      "comments": [" One team had everything to play for, trailing its divisional leader by just one game. The other, well out of the playoff race, was taking part in a meaningless contest. By the way these teams performed, you'd think the Lions were the former, but that was not the case. Detroit absolutely dominated this game, from start to finish. It was better on both sides of the ball, while Jim Caldwell and his staff coached circles around Chip Kelly, who will undoubtedly call his real-estate agent this weekend and ask for available homes in either Southern California or Louisiana. There were reports heading into this contest that Kelly lost the locker room, and the Eagles certainly played as if that were the case. They looked completely lost on defense, blowing tons of coverages and missing countless tackles. The defensive scheme was horrible as well. Coordinator Billy Davis had his cornerbacks play well off the Detroit receivers, and he also made the mistake of having rookie Eric Rowe, who was on the field in place of an injured Nolan Carroll, cover Calvin Johnson one-on-one with no safety help. Rowe, consequently, was beaten like a drum, yet Davis made no adjustments. Kelly's offense, meanwhile, continued to be a mess. His decision to bring back Mark Sanchez this past offseason was a head-scratcher at the time, especially when he traded for the injury-prone Sam Bradford. It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. Jeremy Maclin, LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, two touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and one of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was Jordan Matthews, who caught three passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came very late in garbage time. Matthews dropped a pass in the third quarter, but that was a result of a brutal, but legal hit.    Excluding Matthews and someone named Trey Burton (2-49), no other Eagle had more than 21 receiving yards. Cooper (2-16) was barely a factor, while disappointing rookie Nelson Agholor (2-15) was flagged at one point for taking off his helmet following a first-down conversion.    It wasn't surprising to see DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. Matthew Stafford then threw behind Calvin Johnson, and that was followed by an Ameer Abdullah drop. It appeared as though this was going to be yet another long Thanksgiving afternoon for the Lions, but the team completely turned things around after that. In fact, Stafford led six consecutive scoring drives that featured five touchdowns and a field goal. Stafford was on fire, putting together one of the best games of his career. He went 27-of-38 for 337 yards and five touchdowns despite seeing his targets drop four passes. Stafford was battling a defense that didn't seem to have any sort of sensible game plan, but he was still amazing.    I still can't believe that the Eagles allowed a second-round rookie to cover Johnson without safety help. Megatron responded with eight catches for 93 yards and three touchdowns. He also should've drawn pass interference in the end zone on one occasion, but the flag wasn't thrown for some reason.    Stafford's other two touchdowns went to Golden Tate (7-50) and Theo Riddick (5-62). The latter was constantly open in the middle of the field, as it seemed as though Philadelphia had no idea that he could catch passes. Tate, meanwhile, dropped a pass, but was terrific otherwise.    No Detroit runner posted great numbers, but the Lions ran the ball very well, ripping off at least four yards on most of their carries, which constantly set up Stafford in second-and-short situations. Abdullah, who dropped a ball, managed to gain 63 yards on 16 carries. Joique Bell (7-25) bulldozed into the end zone on one occasion. He also dropped one pass. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
