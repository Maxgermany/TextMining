      "comments": [" This game is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Yes, I know the Jaguars could be tied for first in the AFC South depending on what happens Sunday, but it doesn't matter. There's no way Jacksonville is ever going to make any sort of noise in the playoffs, so let me say this: Games like this make handicapping the NFL very frustrating. Especially during a year like I'm having. It's incredibly discouraging to see your three-point dog have a lead with four minutes remaining and then lose the cover at the very end because of a punt return and some idiot named Supernaw fumbling the ball while diving for the first-down marker. The Titans, as underdogs, had more net yardage and first downs than the Jaguars, yet failed to come within the number because of two fluke plays. If this weren't my full-time job, a game like this would make me think about quitting. It really would.    In case you're a Jacksonville fan and are wondering why your team can't do anything significant, part of the reason is that your offensive line is horrible. Blake Bortles was constantly under pressure all evening. He did a good job of escaping tacklers in the backfield, but was still sacked four times. Bortles was able to complete 21-of-30 passes for 242 yards, one touchdown and an interception when a linebacker jumped in front of his target in the red zone. Bortles also missed Marcedes Lewis for a potential score and lost a fumble just over midfield on a sneak. His numbers weren't bad, but keep in mind that he was battling one of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Some of the Tennessee defensive backs looked completely lost in coverage. It was embarrassing. I have the Titans taking a corner in the first round of my .    NFL Network referred to Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns as the Allen Brothers. Only one of the siblings played well. Robinson caught five balls for 113 yards, including an impressive, leaping reception in between two defenders in the fourth quarter. Hurns, on the other hand, logged three receptions for 19 yards. I have to wonder if his injury hindered him at all in this contest.    Julius Thomas caught Bortles' sole touchdown. He saw more targets than anyone on Jacksonville (8). He snared five of them for 28 yards. His score came immediately following Rashad Greene's punt return down to the 5-yard line.    T.J. Yeldon looked good at times, gaining 54 yards on 14 carries. However, I don't know where he was on a series at the goal line that saw Denard Robinson (7-27) receive three consecutive carries. Robinson predictably failed to reach the end zone. Jacksonville was guilty of this in London when Toby Gerhart couldn't reach the goal line on consecutive tries. I don't know why Jacksonville isn't giving the ball to Yeldon at the most crucial times.    As for the Titans, their offensive line might have been more disappointing than Jacksonville's front. Tennessee gave up four sacks as well, but it seemed as though Marcus Mariota was under more duress. Perhaps the worst moment for the blockers occurred just prior to the 2-minute warning at the end of regulation. The linemen took their time getting to the line of scrimmage as Mariota tried to get one more play off. They showed absolutely no sense of urgency, and as a consequence, Tennessee was flagged for a procedural penalty. The lack of effort was alarming. Mariota went 22-of-35 for 231 yards to go along with 29 rushing yards and a touchdown on five scrambles. He missed some throws, which was discouraging. He threw behind Dorial Green-Beckham in the red zone and couldn't hit an open Delanie Walker downfield. I also think he should have ran more. His best trait are his legs. He's holding himself back by not utilizing them enough.    I thought Tennessee's offensive game plan sucked. The team ran the ball way too much on first down, resulting in predictable play-calling. Tennessee didn't get anything on the ground from its backs, save for two long carries, so Mariota was constantly in second-and-long situations, which was a tough task behind a weak offensive line. Antonio Andrews gained 78 yards on 15 carries, but most of that came on a 26-yard burst.    Walker had a big game. He had more than double the receiving yardage compared to any other Titan, catching eight balls for 109 yards. Green-Beckham (3-40) was next. In fact, no Titan receiver caught a pass in the second half until the final drive. It's safe to say that Kendall Wright was missed.    A quick word on Phil Simms: He was awful once again. He did that we talked about this thing repeatedly, but I thought he was at his worst when Jim Nantz pointed out the pool and the golf course at the stadium. The exchange went something like this: <b> Jim Nantz: <\/b> You never thought you'd see a pool or a lifeguard at a stadium, did you? <b> Phil Simms: <\/b> Yeah, we talked about it, Jim. They're trying to get fans to the stadium. But there's only one real way to do that... ... ... ... <i> Me (thinking during his 10-second pause): Please don't say the generic win football games. Please don't do it. If you have any respect for yourself, please don't say it. <\/i> ... ... ... <b> Phil Simms: <\/b> You gotta win football games, Jim! <i> Me (Thinking): F*** you, Phil Simms! F*** you! <\/i> <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
