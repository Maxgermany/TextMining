      "comments": [" For a while, it appeared as though Teddy Bridgewater was going to make a statement to silence his detractors. The narrative for Bridgewater thus far has been that he hasn't been able to step up against superior opponents. He fell flat on his face against the Packers and Seahawks, both of which occurred at home. The Cardinals were favored by 10 points in this contest, so many thought that Bridgewater would struggle again, but he stepped up and played well - until costing his team with a horrible mistake at the very end. Bridgewater opened the game completing 10 of his first 11 passes. He was on fire, constantly beating Arizona's ineffective blitz. The Cardinals didn't make any sort of adjustments despite this. They kept sending tons of pass-rushers, only to have Bridgewater find the open receiver almost every single time. It was truly remarkable that Bridgewater performed so well against a perceived strong defense, and it was equally astonishing that Arizona didn't change its strategy at all. Bridgewater finished 25-of-36 for 335 yards and a touchdown. He managed to come back from being down 20-10, and then he moved his team into field-goal range at the very end of regulation to perhaps tie the contest and send it into overime. With a third-and-10 on the Arizona 31-yard line, however, Bridgewater held on to the ball for an eternity, allowing Dwight Freeney to hit him and force a strip-sack. The Cardinals pounced on the loose ball, ending the game. Save for that instance, Bridgewater was great. However, the final play was both costly and stupid. He should've known to get rid of the ball. The coaching staff can also be blamed for putting him in that position. Considering that Blair Walsh drilled a 54-yard kick earlier in the contest, settling for a 48-yarder would've been the right move. There just wasn't enough time for the Vikings to score a touchdown in regulation, so moving 5-10 yards closer just wasn't worth the risk.    Bridgewater's fumble wasn't the only mistake the Vikings made. Jarius Wright lost a fumble in the red zone during the second quarter. Adrian Peterson then lost a fumble on a trick play in the third quarter, leading to an Arizona touchdown. Later, Xavier Rhodes dropped a potential pick-six. Minnesota could've easily won this game, but shot itself in the foot too many times.    Speaking of Peterson, the numbers show that he managed just 69 yards and a touchdown (the 100th of his career) on 23 carries. He was much better than the stats indicate, however. Peterson ran with explosion and moved the pile against one of the best ground defenses in the NFL. Peterson also did a great job of picking up the blitz.    Minnesota's leader in receiving yardage was Kyle Rudolph, who racked up six catches for 67 yards. Mike Wallace (3-42) caught a game-tying touchdown in the fourth quarter. Stefon Diggs (2-12) did nothing because he couldn't get open against Patrick Peterson.    As for the Cardinals, they prevailed to clinch playoff berth, but they didn't look overly motivated in this contest. In fact, they were very lethargic at times. They seemed to play with no energy, sleepwalking through this game. As mentioned, they were lucky to get away with a victory because the Vikings killed themselves with some bad errors. Carson Palmer went 25-of-35 for 310 yards and two touchdowns. He should've had a third score, but David Johnson dropped the ball on the team's opening drive. As a positive, Palmer passed Kurt Warner for most passing touchdowns in a single season (31) for the Cardinals.    Johnson dropped a touchdown, but he played well otherwise; he gained 92 yards on 19 carries. The absence of Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington hasn't mattered too much because Johnson has played well, but there's no depth at the position. Kerwynn Williams and Stepfan Taylor spelled Johnson at times, and both looked completely overmatched. A horrible run by Williams single-handedly killed a drive in the opening half, while a helpless Taylor was stuffed at the goal line in the third quarter.    Palmer's touchdowns went to Michael Floyd (5-102) and John Brown (4-78), who broke free because of blown assignments against a secondary missing star safety Harrison Smith. Larry Fitzgerald (5-41) was a huge disappointment from a fantasy perspective. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
