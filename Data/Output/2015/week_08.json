      "comments": [" The Dolphins came into this game playing with great momentum and spirit, but they have to feel absolutely crushed right now. Not only were they completely dismantled in a humiliating blowout; they also lost two key members of their team. It started in the first quarter when right tackle JaWuan James went down with a toe injury. It was a significant loss, as the Dolphins had issues pass protecting after that. Ryan Tannehill took five sacks, which was a season-high total for him - which is saying a lot because he didn't have Branden Albert shielding his blind side prior to the bye. In the third quarter, Cameron Wake was down on the field for a while, and it was determined that he sustained an Achilles injury. Wake could be done for the season, which is huge, considering that he's one of the NFL's top pass-rushers. With Wake gone for the year, the Dolphins' chances of securing the second wild-card spot are very slim.    The Patriots, meanwhile, have moved on to 7-0. Aside from the opening drive, they had trouble moving the chains in the first half. The Dolphins did a great job of putting pressure on Tom Brady, and it seemed like New England was in third-and-longs on every other set of downs. Once Wake went out, however, Brady suddenly had more time, and the Patriots became unstoppable on offense against a deflated team. Brady went 26-of-38 for 356 yards and four touchdowns. He once again played extremely well - not at all like a rotting corpse - but the pass protection continues to be a problem, especially in the wake of guard Tre' Jackson going down with an injury. In a year in which pass protection is so prevalent, this is going to be a problem against better teams that can actually keep up with New England on the scoreboard.    Two of Brady's touchdowns went to Julian Edelman (7-81), while the other two were thrown to Rob Gronkowski (6-113) and Dion Lewis (6-93). All three saw nine targets. Gronkowski's score was a 47-yarder in which safety Reshad Jones whiffed on a tackle. This occurred after Lewis, who had five carries for 19 rushing yards, converted a third-and-14 on a screen. That was basically New England's offense in the opening half before the final minute.    LeGarrette Blount pummeled the Miami front, which was surprising. Blount gained 72 yards on 17 carries despite the fact that the Dolphins had surrendered just 3.1 yards per attempt since the bye. Both Blount and Lewis were effective tonight, which bodes well from a fantasy perspective if you own one of them.    As for the Dolphins' offense, they looked horribly inept until they put some garbage yardage together in the second half. They had fewer than 100 net yards prior to intermission and failed to cross midfield until the third quarter. Tannehill went 28-of-44 for 300 yards and two interceptions. Again, Tannehill's 300 yards are a mirage, as he had just 85 at halftime. He also took a safety when the ball was snapped before he was prepared. Tannehill's first pick was a telegraphed throw in which the defensive back ran the route for Rishard Matthews. The second was a miscommunication. This type of performance has to make the Dolphins question whether Tannehill should be their quarterback of the future. Unfortunately for them, they gave him a big contract recently.    Tannehill's leading receiver was once again Jarvis Landry, who caught six balls for 71 yards. Tannehill targeted Matthews the most, however. Matthews collected seven receptions for 62 yards, but dropped a couple of passes. Besides Lamar Miller, Landry is the only consistent fantasy option on the Dolphins, and this will probably go down as one of his worst performances.    Like they did on Sunday, the Patriots took away the run. Miller mustered just 15 yards on nine carries, though he bailed out his fantasy owners with a touchdown. He also caught five balls for 19 receiving yards. He could've had more yardage in that regard, but was barely tripped up. Meanwhile, Jonas Gray, making his return to New England, dropped a pass. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
