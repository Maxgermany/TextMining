      "comments": [" The task for the Jets was simple, or at least it was on paper. All they'd have to do was defeat the Bills, who recently lost to both the Eagles and Redskins, and struggled to beat the Cowboys, and they'd qualify for the playoffs. New York, off a win versus New England, was effectively considered a lock to win this game, at least in the eyes of the public. The Jets were favored by three and were getting three-quarters of the betting action. However, once again, a team that needed to prevail in Week 17 fell flat on its face. The Jets lost and the Steelers won, so Pittsburgh claimed the No. 6 seed in the AFC. Making matters worse for New York, the team lost at the hands of the head coach it fired the year before.    The Jets made so many mistakes in this game. The receivers dropped some passes early, including a throw to Brandon Marshall that fell through his hands, which would've resulted in a first down. Meanwhile, Ryan Fitzpatrick and the offensive line couldn't handle the blitz at all. Fitzpatrick, seeing tons of pressure, was very inaccurate. It didn't help that fierce winds were blowing around his wobbly passes. Fitzpatrick didn't turn the ball over in the first half, but that changed as the game progressed. The Jets were in position to take the lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but Fitzpatrick forced the issue into the end zone to a covered receiver. A field goal would've given New York a one-point advantage, so the decision-making on Fitzpatrick's part was horrific. Fitzpatrick then threw interceptions on his next two possessions. The first occurred as he was getting hit, while the other came on a desperation heave that sealed the victory for the Bills. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-37 for 181 yards, two touchdowns and the three picks. New York fans that had developed faith in Fitzpatrick had to be shocked by this result, given how well the bearded quarterback had been playing. However, Fitzpatrick was just repeating what he's done in the past; he has always enjoyed some nice stretches but then absolutely killed his team in the clutch. All Jets backers have to do is ask Bills fans about him. One final note on Fitzpatrick: He threw his 30th touchdown of the season in this game, breaking the Jets' single-season record. I'm astonished that New York's previous record, held by Vinny Testaverde, was just 29.    Fitzpatrick's scores went to Marshall (8-126) and Eric Decker (5-50). As mentioned, Marshall dropped a crucial pass.    I mentioned earlier that the Jets committed a number of errors. One such mistake was not feeding Chris Ivory enough. Ivory was given just six carries for some reason, gaining 81 yards in the process. The Jets instead fed the ball more to Stevan Ridley, who had meager numbers (9-29).    There were two major injuries in this game, one on each side. Muhammad Wilkerson had to be helped off the field in the third quarter, and it was later ruled that he sustained a broken leg. The second was to running back Karlos Williams. The rookie runner was off to a great start before getting knocked out with a knee injury. He appeared to be stuffed at the line of scrimmage on one occasion, but made a great spin move to get away from Wilkerson to pick up the first down. He also muscled through a tackle to move the chains on a third-and-3. Williams gained 24 yards and a touchdown on six carries. Supplanting Williams was Mike Gillislee, who was very ineffective. Despite seeing a New York front without Wilkerson for half the game, Gillislee was restricted to 28 yards on 24 carries. He also lost a fumble that set up the Jets with a quick touchdown.    Tyrod Taylor actually led the Bills in rushing with 51 yards on 10 scrambles. He scored on an 18-yard burst that was very impressive. He also made some key third-down conversions amid heavy winds, performing well overall. He went 18-of-28 for 182 yards.    More than half of Taylor's passes were thrown to Sammy Watkins, who caught 11 passes for 136 yards. Darrelle Revis, who had a down year, simply had no chance against him. Revis was also whistled for a penalty on Watkins at one point. Watkins was dominant, and his only blemish on the afternoon was a drop in the first quarter.    Remarkably, only one other Buffalo player had more than three receiving yards. That was Greg Salas (3-41), who also dropped a pass. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
