      "comments": [" It's unknown if Drew Brees and Sean Payton will be in New Orleans next season. If not, it's a bit fitting that the team and city's resurgence began with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown in the home opener in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the last hurrah for the same regime occurred with yet another blocked punt for a touchdown versus Atlanta. Up 7-0, Michael Mauti echoed the memories of Steve Gleason, blocking the ball and falling on it in the end zone. The crowd, which already cheered Gleason, who was in the building to be honored, was ignited even more. Though the Falcons snugged up the margin to one touchdown, the Saints eventually exploded out to a three-score lead to keep their season alive. They now stand at 2-4, so they're not dead - at least not yet. The Falcons, meanwhile, sustained their first loss. It was a mistake-filled night for them, as they constantly killed themselves with turnovers. The blocked punt wasn't even the initial error, as Matt Ryan fumbled a snap on a fourth down of the opening drive. After that, Tevin Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a fourth turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and two touchdowns. The numbers are misleading because of the two lost fumbles and the red-zone miscues, but Ryan didn't have a bad outing. He was betrayed by his supporting cast; he suffered through several drops and was sacked on five occasions, thrice by Cameron Jordan.    The big story prior to the game was whether or not Julio Jones would play. Jones took the field and didn't appear to be limited. He caught six passes for 93 yards. Ryan didn't have enough time in the pocket to find Jones as much as he wanted to. Because of this, Ryan frequently tossed checkdowns to Devonta Freeman, who once again had a great game. He caught eight passes for 56 receiving yards and a touchdown to go along with some fantastic rushing numbers (13 carries, 100 rushing yards, TD). Freeman had a drop late, but it was his only blemish during the evening. Freeman was also helped by Coleman's aforementioned lost fumble. Not that Freeman was going to lose his job to Coleman, or anything, but Coleman (4-40) didn't have a single touch following intermission.    Jones' fantasy owners had to be upset when they saw that Roddy White scored a touchdown. White, who caught three balls for 23 yards and the score, is still not worth owning; he saw just four targets despite Ryan's 44 attempts. Leonard Hankerson (4-37) was thrown to more, seeing six balls. Hankerson was guilty of a bad drop.    As for the Saints, Brees had a terrific evening, going 30-of-39 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He had just one bad throw when he missed Ben Watson high inside the Atlanta 10-yard line at the end of the first half, but he atoned for it, especially after intermission, helping the team accumulate 211 net yards in the final two quarters.    Speaking of Watson, his ridiculous output came out of nowhere. Watson caught a whopping 10 balls for 127 yards and a touchdown. Yes, Ben Watson! It was amazing, as the Falcons didn't understand how to cover him. The Saints repeatedly beat the Falcons with the same crossing route. It's astonishing that Atlanta didn't know how to adjust to this.    The Saints' other pass-catchers disappointed their fantasy owners, but they didn't play poorly. Willie Snead caught four balls for 55 yards, but was able to convert some key third downs. Brandin Cooks' numbers were even worse (4-41), but he drew so much attention away from Brees' other weapons.    Mark Ingram ran tough, but barely had any room against a strong Atlanta run defense, mustering just 46 yards on 20 carries. However, he scored twice and ripped for an impressive 11-yard burst when the Saints were running out the clock late in the fourth quarter.    C.J. Spiller once again did nothing. This was very predictable, as he's been silent all year except for the game-winning touchdown versus Dallas. He had three carries for 10 yards to go along with four catches for 17 receiving yards. He's not worth a roster spot in non-PPR formats.    A couple of dark clouds over the Saints' victory: Left tackle Andrus Peat was knocked out of the game with a leg injury. Also, kicker Zach Hocker whiffed on two field goals, though one was from beyond 50. He connected on one try, but it was from 31. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
