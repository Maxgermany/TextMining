      "comments": [" Peyton Manning will, of course, be in the Hall of Fame five years after he retires. It's now very fair to wonder if that will be in 2020. Manning looks done, so this could very well be his final year in the NFL. It was almost painful to watch Manning in this game. He had zero zip on his passes, and he resembled a wounded animal that needed to be put out of its misery. In fact, Manning was extremely close to having one of the worst starts of his career. That may sound strange to anyone who didn't watch this game, given that he went 26-of-45 for 256 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, but those numbers are very deceiving. Manning's pick, which was returned for a score, was an inaccurate throw. That would've been fine if that was his only blemish, as the box score indicates, but he was so much worse than that. Manning nearly tossed a pick-six on the ensuing drive on a dead-armed throw. Right after that, he underthrew what seemed like a potential touchdown to Demaryius Thomas. Manning was nearly intercepted twice in the second half, including on one occasion in which two Kansas City players had their hands on the ball. Manning had other awful passes, missing Thomas on one occasion deep downfield and tossing several incomplete dead ducks. On the final drive, he had Jordan Norwood open inside the 5-yard line, but his throw was a bit too high. Manning, however, threw a game-tying touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders. It was a perfect pass - a surprising one, at that, considering how putrid he was all night. It was bittersweet for Manning fans; the score helped win the game, but it was one of Manning's final great passes.    Of course, this all wouldn't have happened if the Chiefs were so careless with the football all afternoon. Jamaal Charles opened the game with a lost fumble inside the Denver 5-yard line. There was also a fumble on a kickoff return. Alex Smith threw two picks, one of which was his fault. The first interception was a telegraphed pass, but the other was tipped into the air. The second was a killer because it occurred in the red zone, nullifying a scoring opportunity. The real killer, however, was Charles' late-game fumble. Following Manning's third touchdown, the Chiefs were content just to run the clock out and go to overtime. However, Charles fumbled, and Bradley Roby scooped up the ball and scored. And just like that, Denver prevailed in a game it definitely did not deserve to win. It's a shame for Charles, as the two cough-ups ruined what was otherwise a brilliant evening; he gained 125 yards and a score on 21 carries.    Why didn't the Broncos deserve to win? Outside of Manning's ineptitude, the team made so many horrible mistakes. They had three penalties on Kansas City's first drive alone. They converted a fourth-and-1 on a later possession, but there was a strange timeout that negated it. Late hits, missed tackles and unsportsmanlike penalties were prevalent throughout the evening. The Broncos were the sloppier team, and yet Kansas City had four more turnovers!    While Manning's struggles were predictable, the surprising aspect of this game was how poorly Denver's running game functioned. Both C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman struggled to find rushing room. Anderson mustered just 27 yards on 12 carries, while Hillman tallied 34 yards on nine attempts. Hillman's YPC figure looks nice, but most of his yardage came on a 16-yard burst. Anderson still remains a weekly play for now, but Denver's blocking is awfully sketchy. Maybe Kansas City's run defense is that good, but I'm beginning to have doubts.    Both of Manning's primary receivers hauled in eight passes, with Sanders securing two of the touchdowns. Sanders (8-87) is worth selling high in fantasy right now, given Manning's struggles. The same can be said for Thomas (8-116).    Manning's third score went to Virgil Green. Owen Daniels (3-19) disappointed once again. He's worth dropping at this point.    I mentioned that Smith tossed two interceptions earlier. He was 16-of-25 for 191 yards otherwise. He struggled immensely on third downs, going 0-of-7 in such situations. This game proved why the Chiefs do have any sort of chance at the Super Bowl with him at quarterback. He's so limited, and you can't even say that he takes care of the football anymore. The Chiefs would benefit from moving on after this year.    It's now a season and two games with Smith throwing a touchdown pass to a receiver. Jeremy Maclin led all wideouts in yardage, but accumulated only 57 yards on four catches. I still like Maclin though, so I don't mind him as a buy-low target.    Travis Kelce wasn't nearly as dominant as he was in the opener, but he logged four receptions for 58 yards. Exactly half of his yardage came on one play; he ran right by David Bruton, who had a poor effort on a tackle. That helped set up a Knile Davis touchdown, and at 24-17, it appeared as though Kansas City would pull through. An improbable Manning score and an inexplicable fumble changed that. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
