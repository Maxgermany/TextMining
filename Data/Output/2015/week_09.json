      "comments": [" The Bengals came into this game as 13-point favorites, so hardly anyone believed that this would be a competitive contest. The Browns, however, appeared as though they might prove everyone wrong. Thanks to a 92-yard touchdown drive led by Johnny Manziel right before halftime, Cleveland drew to within 14-10. That was the team's longest possession since December 2013. Unfortunately for the Browns, they simply couldn't keep up. Their offense had four consecutive three-and-outs following intermission, while the defense had no answer for Andy Dalton and company. The talent mismatch was too apparent; Cleveland played well considering the skill on the roster, but the team was just outclassed.    I almost want to begin my analysis with Manziel, but I'll start with the quarterback who actually has a future in the NFL. Dalton misfired on just six attempts, going 21-of-27 for 234 yards and three touchdowns. He was 14-of-16 in the second half, which is just remarkable. With plenty of talented weapons at his disposal, the Browns and their skeleton-crew secondary simply didn't have a chance. However, something worth noting is that Dalton was under pressure quite a bit in this game. The box score says that the Browns sacked him twice, but in reality, he was brought down four times behind the line of scrimmage. Dalton has been protected extremely well all year, so this was a surprise. Offensive line play this year has been crucial, so it's imperative for the Bengals to shore up this area, which was once considered very strong.    Tyler Eifert had a monstrous evening, so I hope you weren't going against him in fantasy. In fact, he was so dominant that the fans shouted MVP! when he was talking on the NFL Network post-game show. The Browns couldn't cover Eifert at all, as he logged five receptions for 53 yards and a whopping three touchdowns.    Eifert tied two other Bengals for the team lead in targets with six. The other two players were Marvin Jones (5-78) and A.J. Green (4-53). Green's fantasy owners might be disappointed, especially when considering that Dalton just missed him on a downfield bomb in the fourth quarter.    The only prominent Bengal who disappointed was Jeremy Hill. Expected to have a breakout performance against a horrible run defense, Hill picked up just 52 yards on 15 carries. He had some nice runs, but was stuffed at the line of scrimmage far too often. Once again, Giovani Bernard did more with less, gaining 72 yards on 13 tries. Both backs caught one pass.    Moving on to the Browns, Manziel went 15-of-33 for only 168 yards and a touchdown. That's not the whole story, however. Manziel had a very solid first half - 11-of-18, 128 yards, one score - as he escaped the pocket well and did a great job of moving the chains. And I'm saying this as one of the biggest Manziel haters on the planet. The guy is a scumbag, but I'll admit when he's performing well. Manziel, however, self-destructed after intermission. It hurt him that Taylor Gabriel dropped two passes that would've gone for a combined 40 yards, but the Bengals pretty much figured him out and made sure to keep him in the pocket. As a result, Manziel was a horrific 4-of-15 for 40 yards in the second half. He was nearly intercepted a couple of times, including one instance in which Dre Kirkpatrick had an open field in front of him for a pick-six. Manziel is not a good quarterback, though he should ultimately find a home in the CFL. He does some nifty things, but he's just way too limited, both mentally and physically, and that's not even taking his glaring off-the-field issues into account. The Browns need to obtain a franchise quarterback soon, and that's exactly what I have them doing in my .    Manziel was so ineffective for half the game that he slowed down Gary Barnidge, who was limited to just two catches (on seven targets) for 35 yards. In fact, the Browns' leader in receiving yardage was running back Duke Johnson, who caught two balls for 38 yards and a touchdown.    The Browns ran the ball well at times with Isaiah Crowell, though his runs were limited because the Browns were behind throughout. Crowell managed 38 yards on 10 carries. The silver lining is that Mike Pettine didn't give the ball to the horrible Robert Turbin at all.    Randy Starks is worth noting. Starks single-handedly gave the Bengals a touchdown on the opening half. He had a very dumb taunting penalty to get the drive going, and then he lined up way offside on a fourth down in the red zone that Cincinnati failed to convert.    More on Phil Simms: Simms gave the usual bland analysis, but I was frustrated with him early on when he was talking about Starks' taunting penalty. Simms literally spent two minutes explaining what a taunting call was. Even my girlfriend, who barely knows anything about football, heard this and commented, Why is this guy explaining what taunting is? Even I know what a taunting penalty is! <!-- TreatRequestAsMobileOrTables = False -->   "],
