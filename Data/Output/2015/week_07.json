      "comments": [" The Seahawks absolutely had to win this game to stay alive in the NFC West race. At 2-4, they definitely couldn't afford another loss. They managed to get the job done, albeit amid some struggles that will be a concern going forward. The primary issue for Seattle is the team's pass protection. Despite leading throughout - the Seahawks marched down the field on the opening drive for a touchdown - Russell Wilson was sacked five times. The offensive line is an abomination, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. With a huge lead, Wilson shouldn't have been under much pressure, but instead, San Francisco was able to smother him to derail some drives. Some penalties by the linemen ruined a couple of possessions as well. Wilson's decision-making is also disconcerting. On three occasions this evening, Wilson tried to squeeze the ball into double coverage and didn't have any success doing so. The first time came in the red zone toward the end of the first half, when he was picked off. The second was a deep bomb downfield to Jermaine Kearse, which was also intercepted. The third was a dropped pick on a dart to Jimmy Graham. Wilson finished 18-of-24 for 235 yards, one touchdown and the two picks. He also registered 20 rushing yards on seven scrambles. Wilson made plenty of good plays, as he was his usual, elusive self. However, the pair of interceptions - as well as a third pick - would've ended up costing him against a better opponent. It's not like he was trailing and was trying to make things happen. With a lead, Wilson should've been more careful with the football.    The bright spot for the Seahawks was Marshawn Lynch. The 49ers had no answers for him, as he trampled them all night. He gained 122 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries - a very impressive YPC average, especially when considering that he had several failed short-yardage tries on the opening possession. This wasn't a surprise, as Seattle has been bad in short yardage dating back to the Super Bowl. However, Lynch eventually plunged into the end zone to give the Seahawks a lead that they never relinquished.    Seattle's leading receiver was Tyler Lockett, who caught all five targets thrown to him for 79 yards, including a 43-yard bomb for a touchdown. Meanwhile, Graham disappointed, hauling in just two of his five targets for 31 yards. Graham exploded last week, but it appears as though that was a fluke. Wilson has to move around too much, so he doesn't have the time to find his athletic tight end.    As for the 49ers, they had yet another dreadful performance. They kept it close against the Giants and upset the Ravens, but those were two injured/bad teams. The Seahawks were far superior, so the 49ers had no chance with their depleted roster. They are, without a doubt, one of the worst squads in the NFL, and quite frankly, the organization deserves this after running Jim Harbaugh out of town. Getting rid of a top-three NFL coach and replacing him with someone who looks like a pizza delivery guy is not a good idea, as it turns out. Jim Tomsula is utterly clueless, as highlighted by this exchange with Tracy Wolfson right before halftime: Wolfson: Coach, how do you find a rhythm in the second half? Tomsula: We gotta find a rhythm. My girlfriend, who doesn't know much about football, even laughed at this. Tomsula is a man with no answers, and he doesn't have the personnel to even find any.    Colin Kaepernick had a miserable evening. It's hard to completely blame him, as he was sacked six times - including 3.5 times by Michael Bennett - but even when he had time, he'd sail ugly passes out of bounds. He didn't even give the Seahawks a chance to pick off his passes because many of his throws weren't in the field of play. Making matters worse, Kaepernick, for whatever reason, didn't have a single rushing attempt. That's inexcusable, and it's not like he didn't have the chances; he could've easily picked up a first down with his legs on a third-and-2, for example, but didn't even bother trying. Kaepernick finished 13-of-24 for only 124 yards, giving him an awful YPA of 5.2. In the offseason, he told the media that he wanted to be himself going forward, but he just looks like a lost soul. There's literally no excuse for him not scrambling at all. His legs are his best attribute, and refusing to use them is just a recipe for failure.    If there's a silver lining for the 49ers, it's that Vernon Davis finally showed signs of life. Davis caught four passes for 61 yards, leading the team in both categories. Sadly, Anquan Boldin (3-39) and Reggie Bush (3-13) were the only other players with more than one reception. Bush sucked yet again; he dropped a pass on third down during the opening drive and then missed a big hole for a long gain, choosing to go outside for barely any yardage. He is a terrible player the 49ers should not be using right now. It's a complete mystery as to why he's ahead of Jarryd Hayne on the depth chart. Hayne should've been active tonight instead of Bush, but Tomsula is too busy delivering pizzas to realize this.    Another receiver worth mentioning is Torrey Smith, who didn't catch a single pass. He was targeted only once, which was a drop. Smith shouldn't be owned in any 12-team fantasy league.    Carlos Hyde had some solid runs in this contest, but he nearly hurt his team with two fumbles. Hyde was fortunate that his teammates pounced on both loose balls, especially considering that K.J. Wright appeared to fall on it the first time. I still have no clue how he didn't recover.    I called for Phil Simms' firing a couple of weeks ago, and I'm once again going to repeat that he's one of the worst NFL announcers. He's so horrible that I feel like I'm betting against him every Thursday. Simms, at one point, told Jim Nantz he can't afford massages. He was obviously not being serious, as his CBS salary is in the seven-figure range, but it just didn't sound quite right. The comment that sparked this bullet point, however, was when Simms stated that the 49ers, down 17 with 3:15 remaining, should punt on a fourth-and-4. Sure, a comeback wasn't likely at all, but the 49ers could've kept moving the chains and given their quarterback some confidence for next week. There was literally no downside to going for it, yet Simms agreed with the Tomsula brain trust in terms of kicking it away. Simms, who also said that the Seahawks were the defending Super Bowl champions at one point, needs to be fired. He's bland, he offers no ideas, and he's infuriating to listen to. And if I have to hear him say, You know, Jim, one more time, I might just have a seizure. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
