      "comments": [" The Titans dominated for the opening quarter and a half, and as a result, it initially appeared as though there wouldn't be any winners in this game. The Jaguar fans were watching their once-promising quarterback struggle. The Titan fans were seeing their top-two draft selection slip away. All those who bet on Jacksonville witnessed a 4.5-point favorite look completely incompetent. Delanie Walker fantasy owners witnessed Leon Washington vulture an early touchdown. And those tuning into this game for casual purposes had to endure a dreadful matchup. Everything changed, however, right before halftime. With the Titans up 10-0 and outgaining Jacksonville by a wide margin (179-16), the Jaguars were able to put together a solid drive, thanks to some tough running by Toby Gerhart. They eventually found their way into the end zone and were able to accomplish the same thing in the third quarter. They established a four-point lead and never looked back.    Bortles had a very mixed game. He was dreadful in the early going, as he was just 9-of-15 for only 52 yards and a touchdown in the first half. He checked it down on an early third-and-7 without even bothering to look downfield. He was then strip-sacked, but was fortunate to have his teammate recover. He also missed some routine throws, but was able to get into a rhythm. Bortles finished 13-of-26 for 115 yards and a touchdown. He still had some poor throws following intermission, including an awful misfire toward Cecil Shorts in the red zone, but he picked up some big gains on the ground, including a first-down scamper on third-and-long. Bortles compiled 50 rushing yards on five scrambles.    Gerhart missed some time in this game with a rib contusion, which is why he had just 12 carries. He ran well after getting stuffed early, finishing with 53 yards and a touchdown. He was outgained by Jordan Todman (5-71, TD), though almost all of that came on a 62-yard burst in the fourth quarter that sealed this victory by Jacksonville.    Only one Jaguar had more than 26 receiving yards. Marqise Lee (4-65) was that player. Marcedes Lewis hauled in Bortles' sole touchdown, though he had just two catches for six yards.    The player who gained the most in this victory was Sen'Derrick Marks. The star Jacksonville defensive tackle needed half a sack to trigger a $600,000 bonus. He managed to sack Charlie Whitehurst on the final play of the game. Not only did he claim more than half-a-million bucks against his former team; he stopped a Tennessee drive right in its tracks to give Jacksnville its third victory of the season.    As for the Titans, I'm surprised by how well Whitehurst played. It appeared as though he was going to ruin Tennessee's chances of landing either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as he opened the game with a 6-of-6, 71-yard, touchdown-drive. Whitehurst continued to shred Jacksonville's secondary throughout the evening, finishing 24-of-35 for 287 yards and the score to Washington, but he couldn't get his team into the end zone again. Simple mistakes disrupted drives all evening, though Whitehurst was responsible for throwing short on a crucial fourth down in the middle of the final quarter. His receiver had to come back from the ball and was consequently tackled short of the marker.    Washington who was playing in his home town, was second on the team in receiving, as he caught all seven of his targets for 62 yards and the touchdown. Kendall Wright (4-73) paced the team in receiving yardage, but got banged up on a 39-yard reception in the fourth quarter. Walker (4-54) disappointed his fantasy owners.    Shonn Greene dominated the carries last week, but he took a back seat to Bishop Sankey again, The rookie runner had some nice gains, but managed only 44 yards on 14 carries. Greene (7-28) had a better average. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
