      "comments": [" Jim Nantz called this one of the biggest victories for the Browns in years. He's absolutely right. Cleveland had some nice wins versus the Saints and Steelers this season, but both of those came at home. No one was really going to believe in the Browns until they beat a highly regarded team on the road, especially on a national stage. They did just that in dominant fashion, slaughtering their in-state rival by three touchdowns. In doing so, they snapped a 17-game road division losing streak. This game was not nearly as close as the score indicates. The Browns outgained the Bengals, 368-165. They limited Cincinnati to just 2.6 yards per play. The pass rush got to Andy Dalton, while the secondary was fantastic. Joe Haden completely shut down A.J. Green, limiting the All-Pro wideout to three catches for 23 yards. The offense, meanwhile, was highly efficient. Brian Hoyer's numbers weren't great - 15-of-23, 198 yards - but he played with confidence and made accurate strikes despite missing his top two targets (Jordan Cameron, Andrew Hawkins). Hoyer was guilty of a couple of errors - he overthrew an open Travis Benjamin downfield and had a possible interception dropped on a high pass over the middle of the field - but he played well otherwise.    The Browns also ran effectively. As projected, Terrance West handled most of the workload, gaining 94 yards on 26 carries. Things really opened up for him when Geno Atkins was knocked out of the game with a troubled knee. Meanwhile, Isaiah Crowell (12-41) and Ben Tate (10-34) made West's fantasy owners frustrated early on when they each vultured touchdowns away, but West found the end zone later on when he converted on a 1-yard plunge. West fumbled, but he had crossed the goal line prior to coughing up the football.    No one Cleveland receiver stood out. Miles Austin led the group with five grabs for 48 yards, while Gary Barnidge (2-46), Benjamin (3-46) and Taylor Gabriel (3-31) all contributed. Things will only get better for the Browns, as Hawkins will be back next week, and Josh Gordon will return in Week 12.    The Bengals, meanwhile, did not look like they were prepared to play. Every single NFL Network analyst picked them to win by double digits, so perhaps Cincinnati took this game for granted. The Bengals made so many mistakes all evening, such as an early timeout, a personal foul because of a Greg Little head butt, a flag for 12 men in the huddle, an offsides at the goal line, a Jeremy Hill fumble and countless drops. Having said that, Andy Dalton was the main culprit. He had one of the most dreadful performances of any quarterback in recent memory. Most of his passes were high and/or wide of the mark. He also made mental mistakes, including one instance where he threw the ball despite being close to five yards past the line of scrimmage. Dalton went 10-of-33 for 86 yards and three picks, ultimately getting pulled in favor of Jason Campbell with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Dalton opened the contest with an interception on the first drive when he didn't see a Cleveland linebacker. The second pick wasn't his fault, as Jermaine Gresham ran a bad route. However, Dalton had some interceptions dropped, and then he heaved his third on an overthrow, which Buster Skrine wrestled away from the intended target. As mentioned, the Bengals were guilty of many drops, so while Dalton was dreadful, this performance wasn't entirely his fault. Green, who was limited by Haden, let several balls fall through his hand.    I noted that Hill lost a fumble. He had some nice runs otherwise, tallying 55 yards on 12 carries. The Bengals made a huge mistake by limiting Hill's attempts. Even though they were behind early, they should have kept feeding the ball to Hill, as the Browns have struggled against the run all year. Then again, Cincinnati's ground attack wasn't going to be as potent as normal, given that mauler Andre Smith was out. Desmond Bryant took advantage of this, sacking Dalton on back-to-back plays.    Gresham led the Bengals with 29 receiving yards off three catches. Mohamed Sanu (2-20), like Green, was a big disappointment. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
