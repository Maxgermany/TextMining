      "comments": [" I don't know what the Cardinals can do to make it happen, but they need to ask the NFL to get the Rams off their schedule. They swept St. Louis, but disaster struck in each of their meetings. Carson Palmer, of course, was knocked out for the year in the first matchup, and Drew Stanton injured his knee in this affair. Arizona improved to 11-3 in the wake of this victory, but losing Stanton is the big news. He went down awkwardly on a hit in the third quarter and was carted into the locker room. If he's out for an extended period of time, it'll be interesting to see if Bruce Arians tells the media that they can go to the Super Bowl with Ryan Lindley or Logan Thomas at quarterback because the former was a train wreck. Lindley went 4-of-10 for 30 yards. He was highly inaccurate with the football and had an interception dropped by Janoris Jenkins when the ball barely scraped the ground. Lindley and the Cardinals escaped this game with a win to preserve the No. 1 seed in the NFC for the time being, but they won't be able to beat competent teams with this type of quarterbacking. It's possible that Arizona won't win another contest this year because Lindley is that bad.    The Cardinals were able to prevail in this contest with tough defense and a strong running game. Kerwynn Williams and Stepfan Taylor were inexplicably effective, rushing for 75 and 61 yards, respectively on a near-equal share of 29 carries. The 136 yards on the ground made absolutely no sense, as the Rams had limited four of their previous five opponents to 66 rushing yards or fewer. Marginal talents like Williams and Taylor shouldn't be gaining nearly five yards per carry, but that's exactly what happened Thursday night.    As good as Arizona's ground attack was, the defense was so much better. The Cardinals made Shaun Hill look completely inept, while offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's predictable offense was an absolute failure. The Rams couldn't keep drives alive, going just 4-of-15 on third down. There were so many instances in which they had just one yard to go, but gave up and punted. That was the story of the game for them, as they moved the ball to the Arizona 1-yard line in the fourth quarter, but had to settle for a field goal. The Rams, otherwise, made mistakes and blew opportunities. They committed their first error in the opening quarter when Tre Mason lost a fumble, setting up the Cardinals with a short field goal. They were flagged for offensive pass interference twice. They dropped two interceptions. They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball. They nearly had some picks themselves, but the Cardinals couldn't convert either. Shaun Hill, meanwhile, was an abomination. He went 20-of-39 for 229 yards and an interception on the final play of the game. That pick wasn't his fault, but as mentioned, he could've had several others. He had so many inaccurate passes, including at the very end, when he overthrew Stedman Bailey for a first down, and he went on a streak in which he completed just five of 14 attempts. St. Louis had five consecutive three-and-outs in the second half.    Tre Mason was a huge disappointment. He wasn't expected to have a strong outing against the Cardinals' ferocious run defense, but he had just two quality runs, gaining 33 yards on 13 carries. The fumble hurt, as it gave Arizona three points and ultimately forced the Rams to kick a field goal on the 1-yard line; they could've gone for it to take a 10-9 advantage, otherwise.    Another player who really struggled was Jared Cook. The Cardinals had been poor against tight ends all year, yet he managed just three catches (eight targets) for 22 yards. He had two receptions wiped out by offensive pass interference, but he failed to reel in a decent catch late in the game because he was able to get just one foot inbounds.    The Rams' leading receiver was Bailey, who logged five catches for 74 yards. Kenny Britt (5-65) wasn't too far behind him.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, made errors themselves. They had three penalties on their first two drives that forced punts. Stanton threw behind an open John Brown on a third down. He did the same thing later on a pass headed for Kerwynn Williams. And, as mentioned, Arizona nearly had three turnovers, but the Rams couldn't capitalize.    Stanton had a mixed game. He missed some open receivers, but he connected on a pretty, 49-yard rainbow to Michael Floyd (2-55), who later drew a 36-yard pass interference flag on Janoris Jenkins. Stanton also made a nifty move where he avoided a couple of sacks and found Larry Fitzgerald for a first down. Stanton (12-of-20, 109 yards) helped Fitzgerald snag the 900th reception of his NFL career. Fitzgerald hauled in seven balls for 30 yards. He had a 27-yard reception wiped out by a holding penalty. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
