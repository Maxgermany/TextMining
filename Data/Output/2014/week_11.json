      "comments": [" In a game that meant so much in a very crowded race for the two AFC wild card spots, it's a shame that someone not associated with either team decided this game. That individual was Walt Coleman, who awarded the Dolphins with nine free points with two atrocious calls. It was a tight, 10-9 affair in the third quarter when Kyle Orton was whistled for an intentional grounding penalty that was ruled a safety because Orton was in the end zone when he threw the ball. It was a disgusting penalty that was wrong for two reasons. First, Sammy Watkins, the intended target, didn't make his break when Orton released the ball, so the quarterback didn't know where his receiver would be. And second, Watkins ended up being in the area anyway. He was literally 4-5 yards away from where the pass landed. The second horrific penalty came on a play that set up Miami in the red zone because of a long pass interference. Stephon Gilmore made a terrific break-up, but the officials threw the flag. Both CBS announcers, as well as everyone on the post-game show, was completely appalled by the infraction. Gilmore made a completely clean play; he actually couldn't have defended his receiver any better. Shortly afterward, the Dolphins scored their second of two touchdowns on the evening, and even that was controversial, as instant replay showed that the ball was short of the goal line when Jarvis Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was one of the two major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Louis Delmas dropped a pass thrown right to him. Orton went 22-of-39 for 193 yards, but was just 10-of-22 for 93 yards following intermission. He was solid early, finding Chris Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front four that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered five sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the fourth quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on six carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only four catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone. Landry converted all five of his targets, but lost a fumble on the free kick following the poor Orton safety call. Fortunately for Landry, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a 47-yard field goal on the ensuing drive, setting up Miami with a short field, which eventually led to Landry's touchdown.    Sammy Watkins, like Wallace, was also missed deep, as Orton overthrew him. Watkins had a horrific fantasy outing, snagging just three of his seven targets for 32 yards. Hogan was the hero for the Bills early on with seven grabs for 74 yards, while Bryce Brown tied Hogan with seven catches for 57 receiving yards, saving those who started him in PPR leagues. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
