      "comments": [" It's amazing how many opportunities the Jets blew in what could have been a victory to turn around their season. They outgained the Patriots by 100 yards (423-323), achieved 12 more first downs (28-16) and held the ball for 40:54 in this contest, but still managed to lose in the final seconds, thanks to a blocked Nick Folk 58-yard field goal. The thing is, it should've never gotten down to that kick. The Jets would have been way ahead if they hadn't made so many costly errors. For instance, a Geno Smith touchdown to Jeremy Kerley on their opening drive was wiped out by holding penalty. Another holding infraction negated a Chris Ivory 9-yard run in the red zone on the ensuing possession, and this was immediately followed by a Jace Amaro drop on what would've set up a manageable third-down situation near the goal line. Amaro, who saw the ball hit him right in the chest, was responsible for Geno Smith's first incompletion. More errors were prevalent throughout the evening. The Jets bobbled a handoff on second-and-1 in the red zone, which ultimately led to one of many field goals in the red zone. Rex Ryan also burned two timeouts in the third quarter. He needed those stoppages at the end of the game, as he was forced to try an onside kick. The Jets consequently had to march down from inside their own 20. Smith did a good job of at least putting the team into the edge of field-goal range, but the attempt was blocked.    Smith had a great outing. He made some mistakes, as he held on to the ball too long on a few occasions, and he sailed a pass over Amaro's head during a two-point try that would've tied the game, but he was mostly sharp. He went 20-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he should've had a second score, but it was wiped out by a hold. Smith also scrambled seven times for 37 rushing yards, as he had a pair of a clutch runs to move the chains. Smith, who has been much better this season when he's been able to target an Eric Decker, was not afraid to throw Darrelle Revis' way. Decker, as a consequence, secured four of his seven targets for a team-high 65 yards. Jeff Cumberland (3-50) snagged Smith's sole touchdown, though he saw fewer targets than Amaro (3-22), who absolutely killed his team with that aforementioned drop.    Though Smith played well, the Jets' season is over. The team is now 1-6, and it lost both of its Super Bowls against the Broncos and Patriots. They'll be flat next week and will likely drop to 1-7. Ryan will be seen as a lame-duck coach, and thanks to the bad-character guys in the locker room like Chris Johnson and the backup quarterback, the team will quit. They will be a great fade to close out the season.    As for the Patriots, it has to be very discouraging that they couldn't stop the run and consequently get off the field. Chris Ivory pummeled his way for 107 rushing yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Even Johnson ran well, gaining 61 yards on 13 attempts. New England won't have any sort of chance to win the Super Bowl if this area of its defense doesn't improve. Unfortunately for them, Jerod Mayo is not returning anytime soon, so odds are that the Patriots will continue to struggle to contain ground attacks. Tom Brady will have to carry the team, and it'll be difficult for him to do so considering his lacking supporting cast. His only productive teammates in this game were Rob Gronkowski (5-68) and Shane Vereen, who led the team with 71 receiving yards (off five catches), scoring twice aerially as a result. Vereen also led the team in rushing (11-43). Meanwhile, Julian Edelman (4-44) nearly cost New England a victory with a pair of drops in the second half. Brandon LaFell (4-55) continued to be mediocre. Brady went 20-of-37 for 261 yards and three touchdowns, but his completion percentage should've been much higher. As mentioned, two of his scores went to Vereen - one was a 49-yard bomb on the opening drive, thanks to a blown coverage - while the third was thrown to Danny Amendola (1-19). Brady once again saw a ton of pressure in his face, and he even had some Eli Manning-type throws in which he released the ball while twisting around and falling to the ground. Most of them were conversions, so that's not a criticism of any sort. It's more of a warning that the offensive line must improve because Brady will be battling secondaries that can actually cover in the future.    As discussed, Vereen handled most of the workload in Stevan Ridley's absence. Brandon Bolden was expected to take on the early-down carries, but Jonas Gray (3-12) was used to give Vereen a breather instead. Gray was trending on Twitter prior to kickoff, but he was never a realistic fantasy option. He's worth picking up if you're desperate and have a spot available, but I wouldn't have very high hopes for him considering Bill Belichick's unpredictability regarding the running back position.    Here's a cool note: Chris Jones, who blocked Folk's field goal to win the game, was the player responsible for a strange penalty that allowed the Jets to pull through in a matchup last year. It's great that he was able to redeem himself like that. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
