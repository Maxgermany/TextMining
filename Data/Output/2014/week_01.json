      "comments": [" It's been seven months since the Super Bowl, yet it doesn't appear as though the Seahawks have skipped a beat. Some special-teams gaffes aside, they looked as dominant as ever, and based on the way they played, it shouldn't surprise anyone if they became the first repeat champions since the Patriots in 2003-04. What's scary is that the Seahawks might be even better in 2014 because they'll actually have Percy Harvin making big plays on offense. Harvin was dominant in this contest, catching a team-high seven passes (no one else had more than three) for 59 yards and also rushing for 41 yards on four carries. Seattle used Harvin in every way imaginable, so this team could be frightening if the former Viking lasts all 16 games.    Russell Wilson's numbers don't show it, but he was at the top of his game as well. Wilson went 19-of-28 for 191 yards and two touchdowns. He also scrambled seven times for 29 rushing yards (includes three minus-1 kneeldowns). Wilson had a pick dropped off a tip, and he had a couple of passes batted down at the line of scrimmage, but he controlled this game for the most part. The play that stood out most was when he used a read-option fake with Marshawn Lynch to hook up with Ricardo Lockette for a 33-yard score. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was beaten on the play. Lockette (2-38) and fullback Derrick Coleman (1-15) were the two Seattle players who caught Wilson's touchdowns. Zach Miller led everyone but Harvin with three grabs for 42 yards. His highlight was an excellent diving catch that made everyone realize he was still in the league.    Marshawn Lynch looked awesome against the Packers. It was if he had didn't have any offseason issues at all. He nimbly eluded tacklers all evening, rushing for 110 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries. Forum member Body Burner, who was over watching the game, asked me if I regretted listing Lynch as a . I don't. I never doubted Lynch's talent; my issue with him is that the workload he's shouldered over the past few years will cause him to miss some time this year.    Some Seattle defenders worth mentioning: Richard Sherman wasn't thrown to at all, causing Jarrett Boykin to come away with zero receptions. Earl Thomas needs to stop playing special teams. A muffed punt of his led to a Green Bay touchdown. Michael Bennett, meanwhile, had a strip-sack of Aaron Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with one touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took three sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to Randall Cobb (6-58), but Jordy Nelson was the primary target. Seeing Byron Maxwell for most of the night, Nelson snagged nine balls for 83 yards. Jarrett Boykin, meanwhile, was completely blanked because he was matched up against Sherman all evening.    Eddie Lacy rushed for 34 yards on 12 carries before leaving the game with a concussion. This is a great time to buy low on Lacy; he didn't run poorly at Seattle, as he simply had no holes versus a ferocious run defense. The Packers couldn't do anything against Seattle's defense, so Lacy will definitely bounce back soon, and he'll have 10 days to get cleared from his concussion.
