      "comments": [" The Lions entered this game in an offensive funk. They scored a combined 15 points in their previous two games, so returning home for a battle against one of the worst defenses in the NFL was just what the doctor ordered. Things were bleak at first. Detroit was down 14-3 in the first quarter, thanks to a Jared Allen strip-sack that he also recovered after beating beleaguered guard Rob Sims. The Lions' offensive line struggles were prevalent, as they were missing left tackle Riley Reiff, who suffered an injury in last week's loss at New England. However, Detroit was able to snap out of it, and after going 25 consecutive drives without scoring a touchdown, they found the end zone on three straight possessions.    Matthew Stafford had a fantastic outing. He rebounded from that lost fumble - which the Bears turned into a touchdown - and misfired on only 11 of his attempts. He finished 34-of-45 for 390 yards and two scores. He endured a couple of drops; otherwise, his numbers would have been much better. Both of Stafford's touchdowns went to Calvin Johnson, who was not battling a top-notch cornerback for the first time since his return from injury. He was going against rookie corner Kyle Fuller, who had been playing well prior to getting banged up a few weeks ago. Fuller was questionable heading into this contest, and he just didn't look like he was 100 percent. Megatron consequently was able to catch 11 balls for 146 yards and the two scores. It didn't help the Bears that they lost safety Chris Conte to an eye injury, but they wouldn't have been able to cover him anyway.    Elsewhere, only three Lions registered more than two receptions: Golden Tate (8-89), Theo Riddick (6-54), who was playing for the injured Reggie Bush, and Eric Ebron (3-23), who was guilty of a drop.    With Bush out, Joique Bell got all of the carries. He gained 91 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries. One of his scores was a plunge from the 1-yard line in which he leapt over the pile.    The Bears, conversely, didn't have any chance to run the ball. They didn't even bother trying to establish any sort of ground attack, as Matt Forte had just five carries for six yards. Forte was stuffed on a third-and-1 try in his own territory in the first half. He at least made up for it by helping out his PPR owners with six catches for 52 receiving yards.    Chicago compensated for the lacking running game by throwing lots of screens. This tripped up the Lions early on, but they eventually figured things out. The Bears struggled to sustain drives after that for the most part, and penalties and sacks disrupted their possessions.    Cutler went 31-of-48 for only 280 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions that occurred late out of desperation. Both of his scores, which came early, were thrown to Alshon Jeffery (9-71).    Chicago's leading receiver was Martellus Bennett, who hauled in eight balls for 109 yards. Brandon Marshall, meanwhile, was highly inefficient; he caught only six of his 11 targets for 42 yards. He dropped a couple of balls. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
