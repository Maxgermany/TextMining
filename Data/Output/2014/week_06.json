      "comments": [" The Texans did not look prepared to play this game early on. They committed plenty of blunders. DeAndre Hopkins dropped a pass on a third down that would've moved the chains. The special-teams unit was completely unprepared for an onside kick against the only team in the NFL that has been successful in that regard this season. Cornerback Kareem Jackson looked like he was trying to avoid contact with T.Y. Hilton on a long pass. Hilton got up, seemingly untouched, and tumbled into the end zone. Replay eventually ruled that Jackson barely brushed Hilton, but it didn't really matter because Trent Richardson scored on the next play. The Colts were eventually up 24-0, and by the end of the first quarter, they had outgained Houston, 218-2. The Texans were averaging just 0.2 yards per play and looked so incredibly pathetic. And then, something happened. The light switch flipped on, and Houston suddenly began playing well, as it seemingly got a spark when the Colts had an illegal formation on a field goal attempt that ultimately led to a Texan touchdown. Arian Foster picked up big chunks on the ground, Ryan Fitzpatrick actually completed some passes, while J.J. Watt dominated the line of scrimmage on the other side of the ball. Watt was an animal, finishing with seven tackles, two sacks, several passes batted down and a fumble recovery for a touchdown that finally put the game in reach for the Texans. Watt, who is the first player in the NFL since 1961 to have a receiving touchdown, a pick-six and a fumble returned for a score in the same season - and it's only Week 6 - cut the deficit to five. Houston had two possessions after that to potentially come away with a victory, but simply couldn't make it happen. Andre Johnson screwed up the first time, getting called for offensive pass interference and then losing a fumble. The second drive ended quickly, as former first-rounder Bjoern Werner strip-sacked Fitzpatrick. The Colts recovered, clinching a victory.    Both Andrew Luck and Watt didn't disappoint in their latest of many epic battles to come. Watt, as mentioned, was awesome, but Luck was a bit better. The former No. 1 pick generated 300-plus yards for the fourth-straight contest, going 25-of-44 for 370 yards, three touchdowns and an interception that was tipped by Jared Crick. Luck's performance was exemplary, especially considering that he was dealing with two backup guards and a center making his second career start. The center screwed up on one play, snapping the ball before Luck was ready. This was when Watt scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown. Luck targeted T.Y. Hilton early and often. The speedy wideout hauled in all nine of the passes thrown his way for a whopping 223 yards and a touchdown. His yardage total was just one shy of Hall of Famer Raymond Berry's single-game record for the Colts. Dwayne Allen (3-49) and Reggie Wayne (4-35) were next on the receiving list.    I'm a bit perplexed about Indianapolis' decision to feature Trent Richardson more than Ahmad Bradshaw once again. Bradshaw garnered more of a workload last week and was once again the superior runner in this contest. However, Richardson was given 17 carries compared to 11 for Bradshaw. Richardson barely outgained Bradshaw, 41-34, but had that aforementioned touchdown. Bradshaw had the best run of the night, a 13-yarder, in which he leapt over Johnathan Joseph and hurdled Brian Cushing to pick up a key first down. He also caught three balls for 25 receiving yards and a touchdown. Richardson, meanwhile, spent too much time dancing around, searching for holes that just weren't going to open up.    Foster, as mentioned, had a huge outing. He started slowly, like all of the other Texans, but he ultimately finished with 109 yards and two touchdowns on just 20 carries. He also caught three balls for 32 receiving yards.    Fitzpatrick also got hot late, and the loss wasn't on him because he would've been in position to win had Johnson not coughed up the ball late in the game. Fitzpatrick misfired on just eight attempts, going 15-of-23 for 212 yards, one touchdown and the lost fumble. He had to deal with lots of pressure in the pocket, as the Colts mustered five sacks and hit him on many other plays. Fitzpatrick's sole score went to Johnson, who had a big game outside of that one fateful drive. Johnson logged seven receptions for 99 yards. Hopkins, meanwhile, never rebounded from that early drop. He managed just one catch for 12 yards on the evening. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
