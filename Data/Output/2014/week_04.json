      "comments": [" The Giants are usually the ones that make mistakes and cost themselves victories, and it appeared initially that would be the case again in this contest when Victor Cruz dropped a pass on third down of the opening drive. However, the Redskins were the ones that capsized, repeatedly making errors all evening. The Giants, as a consequence, improved to .500. New York probably didn't even need Washington's blunders to win this game. Eli Manning struggled during the exhibition and preseason opener, but he has improved since and was razor sharp in this matchup. Out of 23 first-half passes, he had only one incompletion that wasn't dropped compared to three touchdowns. He converted first down after first down, moving the sticks on 7-of-9 on third downs prior to intermission. The Redskins, missing DeAngelo Hall, had no answer for New York's aerial attack, and couldn't get any sort of pass rush going. This was puzzling, as Brian Orakpo, Ryan Kerrigan and Jason Hatcher were battling an offensive line with some glaring holes. Manning finished 28-of-39 for 300 yards, five touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) and an interception. His pick wasn't his fault at all, as Rueben Randle seemed to secure a touchdown, but had the ball knocked out of his hands. It probably would've been ruled a score if the NFL's rules made any sense.    All but one of Manning's aerial touchdowns went to upstart tight end Larry Donnell, who caught seven balls for 54 yards. As my LVH SuperContest partner Matvei put it, What a fantasy season! Jimmy Graham (ADP 1.08) is behind Larry Donall (ADP who the hell is that?)    Manning's top options on the evening were Cruz (6-108) and Randle (8-89), who saw 10 targets each. Both committed errors that would've cost their team in a close game, but the Redskins just weren't competitive.    Rashad Jennings fantasy owners had to be frustrated. Jennings was given just 13 carries for 55 yards, and he flat-out dropped a receiving touchdown. He was then pulled when the game was out of hand, allowing rookie Andre Williams (14-64) to vulture a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Williams was responsible for a drop in the first half.    The Redskins, as mentioned, continuously shot themselves in the foot. It began when Mathias Kiwanuka beat Tyler Polumbus to strip-sack an oblivious Kirk Cousins. A short field set up a Manning touchdown to Donnell. After that, a hold negated a 16-yard reception to Pierre Garcon near midfield. DeSean Jackson followed that up with a drop, and the Giants proceeded to march down the field for another score. With Washington down early, the blunders multiplied. There was holding in the red zone. Logan Paulsen, playing for a concussed Niles Paul, then fumbled deep in New York territory to cost his team at least three points. After that, Cousins began firing countless interceptions. The first occurred because he predetermined where he was going to throw the ball and fired it to a covered receiver. The second was heaved carelessly downfield as he lofted the ball out of the back of the end zone. The third was heaved right at Trumaine McBride, and I just don't know what Cousins was possibly thinking on that play. The fourth was a dying pass because Cousins had pressure in his face and couldn't step up in the pocket. Cousins finished 19-of-33 for 257 yards, one touchdown and the four picks. He was solid at times early on, but by the end of the evening, he looked defeated as he sat on the bench. It appears as though all of his confidence is gone, so it's a good thing that he'll have 10 days of rest to figure things out before the next game. The bad news? Washington has Seattle in Week 5.    As mentioned, Paul was knocked out of the game on a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit over the middle of the field. Paul (3-60) appeared to lose consciousness. He was helped off the field and never returned.    Neither of the primary Washington wideouts did anything. Garcon hauled in two balls for 28 yards, while Jackson reeled in just one pass for nine yards. Jackson had a nice sideline catch taken away from him by a poor officiating ruling. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie completely shut him down otherwise.    The Redskins were down early, so they didn't get a chance to run very much. Alfred Morris was given just 12 carries, but still managed to turn them into 63 yards and a touchdown.    Adding injury to insult, left tackle Trent Williams left the game with a knee injury. He had trouble walking in the locker room.    Phil Simms, the color analyst for this game, refused to say Redskins throughout the telecast. Simms, however, actually said Redskins during last week's broadcast when promoting this contest. Jim Nantz, meanwhile, seemed to mock Simms by saying Redskins as much as possible. It was pretty odd to listen to, though still much better than Brad Nessler's constant errors last year. I'll never forget when Nessler said a punter kicked it into the night sky when the game was inside Minnesota's dome. Simms is extremely bland and can be very annoying at times, but he at least actually pays attention to the game. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
