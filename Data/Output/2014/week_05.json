      "comments": [" It's almost like the Vikings didn't try. When they found out that Teddy Bridgewater would be out and that Christian Ponder would start, they must have been extremely deflated. Phil Simms criticized Minnesota for possibly acting this way in the wake of the Bridgewater news, but I don't blame them for being so flat. The players know what Ponder has - or rather, what he doesn't have - and it was extremely obvious that he had no chance of outscoring Aaron Rodgers in a potential shootout. As a result, the Packers dominated the Vikings. They won by 32, but it could've easily been uglier, as they pulled Rodggers when the score was 42-0. Minnesota didn't even run a play past midfield until there were three minutes remaining in the third quarter. It was so bad that even Jim Nantz laughed at them, chuckling before halftime, Do you think the Vikings are up to doing something tonight? I'm certainly not feeling it. This was such a lopsided contest that Rodgers had to throw just 17 passes. He completed 12 of them for 156 yards and three touchdowns. A couple of drives ended because Rodgers took sacks - he wasn't touched last week, but Minnesota's defense is much better than Chicago's - but the Packer offense was unstoppable otherwise. Had the Vikings been remotely competitive, Rodgers' yardage total could've easily exceeded 300.    Rodgers didn't have to do much because Eddie Lacy had the best performance of his season. After struggling to find any running lanes during the first four weeks of the year, Lacy tallied 105 yards and two touchdowns on just 13 carries. Lacy ran with such power and explosion that Mike McCarthy even laughed and shook his head in disbelief when his running back carried a defender into the end zone on one second-half attempt. If Lacy continues to run this way, the Packers are going to be very difficult to beat.    Rodgers' touchdowns went to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams. Nelson caught a 66-yard bomb in the first quarter, but that was his only reception of the night. Cobb paced the team in targets with four, catching three of them for 34 yards. Adams' score was also his only catch, an 11-yarder. He had an opportunity to reel in another reception, but he slipped in the red zone.    Green Bay's defense was just as excellent as its offense. It made Ponder look terrible. His final numbers - 22-of-44, 222 yards, two interceptions - aren't indicative of how poorly he played. As mentioned, the Vikings didn't run a play past midfield until there were three minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ponder was then able to rack up some garbage yardage to make his stats look respectable. Ponder had major issues with pass protection. The Packers swarmed his backfield and brought him down on six occasions. They also forced some holding penalties. Nick Perry (2 sacks), Mike Daniels (1.5 sacks) and former Viking Letroy Guion (1.5 sacks) led the way for the Packers, while Julius Peppers dropped into coverage and pick-sixed Ponder, who was hit as he released the ball in the second quarter. Ponder was intercepted a second time when he stared down his target on the ensuing drive. He easily could've been picked several more times.    Minnesota's game plan as a whole was puzzling. It was strange that Cordarrelle Patterson wasn't heavily involved at all. He saw just four targets go his way, catching two of them for eight yards. With lots of time off coming up, Minnesota's coaching staff needs to figure out how to get the ball into the hands of its best play-maker.    A week after running circles around the Falcons, both Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon had disappointing performances. Asiata gained 72 yards on 15 carries, but he dropped a couple of passes and lost a fumble in the second quarter. McKinnon, meanwhile, managed just 24 yards on seven attempts, and was largely ineffective, save for a 10-yard burst. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
