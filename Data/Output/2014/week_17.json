      "comments": [" The Chargers had control of their own destiny for the sixth seed in the AFC, so I might as well begin there. All they had to do is beat the Chase Daniel-led Chiefs to reach the playoffs. After winning in Baltimore and San Francisco, prevailing in Kansas City against a backup quarterback seemed easy. A bit too easy, apparently. The Chargers mustered just seven points, as the Chiefs upset San Diego, according to the talking heads on TV, who were oblivious to the fact that Kansas City was a three-point favorite. The Chargers were expected to win because of Philip Rivers, who had a heroic comeback against the 49ers on Saturday night. Rivers, however, couldn't do much because his offensive line let him down. Rivers was swarmed on most of his attempts, as the Chiefs accumulated seven sacks, including four by Justin Houston, who was just one sack short of breaking Michael Strahan's single-season record. Unfortunately for Houston, he didn't have Brett Favre on the other side to take a fraudulent sack. Rivers finished 20-of-34 for 291 yards and two interceptions. Only one pick was his fault, as he foolishly threw into double coverage. The second interception came on a desperation heave on the final play of the game. Rivers' protection really needs to improve this offseason, so an early-round pick should be used on an offensive lineman.    It didn't help Rivers that he was missing his top wideout in Keenan Allen. With Allen out, Eddie Royal (4-95) led the team in receiving. Royal, however, dropped two touchdowns on the same drive in the fourth quarter. The ball barely hit the ground the first time, and the officials ruled it incomplete upon reviewing the play.    Three other Chargers logged more than two receptions: Dontrelle Inman (5-79), Antonio Gates (4-67) and Malcom Floyd (3-29).    Ryan Mathews was also missing. Branden Oliver and Donald Brown shared carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 71-39. Oliver also scored. Brown, meanwhile, was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 try in the final quarter.    As for the Chiefs, they nearly broke their streak of games without a touchdown to a receiver. Dwayne Bowe caught a pass and appeared to cross the goal line, but fumbled. It was ruled that Bowe didn't score, but luckily for the Chiefs, Travis Kelce was right there to recover the ball for the touchdown.    Chase Daniel proved to be a true facsimile of Alex Smith, as he threw short, quick passes to his targets. Daniel was guilty of holding the ball too often on a couple of occasions and took some sacks as a consequence, but he was still able to complete more than half of his passes, finishing 16-of-27 for 157 yards and what should've been a touchdown to Bowe. He began the game 9-of-9 for 72 yards, but couldn't maintain his success, though some of that was because of a couple of drops, including one by Albert Wilson in the red zone.    Kelce turned out to be Daniel's leading receiver, hauling in seven balls for 84 yards. Bowe was next with just three grabs for 30 yards. Wilson was a major disappointment, failing to log a single reception.    Another week, another game in which Jamaal Charles didn't touch the ball enough. Charles had just 13 carries, which he turned into 54 yards. He caught only two passes. I don't understand why Andy Reid wasn't utilizing Charles very much prior to this contest, but there was at least an explanation this week, as Charles hobbled off the field in the first half.    Daniel deserves some credit for this win, but Kansas City's defense was most responsible. Several defenders were awesome, including Houston. Husain Abdullah was also terrific; he broke up a potential touchdown pass thrown toward Antonio Gates in the final quarter and then stuffed Brown on a fourth down. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
