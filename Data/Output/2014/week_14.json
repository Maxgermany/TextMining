      "comments": [" The Cowboys didn't exactly make a statement in their victory over a hapless Chicago team, but the significant item to come out of this win was the fact that barring some anomaly in the time-space continuum - and you never know with Jerry Jones - Dallas will not be going 8-8 or worse this season. Tony Romo, of course, has been criticized over the years for his failures in December and January, but he wasn't even given a chance to choke in this contest. The Cowboys ran what Jim Nantz (via Rex Ryan) called a ground and pound attack, as they ran way more than they passed. By the 3-minute mark of the first half, when Dallas went into a quick offense to score a touchdown prior to intermission, Romo attempted 11 throws compared to DeMarco Murray's 16 carries. Murray had 46 of the 51 yards on the Cowboys' initial touchdown drive, as he converted a pair of fourth-and-short opportunities. Murray was successful on the ground, but he didn't dominate in that regard despite what the final stats may say, as the Bears are surprisingly not inept versus ground attacks. In fact, Murray became the first running back to gain 100-plus rushing yards versus Chicago this season. The Bears had Murray limited to less than a four yards-per-carry average - 22 attempts, 83 rush yards - before this game got out of hand in the third quarter. Murray was able to boost his stats by breaking free for a few big gains late in the evening, which is why he was able to finish with 179 yards and a touchdown. He would've posted even better numbers had he not taken a strange loss of 14 yards in the final quarter.    As for Romo, he misfired on an early, high throw to Jason Witten, but he did a good job of managing the game and converting third downs, misfiring just five times. He finished 21-of-26 for 205 yards and three touchdowns. One of his scores to Cole Beasley shouldn't have stood, as Beasley's knee was down before he hit the pylon. Romo's fantasy owners should consider themselves extremely fortunate that Ed Hochuli inexplicably didn't reverse the call, to the disbelief of Nantz, Phil Simms and Mike Carey.    Only five Cowboys had catches, with Murray leading the way, hauling in nine balls for 49 receiving yards. Dez Bryant (6-82) paced Dallas in receiving yardage, but didn't find the end zone. He was frustrated at one point in the fourth quarter when Dallas ran the ball on a third-and-long near the red zone. Beasley (3-42, 2 TDs) and Gavin Escobar scored Romo's touchdowns.    As for the Bears, the big story coming out of this game was an injury Brandon Marshall sustained in the middle of the second quarter. Barry Church's knee slammed into Marshall's back, and the All-Pro receiver was down on the ground for quite some time. Marshall was taken to the hospital, but tweeted that he's OK. Marshall, who had three catches for 61 yards, one of which was an impressive one-handed grab, was sorely missed, as the Bears' offense sputtered until garbage time. With Alshon Jeffery hobbled with a hamstring injury - he was limping around despite the fact that he caught six balls for 95 yards and a touchdown - Jay Cutler had no one to throw to on most plays besides Martellus Bennett and Matt Forte. Cutler finished 32-of-46 for 341 yards, three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) and a late interception when he underthrew his receiver in the end zone. Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in eight balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
