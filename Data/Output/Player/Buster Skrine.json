   "comment":"Buster Skrine wrestled away from the intended target. As mentioned, the Bengals were guilty of many drops, so while Dalton was dreadful, this performance wasn't entirely his fault. Green, who was limited by Haden, let several balls fall through his hand.    I noted that Hill lost a fumble. He had some nice runs otherwise, tallying 55 yards on 12 carries. The Bengals made a huge mistake by limiting Hill's attempts. Even though they were behind early, they should have kept feeding the ball to Hill, as the Browns have struggled against the run all year. Then again, Cincinnati's ground attack wasn't going to be as potent as normal, given that mauler Andre Smith was out. Skrine wrestled away from the intended target.

   "comment":"Buster Skrine intercepted an overthrow on a screen to Dexter McCluster. Skrine had a return to the Titans' 35-yard line, and once again, New York tacked on a field goal. Chris Ivory took off on runs of 32 and 11 yards on the Jets' next possession. This time, the drive was completed with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Bilal Powell on a checkdown. Late in the second quarter, the Titans weren't set and Fitzpatrick quickly snapped the ball to flip it to Marshall all alone along the sideline. He took off down the field for a 69-yard score. The Jets had a 27-0 lead at the half and the game was over.    Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-36 pass for 263 yards with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Marshall had 6 receptions for 125 yards with 1 score, and Decker totaled 7 catches for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Ivory ran for 101 yards on 22 carries, while Powell had 36 yards on 3 carries and 5 receptions for 46 yards with a score.    Mariota completed 21-of-39 for 274 yards with no touchdowns and 1 interception. Delanie Walker led Tennessee in receiving with 71 yards on 7 receptions. Harry Douglas (3-65) and Dorial Green-Beckham (3-53) contributed, but the biggest play through the air was Mariota's 41-yard touchdown catch.    The Titans had zero running game, as Dexter McCluster led them with a putrid 12 yards on 4 carries.    The engine of the Jets' win was their dominant defensive line overwhelming the Titans at the point of attack. Mariota was getting hit constantly, and Tennessee was completely incapable of running the ball. Muhammed Wilkerson had 3 sacks and 10 tackles. He dominated the Titans. Leonard Williams was gifted his second career sack after defeating a block from running back David Cobb. Demario Davis and Buster Skrine also played well for New York.   Skrine intercepted an overthrow on a screen to Dexter McCluster. Skrine had a return to the Titans' 35-yard line, and once again, New York tacked on a field goal. "
