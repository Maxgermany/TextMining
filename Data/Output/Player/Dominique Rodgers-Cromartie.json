They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards.

On top of this horrible injury luck, the Giants killed themselves with unforced errors to put them in an early hole. Rodgers-Cromartie left the game with an ankle injury of his own. On top of this horrible injury luck, the Giants killed themselves with unforced errors to put them in an early hole. Eli Manning threw a pair of interceptions in the opening quarter, neither of which was his fault. The first bounced off Shane Vereen's hands; the running back should've secured the ball on an easy catch. The second was actually a reception by Dwayne Harris, but he was hit so hard that the ball fell out of his arms and floated into the arms of Will Blackmon. The errors continued as the game progressed. A John Jerry hold ruined field goal position, and then Manning was guilty of a third interception when he tried to fire a tight throw to Rueben Randle. As a result of all of this, the Giants ultimately trailed 17-0. They tried to mount a comeback, and they actually took over with possession down 6 points, but they just ran out of time.    Manning couldn't get anything going until late. He just didn't have the protection, thanks to 4 starting offensive linemen being hurt. He caught fire at the end, but the Redskins were playing prevent, so I don't know how much I'd read into it. Manning finished 26-of-51 for 321 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 interceptions.    Odell Beckham Jr. may have made the catch of the year. I'm sure you've all seen it by now; Beckham dived for the ball in the end zone and was able to reel it in with just 1 hand. As this happened, I shouted, What? Nooo... I couldn't believe he caught it, but I should've known better, given how ridiculously talented he is. Beckham had a huge game otherwise, finishing with 9 catches for 142 yards and that touchdown. With all of the linemen being out, Manning spent most of the afternoon heaving balls up for Beckham, so if you want to know why Beckham had 18 targets, well, there it is.    Only 1 other Giant had more than 40 receiving yards. That was tight end Will Tye, who snatched 6 balls for 74 yards. Tye was on the field with Larry Donnell being out. Meanwhile, Randle snatched Manning's other touchdown, but that was the only pass he hauled in of his 6 targets.    The Giants, as usual, struggled to run the ball. Rashad Jennings (6-14) didn't even have much of an opportunity because Washington led throughout. Shane Vereen (2-15) led the team in rushing yardage.    I haven't discussed the victors yet, but perhaps I should, given that they are now tied for first in the NFC East. Kirk Cousins had a great game torching a New York secondary that lost Rodgers-Cromartie. He went 20-of-29 for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The aerial score was a 63-yard bomb to "
