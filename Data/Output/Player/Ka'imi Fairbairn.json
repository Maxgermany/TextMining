   "comment":"Fairbairn. Mariota answered with a touchdown drive that was keyed by hitting Matthews for a 28-yard pass to set up a first-and-goal, and Mariota finished it with a short touchdown run. Chris Thompson returned the kickoff to midfield to set up Houston. Fuller had Adoree' Jackson burned for a touchdown, but a pass interference caused an incompletion. It did, however, set up a first-and-goal, leaving Watson to run in a read-option for a touchdown. Mariota then stared down a receiver, letting Hal make his second interception of the half. However, Watson had his 1 mistake of the of the game, throwing an interception to Kevin Byard to lose a scoring opportunity, but Houston was up 30-14 at the half. After the intermission, Watson continued to move the ball, using Hopkins for a few completions, including a 4.h-and-1 and a pass interference. The drive ended with Watson lofting in a 10-yard touchdown to Fuller to complete a drive that drained the game clock of 8 minutes. Shortly later, Watson threw his 4.h touchdown pass, via a short toss to Miller. Marcus Gilchrist then picked off Cassel to get into Tennessee territory for another field goal from Fairbairn. Afterward. Cassel promptly threw a pick-six to linebacker "
