   "comment":"Ealy alone! Speaking of Ealy, he caught Bortles' sole interception when Bortles inexplicably threw it right at Ealy's raised hands. Bortles, who tossed wobbly ducks when his passes weren't getting batted down, also made some poor decisions, including a sack that he took for no reason in the first half. He easily could've thrown the ball away, but he froze still, almost as if he was trying to figure out which club he partied at the night before. This allowed the Jets to bring him down. Bortles finished with a ghastly stat line, going 15-of-35 for 140 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Keep in mind that he did this against a poor defense. It's unbelievable that the Jaguars are still starting him. They had an opportunity to go with a superior quarterback in Brandon Allen, who was the top performer at the position in the preseason. Instead, they're stuck with Bortles now, and they'll be in the same situation in 2018 if he suffers an injury, which would guarantee his contract. Jacksonville would be best served benching Bortles now and trading back for Allen.    The only reason Jacksonville's offense mustered anything was "

   "comment":"Ealy.    Despite McCown's massive yardage total, no Jet player had more than 80 receiving yards. Kearse led the way with 4 grabs for 79 yards, while Robby Anderson (4-76) wasn't too far behind him. Kerley (2-61) and Seferian Jenkins (8-46) both scored touchdowns, though, as mentioned, Seferian-Jenkins should've found the end zone twice.    "
