   "comment":"Devontae Booker, who served as the co-leader of the backfield and primary passing back. Booker out-touched Anderson 19-to-15, and he saw more action late in the contest after Anderson fumbled. Overall, Booker finished with 14 carries for 44 yards and 5 catches for 54 yards. He can be added if you're looking for running back depth, or as a handcuff to Anderson, who got 13 carries for 37 yards and a touchdown.    Denver's defense continued to be the main strength for the team. Prior to the 4.h quarter, the team had done a good job of preventing the Bengals' offense from moving. But by the end, the Broncos' defense was worn out and didn't get enough offensive support. The unit will keep the Broncos in games, but until the offense gets better, they won't be a contender at all. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
