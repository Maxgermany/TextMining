   "comment":"Booker touchdown. This gave the Broncos a double-digit lead. At that point, it appeared as though Denver would run away with it, but Siemian was finally picked, as he had a tipped pass of his own returned for 6. The Chargers were back in the game, and 1 drive later, they drove down to the 2-yard line, down just 8. With 4 downs, all they had to do was punch it in to give themselves a chance to tie, but they couldn't do it. All of the controversy will be regarding their play calls. Melvin Gordon led the NFL in rushing touchdowns entering this weekend and had 108 yards on the ground at that point in the contest, yet San Diego didn't give him a single attempt. Rivers threw the ball 4 times instead, and he was under such heavy pressure that he had to throw 2 of those passes away. Rivers went to his tight ends after that, but couldn't connect, turning the ball over on downs. The Chargers had 1 more chance after that, but without being able to pound the rock with Gordon as time was running out, they didn't have much of a chance.    Not running with Gordon on a single occasion on the goal-to-go situation was strange. Gordon gained 111 yards on 23 carries, and he had a 20-yard burst on that very drive. He was excellent against the Broncos, who have been weaker versus the rush than the pass. Not giving him 1 opportunity was inexcusable. Gordon, by the way, caught 4 passes for 44 receiving yards.    Rivers, conversely, didn't perform all that well, though it's hard to blame him. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 20-of-47 for 267 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. None of the 3 picks were his fault - 2 were tipped, while the third was the result of a miscommunication with Griff Whalen - but he was just 9-of-23 in the second half. He saw a ton of pressure and had to throw passes away. His tackles didn't have a chance against Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware.    Rivers' 2 touchdowns went to Benjamin (3-44) and Antonio Gates (4-33). Dontrelle Inman led the team with 4 grabs for 72 yards.    As for Denver's offense, it didn't have much success throughout most of the afternoon, save for a couple of possessions. The Broncos accumulated just 15 first downs (compared to 21 by San Diego) and was outgained by 45 yards. Siemian barely completed half of his throws, going 20-of-38 for 276 yards, a lost fumble and his pick-six. As mentioned, he was very fortunate to get away with some potential interceptions, including another 1 going back for a touchdown. He was very lucky that this wasn't a complete disaster for him.    Only 3 Broncos accumulated more than 35 receiving yards: Demaryius Thomas (5-79), Emmanuel Sanders (4-68) and Virgil Green (4-55). Both Thomas and Sanders saw a game-high 10 targets.

Kapri Bibbs was worked in a bit, but did not do much better (7-22). It seems like Booker will be the lead back going forward, but he should not be anything more than a high-upside FLEX most weeks.    For the Saints, this has to have been a frustrating game. They did everything they could to make a late comeback, but they came up short. A good chunk of that effort was led by the performance of "

Jacksonville's defense played well overall once again, but as is the case every week, the unit was betrayed by Bortles, who was horrendous as ever. I actually expected Bortles to throw 2 pick-sixes against 1 of the NFL's elite defenses, but he at least gave us 1. It was Bortles' 11th pick-six in 3 years. I have Jacksonville taking Lamar Jackson in my , which was updated this weekend. Bortles failed to complete half of his passes, going 19-of-42 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions.

   "comment":"Booker, who served as the co-leader of the backfield and primary passing back. Booker out-touched Anderson 19-to-15, and he saw more action late in the contest after Anderson fumbled. Overall, Booker finished with 14 carries for 44 yards and 5 catches for 54 yards. He can be added if you're looking for running back depth, or as a handcuff to Anderson, who got 13 carries for 37 yards and a touchdown.    Denver's defense continued to be the main strength for the team. Prior to the 4.h quarter, the team had done a good job of preventing the Bengals' offense from moving. But by the end, the Broncos' defense was worn out and didn't get enough offensive support. The unit will keep the Broncos in games, but until the offense gets better, they won't be a contender at all. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
