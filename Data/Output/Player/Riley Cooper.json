   "comment":"Riley Cooper.)    In this NFC East grudge match both defenses started well. Giants rookie cornerback Prince Amukamara was playing in his first ever game regular season, and he got off to a fortunate start by intercepting a deep pass intended for DeSean Jackson. Amukamara got lucky because he was beat by Jackson running downfield, but Vince Young threw a horribly underthrown ball that let Amukamara recover to get the interception. Eli Manning returned the favor by throwing a pick to linebacker Jamar Chaney. Philadelphia took the lead with a field goal in the second quarter, but Young threw another pick. The pass was deflected by cornerback Aaron Ross, and safety Kenny Philips tracked down the ball to set up the Giants just past midfield. A short time later, the Eagles took over at their own 2-yard line. Young aired out a deep ball that Jackson ran under for a gain of about 50 yards. After the play, he acted like an idiot, flipping the ball at a New York coach and then taunting the Giants' sideline. That drew a penalty which negated his big catch and put the ball back on the Philadelphia 2-yard line. Just before halftime, Jackson had a massive punt return, and why in God's name did New York kick it to him? The Giants finally forced Jackson to step out of bounds at the 14-yard line. The next play saw Young connect with Steve Smith on a crossing route for a touchdown. New York got a field goal before time ran out and Philadelphia took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. The third quarter saw more of the same - the Eagles' defensive line was whipping the Giants' line. Manning was under constant duress and the run blocking was terrible. New York had its 8. punt halfway through the 4.h quarter. Philadelphia started a promising drive, but Young threw a ball up for grabs in the back of the end zone and Ross came down with the interception. After trading more punts, the Giants finally got something going early in the 4.h quarter. Manning threw a deep ball for Hakeem Nicks and the wideout rewarded him with a phenomenal catch that went for 47 yards. A couple plays later, Manning scrambled and threw a rope to Victor Cruz who beat Nnamdi Asomugha to get open in the back of the end zone for a 24-yard score. If it weren't for his dumb interceptions, Young would have had a perfect game against New York. In the 4.h quarter, he led Philadelphia on a balanced 18-play drive that took 9 minutes off the clock. On third-and-goal, Young threw a bullet to Riley Cooper running across the back of the end zone. The Giants got the ball with about 3 minutes left in the game. On a critical third down, Manning hit Cruz who broke down the field for a 47-yard gain. On the next play, Eagles defensive end "

   "comment":"Riley Cooper were able to gain separation with ease, while Brent Celek had a long reception because Washington couldn't bring him down. Much of the same was expected from Philadelphia's stop unit, but the Eagles were inexplicably dominant on the defensive side of the ball. They put a massive amount of pressure on Robert Griffin, who often didn't have any time to throw whatsoever. This was particularly prevalent on a trip to the red zone when Griffin was hit as he was about to release the ball. He lost a fumble as a result, negating Washington's best scoring chance of the day until a late touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Griffin struggled to get anything going for most of the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - a high number considering that he scrambled out of some tackles - and as a result, he was just 7-of-15 for 57 yards and an interception on a tipped screen that was overturned before Philadelphia's defense eased up a bit. Griffin finished 17-of-35 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick along with 44 rushing yards on 10 scampers, but don't be fooled; the Eagles smothered him, prompting many poor throws, including 1 where he missed an open Logan Paulsen to set up the offense in the red zone. This was all thanks to outstanding performances by Fletcher Cox, Connor Barwin, DeMeco Ryans and others.    The Eagles were guilty of some pretty poor prevent defense in the 4.h quarter, allowing Griffin to make this result a lot closer than it really was. Griffin actually had a chance to tie the game, as he reached the end zone with less than a minute remaining in regulation, but he was once again under pressure, forcing an incredibly dumb throw in which he heaved the ball off his back foot. The pass was easily intercepted, ending the game.    Nick Foles, chosen way after Griffin in the 2012 NFL Draft, was the better quarterback on the field. He continuously torched Washington's helpless stop unit, going 17-of-26 for 298 yards along with 47 rushing yards and a touchdown on 9 scrambles. Foles would've had an even greater statistical day had the Redskins been able to keep up; he had 217 yards on 9-of-15 passing at intermission. Foles had been targeting Riley Cooper frequently over the past few weeks, but he spread the ball around evenly in this contest. No Eagle had more than 4 catches, as DeSean Jackson led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 82 yards. Cooper managed only 3 catches for 37 yards.    LeSean McCoy also had 4 receptions (73 receiving yards) to go along with 77 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. McCoy went down and grabbed his hamstring in the second quarter. It appeared to be serious, but he was able to take the field after intermission.    Some Washington numbers: - "

Later, Philadelphia converted a nifty double reverse on 4.h-and-1 for a touchdown, but Foles was whistled for a peel-back block that wasn't even necessary. Foles was later picked off on an overthrow, which was followed by an unsuccessful 4.h-and-short try deep in his own territory. He also held on to the ball too long, helping the Vikings accumulate 4 sacks.    Foles still managed to post some awesome numbers, though a huge chunk of his stats came in garbage time. He finished 30-of-48 for 428 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick. He also had 41 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. His best play when this game was still in doubt was a 17-yard completion to "

LeSean McCoy also scored. He managed 88 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and also caught 3 balls for 28 receiving yards. He had a drop, but ran well considering that Washington's defense has been so stout versus ground attacks this season.    As for the Redskins, Robert Griffin had a mixed outing, going 16-of-23 for 220 yards and an interception, which he forced into double coverage. He didn't run nearly enough - 5 scrambles, 11 rush yards - and he was nearly pick-sixed early in the game, but he completed a pair of deep bombs to Jackson. He made some mistakes, showing poor footwork on some attempts and holding on to the ball too long, but he was robbed of a touchdown when Allen tackled Jackson in the end zone prior to the ball arriving.    Jackson talked trash about the Eagles leading up to this game, and he backed up his talk. He caught 4 balls for 126 yards, reeling in receptions of 55 and 51 yards. There's no doubt that Philadelphia missed Jackson's game-breaking ability this year, but it's not like he's done much for the Redskins.    I was surprised to see "

   "comment":"Riley Cooper dropped a potential 40-yard reception, and then Chip Kelly compounded the mistake by throwing the challenge flag. Drops weren't the only issue. Ertz had a big game - 13 catches, 122 yards - but he lost a fumble in the second quarter that set up the Redskins with a field goal. It seemed like Ertz's shin was down - the 2 CBS announcers and Mike Carey believed this to be true - but senile official Walt Coleman is too incompetent to overturn anything. The fact that Coleman is still officiating despite being mentality incapable of doing so is a complete embarrassment. At any rate, the Eagles had a sequence where they were flagged for illegal substitution on a special-teams trick play. A 5-yard penalty on an illegal formation pushed them back, and a false start moved them to first-and-20. "
