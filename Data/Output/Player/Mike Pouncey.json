The numbers say it all, as Cutler was 12-of-26 for only 92 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Cutler spent the majority of the opening half tossing third-down passes short of the line to gain. On 1 instance, he actually had time in the pocket - a rare instance - and yet he hurled a 6-yard pass on third-and-8. On another failed conversion, the CBS announcers pointed out that the Dolphins have their worst third-down conversion rate since 1991. The crowed had enough when Cutler threw his pick, which was a forced ball into tight coverage. The ball popped into the air as a result, and the Titans snatched it. He was booed heavily as he went off the field. Cutler, however, was able to put together a nice drive in the 4.h quarter to take the lead, so perhaps that's a glimmer of hope. That, or it's delaying the inevitable, which is Cutler being benched for Matt Moore. If Cutler continues to be woeful like this, Adam Gase may have to make the move.
