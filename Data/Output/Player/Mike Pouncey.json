   "comment":"Mike Pouncey stood out for their run and pass blocking. Pouncey allowed a sack to Browns defensive tackle Athyba Rubin, but it was a coverage sack that saw Henne run right into Rubin. Henne ran into Taylor for another sack. Overall though, Taylor and Rubin played very well. Right tackle Marc Columbo and tight end "
