   "comment":"Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3."

   "comment":"Diggs in the back of the end zone to cap off the drive, as the rookie wideout torched the normally beleaguered Tracy Porter. Bridgewater continued to lead successful drives throughout this contest, converting 8-of-12 third downs. He misfired just 3 times, going 17-of-20 for 231 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). There was a scary moment in which he was banged low on a dirty hit, but he turned out to be fine.    Speaking of potential significant injuries, Adrian Peterson limped off the field in the second quarter. He turned out to be just fine, as he was given 6 attempts after intermission - a number that would've been higher had the Bears been more competitive. Peterson, unfortunately, disappointed his fantasy owners in the process, generating just 63 yards on his 18 carries. He didn't look the same after coming back. His fantasy owners watched in horror as Jerick McKinnon hauled in 4 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown.    Diggs secured 2 of the other Bridgewater touchdowns, snaring 3 balls for 55 yards in the process. Fullback "

   "comment":"Diggs was short of the first down on the ensuing catch. If that's not enough, Bradford was later charged with 2 fumbles. One was a botched snap, but the second was a strip-sack in which Bradford didn't feel the blind-side pressure from Clay Matthews. On another occasion, Bradford needed to convert a third-and-9, but threw a short pass that actually ended up being a loss of 2 yards. It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners. A mega congrats to the few who used Thielen. The slot receiver had a huge game, catching 12 passes for a whopping 202 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've scored thrice, but Bradford missed him in the end zone. Thielen's output is a clear indicator of how horrible Green Bay's secondary is. Elsewhere in the Minnesota receiving corps, Stefon Diggs caught 4 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown. Kyle Rudolph, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 53 yards.    With Adrian Peterson out, "

   "comment":"Diggs, as they led Minnesota to 21 first-half points. The Vikings then used their defense to close out the win by generating 3 interceptions.    To get the game started, Keenum lofted in a beautiful pass to Adam Thielen for 45 yards after he got separation on Vernon Hargreaves running a go route down the sideline. A 16-yard pass to Dalvin Cook set up Cook to plunge over the goal line for his first career touchdown. The Bucs answered with a field goal drive. The Vikings were set up for more points as Keenum hit Thielen (5-98) for 19 yards and a holding call on T.J. Ward in the end zone set up a first-and-goal. Keenum tossed an easy pass to Jarius Wright to give Minnesota a 14-3 lead. The Bucs started moving the ball with DeSean Jackson getting the best of Trae Waynes for a nice gain, but then Winston forced a pass downfield to Jackson, who didn't have separation on Waynes, and the third-year corner picked off the pass. Keenum took advantage, hitting Diggs for a 43-yard gain, and then Diggs jumped over Hargreaves for a 17-yard touchdown. That put the Vikings up 21-3 at halftime. The domination continued in the third quarter with Diggs ripping the Bucs' secondary for a 59-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay came up with an answer as Winston threaded a needle to "

If Bridgewater is even 75 percent of what he used to be, that'll be a huge boon for a Viking team that is a huge favorite to win the NFC North.    Adam Thielen had a huge performance. He caught 5 balls for 98 yards and a touchdown, his first of the year. Thielen also drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone to set up a rushing touchdown. And speaking of pass interferences, Diggs drew 2 of them downfield, which would explain why his stat line - 4 catches, 27 yards - was so disappointing. Diggs was close to having a big game, and he should've had a nice catch in the 4.h quarter, but incompetent officiating ruled that he didn't secure the ball prior to falling out of bounds (even though it was fairly obvious that he did.) At any rate, Keenum's other touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Diggs for a score. Overall, Keenum ended up going 21-of-29 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The picks came late in the game, 1 on a lofted pass that he threw into double coverage, and another where he stared down the receiver and allowed D.J. Swearinger to undercut the route. These mistakes were emblematic of why Keenum shouldn't be counted on as an every-day starter for a Super Bowl contender. But, like Ryan Fitzpatrick, he could become 1 of the best spot starters in the league while he is in his prime.    Keenum's top receivers during the contest were Adam Thielen (8-166, 1 TD) and Stefon Diggs (4-78, 1 TD). The 2 were able to break away from the Washington corners seemingly all day. In particular, Thielen looked very good, as he made a couple of tough grabs, and also had a long catch that saw him catch the ball in space and use his speed to shred the defense. He can be started as a high-upside FLEX play most weeks. Meanwhile, Diggs was efficient, catching all but 1 of his targets, and he looks healthy again. He can be counted on as a WR2 for the rest of the year. Elsewhere, "
