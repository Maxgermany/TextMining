   "comment":"Stefon Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush.

Bridgewater continued to lead successful drives throughout this contest, converting 8-of-12 third downs. He misfired just 3 times, going 17-of-20 for 231 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). There was a scary moment in which he was banged low on a dirty hit, but he turned out to be fine.    Speaking of potential significant injuries, Adrian Peterson limped off the field in the second quarter. He turned out to be just fine, as he was given 6 attempts after intermission - a number that would've been higher had the Bears been more competitive. Peterson, unfortunately, disappointed his fantasy owners in the process, generating just 63 yards on his 18 carries. He didn't look the same after coming back. His fantasy owners watched in horror as Jerick McKinnon hauled in 4 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown.    Diggs secured 2 of the other Bridgewater touchdowns, snaring 3 balls for 55 yards in the process. Fullback "

On another occasion, Bradford needed to convert a third-and-9, but threw a short pass that actually ended up being a loss of 2 yards. It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners.

A 16-yard pass to Diggs, as they led Minnesota to 21 first-half points. The Vikings then used their defense to close out the win by generating 3 interceptions.    To get the game started, Keenum lofted in a beautiful pass to Adam Thielen for 45 yards after he got separation on Vernon Hargreaves running a go route down the sideline. A 16-yard pass to Dalvin Cook set up Cook to plunge over the goal line for his first career touchdown. The Bucs answered with a field goal drive. The Vikings were set up for more points as Keenum hit Thielen (5-98) for 19 yards and a holding call on T.J. Ward in the end zone set up a first-and-goal. Keenum tossed an easy pass to Jarius Wright to give Minnesota a 14-3 lead. The Bucs started moving the ball with DeSean Jackson getting the best of Trae Waynes for a nice gain, but then Winston forced a pass downfield to Jackson, who didn't have separation on Waynes, and the third-year corner picked off the pass. Keenum took advantage, hitting Diggs for a 43-yard gain, and then Diggs jumped over Hargreaves for a 17-yard touchdown. That put the Vikings up 21-3 at halftime. The domination continued in the third quarter with Diggs ripping the Bucs' secondary for a 59-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay came up with an answer as Winston threaded a needle to "
