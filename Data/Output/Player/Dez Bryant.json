The blocked punt returned for a touchdown, the penalties and the fumble at the Jets 1-yard line were all huge, but Romo's pick was the worst mistake of them all because it could have been prevented. Romo himself said that he needed to avoid the big error, yet he was guilty of it because he made a dumb decision.    Part of Dallas' demise occurred because of Dez Bryant's injury. Bryant caught 3 balls for 71 yards and a touchdown, dominating the opening drive. However, he missed some action because of leg cramps and then couldn't run whatsoever. This made it very easy for "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant with a deep pass down to the 32-yard line. At this point, there were 25 seconds on the clock, and Dallas had 2 timeouts remaining. Instead of using 1 of those stoppages to conserve time and set up Dan Bailey with an easier field goal, Romo lazily took his time and spiked the ball with 7 seconds left. Bailey hit the game-winner - only to see it nullified by a Garrett timeout. I don't understand what the hell Garrett was thinking. He asked for the stoppage and then looked sheephishly as he saw Bailey's kick split the uprights. Of course, Bailey's next attept would fail. The Cardinals would win in overtime, thanks to LaRod Stephens-Howling's only reception, which had Cowboy defensive coordinator Capt. Lou Albano bending over in disgust on the sidelines.    Even if you ignore the field goal, it's still surprising that the Cowboys lost. They dominated early on, as Arizona had just 49 yards in the first half. Kevin Kolb was skittish in the pocket (thanks to 5 sacks) and missed a wide-open Rob Housler for a possible touchdown in opening quarter. However, the Cardinals really picked up after intermission. Kolb was clutch in the second half and overtime, finishing 16-of-25 for 247 yards and a touchdown. Surprisingly, Larry Fitzgerald (4-55) was not his primary target. That was Andre Roberts (6-111), who had a big game against the Cowboys in this meeting last year.    Coming off his 228-yard performance at St. Louis, Chris Wells didn't muster a gain longer than 9 yards. However, he still compiled 67 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.    Wells outgained DeMarco Murray, who really struggled. He tallied just 38 yards on 12 attempts. Felix Jones, meanwhile, notched 36 yards on 6 attempts.    Romo went 28-of-42 for 299 yards and a touchdown. Those are solid numbers, but Romo had issues moving the chains, converting just 4-of-12 third downs. His offensive line's inability to block Arizona (5 sacks) definitely didn't help. Neither did rookie corner Patrick Peterson's prolific play in coverage. Peterson has had issues this year, but was absolutely brilliant in this contest.    Romo's score went to Dez Bryant (8-86, TD). "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant on the following drive and things looked really bleak at that point, but for the rest of the game, he was pretty much the only Cowboy who didn't deserve the blame for this loss. Romo went 29-of-37 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception despite awful blocking by his offensive line. The Giants registered a whopping 6 sacks, including 2 by Osi Umenyiora. The defense, meanwhile, was atrocious. There was so many missed tackles and blown coverages by the secondary. Terence Newman, Alan Ball and Abram Elam were to blame in particular. Newman is old and slow, and he cannot be allowed to see lots of action going forward. The Cowboys need to address the cornerback position in free agency or the <b> </b>. Dallas' stop unit often looked confused and out of sorts. There were assignment screw-ups, as we've often seen in Capt. Lou Albano's unnecessarily complicated defense. The team also jumped offside 3 times on third down, as Eli Manning did a terrific job with the hard count. What's most disconcerting, whether I'm Jerry Jones or a regular Dallas fan, is that the team lacked energy and showed no urgency in the first half. There were multiple fumble recovery opportunities, but the players were just really slow in jumping on the loose balls. It's almost like most of the Cowboys thought that this was the third preseason game instead of a win-or-die divisional battle for the final playoff spot.    I don't want to take anything away from the Giants though, who played really well in the first, second and 4.h quarters. Eli Manning went 24-of-33 for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns, thanks to the dynamic play of Victor Cruz, who torched Newman for a 74-yard score. Cruz caught 6 balls for 178 yards and the touchdown in total. Hakeem Nicks (5-76, TD) also posted solid numbers.    Ahmad Bradshaw scored Manning's third touchdown. He also found the end zone on the ground, rushing for 57 yards on 16 attempts.    Romo, meanwhile, tossed both of his scores to Laurent Robinson (4-61). Dez Bryant (6-70) and Jason Witten (7-69) also performed well."

   "comment":"Dez Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97). Newton, meanwhile, was 21-of-37 for 233 yards, 1 touchdown to Brandon LaFell (4-53) and the aforementioned pick. One thing that really bothers me is that Newton is barely running in the red zone. He did scramble 6 times for 64 yards, but none of this came deep in Dallas territory. After the game, a sullen Newton told the media that he's demanding change. I'm not sure what sort of change, but it appears as though he's defeated mentally.    Of the receivers who didn't score a touchdown, Steve Smith (7-83) was best. Jason Witten (6-44) was just OK. Dez Bryant (2-14), however, disappointed. He appeared to suffer a concussion but reentered the game and dropped a touchdown. This was a very disappointing outing, as Bryant continued to show the inconsistency that has plagued him throughout his career thus far.    As mentioned, both running games were sluggish. "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged 7 times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly "

He went 11-of-16 for 75 yards after intermission. Both of Romo's scores went to Jason Witten (8-70) which was weird to see because the All-Pro tight end isn't usually a red-zone target. Miles Austin-Jones (10-72) had a big day, while Dez Bryant barely did anything (4-22) because the Giants game planned to eliminate him. Bryant had his ankle rolled up in the second half.    "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant for a 2-yard score. This was crucial, as it kept Peyton Manning on the sidelines. Romo was great throughout - until he heaved an interception deep in his own territory with 2 minutes remaining. Many will blame Romo for choking, but linebacker Danny Trevathan made a great, diving catch to force the turnover. The big mistake by Dallas occurred soon after when the defense didn't have enough awareness to allow Denver to score a touchdown when the Broncos marched down to the 1-yard line. This was a typical poor-coaching maneuever that Jason Garrett has been guilty of over the years. Following 3 Manning kneels/awkward dives, the Broncos drilled the decisive chip-shot field goal as time expired.    Aside from the 2 strange dives to kill the clock, Manning had a near-flawless afternoon. He went 33-of-42 for 414 yards, 4 passing touchdowns and an interception on an underthrow that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. Manning also had a rushing score - his first in 5 years - on a play-action naked bootleg that even fooled the cameraman.    Half of Manning's aerial acores went to Julius Thomas, who was a monster. Thomas caught 9 balls for 122 yards. He also drew a deep pass-interference flag. Wes Welker (5-49) and Eric Decker (5-87) had the other scores. The latter lost a fumble near midfield on the opening drive, which would explain how Dallas was able to go up 14-0 in the first quarter. Demaryius Thomas, meanwhile, didn't have his best statistical performance (5-57).    Knowshon Moreno was a beast. He gained 93 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries to go along with 5 catches for 57 receiving yards. Moreno frequently broke out of tackles and was a stud in pass protection.    As for the Cowboys, Romo's final numbers looked like this: 25-of-36 for 506 yards, 5 touchdowns and the back-breaking interception. He fired scores to 4 different players, with Dez Bryant (6-141) finding the end zone twice. Bryant, however, lost a fumble in the first half. The other players who scored were "

Thanks in part to multiple injuries in Oakland's secondary, things seemed to click for Romo from that point on. Though he started with those 69 yards, he finished 23-of-32 for 225 yards and a touchdown. Romo was so efficient offensively that he helped his team score 4 times in the final 5 drives of the game.    Bryant, meanwhile, would go on to redeem himself. He led the team in receiving with 7 catches for 61 yards and a touchdown. Perhaps his best play occurred late when he caught a short pass and fought off 3 Raider tacklers to fight for a first down. He didn't completely get there, but it set up a third-and-short for his team that was easily converted to help Dallas bleed the clock.    "

DeMarco Murray started the day with 40 yards on the first 2 plays of the game via a 23-yard run and 17-yard screen pass. The drive ended when Romo missed a wide open Jason Witten for a potential touchdown. The Jaguars responded with Blake Bortles hitting Cecil Shorts (5-119) for 24 yards, and Bortles made another nice throw to convert at third down. To cap the drive, Denard Robinson (15-60) exploded untouched on a 32-yard touchdown run. Jacksonville's defense came up with a stop, but Ace Sanders muffed the punt inside their 5-yard line, and the Cowboys recovered. A few plays later, Romo rolled out and threw a dart to Witten for a touchdown. Romo opened up the lead by hitting Dez Bryant on a short crossing route. Bryant then turned downfield and ran through a few arm tackles before powering his way into the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. Jacksonville responded to set up a scoring opportunity on apass to Shorts. He broke a few tackles and bolted down the sideline for a 53-yard gain, but on the next play, Denard Robinson fumbled the ball away to Dallas after getting stripped by "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant on the ensuing snap, and just like that, the Cowboys were up 14-0 and had the game in hand. With this victory, as well as Philadelphia's inexplicable loss to Washington, the Cowboys were able to clinch their division. They might even have a chance at the No. 1 seed depending on what occurs next week, so they won't be resting their starters against the Redskins.    Romo was near-perfect. He misfired just twice, though 1 of those passes was a dropped pick-six in the second half. Still, Romo was an impressive 18-of-20 for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Colts, who have struggled against elite quarterbacks this year, had absolutely no answer for him.    The big, non-playoff-related story entering this game, of course, was DeMarco Murray's status off hand surgery. Murray didn't look all that great outside of an 11-yard run, tallying 58 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He seemed to be favoring his surgically repaired hand at times, and when the Cowboys went up 14-0, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms wondered if the coaching staff would sit Murray. That did not happen, as Murray played into the second half, which I thought was pretty foolish. Murray didn't suffer a setback, but he easily could have, and he would've done so senselessly because Dallas had the game in hand. Besides, "

The ultimate killer, however, was a Cassel pick-six as the Cowboys were driving to take the lead in the 4.h quarter. Just outside of the red zone, Cassel fired a horrible out pass that was snatched by Jordan Hicks and taken the other way. There was no excuse for Cassel making that throw; he has too weak of an arm, and he has never been able to convert on an attempt like that at any point in his career. He and his coaching staff have to take blame for not knowing his limitations. Cassel still finished with solid numbers, however, going 25-of-38 for 299 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. One of Cassel's scores was inexplicable, as he lofted a Hail Mary into the end zone, which Dez Bryant somehow came up with. Bryant snared 5 balls for 104 yards and that touchdown. He also drew 2 pass interference flags on "

Roethlisberger and the Steelers came back after the Bryant touchdown and retook the lead with a 1.yard rushing touchdown for Le'Veon Bell with 7:51 left in the game. Bell hadn't scored a touchdown this season, but he managed 2 in this game, plus totaled 134 yards on 17 carries and 9 receptions. He looked unstoppable at times as he stood at the line just waiting for a crease, which he would then explode through. He is fun to watch. That Bell touchdown put the Steelers up 24-23, as they missed yet another 2.point conversion. It was again time for the Cowboys with 7:51 left in the game, and they methodically drove down the field with their mammoth offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott navigating behind it. With 2 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys were 14 yards from a touchdown and could easily milk more clock, but the Steelers smartly backed off a bit and let Elliott coast in untouched for a 14-yard touchdown. This fact could be debated, as the Cowboys' offensive line can make any team look like they are giving up, but it was the best play for the Steelers, and it looked like they let him score. That touchdown gave Dallas a 29-24 lead and allowed the Steelers a minute and 55 seconds to move back down the field for the win, which they did, but too quickly. Roethlisberger and company had no trouble moving the ball down field, and then Roethlisberger pulled a Dan Marino and faked a clock-killing spike only to toss a beautiful 15-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Dez Bryant on 3rd-and-15, and on the next play, hit Terrance Williams for a 51-yard big gainer. Prescott then finished that drive off with a great 10-yard touchdown run to give his team a 14-3 lead with just 13 seconds remaining. This is where you can say, fairly confidently, that Prescott is this team's MVP. Yes, Elliott is a much-needed piece to this offense and the Cowboys will lose games because he isn't playing, but without Prescott, this team is dead in the water. So, on we go to the second half! Wait, there's still a few clicks on the clock and the Chifes have the ball at their 37-yard line with 9 seconds remaining. Dallas goes into a deep, prevent defense, so deep that 7 defensive backs are hovering around the goal line, which sets up 1 of the crazier plays of the week. Smith takes the snap and has no real pass rush to deal with, while Tyreek Hill runs to the middle of the field, catches an easy pass with nobody to meet him other than his teammates setting up to block. From there, they work their way down the field, Demarcus Robinson makes a couple of beautiful blocks and Hill uses his speed to go into the end zone, easy-peasy. It was truly 1 of the dumbest defensive efforts ever by a professional football team. That touchdown made the game 14-10 Dallas, and then on his first drive of the second half, Alex Smith led his team down the field and hit Travis Kelce for a 2-yard touchdown to give Kansas City a 17-14 lead, and we had a game! In that short time frame, we saw some of the best, worst and most exciting football of the season. At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half. In the end, Dallas was able to convert on 7-of-12 third downs. The Chiefs also have some questions that need to be answered about their offense. Why did Kareem Hunt run the ball just 9 times, and why did Tyreek Hill see just 4 targets? The answer is likely to be the offensive line, which was not at its best despite being healthy. And as the run game has declined, so have Kansas City's wins. After getting off to a 5-0 start, the Chiefs have now lost 3 of their last 4 games, and a lack of strong ground game has been a big part of those losses.    The Cowboys should be riding high after a big win like this, which took them to 5-3 on the season, but there's a strong chance that Elliott will finally have to serve his 6.game suspension. I have no idea, but that does seem to be the way of the prevailing winds right now. This game by Prescott should at least give Dallas fans some hope though. Elliott rushed 27 times for 93 yards and a touchdown, but didn't see a target. That 3.4 yards per carry can probably be garnered from Alfred Morris and friends, and Prescott will take the lead. At least we'll really get to see just how good Prescott can be without Elliott, which I'm betting is pretty darn good.    Dez Bryant left this game with an ankle injury, but said afterward that he was just sore and bruised. We'll see where he is next week against Atlanta, but for now, it looks like he could be ready.    Terrance Williams did more than just bring in that 51-yard pass to set up Prescott's rushing touchdown; he ended up catching all 9 of his targets for 141 yards, the most in his career and the most since Week 1, when he gained 68 yards. Unfortunately, he did hurt his knee late in the game, but there isn't much info just yet.    Kansas City will get a bye next week and then face the crumbling Giants on the road, while Dallas takes on Atlanta on the road, in what will be an important NFC matchup for both teams.   "
