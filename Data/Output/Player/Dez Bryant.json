Henderson), 1 of which was a severely underthrown short pass. The other pick was left tackle Doug Free's fault, who appeared frozen in time because he refused to move once the ball was snapped. - The Cowboys had 11 penalties for 91 yards. By contrast, the Vikings committed only 5 infractions for 45 yards.    With all of this in mind, 1 thing is evident. I'll capitalize to emphasize: JERRY JONES MUST FIRE WADE PHILLIPS TO SALVAGE THIS SEASON. When a team continuously underperforms, it's on the coaching staff. The Cowboys keep making the same dumb mistakes over and over again. Dallas needs a change because things are not going to turn around as long as Wobbling Wade is on the sidelines.    Aside from the horrible interception, Romo played pretty well, going 24-of-32 for 220 yards. He also had that long touchdown to Austin-Jones wiped out.

   "comment":"Bryant with a deep pass down to the 32-yard line. At this point, there were 25 seconds on the clock, and Dallas had 2 timeouts remaining. Instead of using 1 of those stoppages to conserve time and set up Dan Bailey with an easier field goal, Romo lazily took his time and spiked the ball with 7 seconds left. Bailey hit the game-winner - only to see it nullified by a Garrett timeout. I don't understand what the hell Garrett was thinking. He asked for the stoppage and then looked sheephishly as he saw Bailey's kick split the uprights. Of course, Bailey's next attept would fail. The Cardinals would win in overtime, thanks to LaRod Stephens-Howling's only reception, which had Cowboy defensive coordinator Capt. Lou Albano bending over in disgust on the sidelines.    Even if you ignore the field goal, it's still surprising that the Cowboys lost. They dominated early on, as Arizona had just 49 yards in the first half. Kevin Kolb was skittish in the pocket (thanks to 5 sacks) and missed a wide-open Rob Housler for a possible touchdown in opening quarter. However, the Cardinals really picked up after intermission. Kolb was clutch in the second half and overtime, finishing 16-of-25 for 247 yards and a touchdown. Surprisingly, Larry Fitzgerald (4-55) was not his primary target. That was Andre Roberts (6-111), who had a big game against the Cowboys in this meeting last year.    Coming off his 228-yard performance at St. Louis, Chris Wells didn't muster a gain longer than 9 yards. However, he still compiled 67 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.    Wells outgained DeMarco Murray, who really struggled. He tallied just 38 yards on 12 attempts. Felix Jones, meanwhile, notched 36 yards on 6 attempts.    Romo went 28-of-42 for 299 yards and a touchdown. Those are solid numbers, but Romo had issues moving the chains, converting just 4-of-12 third downs. His offensive line's inability to block Arizona (5 sacks) definitely didn't help. Neither did rookie corner Patrick Peterson's prolific play in coverage. Peterson has had issues this year, but was absolutely brilliant in this contest.    Romo's score went to Dez Bryant (8-86, TD). "

   "comment":"Bryant on the following drive and things looked really bleak at that point, but for the rest of the game, he was pretty much the only Cowboy who didn't deserve the blame for this loss. Romo went 29-of-37 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception despite awful blocking by his offensive line. The Giants registered a whopping 6 sacks, including 2 by Osi Umenyiora. The defense, meanwhile, was atrocious. There was so many missed tackles and blown coverages by the secondary. Terence Newman, Alan Ball and Abram Elam were to blame in particular. Newman is old and slow, and he cannot be allowed to see lots of action going forward. The Cowboys need to address the cornerback position in free agency or the <b> </b>. Dallas' stop unit often looked confused and out of sorts. There were assignment screw-ups, as we've often seen in Capt. Lou Albano's unnecessarily complicated defense. The team also jumped offside 3 times on third down, as Eli Manning did a terrific job with the hard count. What's most disconcerting, whether I'm Jerry Jones or a regular Dallas fan, is that the team lacked energy and showed no urgency in the first half. There were multiple fumble recovery opportunities, but the players were just really slow in jumping on the loose balls. It's almost like most of the Cowboys thought that this was the third preseason game instead of a win-or-die divisional battle for the final playoff spot.    I don't want to take anything away from the Giants though, who played really well in the first, second and 4.h quarters. Eli Manning went 24-of-33 for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns, thanks to the dynamic play of Victor Cruz, who torched Newman for a 74-yard score. Cruz caught 6 balls for 178 yards and the touchdown in total. Hakeem Nicks (5-76, TD) also posted solid numbers.    Ahmad Bradshaw scored Manning's third touchdown. He also found the end zone on the ground, rushing for 57 yards on 16 attempts.    Romo, meanwhile, tossed both of his scores to Laurent Robinson (4-61). Dez Bryant (6-70) and Jason Witten (7-69) also performed well."

   "comment":"Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97). Newton, meanwhile, was 21-of-37 for 233 yards, 1 touchdown to Brandon LaFell (4-53) and the aforementioned pick. One thing that really bothers me is that Newton is barely running in the red zone. He did scramble 6 times for 64 yards, but none of this came deep in Dallas territory. After the game, a sullen Newton told the media that he's demanding change. I'm not sure what sort of change, but it appears as though he's defeated mentally.    Of the receivers who didn't score a touchdown, Steve Smith (7-83) was best. Jason Witten (6-44) was just OK. Dez Bryant (2-14), however, disappointed. He appeared to suffer a concussion but reentered the game and dropped a touchdown. This was a very disappointing outing, as Bryant continued to show the inconsistency that has plagued him throughout his career thus far.    As mentioned, both running games were sluggish. "

Eli Manning had a long pass to Rueben Randle (2-68) for 56 yards on the first drive of the game to set up a field goal. After that, the Cowboys started making mistakes. Brown undercut a pass in the deep middle of the field on a post route to intercept Romo. He had a nice return to inside the Dallas 30-yard line. Bryant ran a bad route and didn't come back to the ball. Romo threw a pass off the mark to "

Nate Livings and Doug Free were really struggling. The interior of the line was getting whipped by Eagles defensive tackles Fletcher Cox and Cullen Jenkins. Romo made an insane play during the third quarter on which he dodged 3 defenders to make a throw downfield for a 25-yard completion to Miles Austin (2-32). Romo threw for the end zone on the drive, and Bryant laid out for the ball. It was a bad call and ruled a 30-yard touchdown, as the ball had clearly rolled on the ground. There also was a pass interference penalty called on Rodgers-Cromartie. However, the officials botched the review and kept it a Dallas touchdown to tie the score at 17 entering the 4.h quarter. "

I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly "

   "comment":"Bryant had a monstrous performance, catching 9 balls for 224 yards and 2 touchdowns. His scores, both 58 yards, featured completely pathetic New Orleans coverage and tackling. In my notes, I described the latter as worst tackling of all time pertaining to the second touchdown. Witten, meanwhile, hauled in 6 balls for 60 yards. It wasn't a great afternoon overall, but he managed to break the single-season receptions record for tight ends with 103.    "

   "comment":"Bryant (4-71) suffered an injury and was in a wheelchair after the game. The defense could have given Romo more time (as well as a 6.point deficit) to work with at the very end, but Jason Hatcher hit Robert Griffin in the helmet, giving the Redskins a free set of downs and an eventual touchdown instead of a field goal try.    Speaking of Griffin, he still didn't look completely healthy, but was definitely better than he was last week. He completed just 9-of-18 passes for 100 yards, but endured 2 drops, 1 of which came from Pierre Garcon on a key 3rd-and-2 play. Griffin also rushed for 63 yards and a touchdown on 6 carries. He toyed with DeMarcus Ware all evening. The Redskins thought outside the box and left Ware unblocked so Griffin could fool him with his read-option plays.    With the Cowboys concentrating so much on Griffin, Alfred Morris was able to rush for a whopping 200 yards and 3 touchdowns on 33 carries. Morris eclipsed the Redskins' single-season rushing record, which was previously held by Clinton Portis.    Despite the aforementioned drop, Garcon led the team with 3 catches for 46 yards.    As for the Dallas receivers, Miles Austin-Jones didn't long a single reception, thanks in part to an ankle injury he suffered in the second quarter. Jason Witten was second to Bryant in receiving, snagging 7 balls for 56 yards and a touchdown. Witten finished with 110 catches on the year, extending his NFL single-season record for tight ends, which he broke last week.    These 2 teams were among the most penalized entering this weekend, so it was surprising that the first yellow flag wasn't thrown until the 8:59 mark of the 4.h quarter. Washington and Dallas combined for just 3 infractions.    The Redskins locked up the NFC East and the No. 4 seed with the victory. They'll host the Seahawks next Sunday. Sportsbooks actually have them as a 2.5-point home underdog.   "

Poe may weigh that much, but he doesn't look like he does. It seems like he's a 310-pound under tackle with tons of athleticism. He ate very healthily this offseason, and it's paying off.    I mentioned Bryant; he was unstoppable, especially in the first half. He notched a game-high 9 receptions for 141 yards and a touchdown, though he was guilty of a deep drop. Unlike the Giants, the Chiefs opted to cover him 1.on-one. The results nearly cost them, though "

Romo was great throughout - until he heaved an interception deep in his own territory with 2 minutes remaining. Many will blame Romo for choking, but linebacker Danny Trevathan made a great, diving catch to force the turnover. The big mistake by Dallas occurred soon after when the defense didn't have enough awareness to allow Denver to score a touchdown when the Broncos marched down to the 1-yard line. This was a typical poor-coaching maneuever that Jason Garrett has been guilty of over the years. Following 3 Manning kneels/awkward dives, the Broncos drilled the decisive chip-shot field goal as time expired.    Aside from the 2 strange dives to kill the clock, Manning had a near-flawless afternoon. He went 33-of-42 for 414 yards, 4 passing touchdowns and an interception on an underthrow that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. Manning also had a rushing score - his first in 5 years - on a play-action naked bootleg that even fooled the cameraman.    Half of Manning's aerial acores went to Julius Thomas, who was a monster. Thomas caught 9 balls for 122 yards. He also drew a deep pass-interference flag. Wes Welker (5-49) and Eric Decker (5-87) had the other scores. The latter lost a fumble near midfield on the opening drive, which would explain how Dallas was able to go up 14-0 in the first quarter. Demaryius Thomas, meanwhile, didn't have his best statistical performance (5-57).    Knowshon Moreno was a beast. He gained 93 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries to go along with 5 catches for 57 receiving yards. Moreno frequently broke out of tackles and was a stud in pass protection.    As for the Cowboys, Romo's final numbers looked like this: 25-of-36 for 506 yards, 5 touchdowns and the back-breaking interception. He fired scores to 4 different players, with Dez Bryant (6-141) finding the end zone twice. Bryant, however, lost a fumble in the first half. The other players who scored were "

Thanks in part to multiple injuries in Oakland's secondary, things seemed to click for Romo from that point on.

Romo was so efficient offensively that he helped his team score 4 times in the final 5 drives of the game.    Bryant, meanwhile, would go on to redeem himself. He led the team in receiving with 7 catches for 61 yards and a touchdown. Perhaps his best play occurred late when he caught a short pass and fought off 3 Raider tacklers to fight for a first down. He didn't completely get there, but it set up a third-and-short for his team that was easily converted to help Dallas bleed the clock.    "

It seemed like another 1 of those days for the Cowboys... and yet they won by 16. The Titans simply couldn't take advantage of Dallas' mistakes because Jake Locker was so inept. The stats don't tell the complete story, but Jake Locker was very inaccurate. He went 18-of-34 for 234 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He missed open receivers and was completely rattled at times. He even tossed an interception returned for 6 by Rolando McClain, but that was nullified by a quick whistle.    This was obviously a huge disappointment by the Titans, who were seen by many (including myself) as this year's surprise team, especially after their upset victory over the Chiefs in Week 1. Their defense dominated in that contest, but struggled immensely versus Dallas. Tennessee simply couldn't get off the field because it couldn't contain Murray, who atoned for his early fumble by rushing for 167 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries.    Tony Romo, meanwhile, went 19-of-29 for 176 yards and a touchdown. It appeared as though he'd have a rough afternoon early on. He took a sack from Jurrell Casey and saw Bryant leave the game with an injury. However, Bryant quickly returned, and Romo didn't need to do much because his team had the lead the entire afternoon, while Murray was breaking off big chunks of yardage on almost every carry. Despite Romo's meager yardage, Bryant still had a big afternoon. He saw 14 targets, catching 10 balls for 103 yards and a touchdown. "

DeMarco Murray started the day with 40 yards on the first 2 plays of the game via a 23-yard run and 17-yard screen pass. The drive ended when Romo missed a wide open Jason Witten for a potential touchdown. The Jaguars responded with Blake Bortles hitting Cecil Shorts (5-119) for 24 yards, and Bortles made another nice throw to convert at third down. To cap the drive, Denard Robinson (15-60) exploded untouched on a 32-yard touchdown run. Jacksonville's defense came up with a stop, but Ace Sanders muffed the punt inside their 5-yard line, and the Cowboys recovered. A few plays later, Romo rolled out and threw a dart to Witten for a touchdown. Romo opened up the lead by hitting Dez Bryant on a short crossing route. Bryant then turned downfield and ran through a few arm tackles before powering his way into the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. Jacksonville responded to set up a scoring opportunity on apass to Shorts. He broke a few tackles and bolted down the sideline for a 53-yard gain, but on the next play, Denard Robinson fumbled the ball away to Dallas after getting stripped by "

   "comment":"Bryant on the ensuing snap, and just like that, the Cowboys were up 14-0 and had the game in hand. With this victory, as well as Philadelphia's inexplicable loss to Washington, the Cowboys were able to clinch their division. They might even have a chance at the No. 1 seed depending on what occurs next week, so they won't be resting their starters against the Redskins.    Romo was near-perfect. He misfired just twice, though 1 of those passes was a dropped pick-six in the second half. Still, Romo was an impressive 18-of-20 for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Colts, who have struggled against elite quarterbacks this year, had absolutely no answer for him.    The big, non-playoff-related story entering this game, of course, was DeMarco Murray's status off hand surgery. Murray didn't look all that great outside of an 11-yard run, tallying 58 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He seemed to be favoring his surgically repaired hand at times, and when the Cowboys went up 14-0, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms wondered if the coaching staff would sit Murray. That did not happen, as Murray played into the second half, which I thought was pretty foolish. Murray didn't suffer a setback, but he easily could have, and he would've done so senselessly because Dallas had the game in hand. Besides, Joseph Randle had some nice gains (13-37) and could've handled the load, though he did lose a fumble in the second half.    Romo's 4 touchdowns went to 3 different players, with Terrance Williams (2-52) catching 2. The others went to Bryant (5-73), Jason Witten (7-90) and Cole Beasley (2-29)."

   "comment":"Bryant ran onto the field without his helmet on, which was going to be a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. And then the crowd began cheering. That's because Morelli told the fans that there was no flag for pass interference. He didn't give an explanation to the crowd or Jim Caldwell. He simply picked up the flag after making the initial announcement. Pereira was so flabbergasted that he was speechless. There's never been anything like this in recent NFL history, and the poor Lions couldn't have done anything about it, as Morelli was likely signaled by the league office to disallow the call, given that the NFL wanted a matchup between Green Bay and Dallas next week for ratings purposes. Thus, it was no surprise that the Cowboys got all of the penalties from that point on. Following a 10-yard shank by the punter, Dallas drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown, with the assistance of 2 crucial defensive flags that kept the possession alive. I hope the league compensates the Lions in some way because they were epically screwed by some of the worst officiating in NFL history. Detroit should've had the ball on the Dallas 19-yard line with the potential to go up 2 scores; instead, all a teary-eyed Caldwell could do was mutter not good enough during the post-game press conference.    I suppose Romo deserves some credit for that game-winning drive. He got a ton of help from the officials and the league office, but he didn't choke for a change. The forces around him didn't allow him to gag, but he still played fairly well when he needed to. He finished 19-of-31 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns despite the fact that he was sacked 6 times. Ndamukong Suh and Detroit's fierce pass rush had their way with Jerry Jones' heralded offensive line, disrupting plenty of drives. The Lions were so dominant in the trenches early on that they limited the Cowboys to just 6 first downs in the opening half. Both of Romo's touchdowns went to Terrance Williams. The initial score gave the Cowboys some life early on; they had 80 yards of offense in the first half otherwise. Williams benefited from Cassius Vaughn falling down and James Ihedigbo taking a bad angle. The second touchdown, which sealed the victory, came after Williams dropped a score. Williams wouldn't have needed that touchdown if Romo hadn't missed an open Gavin Escobar a play earlier. Romo missed some other targets throughout the afternoon, and he also was strip-sacked. Luckily for him, 1 of his teammates pounced on the ball.    If you're wondering about Dez Bryant, the Lions did a great job of smothering him. Bryant was limited to just 3 catches for 48 yards, and most of that came on a 43-yard reception, which happened because he was matched up on linebacker "

   "comment":"Bryant's reception that took the ball down to the Green Bay 1-yard line with a few minutes remaining in regulation. Bryant caught the ball, made a few steps and then fell just short of the goal line. This was initially ruled a reception, but replay review deemed it an incompletion. Dallas turned the ball over on downs and never got another possession. The Packers were able to prevail, allowing them to advance to the NFC Championship in Seattle. The ruling was incorrect, and the reception should've stood. Bryant made a football move when he took a few steps and dived toward the end zone. The ball barely grazed the ground, but Bryant never really lost control, though that shouldn't have mattered anyway. Because Bryant made a football move, it was a reception by NFL rule. The Cowboys, who are now aware of how the Lions felt, were royally screwed by incompetent officiating.    Having said that, I don't want to take much away from the Packers, who deserve to be in the NFC Championship. There was some concern about "

   "comment":"Bryant early on, which forced a punt. Terrance Williams dropped a pass. Williams was flagged for offensive pass interference, negating a touchdown. The ultimate killer, however, was a Cassel pick-six as the Cowboys were driving to take the lead in the 4.h quarter. Just outside of the red zone, Cassel fired a horrible out pass that was snatched by Jordan Hicks and taken the other way. There was no excuse for Cassel making that throw; he has too weak of an arm, and he has never been able to convert on an attempt like that at any point in his career. He and his coaching staff have to take blame for not knowing his limitations. Cassel still finished with solid numbers, however, going 25-of-38 for 299 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. One of Cassel's scores was inexplicable, as he lofted a Hail Mary into the end zone, which Dez Bryant somehow came up with. Bryant snared 5 balls for 104 yards and that touchdown. He also drew 2 pass interference flags on "

   "comment":"Bryant screwed up on a miscommunication. His second pick was more his fault, as he lofted a high pass on a checkdown to Robert Turbin. Having said that, Romo had more positives than negatives. He showed off his great elusive ability early on when he avoided a sack and flipped a left-handed pass to Darren McFadden, escaping the back of his own end zone amid a sudden monsoon. He made a number of terrific throws, including a 31-yard touchdown to Terrance Williams. Romo finished 18-of-28 for 227 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Romo nearly had a third score, but Cole Beasley dropped the ball in the end zone.    Romo's scores were thrown to Williams (4-79) and Bryant (4-45). Williams drew a taunting penalty following his touchdown and that allowed the Dolphins to drive the field when they were struggling, but they didn't really have many successful drives other than that, so it didn't matter.    With Romo back under center, things opened up for Darren McFadden, who was able to gash the Dolphins for 129 yards on 29 carries. Robert Turbin was mixed in with 7 attempts for 35 yards. McFadden converted a big 4.h down in the opening quarter when Dallas was on its side of midfield, which was a big statement that established the tempo of the game.    As for the Dolphins, they had yet another ugly showing. "

   "comment":"Bryant for a 50-yard touchdown. Prescott started off slowly in this 1. He missed a few throws and lost an early fumble, but he never lost his poise and came on strong, leading his team on 7 scoring drives. He completed 22-of-32 passes for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns, and has firmly taken control of the starting quarterback job over Tony Romo. Roethlisberger and the Steelers came back after the Bryant touchdown and retook the lead with a 1.yard rushing touchdown for Le'Veon Bell with 7:51 left in the game. Bell hadn't scored a touchdown this season, but he managed 2 in this game, plus totaled 134 yards on 17 carries and 9 receptions. He looked unstoppable at times as he stood at the line just waiting for a crease, which he would then explode through. He is fun to watch. That Bell touchdown put the Steelers up 24-23, as they missed yet another 2.point conversion. It was again time for the Cowboys with 7:51 left in the game, and they methodically drove down the field with their mammoth offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott navigating behind it. With 2 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys were 14 yards from a touchdown and could easily milk more clock, but the Steelers smartly backed off a bit and let Elliott coast in untouched for a 14-yard touchdown. This fact could be debated, as the Cowboys' offensive line can make any team look like they are giving up, but it was the best play for the Steelers, and it looked like they let him score. That touchdown gave Dallas a 29-24 lead and allowed the Steelers a minute and 55 seconds to move back down the field for the win, which they did, but too quickly. Roethlisberger and company had no trouble moving the ball down field, and then Roethlisberger pulled a Dan Marino and faked a clock-killing spike only to toss a beautiful 15-yard touchdown to "

On the actual play, the officials missed an obvious blow to the head on Bradford.    It's a shame for the Vikings that they lost because they had a great defensive game plan against the Cowboys. Elliott was limited to 90 rushing yards for the first time since Week 2. Elliott gained 86 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, but 30 of his yards came on 1 attempt. He otherwise was limited to 56 yards on 19 tries. He also had a fumble overturned by replay, as mentioned. Granted, Elliott had a long burst negated by penalty, but Minnesota did a great job tackling him for minimal gains.    The Vikings also restricted Prescott to a season-low passing yardage total. Prescott went just 12-of-18 for 139 yards and a touchdown to go along with 37 rushing yards on 6 scrambles. He was guilty of 2 fumbles, 1 of which was lost. He still made some great plays - a 14-yard run of his on a third-and-13 set up the first touchdown - but he definitely didn't look like himself because of Minnesota's terrific defense.    Elliott's sole score went to Bryant, who caught 4 passes for 84 yards and the decisive touchdown. Bryant was just 1 of 4 Dallas players to catch passes. The others were "

   "comment":"Bryant slipped, but the second was a terrible heave into double coverage deep down the field. This led to New York's sole offensive touchdown of the evening. Aside from the turnovers, Prescott's accuracy was anemic. His pocket awareness was just as bad, as he walked into a sack on 1 occasion to take his team out of field-goal range. He should've thrown a third pick, but Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie dropped the ball while falling out of bounds. Despite all of this, the Cowboys appeared to be driving with about 2:30 remaining in regulation. They reached their own 40-yard line, but Bryant lost a fumble, effectively ending the game.    Bryant's miserable outing was another reason Prescott struggled. "

   "comment":"Bryant, and a rushing 2.point score. Prescott went 24-of-38 for 302 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, a telegraphed throw snatched by Micah Hyde. There was some question as to how Prescott would perform as a rookie in his first playoff game, and aside from the pick, he passed with flying colors. In fact, his numbers could've been much better had his receivers not dropped a few balls. There's no doubt that Tony Romo will be traded this offseason. The only question is to which team.    Elliott, meanwhile, registered 125 yards on 22 carries. He moved the pile on most of his attempts, and 1 of his best runs featured a sick spin move to avoid Clay Matthews. Elliott also had a gain of about 15 wiped out by a Doug Free holding call.    Bryant was perhaps Dallas' top offensive player in this contest. The Packers had no answer for him, as Bryant hauled in 9 of his 12 targets for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns. Witten (6-59) reeled in Prescott's other score. Bryant and Witten were Prescott's only reliable downfield options. "

   "comment":"Bryant for a 36-yard gain on the initial play of the afternoon. That set up a field goal, but the Cowboys found the end zone on the following possession. Dallas scored a touchdown on the longest drive of the season, with the possession lasting 16 plays, featuring several third-down conversions. Trumaine Johnson dropped an interception, and that ended up costing the Rams because Dallas found the end zone shortly later. On the next possession, Alfred Morris burst for a 70-yard gain, setting up an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown run. This put the Cowboys up 17-6, and the game was effectively over. </i> This was the mindset everyone had when Dallas established an 11-point lead in the early going. On Twitter, I saw that 1 Cowboy beat writer said that the game was over, and it certainly appeared that way. It seemed like this would be a blowout. Instead, the Rams made some adjustments and were able to dominate on the defensive side of the ball in the second half. They were so much better on first down, as the Cowboys had to constantly operate in long-yardage situations. Meanwhile, Jared Goff continued to show major growth. He had some instances where he back-peddled and threw some bad passes as a result, but he was mostly on point, leading the Rams to a comeback and a surprise upset victory.    Goff was mostly excellent, going 21-of-36 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a huge third-and-11 deep in his own territory. He didn't face much resistance, as Dallas was missing Pro Bowl linebacker Sean Lee, but this was still a monumental improvement over how he looked last year. Sean McVay and Greg Olson have worked wonders with him.    As good as Goff was, Todd Gurley was the star of the show. Gurley not only rushed for 121 yards on 23 carries - which included a trademark hurdle of his - but he also led the team in receiving, catching 7 balls for 94 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gurley is a monster and happens to be rejuvenated by the upgrades the Rams have made to their offensive line.    Following Gurley, Cooper Kupp was next on the receiving chart with 5 rabs for 60 yards and a touchdown. Interestingly, Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because Ronald Leary departed for Denver. The mainstays aren't performing up to their abilities either.    Prescott finished 20-of-36 for 252 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because his elbow was hit as he released the ball. However, Prescott's stat line could've been far worse. The Rams dropped 2 possible picks of his, as Kayvon Webster repeated Johnson's earlier mistake. Prescott also had Bryant open for a potential reception in the second half, but missed him.    Speaking of Bryant, he caught just 5 of his 13 targets for 98 yards, as Trumaine Johnson did a good job in coverage. Aside from Bryant and Elliott, no Cowboy accumulated more than 34 receiving yards.

   "comment":"Bryant on 3rd-and-15, and on the next play, hit Terrance Williams for a 51-yard big gainer. Prescott then finished that drive off with a great 10-yard touchdown run to give his team a 14-3 lead with just 13 seconds remaining. This is where you can say, fairly confidently, that Prescott is this team's MVP. Yes, Elliott is a much-needed piece to this offense and the Cowboys will lose games because he isn't playing, but without Prescott, this team is dead in the water. So, on we go to the second half! Wait, there's still a few clicks on the clock and the Chifes have the ball at their 37-yard line with 9 seconds remaining. Dallas goes into a deep, prevent defense, so deep that 7 defensive backs are hovering around the goal line, which sets up 1 of the crazier plays of the week. Smith takes the snap and has no real pass rush to deal with, while Tyreek Hill runs to the middle of the field, catches an easy pass with nobody to meet him other than his teammates setting up to block. From there, they work their way down the field, Demarcus Robinson makes a couple of beautiful blocks and Hill uses his speed to go into the end zone, easy-peasy. It was truly 1 of the dumbest defensive efforts ever by a professional football team. That touchdown made the game 14-10 Dallas, and then on his first drive of the second half, Alex Smith led his team down the field and hit Travis Kelce for a 2-yard touchdown to give Kansas City a 17-14 lead, and we had a game! In that short time frame, we saw some of the best, worst and most exciting football of the season. At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half. In the end, Dallas was able to convert on 7-of-12 third downs. The Chiefs also have some questions that need to be answered about their offense. Why did Kareem Hunt run the ball just 9 times, and why did Tyreek Hill see just 4 targets? The answer is likely to be the offensive line, which was not at its best despite being healthy. And as the run game has declined, so have Kansas City's wins. After getting off to a 5-0 start, the Chiefs have now lost 3 of their last 4 games, and a lack of strong ground game has been a big part of those losses.    The Cowboys should be riding high after a big win like this, which took them to 5-3 on the season, but there's a strong chance that Elliott will finally have to serve his 6.game suspension. I have no idea, but that does seem to be the way of the prevailing winds right now. This game by Prescott should at least give Dallas fans some hope though. Elliott rushed 27 times for 93 yards and a touchdown, but didn't see a target. That 3.4 yards per carry can probably be garnered from Alfred Morris and friends, and Prescott will take the lead. At least we'll really get to see just how good Prescott can be without Elliott, which I'm betting is pretty darn good.    Dez Bryant left this game with an ankle injury, but said afterward that he was just sore and bruised. We'll see where he is next week against Atlanta, but for now, it looks like he could be ready.    Terrance Williams did more than just bring in that 51-yard pass to set up Prescott's rushing touchdown; he ended up catching all 9 of his targets for 141 yards, the most in his career and the most since Week 1, when he gained 68 yards. Unfortunately, he did hurt his knee late in the game, but there isn't much info just yet.    Kansas City will get a bye next week and then face the crumbling Giants on the road, while Dallas takes on Atlanta on the road, in what will be an important NFC matchup for both teams.   "
