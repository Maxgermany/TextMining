The new coordinator wanted to simplify the blocking schemes, but it didn't matter because the line still couldn't block. Stafford was constantly under siege, taking 6 sacks. This rattled Stafford, who was forced into 2 interceptions as a consequence. Both were horrible passes that shouldn't have been thrown. Stafford was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions as well, so this performance could've been much worse. That said, I wouldn't dump him in fantasy because the new coaches could help turn things around in the second half of the season. Stafford finished 22-of-36 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Don't be fooled, however. Much of that, including the score, came in garbage time. By the middle of the third quarter, Stafford was 8-of-17 for 72 yards and 2 picks. He looked like a hot mess, but perhaps Cooter can help improve things during the bye. Unless, of course, he's busy sneaking into random women's apartments again.    Thomas scored on a trick play.
