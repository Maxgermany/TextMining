   "comment":"Thomas scored on a trick play.    As for the Detroit offense, it was more of the same despite the promotion of Jim Bob Cooter. The new coordinator wanted to simplify the blocking schemes, but it didn't matter because the line still couldn't block. Stafford was constantly under siege, taking 6 sacks. This rattled Stafford, who was forced into 2 interceptions as a consequence. Both were horrible passes that shouldn't have been thrown. Stafford was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions as well, so this performance could've been much worse. That said, I wouldn't dump him in fantasy because the new coaches could help turn things around in the second half of the season. Stafford finished 22-of-36 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Don't be fooled, however. Much of that, including the score, came in garbage time. By the middle of the third quarter, Stafford was 8-of-17 for 72 yards and 2 picks. He looked like a hot mess, but perhaps Cooter can help improve things during the bye. Unless, of course, he's busy sneaking into random women's apartments again.    "
