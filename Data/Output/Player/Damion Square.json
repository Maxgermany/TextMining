   "comment":"Damion Square, which sent the Philadelphia defensive linemen flying through the air.    There were some strange coaching decisions late in this game on Dallas' part. The Cowboys opted to go for a 4.h-and-1 just over midfield in the 4.h quarter. Instead of trying to pound it with Murray, they asked Orton to throw it. It appeared as though Orton had Murray open in the flat, but the pass was batted down. Later on, the Cowboys had to waste a crucial timeout. It also appeared as though they were guilty of a delay-of-game infraction, but the officials screwed up when they reset the play clock to 25 instead of 40 seconds. </r>  "
