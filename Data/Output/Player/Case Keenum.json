   "comment":"Case Keenum opened up 8-of-12 for 151 yards and a touchdown in the first half against the league's top defense. However, Kansas City started giving Keenum complicated blitzing schemes in the second half. They sacked Keenum 4 times in the final quarter alone, with the final 1 being a strip-sack to end the game. Still though, Keenum played well enough to keep this job after next week's bye. He finished 15-of-25 for 271 yards and a touchdown along with a 9-yard scramble. Most importantly, he didn't throw a pick-six, marking the first time in 6 week that a Houston quarterback hasn't been guilty of that sort of give-away.    Houston's offense has other concerns though - specifically, the injuries to their running backs. "

   "comment":"Case Keenum, asked his backup quarterback to throw a horrible out to Tavon Austin instead of eating up the clock with his best player late in the game. An incompletion later, the Rams tried a long field goal and missed, setting up the Ravens close to midfield. Justin Tucker missed, however, giving the Rams new life. They squandered it, as Fisher stuck with Keenum, who was concussed on a big hit. Keenum missed an open Wes Welker and didn't see the blind-side pressure, losing a fumble. Tucker converted as a result, and the Rams dropped to 4-6 as a result. The Ravens had no business winning that game after losing Justin Forsett to an injury, but Fisher sucks.    If you didn't watch this game, well, I am very happy for you, because if you were rooting for the Rams, they lost, and looked pitiful for most of the game, and if you were backing the Ravens, well, they lost their 2 best offensive players, Joe Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle "

   "comment":"Case Keenum came back to even up the scoreboard with a pass right to Bucs linebacker Kwon Alexander, who coasted into the end zone from 38 yards out. It wasn't a good pass, but it was more on Tavon Austin as he ran a terrible route, stopping in the middle of defenders rather than continuing to run his route. Tampa Bay's kicker, second-round pick Roberto Aguayo, missed the extra point. After a good kick return, the Rams converted a third-and-17 with a draw run by Benny Cunningham for 23 yards as the Bucs had a number of missed tackles. The Rams settled for a 53-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein. Tampa Bay came back as Jameis Winston hit Mike Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Case Keenum and Tavon Austin. Austin scored the game's first touchdown, but was responsible for the early blunders. He dropped a potential gain of 10-15 yards that would've taken the Rams to midfield, up 10-3, and the ball popped out of his hands and sailed right to Landon Collins, who had a spectacular return for a pick-six. Austin then muffed a punt, but was lucky to recover. He followed that up by fair-catching the ball inside his own 5-yard line. What Austin did, however, was not nearly as egregious as Case Keenum's errors. Though Keenum began 9-of-10 for 91 yards and a touchdown, he melted down as the morning progressed. He was nearly picked on a downfield shot on a flea-flicker. Then, on 1 play, he fumbled the ball, recovered it, then was almost intercepted while throwing the ball away. Keenum opened the third quarter by overthrowing an open "

He finished 20-of-31 for 188 yards and an interception at the beginning of the game, which was a downfield touch pass. Because of his meager numbers, no 1 in the Minnesota receiving corps topped 55 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Case Keenum's stat line. The Redskins shut down the Seahawks last week, yet they couldn't stop Keenum at all. Yeah, that makes so much sense.    In a game that many expected to be a defensive battle, the Redskins and the Vikings ended up having a shootout. That's just a microcosm of how the NFL has gone this season. With the win, the Vikings improved to 7-2 and now have a stranglehold on the NFC North. Much of the Minnesota's early success came thanks to the excellent performance of Case Keenum. It's pretty amazing that the Vikings were able to sign him for a deal that was worth just $2 million this offseason. He has been a very solid starter for them and is 1 of the top backups in the NFL. This week, Keenum was unstoppable in the early going. He helped to lead the Vikings to touchdowns on 5 of their first 6 drives. His ability to find open receivers and also to throw them open was paramount to the early success of the Vikings. On 2 occasions, Keenum was able to throw perfect passes to "
