However, Kansas City started giving Keenum complicated blitzing schemes in the second half. They sacked Keenum 4 times in the final quarter alone, with the final 1 being a strip-sack to end the game. Still though, Keenum played well enough to keep this job after next week's bye. He finished 15-of-25 for 271 yards and a touchdown along with a 9-yard scramble. Most importantly, he didn't throw a pick-six, marking the first time in 6 week that a Houston quarterback hasn't been guilty of that sort of give-away.    Houston's offense has other concerns though - specifically, the injuries to their running backs.

The latter came in and nearly led the team to victory, which would've been disastrous. As my Las Vegas Hilton partner Matvei wrote in a text to me, After ruining the season, Matt Schaub is now making a bid to ruin the Texans draft pick. Keenum struggled with his accuracy throughout, but the Texans should have kept him in the game, not only to ensure defeat; but to also make sure that they know what they have in Keenum going forward. Playing Schaub was very pointless and almost extremely harmful. Schaub went 17-of-29 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad pick at the very end.    Some players stood out: - "

   "comment":"Case Keenum-led Texans and the Browns in their final 3 games. Those seemed like 3 sure victories, but that obviously has not turned out to be the case. Following an uncomfortably close victory over Jacksonville, Baltimore looked completely inept in this contest despite being close to a touchdown favorite over a 4.h-string quarterback. Keenum-led Texans and the Browns in their final 3 games. Those seemed like 3 sure victories, but that obviously has not turned out to be the case. Following an uncomfortably close victory over Jacksonville, Baltimore looked completely inept in this contest despite being close to a touchdown favorite over a 4.h-string quarterback. Joe Flacco had poor performance. He was beat up early behind an offensive line that couldn't protect him against J.J. Watt and the Houston defensive front. Flacco was sacked just twice, but he was flagged for intentional grounding on his own 2-yard line for a near-safety, and he took a beating in general, as his offensive line lost both Ricky Wagner and Eugene Monroe in the second half. Monroe walked off on his own power, but Wagner was carted off the field. Flacco didn't look like he was healthy. He finished 21-of-50 for 195 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Most of his passes were way off the mark. One of the picks wasn't his fault because the ball was tipped at the line of scrimmage, but his next interception was an ugly duck off his back foot. The third occurred because Torrey Smith fell down, but Flacco routinely missed open receivers, including his running backs on short screen throws. One of Flacco's worst attempts came when he had a wide-open Owen Daniels for a decent gain, but his pass was at least 8 yards wide of his target.    Despite Flacco's meager numbers, Torrey Smith still rewarded the fantasy players who started him, catching 5 passes (albeit on 12 targets) for 59 yards and 2 touchdowns. Steve Smith disappointed (5-49), though he missed some time after hurting himself on an amazing catch that didn't count because he landed out of bounds. He also dropped a pass that would've gone for a gain for 15-20 yards.    The Baltimore offensive line didn't just have issues pass protecting; run blocking was also an issue. Justin Forsett had absolutely no running room, as he mustered just 19 yards on 10 carries.    Keenum, meanwhile, was a pleasant surprise for the Texans, who were expected to collapse with all 3 of their top quarterbacks sidelined. Keenum, who wasn't even on the roster a week ago, opened the game 4-of-4 and led the team on some scoring drives, though he slowed down after that. He had some miscues, however, which is why he failed to complete half of his passes. He went 20-of-42 for only 185 yards and an interception, which was an errant throw picked off by "

An incompletion later, the Rams tried a long field goal and missed, setting up the Ravens close to midfield. Justin Tucker missed, however, giving the Rams new life. They squandered it, as Fisher stuck with Keenum, who was concussed on a big hit. Keenum missed an open Wes Welker and didn't see the blind-side pressure, losing a fumble. Tucker converted as a result, and the Rams dropped to 4-6 as a result. The Ravens had no business winning that game after losing Justin Forsett to an injury, but Fisher sucks.    If you didn't watch this game, well, I am very happy for you, because if you were rooting for the Rams, they lost, and looked pitiful for most of the game, and if you were backing the Ravens, well, they lost their 2 best offensive players, Joe Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle Keenum, asked his backup quarterback to throw a horrible out to Tavon Austin instead of eating up the clock with his best player late in the game.

He served as a game manager for most of the afternoon, but he was aggressive at times, taking a deep shot to Kenny Britt that resulted in a touchdown. Britt torched Richard Sherman, who looked at the scoreboard in disbelief. Keenum finished 14-of-23 for 103 yards and a touchdown. He has proven himself to be a capable backup, and the Rams may even have him enter the 2016 campaign as their starter, given that they don't really have a promising alternative.    Keenum will have to continue leaning on "

   "comment":"Case Keenum came back to even up the scoreboard with a pass right to Bucs linebacker Kwon Alexander, who coasted into the end zone from 38 yards out. It wasn't a good pass, but it was more on Tavon Austin as he ran a terrible route, stopping in the middle of defenders rather than continuing to run his route. Tampa Bay's kicker, second-round pick Roberto Aguayo, missed the extra point. After a good kick return, the Rams converted a third-and-17 with a draw run by Benny Cunningham for 23 yards as the Bucs had a number of missed tackles. The Rams settled for a 53-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein. Tampa Bay came back as Jameis Winston hit Mike Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, Keenum came back to even up the scoreboard with a pass right to Bucs linebacker Kwon Alexander, who coasted into the end zone from 38 yards out.

   "comment":"Case Keenum throughout the game, and no player was better than Lorenzo Alexander. Alexander recorded a total of 3 sacks to bring his season total to 7. Prior to this season, Alexander had 9 sacks ... over 9 seasons! He is experiencing a re-birth in Rex Ryan's defense and should continue to be a weapon for the team. Elsewhere, Nickell Robey-Coleman came up clutch for the Bills. The nickelback got a key pick-six that gave the Bills a 23-16 lead. Robey-Coleman simply read Keenum's eyes and managed to jump the route. That really swung the momentum in favor of the Bills. Later in the game, Robey-Coleman snagged another pick that sealed the game. It was 4.h-and-long deep in the Rams' own territory, and Keenum just lofted the ball up to try and make something happen.    On offense, the Bills were led today by the superb effort of LeSean McCoy. Their veteran back was far and away the best player of this contest, and it was not close. Against Los Angeles' strong front 7. McCoy was completely dominant. He totaled 150 yards on 18 carries and was a catalyst for his offense. In the first half, he had a 53-yard burst that set up the second touchdown of the game for Mike Gillislee (2 carries, 6 yards, 1 TD). By halftime, McCoy had 111 yards on just 9 carries. He was running rings around the defense and looked as fast and elusive as ever. He and DeMarco Murray are currently battling it out to see who the top fantasy running back is.    In the passing game, the Bills were not quite as strong. Tyrod Taylor was 12-of-23 on the day for just 124 yards. Although he did not do a lot in terms of yardage, he did throw 2 nice touchdowns. The first went to Justin Hunter (1-4). Hunter set himself up near the back of the end zone, and Taylor scrambled around the pocket until Hunter got open. It was a nice move from the quarterback, as he evaded a couple of pass-rushers to make the perfect off-balance throw. The second touchdown went to Marquise Goodwin (2-13). Taylor delivered a strike to Goodwin that was only where he could get it. Taylor threw it low, and the veteran receiver managed to grab it before it went to the ground. The touchdown made the score 30-19 and helped to put the game out of reach. Overall for Taylor, it was a solid day. He did not do anything great, but he was able to lead the Bills to a victory. As long as the running game is as strong as it is, Taylor's upside as a fantasy quarterback will be limited.    The only receivers of note for the Bills were Charles Clay and Robert Woods. Clay caught all 5 of his targets for 73 yards and looked to be Taylor's favorite weapon. As long as Sammy Watkins is out, Clay will be the best receiver on the Bills. As for Woods, he was a major disappointment. He caught only 2 passes for 26 yards; however, he was guilty of numerous drops. He is simply too inefficient to be relied on in any fantasy format.    For the Rams, this game was another black mark on the 10.re of Jeff Fisher. The team had problems converting red-zone opportunities and had to settle too often. Case Keenum was a part of the problem today as well. Though his 21-of-31 completion rate and 271 passing yards were good on paper, his performance left a lot to be desired. Keenum tossed the 2 aforementioned picks and was unable to throw a touchdown. In the red zone, he was unable to do anything as the team only got 1 touchdown and 4 field goals during the game. Keenum did not help the cause as he struggled to get the ball to his receivers and was unable to deal with the pressure that the Bills were putting on him. After this performance, it is fair to wonder if the Rams will be able to win many games with Keenum as quarterback. He simply is too limited to be more than a stop-gap starter. If the team continues to lose, then the staff should strongly consider giving No. 1-overall pick Jared Goff some playing time just to speed up his development.    On the ground, Keenum throughout the game, and no player was better than Lorenzo Alexander. Alexander recorded a total of 3 sacks to bring his season total to 7.

Robert Quinn and Trumaine Johnson were both ruled inactive prior to kickoff, marking the second-straight game the former has been absent. Keenum misfired only 5 times on 32 attempts - including 20 consecutive completions - yet that's exactly what happened in this contest. It appears as though this crazy 2016 campaign just keeps getting more insane. However, what should be recognized is that the Rams are now undermanned. Robert Quinn and Trumaine Johnson were both ruled inactive prior to kickoff, marking the second-straight game the former has been absent. Michael Brockers, who was questionable coming into this contest, was able to suit up, but he left the game early when he aggravated his hip injury. With 3 key defenders out of the lineup, the Rams' stop unit clearly wasn't the same. Matthew Stafford was able to take advantage of this, torching the Rams by going 23-of-31 for 270 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was every bit as spectacular as those numbers indicate, though it helped that he didn't have to deal with any sort of pass rush. He was sacked only once, as his rookie tackle Taylor Decker put together an exceptional performance, albeit against a reserve.    Stafford's touchdowns went to Golden Tate (8-165), Anquan Boldin (8-60), Andre Roberts (2-13) and Marvin Jones (2-10). Tate actually nearly scored twice, but replay review overturned the call. This was shocking to say the least, as Tate was benched 2 weeks ago. I wouldn't expect him to maintain this sort of performance, though it's at least clear that he's not a lost cause. As for Jones, he also almost scored twice, but a miscommunication ruined the potential second touchdown.    With Theo Riddick and Dwayne Washington out, the Lions had Zach Zenner and Justin Forsett as their 2 primary running backs. Zenner (14-58) outgained Forsett (5-5) by a wide margin, and he also caught more passes (2) than Forsett (1) did. Forsett may not be on the roster very long.    Speaking of running backs, Todd Gurley didn't have the sort of performance that his owners were expecting prior to this matchup. Gurley gained just 58 yards on 14 carries, though he did catch 4 balls for 39 yards. Gurley was blown up in the backfield on a 4.h-and-1 try in the second quarter. Gurley's low workload may have been a byproduct of him walking off the field gingerly at 1 point in the opening half. He missed some action, but managed to return to the field. It's unclear if he was 100 percent.    I mentioned that Keenum missed on just 5 throws earlier. Take a look at his stat line: 27-of-32, 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, which was a horrible throw at the end to ruin the Rams' chances. But how does an overall stat line like that even happen? Detroit's banged-up defense got Ziggy Ansah back this week, and he managed to draw a false start at 1 point, but the back 7 continued to be brutal. DeAndre Levy needs to return for the Lions to play well defensively.    "

   "comment":"Case Keenum, but the unit was missing Jarrad Davis (concussion).    Keenum, but the unit was missing Jarrad Davis (concussion).    Matthew Stafford finished 19-of-31 for 209 yards. He refrained from throwing an interception, but with some luck, as a couple of Minnesota defenders dropped the ball. Stafford didn't have much time in the pocket, as he often had to use his mobility to escape sacks. On 1 occasion, he did this and found a receiver to convert a third down. He then hit Marvin Jones for 38 yards on a third-and-17 to set up a field goal.    With the Detroit receivers dealing with a tough secondary, the Lions focused on involving Abdullah as much as possible, and it paid off. Abdullah gained 94 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, with a big chunk of his output coming on a 20-yard burst in the first half.    Marvin Jones (2-42) and Golden Tate (3-29) both posted lackluster figures. Jones had to deal with Xavier Rhodes, so this lackluster showing was predictable.    As for the Vikings, Keenum took a major step backward from last week's performance. Keenum wasn't playing a skeleton-crew defense this time, and it showed. He went 16-of-30 for 219 yards. He began the game with a terrific back-shoulder throw to Thielen for 24 yards, but he had a meltdown following intermission. Keenum was just 8-of-17 for 100 yards after halftime despite "
