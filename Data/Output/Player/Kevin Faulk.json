The story going into this game, however, was how well New England could contain Miami's patented Wildcat offense. The Dolphins ran out of that formation 8 times.

   "comment":"Faulk. Dan Orlovsky, meanwhile, was 7-of-7 and looked unstoppable. And then reality set in. Orlovsky overthrew Pierre Garcon in the end zone. Then he underthrew a wide-open Jacob Tamme. A false start and a sack later, and Indianapolis had to settle for a field goal. Orlovsky wouldn't complete another pass until 3 minutes into the second half. Even more damning is the fact that the Colts had just 1 total yard of offense in the second quarter. The Patriots, on the other hand, couldn't be stopped once they moved into their no-huddle. They scored touchdowns just prior to and after the half. Up 24-3, they sealed the deal by recovering yet another Delone Carter fumble.    New England did not seal the cover, however. They allowed cheap touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, including 1 where Orlovsky was getting sacked and just tossed it up for grabs to Pierre Garcon (9-150, 2 TDs). Garcon's second score was more legitimate, but it didn't really matter at that point (save for any poor bettor who had the Patriots in a teaser.)    Orlovsky went 30-of-37 for 353 yards, the 2 touchdowns to Garcon and an interception. Don't buy into these numbers though; most of Orlovsky's yardage came in garbage time.    As for the real quarterback in this matchup, Tom Brady went 29-of-38 for 293 yards and 3 touchdowns, all to Rob Gronkowski (5-64). Brady's third score was officially a run by the stud tight end, but it pretty much functioned as a pass, so I'll count it as so.    Gronkowski did all the scoring, but Wes Welker (11-114) and Aaron Hernandez (7-43) both had more receptions. Deion Branch (3-37) disappointed his fantasy owners.    I have to say that I'm really disappointed in Bill Belichick. Not because he didn't cover the spread - OK, maybe because of that too - but I thought he could take this opportunity to give Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen more work. Instead, Faulk got touches for some unknown reason. Faulk is done. I don't know what Belichick is thinking here.   "
