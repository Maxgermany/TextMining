Conversely, Dallas scored 34 points in this contest, but looked really sloppy after their first 3 drives. When Seattle began blitzing, the Cowboys never adjusted by calling screens. Instead, Tony Romo continuously took shots downfield, misfiring most of the time. He even threw a pick in the second half. Romo finished the game with great numbers, going 22-of-34 for 331 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He located Jason Witten 9 times for 115 yards and a touchdown. Terrell Owens had 5 grabs for 98 yards.    Injury concerns: Both Marion Barber and Ware left the contest early. Barber (10 carries, 32 yards, TD) had an injured foot, while Ware hurt his knee. Ware was seen walking around later, but Barber had to go to the locker room. Fortunately, his replacement, rookie "

Ware beat left tackle Ware and was snatched by Sean Lee. DeMarco Murray ran the ball in for a short touchdown. Romo later threw a deep ball for 50 yards to Miles Austin who beat Eric Wright running down the field. That set up a field goal. Romo finished 25-of-39 for 283 yards with zero touchdowns and an interception. He never could get in rhythm because of the terrible play of his line.    Murray ran for 38 yards on 18 carries. Austin (5-107), Dez Bryant (6-62) and Ogletree (5-57) could've had big games if Romo had any protection. A 44-yard punt return by Bryant set up the field goal to clinch the win for Dallas.    Jason Witten had 3 dropped passes. He had a terrible drop inside the 10 that could've set up a touchdown. The 10-year veteran looks like he is declining.    The other biggest headline from this game is that Freeman is still deeply in regression mode. He was pathetically ineffective for Tampa Bay, and this kind of performance is inexcusable in his 4.h season. The vast majority of his passes were off the mark and wildly inaccurate. Freeman completed only 10-of-28 attempts for 110 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Vincent Jackson had 1 catch for 29 yards. The Bucs pounded Doug Martin (19-53) without good results and, curiously, continued to run him late in the game when down by 2 scores.    Tampa Bay's line also had protection issues. DeMarcus Ware had a sack-fumble in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers recovered the ball. That repeated itself again in the 4.h quarter. Ware beat left tackle "
