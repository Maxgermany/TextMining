   "comment":"Tebow. It wouldn't have mattered. Aaron Rodgers was on fire against a helpless, Champ Bailey-less Denver defense that simply had no chance. Rodgers went 29-of-38 for 408 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He also scored twice on the ground.    Rodgers' scores went to 4 different players: Greg Jennings (7-103), Jordy Nelson (5-91), James Jones (3-48) and Donald Driver (3-20). The Driver touchdown was cool because he suffered what seemed like a nasty foot injury earlier in the contest, and it didn't look like he would be able to get back out on the field.    James Starks didn't find the end zone, but he had a great outing, rushing for 63 yards on just 13 carries and catching 5 balls for 38 receiving yards. Starks ran with great power; he broke tackles and bulldozed over weak defenders. Starks won't lose his job if he runs like this every week.    As for Kyle Orton, he went 22-of-32 for 273 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 to Eric Decker) and 3 interceptions. Those are great fantasy numbers, but Orton's weakness was apparent on 1 of the picks. He fired a weak pass that was taken back for 6 by Charles Woodson. Orton's passing numbers were a bit of a farce. He threw a 44-yard strike to Brandon Lloyd on a flea flicker that really fooled the Packers. When the Broncos had to move the ball down the field, they often had issues doing so.    Denver stated earlier in the week that it designed a few plays for Tebow. Well, Tebow had just 1 carry for minus-1 yard. He didn't attempt a pass. Expect more Te-Bow! chants in Denver against the Chargers on Sunday.    "

   "comment":"Tebow to the delight of the Mile High fans, and he was able to lead 2 touchdown drives. Brandon Lloyd dropped a 2.point conversion attempt, making the game 26-24 with a couple of minutes remaining. San Diego had the ball on Denver's 40-yard line as the clock was ticking down. However, a phantom personal-foul penalty on Denver moved the Chargers into field goal range. With 20 seconds remaining, Nick Novak, who might just be the best kicker of all time the way he's drilling field goals against me, converted a chip-shot attempt. The personal-foul penalty was the major issue. It was completely bogus. The official didn't even mention who committed the infraction. There was no number announced, and the replay showed nothing. Even the CBS announcers were befuddled. The refs, who actually did this twice in this contest, made sure San Diego covered at all cost. There's no doubt in my mind about this. It may sound like I have sand in my vag, but seriously, no ref should ever be able to go, Personal foul on the defense. That's a 15-yard penalty. First down. Personal foul on whom!? Give us a f***ing number! Don't leave the announcers saying, I'm not sure what that's all about. And it's not like the refs did it just that 1 time. They did it twice in this game! Unbelievable.    Of course, if Lloyd just caught the 2.point conversion, it all wouldn't have mattered. Lloyd, who snagged only 1 pass for 20 yards (on the final drive), couldn't get 2 feet inbounds on another possible completion. Keep that in mind when I talk about Tim Tebow. "

   "comment":"Tebow was for 3.and-a-half quarters? He's terrible! He just got lucky in the end because he was playing the Dolphins. He'll never be good in the NFL! I'm just generating a random Tim Tebow hate comment that Cris Carter, Keyshawn Johnson and Merril Hoge can use the next time they're on the air. It's amazing how some analysts continue to ignore Tebow's ability to rally his team and stage amazing 4.h-quarter comebacks. He's a winner, and his teammates believe in him. Maybe 1 day his coaching staff will believe in him as well. It really looked like John Elway, John Fox and offensive coordinator Mike McCoy were setting him up to fail. McCoy constantly ran the ball on early downs, putting Tebow in a plethora of third-and-long situations. Tebow had no chance on those early on, as none of the receivers could get open with "

   "comment":"Tebow haters say this week. Probably more of the same nonsense. Oh, and speaking of which, 1 of the CBS announcers on Nick Novak's attempted field goal in overtime: Nick sweeps the leg... Quite a coincidence, considering John Kreese Elway and Johnny Lawrence Fox were on Denver's sideline.)    In a must win for San Diego, the Chargers' failure to control the line of scrimmage cost them all game. The afternoon started well for them. After a San Diego field goal, Denver had a promising drive ended with a dropped pass by Eddie Royal. Philip Rivers moved the Chargers down the field and threw a strike to Antonio Gates for a 6-yard score. Late in the second quarter, Royal made up for it with a big punt return across midfield. Tebow moved the ball down the field with a 2 good passes. He finished the drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Tebow and Quan Cosby all coughed the rock up. Those fumbles led to 13 New England points. The dumb mistakes continued after intermission, with the most egregious error coming on the defense. The Broncos forced a punt after Tom Brady threw incomplete on a 3rd-and-24 very deep in his own territory. However, Robert Ayers felt the need to shove a hand into the face of a New England lineman, which gave the Patriots a free first down instead of a short field for Denver's offense.    And if Denver didn't commit all of those errors? Well, I'm sure it would have come down to which team had the ball last. The Patriots had no answer for the run, which the Broncos had to abandon because they fell into a huge hole. Denver's defense, meanwhile, looked completely helpless trying to stop Tom Brady. Brady went 23-of-34 for 320 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unlike last week in which he looked really lackadaisical, Brady played with a ton of a fire that we often see when he's an underdog. Perhaps someone didn't notify him that he was favored by a touchdown. Brady's scores went to Aaron Hernandez (9-129) and Chad Ochocinco (1-33). Rob Gronkowski (4-53) didn't do much because Denver doubled him on every play. Perhaps John Fox didn't realize that New England has 2 awesome tight ends.    And perhaps Bill Belichick finally realized that he has a young stud running back on his bench. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots with 11 carries for 65 yards. BenJarvus Green-Ellis wasted 10 attempts for 17 yards, but found the end zone late in the 4.h quarter.    As for the other star under center, Tebow went 11-of-22 for 194 yards with 93 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on the ground. Tebow played pretty well outside of the fumble. He was pressured on almost every play in the second half, which stymied a potential comeback. It was odd to see the Patriots have so much success getting to the quarterback, especially after watching "

   "comment":"Tebow had to utilize bums like Matt Willis, who dropped a long completion on the final drive of this contest. But it all doesn't matter because the Raiders lost and the Broncos still were able to win the division.    I can't imagine this is how the Broncos wanted to clinch playoff berth. Their offense couldn't do anything aerially in this contest. Tim Tebow was an abysmal 6-of-22 for 60 yards and an interception. The pass protection once again was atrocious, but Tebow held on to the ball too long on way too many occasions. He also lost a fumble in the red zone, which was huge in such a low-scoring struggle.    As mentioned earlier, the receivers sucked. You're not going to advance deep into the playoffs with bums like Willis, "

   "comment":"Tebow didn't play very much, in case you were wondering.    The Steelers proved that Mark Sanchez is still Mark Sanchez: a limited quarterback who is not a play-maker and goes completely ineffective for stretches. Sanchez started the game like he played last week at Buffalo. He moved the ball down the field with some nice passes and finished the drive with a quick slant to Santonio Holmes (3-38) for a touchdown. However, Sanchez couldn't get in any rhythm after that drive and the Jets struggled to do anything against the Steelers' defense. He had some horrific inaccurate passes that weren't even close to his receivers. Sanchez stunk other than that first drive. He totaled 10-of-27 for 138 yards and a touchdown versus Pittsburgh.    New York couldn't run the ball either since Shonn Greene (11-23) and Bilal Powell (9-33) didn't see good lanes against a Steelers' defense that was dominating in the tackle box. This would have been a good game to go with Tim Tebow and use his portion of the offense. Tebow had a 22-yard run, but that was his 1 and only carry and he didn't throw any passes. Tebow torched the Steelers' defense for almost 400 combined yards last January when he was with the Broncos, so it makes no sense that the Jets wouldn't give him a shot with Sanchez struggling. What was the point of trading the pick and spending time in practice on that portion of the offense if the team isn't going to use it? This is suspect coaching from Rex Ryan and Tony Sparano.    On the other side, Pittsburgh pounded New York and gradually pulled away. The Steelers played their tough brand of football, and while they couldn't run the ball well, their defense and "

   "comment":"Tebow not starting because Mark Sanchez threw for 300-plus yards a week ago. Ugh. The stupid Patriots' defense is ruining my semi-trolling.    The Miami Dolphins went on the road and proved that their strong start to the season was no fluke. They dominated the Jets in every aspect with a tremendous day defensively and on special teams alongside an efficient offense led by backup quarterback Matt Moore. New York played New England tough in an overtime loss a week ago, but the Jets looked like a team that belongs in the top 5 of the 2013 NFL Draft. Miami's special teams earned its franchise an early lead with a fabulous first half. It was 1 of the most impressive performances you'll ever see. Special teams pulled off an onside kick, a blocked a punt for a touchdown, a blocked a field goal and a long kick return by Marcus Thigpen.  The Jets were caught completely by surprise by the onside kick after the Dolphins had a field goal drive with the heavy lifting done by Reggie Bush (14-59). Miami lost starter Ryan Tannehill to quad and knee injuries early in the following a sack by Calvin Pace. The Dolphins took a 10-0 lead after a punt was blocked by Jimmy Wilson and recovered in the end zone by Olivier Vernon.    Mark Sanchez stunk up the field. He started the game slowly and couldn't sustain drives. Sanchez was strip-sacked on a corner blitz by Nolan Carroll. The ball ping-ponged around before Paul Soliai caught it. That led to a short Daniel Thomas (15-42) touchdown plunge.  Sanchez played brutal football in the third quarter to negate any comeback attempt. Carroll dropped an interception, and a few plays later, Sanchez had a terrible overthrow that was intercepted by Chris Clemons at the goal line. The signal-caller's next throw was a dropped interception by Reshad Jones.  Sanchez threw a touchdown to Chaz Schillens (4-29) in garbage time. He completed 28-of-54 passes for 283 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Sanchez was far worse than the numbers indicate.    Shonn Greene (15-77 rushing, 2-29 receiving) didn't pick up the slack and had almost half his yardage come on a carry of 36-yards. Clyde Gates (7-82), Dustin Keller (7-67) and Jeremy Kerley (5-43) had modest contributions.    The Jets inexplicably gave Tim Tebow hardly any playing time when Sanchez was awful. That made little sense since New York needed a change to somebody who could create some plays.    Miami's defense deserves some credit for playing very well. Carroll, Shaun Smith, "

   "comment":"Tebow lined up at quarterback with Mark Sanchez split out wide. Sanchez appeared to false start, though the official whistled another Jet for the infraction. It was hilarious that Sanchez would perhaps subconsciously sabotage 1 of Tebow's rare plays. So, anyway, New York was called for a 5-yard penalty. What did Tebow do on the next play? Nothing. Because he was on the sideline again! The other occurrence took place near the end of the second quarter. Tebow was stationed at quarterback, but there was yet another false start. The coaching staff took Tebow off the field and replaced him with Sanchez, who threw an interception on the very next play. It wasn't even difficult for Seattle; second-year corner "

He was incredibly sharp throughout, which makes you wonder when he'll quit being so inconsistent. It's games like these that will keep the New York front office from making the right move and benching Sanchez. Speaking of which, Tim Tebow was barely used. He completed his only attempt for minus-1 yard, which came on a failed fake punt attempt.    Tebow's supporter, "
