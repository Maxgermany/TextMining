Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne put up solid stats, though most of that came once Rosenchoker went into meltdown mode. Manning was 25-of-34, 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Reggie Wayne had 7 receptions, 97 yards and the winning score.    Indianapolis' defense couldn't stop the Texans in the first 56 minutes of the game. I already gave you Slaton and Johnson's numbers; the Colts also were guilty of holding on a third-and-17, which gave Houston a first down. This was pre-Rosenchoker meltdown; otherwise, Rosenchoker would have just handed the ball to Brackett again.   "

   "comment":"Slaton had at least 100 rushing yards in both meetings against Tennessee last year, but managed only 34 yards on 17 carries on Sunday.    Of course, a huge blemish for Houston was its defense, which gave up 3 huge plays to Chris Johnson early in the game. Johnson had scores of 57, 69 and 91 yards. The Texans looked like they had only 6 men on the field on the first 1. Johnson was uncovered when he was split out wide on the second. And the last was a long burst from Tennessee's 9 on a 3rd-and-10. Johnson finished with 197 rushing yards and 87 receiving yards, destroying all of his fantasy opposers.    Kerry Collins was an economical 21-of-33 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Nate Washington was his leading receiver with 4 catches for 36 yards and a score. Justin Gage and Kenny Britt caught 2 balls each.    There was a fight in this game in the 4.h quarter. On a Slaton run, 1 of the Texans ripped off Keith Bulluck's helmet."

Predictably, Brown was stuffed at the goal line. Five units down the drain.    The Texans were shut out in the first half, but mounted a tremendous 21-point comeback. Matt Schaub was brilliant for the most part, going 35-of-50 for 371 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unfortunately, Schaub made 2 horrible mistakes in this contest. The first was a pick-six when the game was tied 21-21 in the 4.h quarter. The second was an errant pass to Joel Dreessen the play prior to Kubiak's blunderous call. Schaub had Dreessen open in the back of the end zone, but overthrew him. Dreessen caught the ball, but could only get 1 foot inbounds.    Andre Johnson caught 8 balls for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns. Owen Daniels also had 8 grabs for 94 yards. Kevin Walter notched 4 receptions for 37 yards.    As many predicted, Steve Slaton didn't have much running room to work with. He had 39 yards on 13 carries. Slaton saved his fantasy owners with 6 receptions for 59 more yards.    As for the Cardinals, "
