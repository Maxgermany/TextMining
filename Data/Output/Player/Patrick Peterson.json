Chris Wells, meanwhile, had just 20 yards on 10 attempts. The Rams were ranked 31st against the rush going into the contest, but the Rams were selling out against the run because they didn't respect Skelton. And rightfully so - Skelton went 20-of-35 for 222 yards and a touchdown to Larry Fitzgerald (4-43). Skelton had trouble moving the chains throughout the afternoon, converting just 2-of-10 third downs.    The Rams should have won this game. They had 121 more yards from scrimmage and 7 more first downs. They also won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 12 minutes. Special teams were a killer. The blocked kick really hurt, and Peterson obviously did them in. Ultimately though, this was probably a good thing for the Rams, who are 1 loss closer to Falling Flat for Matt Kalil.   "

   "comment":"Peterson had the worst game ever. He missed so many tackles and was constantly abused in coverage. He also was whistled for pass interference and fumbled a punt return. But hey, at least the Cardinals have their quarterback situation straightened out.)    The formula for the San Francisco has been pretty simple this year. Let the defense hold the opponent's scoring down, run the ball as much as possible and do not turn the ball over. It's pretty cool when it works and for a couple months now, it has. So well in fact that the team has not only clinched its first winning season since 2002, but their magic number to win the NFC West is only 2. This was no picnic though, starting with the drizzle of rain occasionally falling from the skies. I can summarize the first half pretty succinctly. The 49ers kept trying to kick field goals and the Cardinals kept trying to get a first down. Neither team was very successful in those endeavors. After Arizona punted on its opening drive, San Francisco got the ball to wide receiver Michael Crabtree twice for 51 yards, throwing incomplete twice in the direction of Braylon Edwards along the way. Crabtree had a huge game (7 receptions for 120 yards) and abused rookie cornerback Patrick Peterson in the process. Edwards never did get his hands on a ball, apparently more troubled by the soaked conditions than his fellow receivers. At the end of the drive, "

   "comment":"Peterson on offense. But Skelton caught fire in the fourth quarter. He finished 23-of-44 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He should have had a third score - which would have tied the game with a minute remaining on the clock - but Early Doucet, who was wide open in the end zone, fell down when he tripped over his own feet. It's unfortunate, but that's how Arizona's season would conclude.    Doucet hadn't done anything prior to that anyway (2-24), so maybe that's why the Bengals left him uncovered. Larry Fitzgerald (6-105, TD) and Andre Roberts (6-75) were much bigger parts of the offense.    Both running backs disappointed. Chris Wells (14-53) and Cedric Benson (16-57) struggled, though the latter was worse because he had 2 key fumbles in the fourth quarter that gave Arizona a chance. One resulted in a touchdown, while the other led to that Doucet opportunity.    With a huge second-half lead, Dalton didn't have to do much. I listed his halftime numbers earlier; he finished 18-of-31 for 154 yards and the 2 scores. For those who don't have nifty Windows calculators, that's just 3-of-9 for 18 yards after intermission. He also had an interception nullified by a penalty.    A.J. Green had really disappointing numbers, catching just 2 passes for 25 yards. It's unfortunate for his fantasy owners, but he drew a 21-yard pass-interference penalty on Peterson.    The star of this game for Cincinnati was "

   "comment":"Peterson picked off at the goal line. Newton later tossed 2 more picks and lost a fumble. The reason I was scared to bet on the Cardinals was because the Panthers were coming off a bye, and road favorites following a week off have a great covering history. However, I didn't want to take Carolina either because I questioned if Newton would spend the free week watching film of Arizona. As Matvei joked: It looks like Newton watched film of Derek Anderson instead of the Cardinals' defense. Newton was terrible, but I don't agree with Rodney Harrison's take that he needs to be benched. Two reasons: First, are the Panthers going to turn to Derek Anderson? Jimmy Clausen? What's their option if they're going to sit Newton? Second, this wasn't all Newton's fault. His leaky offensive line surrendered 7 sacks, 1 of which resulted in a safety. His receivers dropped passes as well. Steve Smith was especially guilty of this, as he let the ball go through his hands in the end zone during the first half. Brandon LaFell had an equally crucial drop on fourth down in the red zone. There are, however, things Newton needs to work on. He needs to actually learn how to read defenses. He also has to use his legs more frequently. It's inexcusable that he scrambled only 4 times for 25 rushing yards.    Four Panthers had 4 or more receptions: Greg Olsen (5-79), Ted Ginn (4-78), Smith (4-60) and LaFell (4-47). Peterson did a number on Smith, who was frustrated enough to commit a pass-interference flag by pushing off the Pro Bowl corner. "

   "comment":"Peterson, who had great coverage on Johnson, couldn't do anything about it. Keenum ultimately went 15-of-26 for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half. Things were looking promising for Keenum, who helped the Texans outscore the Cardinals, 17-7, after the initial strip-6. However, things fell apart for him after intermission. Arizona's defense made some great adjustments and sent some creative blitzes Keenum's way. Keenum, perhaps due to inexperience, couldn't handle Arizona's blitzes. He was sacked only 3 times - 1 of which was for a 22-yard loss - but that's not indicative of the pressure he was under in the second half. Keenum, who went just 7-of-17 for 42 yards and a score following the break, was lucky to get away with what should have been a couple of interceptions. He also launched a couple of deep balls that sailed out of bounds on his final possession.    The Texans were able to hang around despite Keenum's second-half struggles because of poor Arizona coaching. The defense did a great job, but I have no idea what Bruce Arians was doing at times. Arians did a great job early on of setting up weird screens for his tight ends, which is something the Texans couldn't handle. But Arians' obsession with giving the ball to Rashard Mendenhall nearly cost his team the game. Mendenhall was stuffed on a third-and-1 deep in Houston territory, limiting a promising possession to 3 points. Mendenhall then lost a fumble at his own 5-yard line, quickly setting up Keenum with a second touchdown pass to Johnson. Mendenhall is absolutely terrible, and it's inexcusable that he continues to get so much work. Why did he receive more carries than Andre Ellington? Ellington, who is so much more talented, gained 55 yards on 11 carries, while Mendenhall plodded his way to a 42-yard outing on 13 attempts. Ellington also had just 2 catches for 18 receiving yards. That's a total of 13 touches, which is simply not enough. He needs the ball in his hands at least 20 times per game.    Carson Palmer entered this game with multi-turnover performances in 6 of 8 starts this year. Make it 7 of 9. Palmer was guilty of a first-half interception that happened because he was hit as he released the ball. He was also strip-sacked deep in his own territory, which set up the Texans with a field-goal attempt that they actually converted this week. Despite the turnovers, Palmer went 20-of-32 for 241 yards and 2 touchdowns otherwise. He actually had ample time in the pocket; outside of J.J. Watt's forced fumble, he wasn't sacked at all.    Palmer's 2 scores went to Andre Roberts (5-72) and Rob Housler (4-57). Larry Fitzgerald caught just 3 balls for 23 yards, as the Texans did their best to eliminate him from Arizona's game plan with Johnathan Joseph's coverage. Michael Floyd sprained his shoulder.    On the other side, Ben Tate received the full workload with Arian Foster out of the lineup. He was able to carry the ball only 15 times because of the early deficit, finishing with 56 yards. He also caught 3 passes, but managed only 8 receiving yards out of that.    As mentioned, Johnson caught 2 touchdowns, with the second being a circus catch despite Peterson being able to get 1 hand on the football. He did this amid 5 receptions for 37 yards. "

While he was out, Robert Turbin (10-38) and Christine Michael (6-26) were able to split the workload.

Doug Baldwin (7-113) also had a big game, while rookie Paul Richardson (7-52) also contributed. Richardson saw more targets than usual because Jermaine Kearse was knocked out with a hamstring in the second quarter.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals are barely worth mentioning. Everything they've worked for this whole season is for naught because of injuries to the quarterback position. They did keep this game close for a while - it was 14-6 entering the fourth quarter - but missed out on numerous opportunities. Ryan Lindley couldn't get the ball to an open John Brown on a third down. Michael Floyd dropped a deep pass. Lindley underthrew Brown a bit in the end zone. Peterson dropped an interception which would've given Arizona the ball in the red zone. Floyd tipped a pass away from Larry Fitzgerald for a first-down conversion on a miscue. Cromartie fell down on a long Baldwin reception. The Cardinals needed things to go their way considering their quarterback situation; instead, they just couldn't get any breaks beyond Hauschka's missed field goals.    Arizona's defense sucked, but Lindley was even worse. His overall numbers say it all, as he went 14-of-35 for 178 yards and an interception. He had some nice throws, including a nice rainbow to Floyd, who caught the pass over "

They had a laughable 78 yards from scrimmage, averaging a pathetic 1.7 yards per play. In other words, they needed nearly 6 plays, on average, to achieve a first down.

The fumble wasn't his fault though, as Charles Sims' helmet knocked the ball loose. Sims was on the field because Doug Martin was lost with a hamstring. Winston threw 2 more interceptions, 1 of which came when the Buccaneers still had a chance to make a comeback. Down 20, the Buccaneers once again had a promising drive in the works, but Winston launched a high pass to Sims, which was tipped into the air. The ball fell right into Cooper's hands, and Cooper ran it back for a touchdown. Cooper replaced the woefully inept Brandon Williams at corner and was so much better. Winston finished 27-of-52 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown, 4 interceptions and a lost fumble. While the score was a nice 1 - it was a beautiful back-shoulder throw to Mike Evans, who was seeing coverage from Patrick Peterson - Winston's stat line could've been even worse than it was because the Cardinals dropped at least 3 more potential interceptions. One was thrown right to Peterson, who somehow couldn't come up with the turnover.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, really needed to rebound following the loss to New England last week. "

Ryan was able to take the opportunity to pick up a first down on a third-and-10 scramble. And if all that wasn't bad enough, the Cardinals forced a punt, down 24-13 early in the fourth quarter, but Calais Campbell inexplicably lined up offside. The Falcons' drive continued, and was capped off with a touchdown, giving them an insurmountable 31-13 advantage. The Falcons, meanwhile, didn't do anything that impressive, despite their blowout victory. Most of their chunks of offense came on fluky plays, whether they were screen passes to Taylor Gabriel, or Ryan third-down scrambles, or poor pass-interference calls on Patrick Peterson. Again, Atlanta was being outgained in yards per play the entire afternoon, so its offense wasn't as good as Arizona's, and anyone who paid close attention to this game would probably agree.    Ryan finished 26-of-34 for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He played well overall, but wasn't great. Statistics can often be misleading, and that was certainly the case in this instance. Two of Ryan's longest completions, a 35- and a 25-yarder, were short tosses to Gabriel, who did all the work against a sloppy Arizona defense. Ryan's pick wasn't his fault, as it was a "

Marvin Jones, who actually saw Peterson's coverage, managed just 2 receptions for 37 yards, but he was able to score to salvage his fantasy day. However, the story of the game was Golladay, who was the third receiver on most snaps. He made some errors early by dropping the ball on a couple of instances. However, he had a terrific fourth quarter. He scored twice, with 1 touchdown being an incredible, diving catch. Golladay hauled in 4 balls for 69 yards and 2 touchdowns. He's very talented, and he's worth picking up in fantasy leagues if he's available.    The Lions didn't have much luck running the ball, as "

   "comment":"Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald, all had magnificent performances. Peterson, especially, was the difference. He struggled to do anything in New Orleans, so trading for him seemed like grasping at straws. It was a life boat instead, as Peterson was absolutely dominant. He gashed the hapless Buccaneers for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. This stat line was not the byproduct of fluky runs; Peterson showed the same sort of burst, power and juke moves that he displayed in his prime. I can't explain it, but it happened. Peterson was amazing, and if he keeps running like this, Arizona will be able to compete for the NFC West title.    Palmer, meanwhile, was also terrific. I can't believe I wrote that sentence after watching him struggle for the first 5 weeks of the season, but Palmer didn't even have an incompletion in this contest until the third quarter! He was 13-of-13 for 211 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half alone. Palmer didn't do much following halftime, which would explain why his stats didn't change much - he finished 18-of-22 for 283 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception on a careless deep shot into double coverage - but this is obviously an encouraging development for the Cardinals. It's hard not to forget how much Palmer struggled in the 5 previous weeks - plus, Palmer had a pick dropped by a linebacker in the fourth quarter - but perhaps he'll continue to play better now that he appears to have a strong running game aiding him.    The last of the veterans, Fitzgerald snared 10 of his 11 targets for 138 yards and a touchdown. As with Peterson and Palmer, Fitzgerald performed as if he were in his prime, though unlike the other 2 veterans, he had thrived earlier this season. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, he made a mistake when he lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Along with Fitzgerald, "

   "comment":"Peterson, Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald all looked terrific, but this game was a complete reversal of that. The Rams dominated this game, though the injury to Palmer certainly helped matters. The Rams were up 6-0 in the second quarter, thanks to a missed Phil Dawson 32-yard field goal. Arizona had the ball, which changed when Palmer was hit as he threw, forcing an interception. Todd Gurley scored on the next play, but adding injury to insult, Palmer left the game with a broken arm and was replaced by Drew Stanton. The backup signal-caller was responsible for an interception on a miscommunication with John Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both "

   "comment":"Peterson paid off again, with the veteran back carrying them to a road win in San Francisco. This win puts the Cardinals at 4-4 and keeps them in the playoff chase. The 49ers fell to 0-9, but maintain their draft position for the 2018 NFL Draft.    Early in the first quarter, Cardinals quarterback Drew Stanton hit John Brown for 52 yards (his only catch), but Phil Dawson missed a short field goal for Arizona. The 49ers then gifted Arizona some points as Kyle Juszcyk was stripped by Tyrann Mathieu and the loose ball was scooped up by Patrick Peterson for a return to inside the 49ers' 10-yard line, which set up the Cardinals' offense.
