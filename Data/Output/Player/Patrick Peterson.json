The Rams were ranked 31st against the rush going into the contest, but the Rams were selling out against the run because they didn't respect Skelton.

   "comment":"Patrick Peterson had the worst game ever. He missed so many tackles and was constantly abused in coverage. He also was whistled for pass interference and fumbled a punt return. But hey, at least the Cardinals have their quarterback situation straightened out.)    The formula for the San Francisco has been pretty simple this year. Let the defense hold the opponent's scoring down, run the ball as much as possible and do not turn the ball over. It's pretty cool when it works and for a couple months now, it has. So well in fact that the team has not only clinched its first winning season since 2002, but their magic number to win the NFC West is only 2. This was no picnic though, starting with the drizzle of rain occasionally falling from the skies. I can summarize the first half pretty succinctly. The 49ers kept trying to kick field goals and the Cardinals kept trying to get a first down. Neither team was very successful in those endeavors. After Arizona punted on its opening drive, San Francisco got the ball to wide receiver Michael Crabtree twice for 51 yards, throwing incomplete twice in the direction of Braylon Edwards along the way. Crabtree had a huge game (7 receptions for 120 yards) and abused rookie cornerback Patrick Peterson in the process. Edwards never did get his hands on a ball, apparently more troubled by the soaked conditions than his fellow receivers. At the end of the drive, "

St. Louis' inept coaching staff clearly didn't learn its lesson and consequently paid the price. Peterson's third-quarter score gave Arizona a 20-10 lead, seemingly putting the game out of reach at the time. St. Louis did a couple of other stupid things in this contest. For instance, the offense had a first-and-goal on the Arizona 3-yard line just prior to halftime. An offensive lineman committed a false start penalty, and then "

   "comment":"Patrick Peterson picked off at the goal line. Newton later tossed 2 more picks and lost a fumble. The reason I was scared to bet on the Cardinals was because the Panthers were coming off a bye, and road favorites following a week off have a great covering history. However, I didn't want to take Carolina either because I questioned if Newton would spend the free week watching film of Arizona. As Matvei joked: It looks like Newton watched film of Derek Anderson instead of the Cardinals' defense. Newton was terrible, but I don't agree with Rodney Harrison's take that he needs to be benched. Two reasons: First, are the Panthers going to turn to Derek Anderson? Jimmy Clausen? What's their option if they're going to sit Newton? Second, this wasn't all Newton's fault. His leaky offensive line surrendered 7 sacks, 1 of which resulted in a safety. His receivers dropped passes as well. "

   "comment":"Patrick Peterson, who had great coverage on Johnson, couldn't do anything about it. Keenum ultimately went 15-of-26 for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half. Things were looking promising for Keenum, who helped the Texans outscore the Cardinals, 17-7, after the initial strip-six. However, things fell apart for him after intermission. Arizona's defense made some great adjustments and sent some creative blitzes Keenum's way. Keenum, perhaps due to inexperience, couldn't handle Arizona's blitzes. He was sacked only 3 times - 1 of which was for a 22-yard loss - but that's not indicative of the pressure he was under in the second half. Keenum, who went just 7-of-17 for 42 yards and a score following the break, was lucky to get away with what should have been a couple of interceptions. He also launched a couple of deep balls that sailed out of bounds on his final possession.    The Texans were able to hang around despite Keenum's second-half struggles because of poor Arizona coaching. The defense did a great job, but I have no idea what Bruce Arians was doing at times. Arians did a great job early on of setting up weird screens for his tight ends, which is something the Texans couldn't handle. But Arians' obsession with giving the ball to "

   "comment":"Patrick Peterson to look like a receiver. The second was thrown right to Marcus Cooper. Winston then lost a fumble when he was once again moving the ball well. The fumble wasn't his fault though, as Charles Sims' helmet knocked the ball loose. Sims was on the field because Doug Martin was lost with a hamstring. Winston threw 2 more interceptions, 1 of which came when the Buccaneers still had a chance to make a comeback. Down 20, the Buccaneers once again had a promising drive in the works, but Winston launched a high pass to Sims, which was tipped into the air. The ball fell right into Cooper's hands, and Cooper ran it back for a touchdown. Cooper replaced the woefully inept Brandon Williams at corner and was so much better. Winston finished 27-of-52 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown, 4 interceptions and a lost fumble. While the score was a nice 1 - it was a beautiful back-shoulder throw to Mike Evans, who was seeing coverage from Patrick Peterson - Winston's stat line could've been even worse than it was because the Cardinals dropped at least 3 more potential interceptions. One was thrown right to Peterson, who somehow couldn't come up with the turnover.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, really needed to rebound following the loss to New England last week. "
