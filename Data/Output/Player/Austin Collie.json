The second, which also infuriated Philly fans, was a penalty on the Eagles for a blow to the helmet on Manning that gave Indianapolis a first down in the fourth quarter. The call was legitimate; it's part of the rules. You can't have your quarterbacks getting hurt; if the NFL has guys like Manning, "

   "comment":"Collie took another vicious blow to the head on what was a legal hit. Collie was down for a few minutes, but eventually walked off and was diagnosed with yet another concussion. As this happened, the camera panned to the stands, where several female Colts fans were seen crying. Collie (8-87, 2 TDs) was greeting to a standing ovation when he made his first reception. He's a big part of the offense, and it's no surprise that Indianapolis struggled to move the chains after he left the game. At any rate, this was a 3-point battle until late in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately for all Jaguars bettors, an onside kick attempt went the other way for a back-breaking cover.    As noted, "

   "comment":"Collie down the sideline for a big gain just before halftime. Manning was 18-of-25 for 214 yards and a touchdown in the first half. Brady was just 9-of-15 for 144 yards in the first half. Manning helped the Broncos accumulate 270 net yards in the opening half. Brady restricted the Patriots to 119 net yards in the opening half. Manning achieved 6 first downs in the opening touchdown drive of the third quarter. Brady managed just 6 first downs in the entire opening half. Manning had a stretch in which he converted 19 of 20 passes. Brady didn't get the Patriots inside the Denver 18-yard line until there were 10 minutes remaining in the game. Manning went 32-of-43 for 400 yards (third-most in AFC Championship history) and 2 touchdowns. Brady finished 24-of-38 for 277 yards and only 1 touchdown.    Two things absolutely killed the Patriots' chances of winning this game, and I alluded to both already. The first was Brady's inaccuracy. He overthrew several of his targets. Had he hit them, New England may have been victorious. He was sharp in the fourth quarter, but only because he had the luxury of battling a prevent defense. The second was Talib's injury. Talib got hurt in last year's AFC Championship, which completely ruined Bill Belichick's defensive game plan. The same thing happened in this contest. The Patriots actually played Denver's offense pretty well until Talib went down. After that, New England couldn't get the Broncos off the field, as Manning continuously hit Demaryius Thomas, who led all receivers with 134 yards and a touchdown on 7 catches. Julius Thomas (8-85) also had a big game, though he dropped a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Eric Decker (5-73) and Wes Welker (4-38) came up with some clutch receptions as well.    The Broncos sustained some injuries as well, but most of the players who were banged up eventually came back onto the field. This, however, does not apply to Knowshon Moreno and cornerback Tony Carter, both of whom got hurt in the fourth quarter. Carter left with a concussion, while Moreno injured his chest. Moreno did run well, gaining 59 yards on 14 carries. Montee Ball (12-43) also pounded the ball effectively.    While Denver maintained a strong rushing attack, the Patriots couldn't do anything on the ground. LeGarrette Blount managed a mere 6 yards on 5 carries, while Stevan Ridley was only slightly better (5-17). Shane Vereen did the most; he had 34 rushing yards on 4 totes and also caught 5 balls for 59 receiving yards.    As for Brady's receivers, Danny Amendola, who dropped a pass, didn't log a single reception. It's amazing how much of a disappointment he has been. Meanwhile, Edelman tallied a game-high 10 catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he could've had a much bigger game had Brady hit him for a potential 56-yard score. Aside from Edelman and Vereen, Austin Collie was the only Patriot with more than 2 receptions (4-57).    Bill Belichick made a couple of curious coaching decisions. He passed on a 56-yard field goal in altitude at the beginning of the second quarter despite "
