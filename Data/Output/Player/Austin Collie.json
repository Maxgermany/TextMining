Coleman could have seriously injured Collie, and should absolutely be suspended. There's no room for this crap in the NFL. The second, which also infuriated Philly fans, was a penalty on the Eagles for a blow to the helmet on Manning that gave Indianapolis a first down in the 4.h quarter. The call was legitimate; it's part of the rules. You can't have your quarterbacks getting hurt; if the NFL has guys like Manning, "

As this happened, the camera panned to the stands, where several female Colts fans were seen crying. Collie (8-87, 2 TDs) was greeting to a standing ovation when he made his first reception. He's a big part of the offense, and it's no surprise that Indianapolis struggled to move the chains after he left the game. At any rate, this was a 3.point battle until late in the 4.h quarter. Unfortunately for all Jaguars bettors, an onside kick attempt went the other way for a back-breaking cover.    As noted, "
