The clock expired. Again, they had no timeouts left. Pat Shurmur is a freaking idiot. Fortunately, as I mentioned, the Browns eventually covered when Wallace (19-33, 147 yards, TD, INT) found "

That's because Andy Dalton was erratic all afternoon, going 22-of-44 for 232 yards. He should have been picked off a couple of times.
