   "comment":"Tulloch tipped the ball to himself and secured a huge interception for Detroit. The Lions made Romo pay and took the lead. Some good passes from Stafford to Johnson and hard runs by Best, moved the ball inside the 5-yard line. Stafford finished the drive with a fade pass to Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown toss. Romo didn't have a comeback in him, and Detroit improved to 4-0 for the first time since 1980. Dallas fell to 2-2.    Stafford ended the game 21-of-43 for 240 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Johnson had 8 receptions for 96 yards and 2 scores. Pettigrew caught 6 for 64. Best ran for 47 yards on 11 carries.    Robinson led the Cowboys in receiving with 7 receptions for 116 yards. Witten had 7 catches for 94 yards with 1 score, while Bryant had 3 catches for 37 yards and 2 scores. Jones ran for 57 yards on 16 carries.    For the game, Romo finished 34-of-47 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Lions could not have made their comeback win without Romo's 2 pick-sixes and final interception. It was a terrible meltdown performance from the Cowboys signal-caller. Romo turns 32 next April, so next offseason may be time for Dallas to think of the long-term future at the position. His performance against the Lions and Jets this season have to make them start pondering that.   "
