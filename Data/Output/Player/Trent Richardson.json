   "comment":"Richardson, who had been gashing the Giants all afternoon (17 carries, 81 yards). Instead, Brandon Weeden attempted a weird throw off his back foot. It was picked off. A couple of plays later, the Giants scored a touchdown and tied the game. If that wasn't bad enough, Joshua Cribbs fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Wasting no time, Eli Manning hit Victor Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7.point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible. His final numbers look decent - 22-of-35, 291 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks - but most of the yardage, save for a 62-yard touchdown bomb to "

   "comment":"Richardson the appropriate workload. Richardson carried the ball just 18 times despite the fact that his team either led or trailed by only 1 point until midway through the 4.h quarter. Richardson also had 5 catches for 21 receiving yards, but 23 touches are simply not enough. With Josh Gordon out, Richardson was the only play-maker on the squad. He needs to have the ball in his hands around 30 times every single week. It's just unbelievable that 2 brilliant offensive minds in Rob Chudzinski and Norv Turner can't figure this out.    While Richardson had just 18 carries, "

   "comment":"Richardson in an apparent attempt to tank for Teddy Bridgewater - go here for my - but instead, he found a franchise quarterback who already happened to be on his roster. Brian Hoyer is the future of the Cleveland Browns! OK, maybe I'm exaggerating just a bit, but Brian Hoyer seriously did look a billion times better than Brandon Weeden. Of course, it helped that Hoyer actually had a legitimate No. 1 receiver to throw to. Josh Gordon, returning from his 2.game suspension, caught 10 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown. He was an absolute monster, and the Vikings had no answer for him. Perhaps this means that Lombardi will sell high on Gordon and deal him to a team desperate for a receiver like the Patriots. Perhaps he can obtain a second-rounder for him. Gordon's inevitable departure will hurt Hoyer, but the former New England quarterback is solid for now. He went 30-of-54 for 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Hoyer became the first Cleveland quarterback to throw 3 scores in a single game since Brady Quinn in December 2009. One of his picks wasn't his fault, as it was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted deep inside Minnesota territory.    The Browns predictably couldn't run the ball without Richardson. They signed "

Brown was OK, gaining 54 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Richardson wasted 5 attempts for 19 yards. Eleven of those 19 yards came on a third-and-20, so they were meaningless.    Luck didn't play well, but Ryan Fitzpatrick was worse. Fitzpatrick, who performed well against the Colts 2 weeks ago, struggled with turnovers. He was guilty of 3 interceptions and a lost fumble in field-goal range, negating his decent stats: 21-of-37, 201 passing yards, 54 rushing yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Fitzpatrick's picks were careless. Whenever he sensed any sort of pressure, it looked like he thought, Ah f*** it, I'm just going to bomb it downfield. For a smart, Harvard man, Fitzpatrick can play very stupidly sometimes. Fitzpatrick's lone aerial score was a flip to "

   "comment":"Richardson continued to play like a bum, gaining 20 yards on 6 carries (though he did have 5 catches for 68 receiving yards). Darrius Heyward-Bey, meanwhile, committed yet another big drop that would've moved the chains on third down, making me wonder why he was still on the field. The Indianapolis coaching staff apparently agreed, as it utilized undrafted rookie Da'Rick Rogers heavily in the second half. Rogers responded well, showing so much more play-making ability than Heyward-Bey ever did. Rogers led the team ith 6 grabs for 107 yards and 2 touchdowns. Some of this production was the result of poor tackling, but the former Tennessee Vol was impressive nonetheless. He could have a bright future ahead of him if he continues to stay out of trouble, as he's donethis year.    As for the winners, Andy Dalton couldn't be stopped, particularly in the second half when he misfired on just 4 of 16 attempts. He ultimately finished 24-of-35 for 275 yards and 3 passing touchdowns and a rushing scamper into the end zone. Dalton's scores went to A.J. Green (6-72), Marvin Jones (3-60) and Jermaine Gresham (5-41). The Colts opted not to shadow Green with Vontae Davis, but it ultimately didn't matter because Jones torched Davis for his touchdown.    Though BenJarvus Green-Ellis was outgained by Giovani Bernard by a wide margin (99-48), he was able to find the end zone twice. One score was highly controversial. Green-Ellis was tackled short of the goal line on a 4.h-down try before crossing the goal line on the ground. The play was reviewed and overturned, with official Jeff Triplette stating that Green-Ellis wasn't touched. Both CBS announcers were irate about this, as they believed it was clear that nose tackle Josh Chapman tripped the runner.    I mentioned Bernard's 99 rushing yards. He did this on just 12 carries, and he also had 4 catches for 49 receiving yards. I don't understand why Green-Ellis continues to get more touches than the explosive rookie.    Some Indianapolis stats: - LaVon Brazill had Luck's other 2 touchdowns. He caught 3 balls for 53 yards. - Coby Fleener (5-31) and T.Y. Hilton (2-7) disappointed their fantasy owners. - Donald Brown, despite being named the starter over Richardson, had just 4 carries for 11 yards.   "

Antoine Beatha had a big return to set up a field goal, making this a 3.score affair at halftime. Indianapolis never looked back. This was a nice win, but the Colts sustained a number of injuries: Vontae Davis (groin), Aubrayo Franklin (knee) and Bjoern Werner (ankle) were all knocked out.    Here are some key stats/notes: - Andrew Luck went 26-of-37 (including a perfect 6-of-6 in the second half) for 282 yards and a touchdown. He should've had a second score, but Griff Whalen dropped the ball in the end zone. On the flip side, Luck was fortunate to get away with an interception in the red zone. - Whalen ultimately found the end zone, as he was 1 of 2 Colts who logged more than a couple of receptions (4-32). The other was T.Y. Hilton, who had a huge game with 11 catches for 155 yards. - Both Indianapolis backs scored, as mentioned, though Brown (12-31) and Richardson (8-25) were both limited in terms of yardage. - Henne racked up garbage yardage, finishing 30-of-51 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. It must be noted that Henne had just 107 yards by halftime. - Jones-Drew, who fumbled, had just 39 rushing yards on 13 carries, but did catch 5 balls for 51 receiving yards.

   "comment":"Richardson scored on the next play. The Colts were eventually up 24-0, and by the end of the first quarter, they had outgained Houston, 218-2. The Texans were averaging just 0.2 yards per play and looked so incredibly pathetic. And then, something happened. The light switch flipped on, and Houston suddenly began playing well, as it seemingly got a spark when the Colts had an illegal formation on a field goal attempt that ultimately led to a Texan touchdown. Arian Foster picked up big chunks on the ground, Ryan Fitzpatrick actually completed some passes, while J.J. Watt dominated the line of scrimmage on the other side of the ball. Watt was an animal, finishing with 7 tackles, 2 sacks, several passes batted down and a fumble recovery for a touchdown that finally put the game in reach for the Texans. Watt, who is the first player in the NFL since 1961 to have a receiving touchdown, a pick-six and a fumble returned for a score in the same season - and it's only Week 6 - cut the deficit to 5. Houston had 2 possessions after that to potentially come away with a victory, but simply couldn't make it happen. Andre Johnson screwed up the first time, getting called for offensive pass interference and then losing a fumble. The second drive ended quickly, as former first-rounder Bjoern Werner strip-sacked Fitzpatrick. The Colts recovered, clinching a victory.    Both Andrew Luck and Watt didn't disappoint in their latest of many epic battles to come. Watt, as mentioned, was awesome, but Luck was a bit better. The former No. 1 pick generated 300-plus yards for the 4.h-straight contest, going 25-of-44 for 370 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped by Jared Crick. Luck's performance was exemplary, especially considering that he was dealing with 2 backup guards and a center making his second career start. The center screwed up on 1 play, snapping the ball before Luck was ready. This was when Watt scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown. Luck targeted T.Y. Hilton early and often. The speedy wideout hauled in all 9 of the passes thrown his way for a whopping 223 yards and a touchdown. His yardage total was just 1 shy of Hall of Famer Raymond Berry's single-game record for the Colts. Dwayne Allen (3-49) and Reggie Wayne (4-35) were next on the receiving list.    I'm a bit perplexed about Indianapolis' decision to feature Trent Richardson more than Ahmad Bradshaw once again."
