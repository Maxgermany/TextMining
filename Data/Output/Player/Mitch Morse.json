   "comment":"Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles. Darren Sproles (10-48) was next, followed by Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is.
