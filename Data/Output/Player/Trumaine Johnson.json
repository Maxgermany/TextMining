   "comment":"Trumaine Johnson blanket him. This was unusual for Gregg Williams' defense, but it worked perfectly. Johnson, 1 of the top cornerbacks in the NFL, smothered Megatron. With poor protection and no top option at his disposal, Stafford struggled. His final numbers look good - he went 30-of-46 for 245 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but much of that came in garbage time. By halftime, Stafford was 12-of-17 for 99 yards and a pick-six, which was a telegraphed ball to Megatron that Johnson picked off.    Megatron, who couldn't get open whatsoever against Johnson, caught just 1 of the 5 targets thrown to him for 16 yards. He was guilty of a brutal drop as well. "

   "comment":"Trumaine Johnson dropped an interception, and that ended up costing the Rams because Dallas found the end zone shortly later. On the next possession, Alfred Morris burst for a 70-yard gain, setting up an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown run. This put the Cowboys up 17-6, and the game was effectively over. </i> This was the mindset everyone had when Dallas established an 11-point lead in the early going. On Twitter, I saw that 1 Cowboy beat writer said that the game was over, and it certainly appeared that way. It seemed like this would be a blowout. Instead, the Rams made some adjustments and were able to dominate on the defensive side of the ball in the second half. They were so much better on first down, as the Cowboys had to constantly operate in long-yardage situations. Meanwhile, Jared Goff continued to show major growth. He had some instances where he back-peddled and threw some bad passes as a result, but he was mostly on point, leading the Rams to a comeback and a surprise upset victory.    Goff was mostly excellent, going 21-of-36 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a huge third-and-11 deep in his own territory. He didn't face much resistance, as Dallas was missing Pro Bowl linebacker Sean Lee, but this was still a monumental improvement over how he looked last year. Sean McVay and Greg Olson have worked wonders with him.    As good as Goff was, Todd Gurley was the star of the show. Gurley not only rushed for 121 yards on 23 carries - which included a trademark hurdle of his - but he also led the team in receiving, catching 7 balls for 94 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gurley is a monster and happens to be rejuvenated by the upgrades the Rams have made to their offensive line.    Following Gurley, Cooper Kupp was next on the receiving chart with 5 rabs for 60 yards and a touchdown. Interestingly, Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because Ronald Leary departed for Denver. The mainstays aren't performing up to their abilities either.    Prescott finished 20-of-36 for 252 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because his elbow was hit as he released the ball. However, Prescott's stat line could've been far worse. The Rams dropped 2 possible picks of his, as Kayvon Webster repeated Johnson's earlier mistake. Prescott also had Bryant open for a potential reception in the second half, but missed him.    Speaking of Bryant, he caught just 5 of his 13 targets for 98 yards, as Trumaine Johnson did a good job in coverage. Aside from Bryant and Elliott, no Cowboy accumulated more than 34 receiving yards.
