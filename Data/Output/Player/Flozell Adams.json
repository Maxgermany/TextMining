   "comment":"Flozell Adams suffered an injury in the second quarter. This prompted Mr. Turkey Neck and Jason Garrett to come up with the brilliant idea of having Jason Witten block Jared Allen. Meanwhile, Marc Colombo was beaten like a Tom Cable spouse (yes, I used that joke again), by Ray Edwards, who totaled 3 sacks. And speaking of Mr. Turkey Neck, check out this quote after the game: We throw an interception, we miss a field goal, I think we were playing pretty good. I can't believe I bet on Mr. Turkey Neck in a playoff game. How dumb was that move on my part? I'll have more of Phillips' moronic quotes in my <b> </b>.    I guess there was a team that won this game, and that would be the Vikings, who finished the year a perfect 9-0 at home. Brett Favre was a bit shaky at the beginning of the contest, but finished strong (15-24, 234 yards, 4 TDs). Favre took a sack on the fist drive, but was sacked only once after that.    Sidney Rice was amazing, catching 6 balls for 141 yards and 3 touchdowns. On his first score, Rice beat Gerald Sensabaugh for a 47-yard gain on a play where Sensabaugh could have at least broken up the pass had he turned around.    As mentioned, all of Dallas' mental errors had a lot to do with the Vikings' blowout, but the raucous crowd played a huge factor. Though the Cowboys won in New Orleans back in Week 15, they just seemed completely disoriented by all of the noise. But as Emmitt would say, What come around sometime come around again or sometime it do not come around again, but usually it do come around. The point is, the Vikings will experience exactly what Dallas went through next week in the Superdome.   "
