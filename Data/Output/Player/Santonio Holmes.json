   "comment":"Holmes caught a pass from Ben Roethlisberger on third down with 45 seconds remaining in regulation. His feet were in the end zone, but the ball never crossed the end line. It was ruled 4.h down. The replay booth called for a review. After looking at por... I mean the replay for 2 minutes, official Walt Coleman ruled that it was a touchdown. Now, there's no question that the ball never crossed the plane. The disturbing thing is that Coleman never mentioned that. He simply said that both of Holmes' feet were in the end zone, making it a touchdown. If you're missing the point here, Coleman clearly didn't know the rules! Maybe he should go hang out with Donovan McNabb. This is really embarrassing for the league.    Moving on, I picked the Steelers to win this game for a grand total of zero units because they just seem to pull victories out of their rear end. Well, chalk another 1 up. This was an evenly matched contest, but Pittsburgh came out on top once again.    Credit Roethlisberger for engineering the decisive, 12-play, 92-yard drive in 2:53. Big Ben finished 22-of-40 for 246 yards and a touchdown.    Though Holmes caught the game-winning touchdown, "

   "comment":"Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker "
