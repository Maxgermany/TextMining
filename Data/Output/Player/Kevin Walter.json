   "comment":"Kevin Walter, Kubiak decided that giving the ball to Brown, a talent-less, second-string running back who probably couldn't make the roster for half the teams in the league, was his best option. Predictably, Brown was stuffed at the goal line. Five units down the drain.    The Texans were shut out in the first half, but mounted a tremendous 21-point comeback. Matt Schaub was brilliant for the most part, going 35-of-50 for 371 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unfortunately, Schaub made 2 horrible mistakes in this contest. The first was a pick-six when the game was tied 21-21 in the 4.h quarter. The second was an errant pass to Joel Dreessen the play prior to Kubiak's blunderous call. Schaub had Dreessen open in the back of the end zone, but overthrew him. Dreessen caught the ball, but could only get 1 foot inbounds.    Andre Johnson caught 8 balls for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns. Owen Daniels also had 8 grabs for 94 yards. Kevin Walter notched 4 receptions for 37 yards.    As many predicted, Steve Slaton didn't have much running room to work with. He had 39 yards on 13 carries. Slaton saved his fantasy owners with 6 receptions for 59 more yards.    As for the Cardinals, "

Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, "
