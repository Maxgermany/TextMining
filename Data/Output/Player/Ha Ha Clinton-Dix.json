Instead, the ball went right over his head and into the hands of Luke Willson. Had Clinton-Dix made the pick, Mason Crosby's 48-yard field goal at the end of regulaton would've clinched a trip to the Super Bowl for the Packers. - On Green Bay's game-tying drive, McCarthy opted not to call any timeouts. Time trickled off the clock, and Green Bay never really had an opportunity to score the go-ahead touchdown.    It would be a mistake to concentrate on the Packers exclusively, given how awesome Wilson was at the very end. Wilson, at 1 point, was 2-of-9 for only 13 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. Green Bay smothered him, as "

He did not get a pass off until he was getting hit. As a result, he overthrew Jack Doyle on the play and Clinton-Dix again was the beneficiary. Luck would have been better off taking the sack or lofting it out of bounds. He needs to improve his decision-making if he wants to be a truly elite quarterback.    For most of the day, Luck relied on 3 receivers to do a brunt of the work. "
