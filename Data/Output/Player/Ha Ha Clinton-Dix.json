   "comment":"Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to come over and get under the ball. The second pick came on a throw that should never have happened. Luck had quite a bit of time to throw before he was put under pressure. He did not get a pass off until he was getting hit. As a result, he overthrew Jack Doyle on the play and Clinton-Dix again was the beneficiary. Luck would have been better off taking the sack or lofting it out of bounds. He needs to improve his decision-making if he wants to be a truly elite quarterback.    For most of the day, Luck relied on 3 receivers to do a brunt of the work. T.Y. Hilton (6-81) led the team in both catches and yardage. The speedy top option is still not at full health as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Still, his big-play ability makes him a high-upside WR1 week in and week out in fantasy. After Hilton, Jack Doyle (5-61) and Donte Moncrief (3-55, 1 TD) were the major producers. Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9. and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.    In terms of the running game, Frank Gore was surprisingly strong. The Packers boast 1 of the league's best run defenses, but the 12-year veteran was able to do well on Sunday. Gore's numbers do not look great on paper - he had 19 carries for 60 yards - but he was elusive, shifty and able to make plays against Green Bay's defense. Also, Gore had 2 touchdown runs that helped to drive the Colts' offense. The first touchdown was a result of impressive blocking from the line on a pitch play. Gore was able to walk in untouched. On the second, he plowed through the offensive line and some Packers defenders to reach the end zone. It will definitely be interesting to see if Gore continues to be a red-zone threat for Indianapolis, especially given Andrew Luck's trouble with turnovers of late.    The Colts really started the game off on the right foot when Jordan Todman had a huge kick-return touchdown. He took the opening kick back 99 yards for the score. Todman looked explosive and was able to follow the blocking. He had another big return on a kick later in the game. Perhaps Indianapolis should consider giving him some carries, since the team does not have much behind Gore.    For the Packers, this was yet another disappointing loss. Aaron Rodgers was able to rally Green Bay late, but he could not do enough to carry the team. Rodgers' stat line is a little bit deceiving. He went 26-of-43 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. Two of the touchdowns came in the 4.h quarter, however, and Rodgers had some issues getting the offense moving early. His throws were not bad. Rather, he could not find an open receiver against the Colts' defense. Rodgers was able to move around the pocket effectively as the contest went on, and that really helped him out. Once he did that, the Colts had more trouble following the receivers and Rodgers was able to hit the open man. The performance was not as good as the 1 he had last week against the Falcons, but his play late could have won the game for Green Bay.    Rodgers spread the ball around a fair amount on Sunday. Jordy Nelson (7-94, 1 TD) and Richard Rodgers (6-64) led the team in receiving. Nelson looked solid for the second straight week, and it appears that the veteran is finally healthy. He made a beautiful catch on a long pass on what was a free play, and that was how he scored his touchdown. Rodgers, meanwhile, was solid but unspectacular. He is too inconsistent of an option for most fantasy leagues. Davante Adams (4-41, 1 TD) came on late, catching a 40 yard pass and a short touchdown on the team's final scoring drive. He has really done a good job of fixing his issues with drops, and is far more consistent as a result. Randall Cobb (2-14, 1 TD) played sparingly as he continues to recover from an injury. When healthy, he can be considered a WR2 in most formats.    One frustrating part of today's game was the usage of Ty Montgomery. In the first half, the dual-threat player only had 4 carries. He had a big burst on the opening play, where he slipped through the offensive line and followed his blockers for a big gain, but he was not used for a while afterward. The team insisted on giving Don Jackson carries. He only managed 8 yards on 4 attempts. Montgomery was able to rush for 53 yards on 7 carries and caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He caught a screen pass late where he ducked away from defenders, and that is where many of his receiving yards came from. Moving forward, the team should give him a few more touches each week. Granted, Montgomery may not be able to handle a full workload, but he is a greatly talented player. The more touches he gets, the better the offense will be.    Final Note: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was very strong in today's game. In addition to the 2 picks, he notched half of a sack on a blitz. He continues to develop into 1 of the better safeties in the league.
