Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line.

   "comment":"Moore (2-53). The other score went to Jimmy Graham (6-29). Marques Colston led the team in receiving with 4 catches for 69 yards, but couldn't find the end zone.    Mark Ingram once again had more carries than Chris Ivory (8-37) and Pierre Thomas (5-30). He gained 67 yards and a touchdown on just 12 carries. As he ran into the end zone, he was flagged for a taunting penalty. The Saints were actually whistled for 11 infractions, which makes me wonder how lopsided this could have been had they taken Oakland completely seriously.    Palmer had a solid fantasy day, going 22-of-40 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned couple of picks. His scores went to Brandon Myers (6-55) and Juron Criner (3-23).    Marcel Reece was the Raiders' most effective offensive player. Not only did he rush for 103 yards on just 19 carries, but he led the team in receiving, snagging 4 balls for 90 yards. His only blemish was getting stuffed at the goal line in the first half.    On the other end of the spectrum, Denarius Moore was a major disappointment with just a mere 9-yard catch. "

Wheaton dropped a pass, which was followed by Roethlisberger completely missing an open Wheaton with no pressure on his face. On 4.h down, a Roethlisberger-to-Wheaton attempt fell incomplete because Wheaton wasn't even looking for the football.    Roethlisberger had an awful afternoon, going 21-of-42 for 228 yards, 1 touchdown (in garbage time to Moore) and an interception, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Much of his yardage came in meaningless action. Roethlisberger has awful chemistry issues with all of his receivers not named "
