   "comment":"Lawrence burned Joe Staley for a strip-sack that the Cowboys recovered to maintain their 17-point lead going into halftime. Dallas blew the game open in the third quarter when Elliott caught a screen pass and exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. The Cowboys added another drive with Prescott scrambling ahead for a short touchdown run. At the end of the third quarter, Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith came on a blitz to strip-sack Beathard, and Dallas recovered the loose ball. Shortly later, Dez Bryant made a leaping touchdown catch in the back of the end zone. That score tied Bob Hayes for the most touchdown receptions in Dallas Cowboys history.    Prescott was 16-of-25 for 234 yards with 3 touchdown through the air. He ran for 26 yards on 4 carries with a score. Bryant (7-63-1) and Witten (4-54-1) led Dallas through the air.    Elliott had his best game of the season, running for 147 yards on 26 carries with 2 touchdowns. He also added that 72-yard touchdown reception.    Beathard was 22-of-38 for 235 yards in his first NFL start. Hyde ran for 68 yards on 14 carries with 4 catches for 20 yards.    Defensively, Dallas defensive ends David Irving and Demarcus Lawrence played well. The 49ers' defense, meanwhile, was embarrassed, as they couldn't stop the Cowboys. To make matters worse, rookie first-round pick "
