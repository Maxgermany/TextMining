   "comment":"Jahvid Best also fumbled to give the Packers a possession inside Detroit's 20-yard line, which led to a touchdown.    Aaron Rodgers had an incredible first half, going 8-of-9 for 131 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, he was just 4-of-8 for 50 yards and 2 picks after intermission. Rodgers simply couldn't get into a rhythm, as it seemed like Detroit had possession of the football for the entire second half.    Rodgers' touchdowns went to Donald Driver (3-89), Jermichael Finley (4-36) and Greg Jennings (2-25). He has great downfield weapons at his disposal, but still no semblance of a running game; John Kuhn and Brandon Jackson each had 9 carries for 39 and 33 yards, respectively. The Packers need to trade for Marshawn Lynch.    Shaun Hill is a fantasy monster. He went 34-of-54 for 331 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 picks (1 of which wasn't his fault; his receiver fell down). Hill also had a 40-yard run. Hill's 2 scores went to Calvin Johnson, who had 6 grabs for 86 yards and 2 scores. So much for Charles Woodson slowing him down.    Detroit's tight ends, Brandon Pettigrew (8-91) and Tony Scheffler (6-63) were Hill's primary targets aside from Megatron.    Jahvid Best rushed for just 12 carries for 50 yards because Detroit was down early. However, he helped his PPR owners out with 4 catches for 34 receiving yards.   "
