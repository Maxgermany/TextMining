  "comment":"Tre Mason then ran the ball into the end zone for the score. The Rams quickly got the ball back, and Benny Cunningham ripped off a 40-yard run. That set up 1 more field goal, and St. Louis took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bruce Ellington got open running deep and Blaine Gabbert hit him for 44 yards. The 49ers settled for another Phil Dawson field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, Case Keenum moved the ball across midfield with a completion to Britt for 18 yards. However, Dontae Johnson blocked a 48-yard field goal to keep the 49ers alive. San Francisco took advantage with a 15-yard pass to Torrey Smith, a roughing the passer penalty, and a 33-yard screen to Quinton Patton. That set up a short field goal for Phil Dawson to mercifully end this game.    Blaine Gabbert was 28-of-44 for 354 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. He didn't play poorly, but he spent most of the afternoon checking the ball down.    DuJuan Harris had a nice game for the 49ers with 67 yards on 16 carries and 86 yards on 8 receptions. Torrey Smith (5-61) and Boldin (5-71-1) led San Francisco's receivers.    Case Keenum was 22-of-37 for 231 yards. Kenny Britt led the St. Louis receivers with 3 catches for 81 yards.    Tre Mason, starting for Gurley, totaled 44 yards on 18 carries with a score.    The 49ers' defense received nice games from ",
