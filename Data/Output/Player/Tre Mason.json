They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball. They nearly had some picks themselves, but the Cardinals couldn't convert either. Shaun Hill, meanwhile, was an abomination. He went 20-of-39 for 229 yards and an interception on the final play of the game. That pick wasn't his fault, but as mentioned, he could've had several others. He had so many inaccurate passes, including at the very end, when he overthrew Stedman Bailey for a first down, and he went on a streak in which he completed just 5 of 14 attempts. St. Louis had 5 consecutive 3.and-outs in the second half.    Tre Mason was a huge disappointment. He wasn't expected to have a strong outing against the Cardinals' ferocious run defense, but he had just 2 quality runs, gaining 33 yards on 13 carries. The fumble hurt, as it gave Arizona 3 points and ultimately forced the Rams to kick a field goal on the 1-yard line; they could've gone for it to take a 10-9 advantage, otherwise.    Another player who really struggled was "

Gurley will have a larger role going forward, so he's a buy-low option right now.    While Gurley is a buy-low, Kenny Britt is a sell-high. Britt secured 7 balls for 102 yards, but this is going to go down as 1 of his top performances of the season. Britt is a lethargic bum who can't be counted on, but he was robbed of a key reception at the very end of the game. Britt made a great grab to move the chains on St. Louis' final drive. His forearm was definitely under the ball, yet the incompetent officials somehow overturned it to the surprise of the 2 CBS announcers. I'd say this ended up costing the Rams a victory, but that would be a lie; I'm not sure their inept offense could've achieved another first down after that.    Aside from Britt, only 1 other Ram collected more than 18 receiving yards. That would be Tavon Austin, whose 5 receptions went for 38 yards. He should be ignored in fantasy. Lance Kendricks (2-12) was guilty of 2 key drops, 1 of which would've set up the Rams with a first down at the Pittsburgh 15-yard line.    Kendricks wasn't the only Ram making mistakes. Just take a look at St. Louis' sole red-zone sequence, which occurred early in the 4.h quarter: - Tre Mason given a carry, blown up in the backfield. - "
