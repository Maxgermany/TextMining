The Bears had 8. - Minnesota converted 12-of-18 third downs. Chicago was 2-of-8. - The Vikings out-gained the Bears, 537-169. - Minnesota won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 22 minutes!    Brett Favre was 32-of-48 for 392 yards and 3 touchdowns. His scores went to Percy Harvin (6 catches, 101 yards), Visanthe Shiancoe (5-51) and Chester Taylor (6-51). Sidney Rice and Bernard Berrian didn't get into the end zone, but both had solid games, catching 6 balls each for 89 and 74 yards, respectively.    The only good thing the Bears did in this contest was hold Adrian Peterson in check. They limited him to 85 yards and a score on 25 carries. Peterson also fumbled twice.    Horrible numbers for Chicago, as you would imagine. Jay Cutler was 18-of-23 for 147 yards and a touchdown, but also tossed 2 interceptions. One of them wasn't his fault (tipped ball).    "

Cutler was surprisingly careful with the football in Toronto, going 17-of-30 for 188 yards and 2 touchdowns. Cutler took 1 sack, which was actually a fumble recovered by Buffalo. So maybe Canada isn't perfect, but it's pretty close.    The Bears scored 3 touchdowns, but none of the players who found the end zone have any sort of fantasy relevance. "

Green Bay gave him plenty of opportunities with mistakes of its own, but Cutler simply couldn't take advantage of them, leading his team to 190 total net yards and converting a pitiful 0-of-9 on third downs. Cutler went just 12-of-21 for 135 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That means in 8 games versus the Packers, he's 127-of-237 for 1,518 yards, 8 touchdowns and a whopping 18 interceptions. That gives him a completion percentage of 53.6 and a YPA of 6.4. You can't put this all on Cutler though. It's not even close to being all of his fault. There are 2 issues with Chicago's offense, 1 of which is the offensive line. The group once again couldn't block for him, allowing 4 sacks, 1 of which came when Green Bay rushed only TWO players! "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler interception in the end zone that was tipped twice and fell into the arms of Kevin Williams. Christian Ponder was horrendous prior to halftime. He was 6-of-14 for 81 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly pick-six by the time the intermission rolled around. I thought there was a chance Matt Cassel would open as the starter in the third quarter, but the coaching staff stuck with Ponder, who inexplicably caught fire. He was 10-of-16 for 146 yards after the break.    Adrian Peterson, who said his goal was to rush for 2,500 yards this season, hasn't been very impressive in the early going. He failed to reach the century plateau in the opener, and just barely got there in this contest. He gained 100 yards on 26 carries, though he lost 13 yards on a ridiculous Chris Johnson-type attempt in which he ran backward for some reason. It's clear that Peterson misses his stud fullback Jerome Felton, who will be back from suspension in Week 4.    Ponder's sole touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (3-42), as expected. Greg Jennings had an OK outing, hauling in 5 grabs for 84 yards. Jerome Simpson predictably disappointed (2-49) after his awesome season debut. He's the 2013 version of Kevin Ogletree.    The Bears were able to overcome fluky Minnesota touchdowns and late Ponder precision passing, thanks to a 66-yard, game-winning drive, capped off with a Martellus Bennett score. Jay Cutler was extremely sharp, going 28-of-39 for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. As mentioned, 1 of his picks wasn't his fault because it was tipped twice into the air.    Cutler tossed 2 scores to Bennett (7-76), while the other 1 went to "

He went 15-of-24 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that came at the very end on a Hail Mary. Cutler has choked versus Green Bay in the past, but this loss certainly wasn't his fault. His usually reliable weapons had a hand in this defeat. "

One of the picks was terrible, as he heaved it late across his body. Cutler always seems to have at least 1 of these #yolo throws every game, and it usually doesn't turn out well. It's disappointing that he hasn't learned his lesson yet. To be fair, Cutler had some issues with pass protection. He also missed "

Despite the victory, Chicago didn't get off to a good start. Cutler lost a fumble early on and then proceeded to yell at the refs about it, drawing an unsportsmanlike penalty. The Vikings appeared to recover, but the officials strangely ruled that they took too long to pounce on the football and thus weren't awarded possession.

   "comment":"Jay Cutler completely lacks. Marc Trestman should've made the change earlier.    The Lions clinched a playoff spot on Saturday night with the Eagles loss to the Redskins, so this was a tune-up for Detroit with seeding and playoff positioning on the line. The Lions played a sloppy game filled with bone-headed penalties, blowing great opportunities for points and taking cheap shots at the opposition. It was a throwback game, as Detroit played like it did during the Jim Schwartz era, but against an overmatched Bears team, the Lions had too much talent to lose on the road.    The Lions got a scoring drive going midway through the first quarter. They converted a 4.h-and-5 with a screen pass to "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler and company. The Bears were guilty of 3 turnovers, yet the Raiders couldn't maintain possessions, controlling the ball for less time than Chicago despite having all of those extra drives.    Derek Carr went 20-of-33 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault (more on that later). He looked good early, lofting a beautiful score to Amari Cooper, but he converted just 9 of his 19 attempts in the second half. That's not good news, especially considering the level of his competition in this matchup. To be fair, Carr appeared to have a touchdown to Seth Roberts late in the game, but Roberts' second foot was barely out of bounds.    Cooper snagged 4 balls for 49 yards and a score, as mentioned. However, he dropped a pass and didn't do anything after intermission. Michael Crabtree led the team in receiving with 5 catches for 80 yards. Crabtree appeared to suffer an injury while blocking for Cooper in the first half, but he turned out to be fine after missing the second quarter.    It was surprising to see Latavius Murray struggle to run the ball. He managed just 49 yards on 16 attempts. Making matters worse for his fantasy owners, he was benched after he both bobbled a pass that resulted in Carr's pick and dropped a pitch that turned out to be a fumble. Sitting him was not wise despite the 2 errors, as he's the best running back on the roster by a mile.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler put together a great, game-winning drive, but before that, it appeared as though he was trying his best to give this victory away. He was nearly picked on a tipped pass early, and then he actually tossed an interception to "

Mallett, who is likely to be permanently benched, barring injury, doesn't have much of an NFL future.    Hoyer did well overall. He went 24-of-31 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception.

   "comment":"Jay Cutler has played brilliantly under Adam Gase, but he didn't have his best performance in this contest. The Cutler of old appeared to surface at times, as he was guilty of 2 turnovers in this contest. One was a fumble on a strip-sack that almost could've been ruled a pick. The other was an ugly interception that he foolishly forced into tight coverage. However, Cutler had some bright moments as well, repeatedly leading his team down the field on impressive drives in the 4.h quarter. The possessions were ultimately spoiled, though the final 1 ended when the Bears couldn't convert on a 2.point try. Cutler finished 18-of-32 for 265 yards and the 2 turnovers. Not included in those numbers are 2 deep pass interference penalties that "

Manning didn't have much time to throw, but when he did, he often stared down his receivers like a leering drunk, allowing the Vikings to jump the routes of his horrible receivers. One interception was returned for 6. while another nearly went back all the way, but the defender stepped out at the Giants' 4-yard line. Manning finished 15-of-29 for 234 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the 3 picks. Most of those numbers were bogus, however, as Manning was just 8-of-18 for 98 yards and 3 interceptions before the game got out of hand. Manning also was credited with a fumble when he botched a shotgun snap on a third down.    The stats show that "

Once Roethlisberger was forced to throw, his offensive line couldn't contain Philadelphia's front line and he was constantly running for his life. The Eagles sacked him 4 times and hurried him multiple times. Roethlisberger had thrown for 3 touchdowns in each of his first 2 games this season before running into the Eagles.    Eagles rookie quarterback Carson Wentz continued his stellar play on Sunday, spreading the ball around well as he hit receivers from multiple angles. His pocket awareness was superb, as he moved his team with ease on almost every drive. The offensive line held the Steelers to no sacks, and the offense had the Steelers on their heels at all times. Now 3 games into his rookie season, Wentz has now thrown 102 passes with no interceptions. He's good at football. Wentz completed 23-of-31 passes for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. His numbers would have been even better if it weren't for the Eagles defense, which stifled the Steelers at every point, which helped the Eagles create a big enough lead to run the ball in the 4.h quarter.

His first game back, a Monday night victory over the Vikings, was a good start, but his second performance was a complete flop. This performance detailed everything wrong with Cutler. His accuracy and mechanics were lacking in this contest, as he immediately began with an interception toward "

It seemed like the Falcons were going to be able to coast to an easy victory, but they began looking ahead to next week's battle against the Patriots too early. The Dolphins rallied, outscoring Atlanta 20-0 in the second half to pull the upset as massive 13-point underdogs. While everything went wrong for the Dolphins in the opening half, the complete opposite occurred following intermission. For instance, the Dolphins, down 17-7, were able to get a third-down conversion because of a pass interference. Cutler then tossed another pick, but a horribly blatant roughing-the-passer penalty nullified the turnover. All of this allowed Miami to score to trim the margin to a 1.score game.

Matt Moore, who was not much of a downgrade from Ryan Tannehill last year, stepped in, and he promptly threw an interception when he forced a throw into coverage. Moore, however, managed to rebound and put together a couple of scoring drives to tie the game. It appeared as though the teams would be headed to overtime, but Josh McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    "
