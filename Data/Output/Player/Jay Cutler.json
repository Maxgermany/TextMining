   "comment":"Jay Cutler threw interceptions, and the Vikings dominated in almost every statistical category. Some examples: - The Vikings had 31 first downs. The Bears had 8. - Minnesota converted 12-of-18 third downs. Chicago was 2-of-8. - The Vikings out-gained the Bears, 537-169. - Minnesota won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 22 minutes!    Brett Favre was 32-of-48 for 392 yards and 3 touchdowns. His scores went to Percy Harvin (6 catches, 101 yards), Visanthe Shiancoe (5-51) and Chester Taylor (6-51). Sidney Rice and Bernard Berrian didn't get into the end zone, but both had solid games, catching 6 balls each for 89 and 74 yards, respectively.    The only good thing the Bears did in this contest was hold Adrian Peterson in check. They limited him to 85 yards and a score on 25 carries. Peterson also fumbled twice.    Horrible numbers for Chicago, as you would imagine. Jay Cutler was 18-of-23 for 147 yards and a touchdown, but also tossed 2 interceptions. One of them wasn't his fault (tipped ball).    "

He was 18-of-31 for 286 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault. He didn't take any sacks, and when he was under pressure, he maneuvered the pocket well and found his receivers downfield. Unfortunately, he's done. The good news though is that the Bears have a pretty decent backup in Caleb Hanie, who performed well in the NFC Championship.    Cutler's favorite targets were "

Well, despite having 9 days off and switching out left guards, the Bears still haven't been able to fix their pass protection issues. Cutler was sacked just twice, but that's a misleading statistic. He was frequently harassed in the pocket and seldom had time to throw. As a result, the Bears were just 4-of-14 on third-down conversions, though they managed to somehow move the chains on a 3rd-and-17 on a short pass to "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler's inability to beat the Packers continues. He's now 1-7 against his arch rival. Green Bay gave him plenty of opportunities with mistakes of its own, but Cutler simply couldn't take advantage of them, leading his team to 190 total net yards and converting a pitiful 0-of-9 on third downs. Cutler went just 12-of-21 for 135 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That means in 8 games versus the Packers, he's 127-of-237 for 1,518 yards, 8 touchdowns and a whopping 18 interceptions. That gives him a completion percentage of 53.6 and a YPA of 6.4. You can't put this all on Cutler though. It's not even close to being all of his fault. There are 2 issues with Chicago's offense, 1 of which is the offensive line. The group once again couldn't block for him, allowing 4 sacks, 1 of which came when Green Bay rushed only TWO players! "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler interception in the end zone that was tipped twice and fell into the arms of Kevin Williams. Christian Ponder was horrendous prior to halftime. He was 6-of-14 for 81 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly pick-six by the time the intermission rolled around. I thought there was a chance Matt Cassel would open as the starter in the third quarter, but the coaching staff stuck with Ponder, who inexplicably caught fire. He was 10-of-16 for 146 yards after the break.    Adrian Peterson, who said his goal was to rush for 2,500 yards this season, hasn't been very impressive in the early going. He failed to reach the century plateau in the opener, and just barely got there in this contest. He gained 100 yards on 26 carries, though he lost 13 yards on a ridiculous Chris Johnson-type attempt in which he ran backward for some reason. It's clear that Peterson misses his stud fullback Jerome Felton, who will be back from suspension in Week 4.    Ponder's sole touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (3-42), as expected. Greg Jennings had an OK outing, hauling in 5 grabs for 84 yards. Jerome Simpson predictably disappointed (2-49) after his awesome season debut. He's the 2013 version of Kevin Ogletree.    The Bears were able to overcome fluky Minnesota touchdowns and late Ponder precision passing, thanks to a 66-yard, game-winning drive, capped off with a Martellus Bennett score. Jay Cutler was extremely sharp, going 28-of-39 for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. As mentioned, 1 of his picks wasn't his fault because it was tipped twice into the air.    Cutler tossed 2 scores to Bennett (7-76), while the other 1 went to "

Josh McCown was fine in relief, so perhaps that'll give the Bears more confidence that they can move on without him following this offseason.    The Detroit Lions are in the drivers seat to win the NFC North for their first divisional championship in more than 20 years. After grabbing a tough road win at Chicago combined with Green Bay losing to the Eagles, Detroit is in sole possession of first place in the NFC North with 7 games remaining. The loss isn't the end of the world for the Bears, as they remain in the playoff race. After missing basically 6 quarters of action, Jay Cutler returned to the lineup for Chicago.

There was speculation all week that neither would return in 2015, so their victory in this contest could be the first step to allow both to maintain their jobs for at least another season. Despite the victory, Chicago didn't get off to a good start. Cutler lost a fumble early on and then proceeded to yell at the refs about it, drawing an unsportsmanlike penalty. The Vikings appeared to recover, but the officials strangely ruled that they took too long to pounce on the football and thus weren't awarded possession. It was such a weird call, but it ultimately didn't matter because "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler was strip-sacked, which led to a Tampa touchdown. Bucs: Speaking of that Tampa score, Mike Evans was whistled for taunting, which gave the Bears a very short field. Bears: Chicago did nothing with the short field position, as there was a dropped interception. Robbie Gould followed that up with a missed field goal, albeit from 54 yards. The Bears then allowed a completion to Vincent Jackson on a third-and-23. Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims. Both turnovers led to touchdowns. Thanks to a Vincent Jackson fumble (a terrible call by Walt Coleman, who failed to overturn it via replay because he was too senile to remember where he was) and several awful sacks by McCown allowed Chicago to clinch this win and cover.    McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. His play made Jay Cutler look like a quarterback god even though he struggled as well. Cutler, who went 17-of-27 for 130 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, was booed heavily throughout the entire afternoon, particularly when Tampa dropped a potential interception of his on third down. He had some bad incompletions that weren't even close, and he was only able to generate 204 net yards of offense on just 3.6 yards per play. Chicago would have lost this game had its opponent not self-destructed.    With Cutler struggling, "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler and company. The Bears were guilty of 3 turnovers, yet the Raiders couldn't maintain possessions, controlling the ball for less time than Chicago despite having all of those extra drives.    Derek Carr went 20-of-33 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault (more on that later). He looked good early, lofting a beautiful score to Amari Cooper, but he converted just 9 of his 19 attempts in the second half. That's not good news, especially considering the level of his competition in this matchup. To be fair, Carr appeared to have a touchdown to Seth Roberts late in the game, but Roberts' second foot was barely out of bounds.    Cooper snagged 4 balls for 49 yards and a score, as mentioned. However, he dropped a pass and didn't do anything after intermission. Michael Crabtree led the team in receiving with 5 catches for 80 yards. Crabtree appeared to suffer an injury while blocking for Cooper in the first half, but he turned out to be fine after missing the second quarter.    It was surprising to see Latavius Murray struggle to run the ball. He managed just 49 yards on 16 attempts. Making matters worse for his fantasy owners, he was benched after he both bobbled a pass that resulted in Carr's pick and dropped a pitch that turned out to be a fumble. Sitting him was not wise despite the 2 errors, as he's the best running back on the roster by a mile.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler put together a great, game-winning drive, but before that, it appeared as though he was trying his best to give this victory away. He was nearly picked on a tipped pass early, and then he actually tossed an interception to "

Luck, meanwhile, was jumping up and down and high-fiving everyone. That's the difference between a great and an awful teammate. Then again, Luck is actually a professional quarterback. Mallett, who is likely to be permanently benched, barring injury, doesn't have much of an NFL future.    Hoyer did well overall. He went 24-of-31 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He made numerous great throws, and at 1 point, he completed 11 consecutive passes. He actually gave the Texans some life. Unfortunately, he made 2 terrible mistakes late in the 4.h quarter.

   "comment":"Jay Cutler has played brilliantly under Adam Gase, but he didn't have his best performance in this contest. The Cutler of old appeared to surface at times, as he was guilty of 2 turnovers in this contest. One was a fumble on a strip-sack that almost could've been ruled a pick. The other was an ugly interception that he foolishly forced into tight coverage. However, Cutler had some bright moments as well, repeatedly leading his team down the field on impressive drives in the 4.h quarter. The possessions were ultimately spoiled, though the final 1 ended when the Bears couldn't convert on a 2.point try. Cutler finished 18-of-32 for 265 yards and the 2 turnovers. Not included in those numbers are 2 deep pass interference penalties that "

Manning didn't have much time to throw, but when he did, he often stared down his receivers like a leering drunk, allowing the Vikings to jump the routes of his horrible receivers. One interception was returned for 6. while another nearly went back all the way, but the defender stepped out at the Giants' 4-yard line. Manning finished 15-of-29 for 234 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the 3 picks. Most of those numbers were bogus, however, as Manning was just 8-of-18 for 98 yards and 3 interceptions before the game got out of hand. Manning also was credited with a fumble when he botched a shotgun snap on a third down.    The stats show that "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler played really well in the first half, but the Texans' defense dominated the final 2 quarters and battered Cutler with a serious pass rush to shut out Chicago after intermission.    Osweiler had a good first drive going to open the game, but in Chicago territory, Tracy Porter out-fought DeAndre Hopkins for a 50-50 pass and came away with an interception. Jay Cutler took advantage and started moving the ball down the field, including an excellent catch by Alshon Jeffery."

   "comment":"Jay Cutler, but now the Eagles can proudly say they held Ben Roethlisberger to a 54.5 percent completion rate, with 24-of-44 completions for 257 yards, no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble. Once Roethlisberger was forced to throw, his offensive line couldn't contain Philadelphia's front line and he was constantly running for his life. The Eagles sacked him 4 times and hurried him multiple times. Roethlisberger had thrown for 3 touchdowns in each of his first 2 games this season before running into the Eagles.    Eagles rookie quarterback Carson Wentz continued his stellar play on Sunday, spreading the ball around well as he hit receivers from multiple angles. His pocket awareness was superb, as he moved his team with ease on almost every drive. The offensive line held the Steelers to no sacks, and the offense had the Steelers on their heels at all times. Now 3 games into his rookie season, Wentz has now thrown 102 passes with no interceptions. He's good at football. Wentz completed 23-of-31 passes for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. His numbers would have been even better if it weren't for the Eagles defense, which stifled the Steelers at every point, which helped the Eagles create a big enough lead to run the ball in the 4.h quarter.    Philadelphia's lead running back, "

The Bears won't be bringing him back following this season, so Cutler has to show another squad (i.e. Jets, Broncos, 49ers) that he's capable of starting for them. His first game back, a Monday night victory over the Vikings, was a good start, but his second performance was a complete flop. This performance detailed everything wrong with Cutler. His accuracy and mechanics were lacking in this contest, as he immediately began with an interception toward "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler threw an interception deep in Atlanta territory; and Miami couldn't convert third downs to keep promising drives alive. It seemed like the Falcons were going to be able to coast to an easy victory, but they began looking ahead to next week's battle against the Patriots too early. The Dolphins rallied, outscoring Atlanta 20-0 in the second half to pull the upset as massive 13-point underdogs. While everything went wrong for the Dolphins in the opening half, the complete opposite occurred following intermission. For instance, the Dolphins, down 17-7, were able to get a third-down conversion because of a pass interference. Cutler then tossed another pick, but a horribly blatant roughing-the-passer penalty nullified the turnover. All of this allowed Miami to score to trim the margin to a 1.score game. Meanwhile, the Falcons had a promising drive disrupted by a "

   "comment":"Jay Cutler suffered a rib injury. This normally would've spelled the end for any team, but not for the Dolphins, a team whose backups 10. to be better than the starters. Matt Moore, who was not much of a downgrade from Ryan Tannehill last year, stepped in, and he promptly threw an interception when he forced a throw into coverage. Moore, however, managed to rebound and put together a couple of scoring drives to tie the game. It appeared as though the teams would be headed to overtime, but Josh McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    "
