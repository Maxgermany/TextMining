   "comment":"Cutler hit Eddie Royal on a 93-yard bomb to Eddie Royal, thanks to completely inept coverage by completely inept corner Brandon McDonald. On Cleveland's next drive, Winslow once again did his best to ruin his team's chances of winning, fumbling on Denver's 38-yard line. Denver took over and scored another touchdown 8 plays later to take the lead, despite the fact that the Browns dropped about 4 would-be interceptions in the final quarter. After the teams exchanged touchdowns, Winslow let a ball sail right through his hands in Denver territory on fourth-and-6. Game over. I really should stop handicapping Cleveland contests and just ask Edwards and Winslow whom they're betting on. Those 2 clowns have blown so many games this year, it's really disgusting. I'm convinced Winslow had the Browns -2 in the first half and the Broncos +3 for the game. There is no other explanation for his Jekyll-and-Hyde performance. Winslow, McDonald and the other drop-happy defensive backs weren't the only ones trying to blow it for the Browns. Romeo Crennel did some ridiculously stupid things himself, including accepting a 10-yard penalty on the Broncos that brought up third down instead of fourth down.    At any rate, tons of credit has to be given to Denver. Despite its multiple injuries, the Broncos won to improve to 5-4. Cutler was 24-of-42 for 447 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, though the Browns dropped about half-a-dozen sure-fire interceptions in this contest. Because he didn't have a running game by his side - Torain and "

Unfortunately, Alex Barron was called for a holding penalty. One play later, Brandon Gibson fumbled the ball, returned by Chicago to St. Louis' 20. Just blown opportunities for the Rams all afternoon. They began 6 possessions in Chicago territory in this contest, but mustered just 3 field goals.

Knox would eventually redeem himself; he led the Bears with 5 catches for 90 yards.    It was really surprising that Mike Martz opted to run the ball as much as he did. "

   "comment":"Cutler tossed the ball right to Babineaux, who couldn't come up with the turnover and perhaps subsequent touchdown. That was the turning point of the game - well, 1 of the 2 - because Chicago scored a touchdown a couple of plays later to make it 14-0. The other turning point was John Carlson's concussion on the second drive of the game. Carlson was a major part of the offensive game plan, and his absence was huge for the Seahawks, who couldn't move the chains whatsoever until the fourth quarter. In fact, Morrah, Carlson's replacement, had a huge drop later on that same possession.    Matt Hasselbeck went 26-of-46 for 258 yards and 3 touchdowns. Those numbers could have been even better if it weren't for all those drops (he had 2 more by Mike Williams in the second half). Despite a horrendous regular season, Hasselbeck has stepped up and performed well in the playoffs. The Seahawks should bring him back while they groom Charlie Whitehurst or another young signal-caller.    As for the other quarterback, Cutler went 15-of-28 for 274 yards and 4 touchdowns (2 pass, 2 rush). However, it could have been much worse for Cutler. He had that aforementioned dropped interception in the end zone. He also fumbled, which was fortunately recovered by his own lineman. Additionally, Cutler tossed a couple of sketchy passes that had a chance of being picked off.     Cutler's offensive line played a lot better than most people thought it would. It's unclear though if this was just a result of Seattle sucking or not; remember, the Packers sacked Cutler 6 times in the season finale, so the city of Chicago should wait a while before throwing a parade for its offensive front. The line thrived in both pass protection and run blocking. The Seahawks couldn't stop "

The Tampa Bay offensive line struggled to give him time to throw the ball, and the Buccaneers receivers were taking too long to come open. In the third quarter, the Bears opened up a 21-5 lead with a short touchdown run from Barber. Freeman promptly threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Lance Briggs. It was returned to the 1-yard line, but a penalty for a block in the back put the ball at midfield. Later, Freeman was intercepted again, this time inside the Bears 20 by Brian Urlacher. Cutler gave the ball right back on an interception by Buccaneers safety Corey Lynch."

What really happened though was that Cutler was playing through a concussion. He was removed from the contest at halftime and never came back. He finished 7-of-14 for 40 yards and 2 picks. "

   "comment":"Cutler interception in the end zone that was tipped twice and fell into the arms of Kevin Williams. Christian Ponder was horrendous prior to halftime. He was 6-of-14 for 81 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly pick-6 by the time the intermission rolled around. I thought there was a chance Matt Cassel would open as the starter in the third quarter, but the coaching staff stuck with Ponder, who inexplicably caught fire. He was 10-of-16 for 146 yards after the break.    Adrian Peterson, who said his goal was to rush for 2,500 yards this season, hasn't been very impressive in the early going. He failed to reach the century plateau in the opener, and just barely got there in this contest. He gained 100 yards on 26 carries, though he lost 13 yards on a ridiculous Chris Johnson-type attempt in which he ran backward for some reason. It's clear that Peterson misses his stud fullback Jerome Felton, who will be back from suspension in Week 4.    Ponder's sole touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (3-42), as expected. Greg Jennings had an OK outing, hauling in 5 grabs for 84 yards. Jerome Simpson predictably disappointed (2-49) after his awesome season debut. He's the 2013 version of Kevin Ogletree.    The Bears were able to overcome fluky Minnesota touchdowns and late Ponder precision passing, thanks to a 66-yard, game-winning drive, capped off with a Martellus Bennett score. Jay Cutler was extremely sharp, going 28-of-39 for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. As mentioned, 1 of his picks wasn't his fault because it was tipped twice into the air.    Cutler tossed 2 scores to Bennett (7-76), while the other 1 went to "

   "comment":"Cutler go 24-of-33 for 358 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, and the Bears score just 18 points? Charlie covered this game, so I look forward to watching it later during the week.    New Orleans took control of this game in the opening minutes and never looked back despite a breakout performance by Chicago wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. The Bears' defense couldn't keep Drew Brees from putting up points, while the Saints' defense came up with some clutch stops to keep New Orleans undefeated. The game really wasn't as close as the score, as Chicago got a late touchdown and 2-point conversion. Saints' defensive coordinator Rob Ryan has done a tremendous job this season, leading a complete turnaround to give his organization a balanced team for the first time in years. Early in the game, Brees used the unstoppable Jimmy Graham to move the ball down the field. The standout tight end dominated Chicago's safeties. After a New Orleans drive for a field goal, Malcolm Jenkins came on a safety blitz to get a sack fumble that was recovered by Cam Jordan to set up the Saints for their second field goal. Brees hit Graham for 38 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Pierre Thomas (19-36, 9-55 receiving). In the final seconds before halftime, Thomas took a 25-yard screen pass to the end zone. The Bears' defense adjusted to play better in the second half and kept New Orleans to only 2 more Garrett Hartley field goals.    Brees completed 29-of-35 passes for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns in this game. He was highly efficient and didn't make any mistakes to set up Chicago's offense. Darren Sproles (3-10 rushing, 3-31 receiving) didn't have big totals, but he churned out clutch yards. Bears cornerback Charles Tillman led the way to shut down Marques Colston (2-15).    Chicago's offense was carried by Jeffery, as New Orleans sold out to stop Brandon Marshall (4-30) and limit Matt Forte (12-55). Jeffery (10-218) stepped up with a monster game. He made a superb leaping catch for 31 yards in the first quarter. That would set up a short touchdown toss for the duo. Cutler hit a 48-yard completion to Jeffery in the third quarter and a gain of 18 yards to Martellus Bennett (5-56) set up a field goal."

After grabbing a tough road win at Chicago combined with Green Bay losing to the Eagles, Detroit is in sole possession of first place in the NFC North with 7 games remaining. The loss isn't the end of the world for the Bears, as they remain in the playoff race. After missing basically 6 quarters of action, Jay Cutler returned to the lineup for Chicago.

   "comment":"Cutler was pretty erratic, but it doesn't matter who the quarterback is as long as the defense is this inept. Chicago was so terrible on this side of the ball in every facet. The Eagles ran all over the Bears, as LeSean McCoy gained 133 yards and 2 touchdowns on 18 carries. Bryce Brown chipped in with 115 yards on 9 attempts, including a 65-yard score in garbage time. Chris Polk (2-12) also scored. In case you don't want to do the math, the 3 Philadelphia running backs averaged 8.97 yards per carry. That's nearly a first down every time they handled the ball! The Bears also showed very little resistance through the air. Nick Foles let the ball hit the ground only 4 times, completing 21-of-25 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns. Foles, who also scrambled twice for 17 rushing yards, basically did whatever he pleased. He barely saw any pressure throughout the evening, as Chicago's defense was reeling. Foles, by the way, fired his touchdowns to Brent Celek (3-58) and Riley Cooper (3-53). DeSean Jackson disappointed his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 29 yards.    With all of that in mind, it's not like anyone expected Chicago's stop unit to play particularly well. The offense, however, was expected to at least keep pace with the Eagles, but that wasn't happening for several reasons: - Cutler was erratic at times, going 20-of-35 for 222 yards, 1 late touchdown to Brandon Marshall (4-36) and a pick-6."

Meanwhile, the grass caused corner Davon House to fall down a couple of times on a pair of big Chicago plays. However, the Bears' great fortunes quickly ran out, and it began just before halftime. Martellus Bennett was tackled inches short of the goal line just as time expired. Cutler then was erratic as he was trying to come from behind, tossing 2 interceptions in the second half. One of them was a miscommunication that led to a Packer field goal attempt. The Bears held on the play, granting Green Bay with a first-and-goal opportunity. Rodgers took advantage with a touchdown on the very next snap. That put the Packers up 21, icing the second victory for them. Cutler had a miserable second half, going 7-of-13 for 83 yards and the 2 picks following intermission. He had a third potential interception that was dropped. Green Bay's defensive improvement after halftime was inexplicable, though Cutler melting down had something to do with it.    Rodgers, meanwhile, was brilliant throughout.

   "comment":"Cutler fumbled 2 snaps, yet was able to make great plays on both instances. He scrambled and picked up a first down the initial time and then threw a completion for a first down on the second occasion. Meanwhile, the grass caused corner Davon House to fall down a couple of times on a pair of big Chicago plays. However, the Bears' great fortunes quickly ran out, and it began just before halftime. Martellus Bennett was tackled inches short of the goal line just as time expired. Cutler then was erratic as he was trying to come from behind, tossing 2 interceptions in the second half. One of them was a miscommunication that led to a Packer field goal attempt. The Bears held on the play, granting Green Bay with a first-and-goal opportunity. Rodgers took advantage with a touchdown on the very next snap. That put the Packers up 21, icing the second victory for them. Cutler had a miserable second half, going 7-of-13 for 83 yards and the 2 picks following intermission. He had a third potential interception that was dropped. Green Bay's defensive improvement after halftime was inexplicable, though Cutler melting down had something to do with it.    Rodgers, meanwhile, was brilliant throughout. He backed up his message about relaxing despite the team's 1-2 start by going 22-of-28 for 302 yards and 4 touchdowns. Whereas Cutler struggled immensely following halftime, Rodgers misfired on just 2 of his 11 attempts during the same time span. One of the incompletions was actually a drop by "

His pick was a miscommunication with his target, while a strip-sack that he was responsible for led to a Miami field goal. Other players committed errors as well. Matt Forte was inexplicably given just 2 carries in the opening half. Alshon Jeffery had a drop, while Dante Rosario lost a fumble. Perhaps the worst thing Chicago did was show absolutely no sense of urgency despite being in a position to mount a comeback in the fourth quarter. Down 17 and in Miami territory with 8 minutes left, Cutler lackadaisically ran the offense, letting the clock tick down. It's almost as if he was resigned to losing at that point.    Meanwhile, Chicago's defense struggled once again. "

Despite the victory, Chicago didn't get off to a good start. Cutler lost a fumble early on and then proceeded to yell at the refs about it, drawing an unsportsmanlike penalty. The Vikings appeared to recover, but the officials strangely ruled that they took too long to pounce on the football and thus weren't awarded possession.

Bears: Chicago did nothing with the short field position, as there was a dropped interception. Robbie Gould followed that up with a missed field goal, albeit from 54 yards. The Bears then allowed a completion to Vincent Jackson on a third-and-23. Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims. Both turnovers led to touchdowns. Thanks to a Vincent Jackson fumble (a terrible call by Walt Coleman, who failed to overturn it via replay because he was too senile to remember where he was) and several awful sacks by McCown allowed Chicago to clinch this win and cover.    McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. His play made Jay Cutler look like a quarterback god even though he struggled as well. Cutler, who went 17-of-27 for 130 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, was booed heavily throughout the entire afternoon, particularly when Tampa dropped a potential interception of his on third down.

Cutler finished 32-of-46 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns ((2 passing, 1 rushing) and a late interception when he underthrew his receiver in the end zone. Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset.   "

   "comment":"Cutler completely lacks. Marc Trestman should've made the change earlier.    The Lions clinched a playoff spot on Saturday night with the Eagles loss to the Redskins, so this was a tune-up for Detroit with seeding and playoff positioning on the line. The Lions played a sloppy game filled with bone-headed penalties, blowing great opportunities for points and taking cheap shots at the opposition. It was a throwback game, as Detroit played like it did during the Jim Schwartz era, but against an overmatched Bears team, the Lions had too much talent to lose on the road.    The Lions got a scoring drive going midway through the first quarter. They converted a fourth-and-5 with a screen pass to "

   "comment":"Cutler scramble on the final drive of the game, they had the Bears outgained by 100 net yards and were averaging 1.5 more yards per play than the Bears were. A few plays made this a fake close contest. One was a Greg Jennings dropped touchdown in the first half. Another was a near-interception returned for a touchdown by Kyle Fuller off a deflection that gave Chicago a field goal. A third was a big kickoff return that allowed Chicago to put 3 more points on the scoreboard. A fourth was an eschewed field goal at the end of the game that would've covered (or pushed) the spread. The Bears, otherwise, were outplayed by a large margin. Outside of a couple of poor passes - the aforementioned interception by Fuller and a near-pick on an attempted screen - Teddy Bridgewater had a quality performance. Most of his throws were accurate, and he showed nice velocity and touch on his passes. Bridgewater finished 17-of-25 for 209 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also picked up 14 yards on a scramble. He should've had a second score, a 35-yarder to Jennings, but the ball barely scraped the ground.    No Viking caught more than 3 passes. Jennings (3-45) was second in receiving, trailing only Adam Thielen (3-68), who secured Bridgewater's only touchdown. Charles Johnson (2-22) disappointed in the finale.    Matt Asiata had nice gains in this contest, tallying 91 yards on 19 carries. However, he was stuffed on consecutive plays inside the 5-yard line with 3 minutes remaining. Had he converted, the Bears wouldn't have had 1 final opportunity to take the lead. Of course, that implies that the Bears could've mustered anything offensively without a fluke play. Chicago once again looked dysfunctional when it had the ball, especially early on. Cutler, starting this game for the concussed Jimmy Clausen, had to waste an early timeout on a third-and-1. Following a false start, the Bears were guilty of a delay of game. This happened again later on, disrupting what looked like a promising drive. Cutler should really be happy that he avoided turning the ball over. He was lucky to get away with a pick on a third down at the end of the opening quarter. He finished 23-of-36 for only 172 yards, as he once again threw nothing but checkdowns and screens. The Vikings' pass rush overwhelmed Chicago's decrepit offensive front, so Cutler didn't have time to look downfield.    Cutler appeared to throw a touchdown to "

   "comment":"Cutler and company. The Bears were guilty of 3 turnovers, yet the Raiders couldn't maintain possessions, controlling the ball for less time than Chicago despite having all of those extra drives.    Derek Carr went 20-of-33 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault (more on that later). He looked good early, lofting a beautiful score to Amari Cooper, but he converted just 9 of his 19 attempts in the second half. That's not good news, especially considering the level of his competition in this matchup. To be fair, Carr appeared to have a touchdown to Seth Roberts late in the game, but Roberts' second foot was barely out of bounds.    Cooper snagged 4 balls for 49 yards and a score, as mentioned. However, he dropped a pass and didn't do anything after intermission. Michael Crabtree led the team in receiving with 5 catches for 80 yards. Crabtree appeared to suffer an injury while blocking for Cooper in the first half, but he turned out to be fine after missing the second quarter.    It was surprising to see Latavius Murray struggle to run the ball. He managed just 49 yards on 16 attempts. Making matters worse for his fantasy owners, he was benched after he both bobbled a pass that resulted in Carr's pick and dropped a pitch that turned out to be a fumble. Sitting him was not wise despite the 2 errors, as he's the best running back on the roster by a mile.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler put together a great, game-winning drive, but before that, it appeared as though he was trying his best to give this victory away. He was nearly picked on a tipped pass early, and then he actually tossed an interception to "

   "comment":"Cutler Award for sportsmanship. Mallett wasn't done. He spent the entire second half looking miserable. The camera panned to him pouting on multiple occasions. Luck, meanwhile, was jumping up and down and high-fiving everyone. That's the difference between a great and an awful teammate. Then again, Luck is actually a professional quarterback. Mallett, who is likely to be permanently benched, barring injury, doesn't have much of an NFL future.    Hoyer did well overall. He went 24-of-31 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He made numerous great throws, and at 1 point, he completed 11 consecutive passes. He actually gave the Texans some life. Unfortunately, he made 2 terrible mistakes late in the fourth quarter.

   "comment":"Cutler had another solid outing, as he was helped by the return of Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal. He went 26-of-41 for 353 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick was a great play by Rashean Mathis, though Jeffery didn't fight for the ball to try and break up the pass.    Jeffery had a great fantasy outing, catching 8 balls for 147 yards and a touchdown. He was abusing Josh Wilson all afternoon; Wilson didn't have a prayer of covering him. Jeffery's only blemish, aside for not fighting for the pick, was dropping a ball that would've gone for about a gain of 20.    Martellus Bennett tied Jeffery with 11 targets, but wasn't nearly as productive, snatching 6 balls for 59 yards. Bennett nearly had a touchdown, but Cutler's pass to him was broken up at the last second. He also dropped a pass in the second half.    "

   "comment":"Cutler would make. Bridgewater deserves credit for the win, but he won't be bailed out by awful secondary play when he battles superior competition. He needs to clean up his sloppy throws. For instance, he badly sailed a pass over Mike Wallace's head for a potential touchdown in the third quarter. Bridgewater absolutely needs to hit throws like that.    Diggs had another big game. He caught 6 of his team-high 12 targets for 95 yards and the touchdown. Bridgewater was locked in on Diggs so much that the player with the next-highest amount of targets was Wallace, with 4. Wallace couldn't secure a single reception.    Adrian Peterson gashed the Bears, gaining 103 yards on just 20 carries, despite not having any long bursts. He also chipped in with 2 receptions, but for just 6 yards.    Chicago's running backs weren't as fortunate. Matt Forte picked up 41 yards on 10 carries to go along with 4 catches for 28 receiving yards. However, he was knocked out with a knee injury in the second half, which reportedly is an MCL sprain. His replacement, Jeremy Langford, looked good at times, tallying 46 yards on 12 attempts. However, he absolutely killed his team with a drop in the final minute of regulation. This occurred on a third down, and a reception would've moved the sticks. Instead, the Vikings were able to obtain possession and ultimately win the game on the ensuing drive.    Cutler had a solid outing, going 22-of-33 for 211 yards and a touchdown. He didn't win the game, but took just 1 sack and continued to play mistake-free football, which is huge for him.    "

   "comment":"Cutler has ever beaten the Packers as Chicago's quarterback. So, what happened? Is the NFL just completely random, or is there any sort of good reason the Packers couldn't beat the Bears on short rest - a situation that tends to benefit the superior team? Well, considering how many picks are going, it might just be completely random, but Green Bay did shoot itself in the foot repeatedly in this contest. Here's a rundown of the prominent mistakes: - Davante Adams dropped a potential touchdown in the first quarter. - Eddie Lacy lost a fumble in his own territory in the second quarter. The Bears, who had gone 3-and-out on 4 of their first 5 drives, used the turnover to get momentum, scoring their first touchdown of the night. - An offensive pass interference call ruined a chance for the Packers to score a touchdown right before halftime. The officials called James Jones for a pick. - Adams dropped a pass to move the chains in the third quarter. Adams then dropped another ball on the same possession, and this was followed by a botched snap that ruined field goal position. - Rodgers threw an interception because Adams was bumped off the route. - Adams - you guessed it - dropped another pass in the fourth quarter. - On the final drive, James Starts was guilty of letting the ball fall through his hands, and then Jones dropped the game-winning touchdown. The final drive stalled. As you can see, the Packers absolutely wrecked themselves with mental errors. They managed to outgain the Bears, 365-290, but no team could've overcame all of those horrible mistakes. So, what can the Packers do to improve this? I'm not sure there are any clear answers besides removing Adams from the lineup. He is absolute trash. He saw a team-high 11 targets, but caught only TWO passes for 14 yards. That's ridiculous! He might just be the least-efficient receiver in the NFL, taking that distinction from Mike Wallace. Meanwhile, the other receivers aren't helping Rodgers. Cobb (6-74) continues to underwhelm, while Jones, who couldn't reel in any of his 6 targets, looks like he's running in slow motion. I didn't think Green Bay would miss Jordy Nelson when he went down in the preseason, given that Rodgers has gotten the most out of pedestrian talents before, but I think most Packer fans would kill to have him back in the lineup right now.    Getting to the numbers, Rodgers went 22-of-43 for only 202 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. I counted at least half-a-dozen drops, 2 of which could've been scores, so Rodgers should've had a much bigger game. Then again, Rodgers nearly threw an interception, but the defender dropped the ball in the end zone in the second quarter. There was also a scary moment where Rodgers appeared to hurt his hand while recovering a botched snap. However, he didn't miss any time. Cris Collinsworth speculated that Rodgers simply banged his funny bone.    The Packers ran very well on the Bears. Lacy gained 105 yards on 17 carries, but was benched for a few drives because of his early fumble. Lacy, however, was given 7 carries following intermission. James Starks (7-39) also looked good, especially as a receiver out of the backfield; he snatched 4 passes for 41 receiving yards.    Adding injury to insult, Bryan Bulaga left the game with an ankle injury. He was listed as questionable to return, so perhaps it's not very serious.    My apologies to you Chicago fans, given that I've been ranting about the Packers this entire time. Green Bay is still alive in the playoff chase, however, so I wanted to spend more time on them. However, I do want to mention that the Bears once again were surprisingly impressive. They've had some unexpected wins this year, and this 1 has been the best 1 of all. Cutler, who normally folds against the Packers, was fantastic. It looked like he was going to struggle early - as mentioned, the Bears went 3-and-out on 4 of their first 5 drives - but Cutler caught fire after that. He was 10-of-14 for 122 yards after intermission. Cutler went 19-of-31 for 200 yards and a touchdown overall, which is very impressive considering that he was A) taking the field in cold, rainy conditions, and B) playing without his talented tight end, Martellus Bennett.    It helped Cutler that he had "

Manning didn't have much time to throw, but when he did, he often stared down his receivers like a leering drunk, allowing the Vikings to jump the routes of his horrible receivers. One interception was returned for 6, while another nearly went back all the way, but the defender stepped out at the Giants' 4-yard line. Manning finished 15-of-29 for 234 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the 3 picks. Most of those numbers were bogus, however, as Manning was just 8-of-18 for 98 yards and 3 interceptions before the game got out of hand. Manning also was credited with a fumble when he botched a shotgun snap on a third down.    The stats show that "

   "comment":"Cutler had to work with were his running backs. Detroit, meanwhile, had motivation here, as the team has discussed finishing strong this season to catapult them into a potential hot start in 2016. Despite these 2 factors, this contest went back and forth in the second half, but the Lions ultimately prevailed. The Lions were able to win because Matthew Stafford simply had more to work with. Calvin Johnson, who appeared to be playing on 1 leg a couple of Monday nights ago, completely dominated this contest. The Bears had no answer for him, as he secured 10 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown. Stafford and Johnson connected on a beautiful back-shoulder connection in the first half. Stafford, meanwhile, went 28-of-39 for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Bears couldn't do anything to stop him, especially during the latter stages of the second half. They need to improve their linebacking corps and pass rush this offseason. Adding another cornerback wouldn't hurt either.    With Megatron dominating all of the targets, no other Lion registered more than 49 receiving yards. Thus, it was a disappointing showing by Golden Tate (4-34). Stafford's other touchdowns went to Eric Ebron (5-25) and Tim Wright.    Ameer Abdullah handled most of the workload, gaining 44 yards on 10 carries. He appeared to fumble early on, but the officials ruled that his forward progress had been stopped.    As for the Bears, Cutler had the performance of a lifetime. I'm not being facetious. With Jeffery and Miller out of the lineup, Cutler went 17-of-23 for 245 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions despite the fact that his top targets were people named "

Once Roethlisberger was forced to throw, his offensive line couldn't contain Philadelphia's front line and he was constantly running for his life. The Eagles sacked him 4 times and hurried him multiple times. Roethlisberger had thrown for 3 touchdowns in each of his first 2 games this season before running into the Eagles.    Eagles rookie quarterback Carson Wentz continued his stellar play on Sunday, spreading the ball around well as he hit receivers from multiple angles. His pocket awareness was superb, as he moved his team with ease on almost every drive. The offensive line held the Steelers to no sacks, and the offense had the Steelers on their heels at all times. Now 3 games into his rookie season, Wentz has now thrown 102 passes with no interceptions. He's good at football. Wentz completed 23-of-31 passes for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. His numbers would have been even better if it weren't for the Eagles defense, which stifled the Steelers at every point, which helped the Eagles create a big enough lead to run the ball in the fourth quarter.

   "comment":"Cutler opened by firing some impressive strikes on the opening drive, moving the Dolphins inside the Saints' 5-yard line. However, the possession concluded with an interception thrown toward Julius Thomas, who didn't fight for the ball. Ken Crawley, starting for the disciplined P.J. Williams, snatched the pick. The Saints followed that up by moving into the red zone themselves, but they also screwed up. Zach Strief's hold forced a field goal, which was missed from 41 yards. Many mistakes were made throughout the opening half. Aside from all the penalties - there were 16 total prior to intermission - the Saints were guilty of a botched snap on third down. The Dolphins, meanwhile, were whistled for offensive pass interference, negating a first down. They also fumbled deep in their own territory, but were lucky to recover. The Saints cleaned up their act following intermission. By the time the game was 20-0, New Orleans outgained Miami in the second half, 217-25! The Dolphins couldn't sustain drives because of poor blocking and mistakes, while their defense whiffed on numerous tackles, allowing the Saints to convert several key third-and-longs.    Drew Brees was very sharp in the second half, going 16-of-20 for 171 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. His overall numbers were 29-of-41, 268 yards and the 2 scores. His touchdowns went to Michael Thomas (8-89) and Alvin Kamara (10-71), who happened to be the Saints' leading receivers. No other New Orleans player logged more than 31 receiving yards. Kamara is very interesting; he also rushed for 25 yards on 5 carries. Every time Mark Ingram or Adrian Peterson handled the ball, I wondered, Why isn't that Alvin Kamara? The rookie is such a special talent, and he's the best fit for what the Saints want to do offensively. New Orleans has a bye coming up, so I expect Kamara to be an even bigger part of the offense in Week 6 and beyond. Ingram (14-45) will still be in the mix), but Peterson (4-4) should be completely phased out, or even cut.    The dark cloud over the Saints' victories was a pair of injuries they suffered. Impressive rookie linebacker Alex Anzalone hurt his arm in the first quarter. More importantly, right tackle Zach Strief, who returned from injury this week, hurt his knee.    As for the Dolphins, Cutler was extremely impressive on the opening possession, as referenced earlier. However, he did absolutely nothing afterward. Cutler finished 20-of-28 for 164 yards and the aforementioned pick against 1 of the worst defenses in football that lost a starting linebacker in the early going. Cutler didn't play well, but this wasn't nearly all his fault. The line couldn't block, Julius Thomas didn't try, and Adam Gase came up with a horrible game plan, which includes a failed Wildcat play that Cutler hilariously didn't participate in, opting to stand still as the action was going on.

Still, it doesn't help that Cutler has, as 1 analyst put it this week, morphed into Blaine Gabbert. The numbers say it all, as Cutler was 12-of-26 for only 92 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Cutler spent the majority of the opening half tossing third-down passes short of the line to gain. On 1 instance, he actually had time in the pocket - a rare instance - and yet he hurled a 6-yard pass on third-and-8. On another failed conversion, the CBS announcers pointed out that the Dolphins have their worst third-down conversion rate since 1991. The crowed had enough when Cutler threw his pick, which was a forced ball into tight coverage. The ball popped into the air as a result, and the Titans snatched it. He was booed heavily as he went off the field. Cutler, however, was able to put together a nice drive in the fourth quarter to take the lead, so perhaps that's a glimmer of hope. That, or it's delaying the inevitable, which is Cutler being benched for Matt Moore. If Cutler continues to be woeful like this, Adam Gase may have to make the move.    To be fair to Cutler, he lost his favorite receiver, "

The Dolphins rallied, outscoring Atlanta 20-0 in the second half to pull the upset as massive 13-point underdogs. While everything went wrong for the Dolphins in the opening half, the complete opposite occurred following intermission. For instance, the Dolphins, down 17-7, were able to get a third-down conversion because of a pass interference. Cutler then tossed another pick, but a horribly blatant roughing-the-passer penalty nullified the turnover. All of this allowed Miami to score to trim the margin to a 1-score game.

   "comment":"Cutler suffered a rib injury. This normally would've spelled the end for any team, but not for the Dolphins, a team whose backups tend to be better than the starters. Matt Moore, who was not much of a downgrade from Ryan Tannehill last year, stepped in, and he promptly threw an interception when he forced a throw into coverage. Moore, however, managed to rebound and put together a couple of scoring drives to tie the game. It appeared as though the teams would be headed to overtime, but Josh McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    "
