   "comment":"Herndon muffed the punt.    The Chiefs weren't really doing much on offense this entire time. That's because they lost Jeremy Maclin and Charcandrick West to injuries. Maclin was concussed on a dirty ht by Jahleel Addae that inexplicably wasn't called. West, meanwhile, injured his hamstring. However, replacement Spencer Ware picked up the slack soon enough, rushing for 96 yards and 2 touchdowns on 11 carries. Ware isn't an impressive player; his production was a byproduct of San Diego's defense giving up at the end. There was no effort on his 52-yard burst.    Alex Smith finished 20-of-25 for 253 yards to go along with 7 scrambles for 33 rushing yards. He played relatively well, and his numbers could've even been better had Travis Kelce not dropped a touchdown pass at the end of the first half.    Maclin, who had 3 catches for 29 yards, was out for about half the game, which would explain why Albert Wilson (4-56) led the Chiefs in receiving. It would've been Kelce (5-46), but he dropped 2 balls.    As for the horrible Chargers, Rivers finished 19-of-30 for 178 yards and the aforementioned pick-six. He was sacked just 3 times, but that's a very misleading number. He had no protection whatsoever.    It didn't help that Rivers had no support from his running game. Melvin Gordon was a huge disappointment once again, mustering just 37 yards on 15 carries. The Chargers had this terrible 10.ency to run the ball on second-and-1 every time. It was such predictable play-calling. Mike McCoy, who deserves to be fired, simply was too incompetent to make any adjustments.    Rivers also didn't have anyone to throw to besides Stevie Johnson (7-54). After that, it was Dontrelle Inman (3-51) and Herndon (5-37), who dropped a pass. Those 3 players were the only Chargers who accumulated more than 12 receiving yards. Gates, who logged only a 6-yard reception, could've had a big gain, as mentioned, but Rivers missed him.   "

Donald Brown had more carries, but mustered only 17 yards. Brown, however, scored the game's opening touchdown. As expected, San Diego didn't miss Melvin Gordon at all.    I need to note that the officiating in this game was horrendous. Carl Cheffers' crew bungled some plays. They began early by correctly flagging the Raiders for a blatant hold. They then picked up the flag 45 seconds after making the announcement. It was absurd, and Nantz and Mike Carey were both completely appalled while Phil Simms asked himself some more questions. Later, there was an obvious pass interference on an Oakland linebacker, who shoved Woodhead as the ball was being thrown to him. No penalty was called, prompting Mike McCoy to complain. The refs eventually threw a flag - but on McCoy for yelling at them!   "
