   "comment":"Javontee Herndon (3-16) dropped 2 passes, including a crucial third down.    Speaking of Woodhead, he led the team in rushing with 55 yards on 11 carries. Donald Brown had more carries, but mustered only 17 yards. Brown, however, scored the game's opening touchdown. As expected, San Diego didn't miss Melvin Gordon at all.    I need to note that the officiating in this game was horrendous. Carl Cheffers' crew bungled some plays. They began early by correctly flagging the Raiders for a blatant hold. They then picked up the flag 45 seconds after making the announcement. It was absurd, and Nantz and Mike Carey were both completely appalled while Phil Simms asked himself some more questions. Later, there was an obvious pass interference on an Oakland linebacker, who shoved Woodhead as the ball was being thrown to him. No penalty was called, prompting Mike McCoy to complain. The refs eventually threw a flag - but on McCoy for yelling at them! <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
