He actually received a goal-line carry in the third quarter, but was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. - Kyle Rudolph was thrown to quite frequently on third down. He hauled in 5 receptions for 67 yards. - A disappointing debut for Blackmon. He had just 3 catches for 24 yards. As mentioned, however, Gabbert missed Blackmon in the end zone for an easy touchdown.    Major credit is due to Minnesota's front office, who made a ballsy move by cutting Ryan Longwell in favor of rookie kicker "

A bobbled field goal snap cost the Jaguars more points, but a few plays later Paul Posluszny made a fantastic leaping catch before racing down the field for a 59-yard pick-six. The 2.point conversion try was picked off by Champ Bailey, but the Broncos had only a 14-12 halftime lead. Denver came out in the third quarter with a nice drive that almost ended in a turnover from a Ronnie Hillman fumble, but Eric Decker (5-50) recovered the ball. The Broncos finished the drive by having Moreno plunge into the end zone. The Jaguars answered with a possession led by completions to Blackmon. "
