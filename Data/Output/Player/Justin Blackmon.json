Some skill-position players of note: - Percy Harvin caught 6 balls for 84 yards. He actually received a goal-line carry in the third quarter, but was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. - Kyle Rudolph was thrown to quite frequently on third down. He hauled in 5 receptions for 67 yards. - A disappointing debut for Blackmon. He had just 3 catches for 24 yards. As mentioned, however, Gabbert missed Blackmon in the end zone for an easy touchdown.    Major credit is due to Minnesota's front office, who made a ballsy move by cutting Ryan Longwell in favor of rookie kicker "
