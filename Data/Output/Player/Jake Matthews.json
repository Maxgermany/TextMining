Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. "
