McKinnon, who made some nice blitz pick-ups, appears to have surpassed Asiata on the depth chart.    Teddy Bridgewater simply was incapable of keeping drives alive. Taking a major step backward from his scintillating debut, Bridgewater went 23-of-37 for 188 yards and 3 interceptions. The first occurred because Teddy Bridgewater didn't see Glover Quin in the end zone. The second was the result of a high pass that was tipped. The third came in garbage time. Bridgewater didn't handle Detroit's pass rush well at all. He took a whopping 8 sacks.

Peterson, seizing control of the NFL's rushing lead from Doug Martin, accumulated 104 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. There was some concern with him entering this game, but he put those to rest with an impressive early run featuring some sick cuts. Peterson's only blemish on the evening was a dropped pass. Meanwhile, McKinnon took over for Peterson when the game got out of hand. McKinnon tallied 89 yards on just 7 attempts. He also ran into the end zone twice; the initial 1 being his first-ever NFL rushing touchdown.    "

There was a scary moment in this game when Adrian Peterson went into the locker room to get his lower back checked out. Peterson missed numerous drives, but returned to the field on the team's final offensive drive. Peterson actually fumbled his first touch back, but the Vikings were able to recover. Peterson managed 67 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries versus a Green Bay rush defense that played well.

   "comment":"Jerick McKinnon that the spry running back was able to turn into a big gain because of a blown coverage. Take away that fluky connection, and Bradford would've thrown for just 183 yards on 30 completions, which is just sad. I don't completely blame Bradford for being a checkdown machine because he can't exactly trust his offensive line, plus Stefon Diggs was out. However, there times when Bradford had plenty of time in the pocket, and he still settled for 3-yard completions on a third-and-8.    With Diggs out, Bradford spent the majority of the time targeting McKinnon that the spry running back was able to turn into a big gain because of a blown coverage.

However, there times when Bradford had plenty of time in the pocket, and he still settled for 3-yard completions on a third-and-8.    With Diggs out, Bradford spent the majority of the time targeting Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen, both of whom drew double-digit targets. Rudolph hauled in 9 of 10 passes thrown his way for 64 yards, with the sole failed connection being a drop. Thielen, meanwhile, snared 8 of his 11 targets for 53 yards. He was also guilty of a drop. Patterson, who made the greatest mistake of all, reeled in 5 passes, but for only 15 yards. He also picked up 22 rushing yards on a double reverse. Rookie Laquon Treadwell was even less of a positive factor. He failed to haul in his only target, as he dropped it. The ball popped into the air and was picked off by Slay. However, Slay was called for pass interference on what was a very shaky penalty. This occurred on the first drive, and Treadwell wasn't heard from again. He's been a huge disappointment thus far.    The Vikings once again struggled to run the ball. McKinnon tallied 31 yards on 9 carries, most of which came on a 10-yard burst. He also caught 4 balls for 45 yards, which includes the 41-yard reception I mentioned earlier. "
