   "comment":"Jerick McKinnon was much more impressive. He gained 135 yards on 18 carries, including a 55-yard burst. He didn't face much of a challenge against Atlanta's pathetic front, but McKinnon still needs to get more touches going forward.    Moving back to the Falcons, Ryan was sharp early on, but as mentioned, his offensive line issues prevented him from doing anything late. Ryan finished 25-of-41 for 298 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 meaningless picks. He was terrific on third downs, converting 10-of-15 opportunities.    The Vikings didn't seem to have an answer for any of the 3 primary receivers, as "

   "comment":"Jerick McKinnon handled most of the workload, but managed just 40 yards on 11 attempts. McKinnon, who made some nice blitz pick-ups, appears to have surpassed Asiata on the depth chart.    Teddy Bridgewater simply was incapable of keeping drives alive. Taking a major step backward from his scintillating debut, Bridgewater went 23-of-37 for 188 yards and 3 interceptions. The first occurred because Teddy Bridgewater didn't see Glover Quin in the end zone. The second was the result of a high pass that was tipped. The third came in garbage time. Bridgewater didn't handle Detroit's pass rush well at all. He took a whopping 8 sacks. Like Stafford, Bridgewater had to continuously dump the ball off to his running back, which would explain why Jerick McKinnon logged 6 catches for 42 receiving yards. Bridgewater did not get good protection, thanks mostly to "
