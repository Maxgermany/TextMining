   "comment":"Michael Floyd was his top receiver as he caught 5 for 87 yards. WalterFootball.com caught up with Fitzgerald after the game, and he summed up the game nicely, The first half that [sic] was some ugly ball in the first half. All around. The defense kept fighting and fighting to keep the game manageable for us. Those guys played their tail off. They got banged up and we lost lots of bodies last week, but guys continued to step up in their roles and that is what a team is about.    Mendenhall was terrible for the Cardinals. Early on, he dropped an easy pass and fumbled the ball away after running into Fitzgerald. Mendenhall also fumbled the ball out of bounds after a strip by Revis inside the Bucs' 10-yard line when Arizona was setting up the go-ahead field goal. The Cardinals should bench Mendenhall and let young backs "

Rashard Mendehall also predictably lost a fumble. What couldn't have been projected was Jay Feely's 2 missed field goals, as Feely was 28-of-32 entering this contest.    Palmer played pretty well aside from the pick. He went 28-of-49 for 407 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. He was especially sharp in the second half, misfiring on just 1 pass. He was a ridiculous 18-of-19 for 292 yards and a score following intermission. Palmer's touchdown went to Andre Roberts (3-74). His top 3 targets were Larry Fitzgerald (6-113), Floyd (6-91) and Rob Housler (5-78)."

   "comment":"Michael Floyd. Unfortunately, following a second Floyd score, things trended downward for Stanton. He threw an interception in the red zone when he didn't see linebacker Josh Bynes. He then tossed a second pick when he forced the ball into coverage. Stanton nearly had a third interception in the second half that was dropped, but he redeemed himself by converting a third-and-11 to Larry Fitzgerald that iced the game, which the FOX announcers called the biggest throw of his career. There's some question as to whether Fitzgerald was past the line to gain, but the Lions couldn't challenge because they were out of timeouts. Jim Caldwell used all of them prior to the 2-minute warning, which was a poor coaching gaffe.    Stanton went 21-of-32 for 306 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Those numbers look much better than how Stanton actually played, as he struggled to move the chains following the initial scoring drives.    Both of Stanton's aerial scores went to Michael Floyd, who only made 2 catches for 54 yards. John Brown (5-69) led the team in receiving, while Fitzgerald (2-33) didn't do much because he hurt his knee. He'll have an MRI on Monday, but it's a good sign that he was able to gut it out and snare the game-sealing reception.    Floyd.
