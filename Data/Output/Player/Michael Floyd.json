   "comment":"Floyd was his top receiver as he caught 5 for 87 yards. WalterFootball.com caught up with Fitzgerald after the game, and he summed up the game nicely, The first half that [sic] was some ugly ball in the first half. All around. The defense kept fighting and fighting to keep the game manageable for us. Those guys played their tail off. They got banged up and we lost lots of bodies last week, but guys continued to step up in their roles and that is what a team is about.    Mendenhall was terrible for the Cardinals. Early on, he dropped an easy pass and fumbled the ball away after running into Fitzgerald. Mendenhall also fumbled the ball out of bounds after a strip by Revis inside the Bucs' 10-yard line when Arizona was setting up the go-ahead field goal. The Cardinals should bench Mendenhall and let young backs "

He went 28-of-49 for 407 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. He was especially sharp in the second half, misfiring on just 1 pass. He was a ridiculous 18-of-19 for 292 yards and a score following intermission. Palmer's touchdown went to Andre Roberts (3-74).

In addition to the numbers he posted, Brown drew a flag for pass interference in the red zone. He's a solid player, while Floyd belongs on the waiver wire in your fantasy league.    The Saints' red-zone offense struggled, as written earlier. They moved the chains well in between the 20s, but struggled deep in Arizona territory. In 4 trips inside the Cardinals' 30-yard line, New Orleans came away with 3 field goals and just 1 touchdown. This may seem strange considering that "

Floyd was called for offensive pass interference, which wiped away what would have been his second touchdown. The Steelers' defense played the epitome of bend, but don't break defense, picking Palmer off twice and stopping the Cardinals on 58 percent of third downs.    Palmer was not his usual, accurate self and relied on some big receptions from his receivers, especially John Brown, who continues to show his immense ability. Brown made catches all over the field on his way to a big day, finishing with 10 receptions on 14 targets for 198 yards. All 3 were career highs for him. The only blemish, and it was an ugly 1. was a fumble which set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Steelers.    Vick was stuck on negative passing yards for most of the first half, and by the time he left in the third quarter, he was 3-for-8 for 6 yards. He ended up leaving due to a hamstring strain or possibly was just benched for Oklahoma Sooners product "

   "comment":"Floyd. Palmer was then nearly picked on a deep attempt downfield, and then proceeded to toss the ball into the ground. On the following drive, Josh Norman dropped a potential interception, leading me to wonder why in the world Palmer was targeting Norman when the rest of the Carolina secondary was the weak spot of the defense. Palmer went on to float a short pass over Andre Ellington's head and then was strip-sacked. Palmer, facing a 17-0 deficit, then had a stretch in which he completed 7-of-9 passes, but went on to struggle after that. He lost a fumble and then heaved a careless interception into the end zone, staring down his receiver. Much later, whatever life the Cardinals had following a touchdown was sucked out when Palmer was responsible for a dumb interception into double coverage. Further embarrassing himself, Palmer was pick-sixed by Luke Kuechly with a few minutes remaining on the clock. People are going to say that Palmer's finger injury was the reason for his struggles. However, that doesn't excuse his horrible decision-making. We haven't seen much of him in the playoffs, but he's now 1-3, and it's safe to say that he's a choke artist. The Cardinals need to think about using a day-two selection on a quarterback to groom behind Palmer, who will turn 37 during the 2016 campaign.    Outside of Palmer, Arizona's greatest disappointment was Larry Fitzgerald, who caught 4 passes for 30 yards, and no, it wasn't because Norman was covering him. Norman was on Michael Floyd (3-37), who didn't catch a pass in meaningful action. Fitzgerald was guilty of 2 drops. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Floyd, but Palmer once again didn't seem like himself. He wasn't horrible, but Arizona's offense isn't nearly as dynamic as it was last year, as Palmer clearly has regressed. Stanton, in relief, went 4-of-11 for 37 yards and 2 interceptions, 1 of which was a horrific attempt at a Hail Mary in which Stanton didn't even bother waiting for his receivers to run to the end zone. Stanton was abysmal in the preseason, and I thought Matt Barkley should've been rostered instead.    Johnson's injury ruined what was a solid afternoon, aside from the lost fumble. Johnson gained 83 yards on just 17 carries, and he also caught 4 passes for 41 receiving yards. He'll probably be in the lineup on Thursday, but if he's not, Chris Johnson (6-34) probably won't be available either because he also left the game with a dreaded non-contact injury. Andre Ellington is the next man up.    John Brown got off to a slow start this season because he was dealing with concussion ramifications, but he seems back to his old self. He caught 10 passes for 144 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (5-62) was next on the receiving chart, while Floyd's yardage was minimal (3-36), but he caught a touchdown. The drops hurt, however. There were 3 in total, and 1 occurred at the end when the Cardinals were attempting to mount a comeback. A monstrous hit by "

   "comment":"Floyd's hands, and the Texans capitalized with a field goal. Lewis then fumbled the ensuing kickoff, allowing Houston to score a quick touchdown. Suddenly, this was just a 1.point margin, and it was apparent that New England was going to struggle to put Houston away. The Patriots took just a 17-13 advantage into halftime, and while they eventually pulled away, it wasn't very convincing. They had to rely on a comedy of errors by Houston's inept offense. The Texans' defense, meanwhile, was incredible, as it did a great job of restricting the Patriots despite the 34 points; 7 came on Lewis' kickoff return, and some others were a result of turnovers by the Houston offense.    Tom Brady failed to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-38 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Brady was hit hard throughout the evening by Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus. New England's offensive line held up well for most of the season, but that was not the case in this instance. Brady was constantly under siege, and he couldn't do his usual dinking and dunking because the Texans made sure to take that away from him. Brady, as a result, had to take more deep shots than usual. He did manage to connect on some long passes, but he did uncharacteristically toss 2 interceptions, which was his exact total from the regular season. I mentioned the first; the second occurred as Brady was hit, and it didn't seem as though he saw Houston linebacker Benardrick McKinney.    Despite Brady not being able to dink and dunk, Julian Edelman still led the team in receiving, catching 8 balls for 137 yards, including a 48-yard grab. He just missed out on another long reception. Edelman's only blemish during the evening was a drop on third down, though Brady did throw behind him. Elsewhre in the receiving corps, Chris Hogan (4-95) was next on the stat sheet; he also drew a long interference flag on stud cornerback A.J. Bouye, but left the game with an injury. Martellus Bennett did the same on a non-contact knee injury. It seemed dire for Bennett at first, but he somehow missed only 1 snap. Bennett caught just 1 pass for 4 yards, while Floyd (1-9) didn't do much outside of being somewhat responsible for Brady's first pick, though the pass was thrown a bit in front of him.    Brady's 2 passing touchdowns went to Lewis (2-23) and "
