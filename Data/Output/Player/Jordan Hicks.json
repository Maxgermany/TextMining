   "comment":"Jordan Hicks. Prescott and Hicks. Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott were guilty of a botched exchange, but Dallas once again was fortunate to recover. Prescott followed that up by underthrowing Bryant for a touchdown and then having an interception dropped, only because Terrance Williams had to commit offensive pass interference to break up the play. On later drives, the Cowboys were flagged for a delay-of-game penalty, and then Elliott had a long run that was nullified by a hold, albeit a shaky 1. As you can see, the Cowboys screwed up so many times and clearly didn't have their heads in the game. And yet, they won. I don't know if that says more about the Eagles blowing it, or Dallas having amazing perseverance. Philadelphia did make mistakes of its own, especially late in the contest. Wendell Smallwood lost a fumble, and then it actually appeared as though the Eagles would be able to put it away with a field goal to make it a 10-point margin with a few minutes remaining. However, a bad Jason Kelce snap forced Philadelphia out of kicking range. The Cowboys followed that up with a game-tying drive and then ultimately won in overtime.    Prescott struggled in the first 3 quarters. On top of the aforementioned miscues, he was just inaccurate for the most part. However, Prescott put together 2 amazing drives to seal the victory. He hit Bryant for a 22-yard game-tying score, and following a successful sneak on 4.h-and-1 in overtime, he connected with a wide-open Jason Witten for the decisive touchdown. Prescott finished 19-of-39 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception to Hicks. He made up for that horrid completion percentage by moving well on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 38 rushing yards and an additional score. His early struggles at least have to be somewhat worrisome, but his ability to come through in the clutch means so much more.    The Cowboys welcomed Bryant back to the lineup for the first time since Week 3. Bryant caught just 4 of his 14 targets, though that wasn't his fault, as Prescott dealt with accuracy issues. Bryant did have 113 yards and a touchdown, but he really should have found the end zone 3 times. Aside from Bryant, only 2 other Cowboys had more than 25 receiving yards: Elliott (4-52) and "
