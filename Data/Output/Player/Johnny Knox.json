Despite being outplayed, the visitors were up 7-6. I have a little fun with fullback Marcel Reece calling him a matchup nightmare which is what radio announcer Greg Papa referred to him as in the preseason, but he looked like 1 taking a screen 47 yards down the sideline to start Oakland's next drive. That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2.minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end "
