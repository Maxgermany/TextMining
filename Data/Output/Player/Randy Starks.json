   "comment":"Starks. Good going, Sanchize. It's time for the Jets to start exploring other quarterback options.)    The biggest takeaway from this game: Mark Sanchez is awful. The Jets have to get some quality competition for the starting quarterback job this offseason. Sanchez had an atrocious performance, completing 21-of-32 passes with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Miami struck first with a field-goal drive that was led by Matt Moore. To answer, Jets' embattled offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer emptied the playbook with a gadget play. Wide receiver Jeremy Kerley threw a pass off an end around to Dustin Keller for a gain of 41 yards. The drive ended with Sanchez tossing a 1.yard touchdown pass to Keller. New York's lack of discipline was a crippler in the first half. The team had repeated false start penalties that turned a promising drive into a field goal. Conversely, the Jets' defense had an excellent first half. They were aided by Brian Hartline dropping a perfectly thrown deep pass from Moore. Brodney Pool intercepted Moore, but Sanchez gave it right back with a terrible pick. Under pressure, Sanchez tried to dump a pass off but instead he was picked by defensive lineman Randy Starks. That set up a 58-yard field goal from "

He had a very dumb taunting penalty to get the drive going, and then he lined up way offside on a 4.h down in the red zone that Cincinnati failed to convert.    More on Phil Simms: Simms gave the usual bland analysis, but I was frustrated with him early on when he was talking about Starks' taunting penalty. Simms literally spent 2 minutes explaining what a taunting call was. Even my girlfriend, who barely knows anything about football, heard this and commented, Why is this guy explaining what taunting is? Even I know what a taunting penalty is! <!-- TreatRequestAsMobileOrTables = False -->   "
