Miami's offensive line had a mixed performance. They blocked well for Thomas in the ground game, but they struggled mightily as a unit in pass blocking. The Dolphins allowed 5 sacks in the game. Left tackle Jake Long and center Mike Pouncey stood out for their run and pass blocking. Pouncey allowed a sack to Browns defensive tackle Athyba Rubin, but it was a coverage sack that saw Henne run right into Rubin. Henne ran into Taylor for another sack. Overall though, Taylor and Rubin played very well. Right tackle Marc Columbo and tight end Anthony Fasano allowed a bad sack. Guard John Jerry had some bad plays against the Browns tackles, but left guard Richie Incognito had the worst game against Cleveland. Rubin dominated Incognito. The Dolphins really could use a new right tackle and a new left guard.    Overall the Browns' defense played well. They bent, but did not break. Haden, Rubin, Taylor, linebacker D'Qwell Jackson and rookie defensive end Jabaal Shread all had good games for Cleveland."

The second pass was obviously uncatchable, but Coleman doesn't seem to know the rules anymore because he's stuck in a different decade. These flags helped the Lions score their only touchdown of the first half. The score carried them until they snapped out of their funk after intermission. "

McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out. Troy Niklas (2-12) had 2 scores.    Josh McCown was 18-of-34 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The Browns had no running game. McCown led them with 18 yards on 5 carries. Isaiah Crowell (10-14) was ineffective, and for some reason, the explosive Duke Johnson had only 1 carry for 3 yards despite catching 2 passes for 68 yards.    Gary Barnidge led the Browns with 7 receptions for 53 yards. Taylor Gabriel (4-32) and Travis Benjamin (3-26) were ineffective.    Arizona's defense got a strip-sack out of Dwight Freeney and put a lot of heat on McCown in the second half. Surprisingly, the Cardinals' secondary had an underwhelming game against Cleveland.    After being beaten by Floyd on the long touchdown, Haden went into the locker room with a head injury. Armonty Bryant and Karlos Dansby played well for the Browns.   "

The Ravens quickly got the ball back as a McCown overthrow floated to Eric Weddle for an interception. That gave them the ball close to midfield with 42 seconds left. That set up a 52-yard field goal for Justin Tucker, and the Browns took a 20-12 lead into halftime. To open the third quarter, Flacco moved the ball down the field with a 19-yard completion to Steve Smith and then a 31-yard pass to Smith (3-64). To finish the drive, Wallace got open for a 17-yard touchdown strike and the Ravens kicked the point to make it 20-19.

   "comment":"Joe Haden read his eyes perfectly. Flacco, however, was nearly perfect otherwise following intermission, as his second-half numbers were 13-of-17 for 163 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. The offense went into a quick tempo, and Flacco's throws were mostly precise, though Cleveland's atrocious defense made things very easy for him.    While Flacco's 3 touchdowns all went to different players, they mostly had a common theme: An offensive lineman sustained an injury following 2 of his scores. Guard Haden read his eyes perfectly.

   "comment":"Joe Haden.    Manning accumulated 3 touchdowns, but struggled once again. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-27 for only 194 yards. That is a truly horrible stat line against 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Most quarterbacks have torched the Browns this year, so it has to be very discouraging for the Giants that Manning couldn't do much. He should've been able to make several downfield throws, but was just inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't all Manning's fault, as his offensive line had issues keeping the Browns out of the backfield. Cleveland sacked Manning once, but that's not indicative of the pressure Manning saw. Rookie Emmnauel Ogbah put some good heat on the Giant signal-caller.    Excluding Beckham, only 1 Giant had more than 18 receiving yards. That was Haden.    Manning accumulated 3 touchdowns, but struggled once again.
