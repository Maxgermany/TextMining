   "comment":"Adam Jennings. Jennings appeared to graze the ball late in the 4.h quarter, but TV replays showed that he didn't touch it. Unfortunately, Mike Smith couldn't challenge the call because he used all of his timeouts to stop the clock when the Eagles had possession. I'd like to see the NFL allow a team to challenge without timeouts to avoid a situation like this in the future. If the challenge fails, maybe you can penalize them 15 yards or something. But the Falcons were essentially screwed by that horrendous call.    Atlanta wasn't the only team to get the shaft by the officials in this contest. Eagles defensive end "
