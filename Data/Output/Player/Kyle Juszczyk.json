Ultimately though, Jacksonville just couldn't sustain drives; the team averaged just 3.6 yards per play, converted only 5-of-18 third downs and bogged down in the red zone. The Ravens, meanwhile, struggled offensively as well, but they moved the chains when they needed to at the very end. "

   "comment":"Juszczyk and wide receiver Kamar Aiken all topped 5 receptions, but nobody on the Ravens passed 66 receiving yards. But the Steelers' defense, even with the knowledge that Mallett wasn't going to try to beat them deep, couldn't keep the Ravens from matriculating their way down the field.    Chris Matthews (not of MSNBC fame) put up the first points of the day, on a 9-yard touchdown grab in the end zone. Mallet laced it over 2 Pittsburgh defenders, where only Matthews could make a play on the ball.    After getting up 7-0 in the first, the Ravens held on to the lead after picking off Ben Roethlisberger and having Justin Tucker kick 2 field goals to put them up 13-3 at halftime. The expectation remained that the Steelers' explosive offense would eventually be able to throw the ball on the Ravens' pass defense, which statistically, has been 1 of the worst in the league this season, but Roethlisberger never looked comfortable.    The Steelers did get their first touchdown in the third quarter, as DeAngelo Williams went in from 1 yard out to make it 13-10 Baltimore, but Roethlisberger was intercepted again early in the 4.h quarter, which set up a short field for Mallett, who hit St. Louis castoff Chris Givens for a 39-yard gain and then Kyle Juszczyk for a 34-yard gain, which set Javorius Allen up for a 3-yard touchdown run and a 20-10 lead.    Allen was the workhorse for the Baltimore offense, rushing 18 times for 79 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 35 yards. The Steelers hadn't allowed an opposing running back to total 100 or more yards against them since Week 7 and had allowed only 3 rushing touchdowns to running backs all season. The Ravens imposed their will on even the best part of the Steelers' defense.    DeAngelo Williams was easily the best offensive player for the Steelers, as he carried the ball 17 times for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also caught all 6 of his targets for 53 yards. Both of his touchdowns were set up by pass interference calls, which were Pittsburgh's main mode of offense.    Roethlisberger was sacked 3 times and called what should have been unnecessary timeouts, while completing 24-of-34 passes for 215 yards, no touchdowns and 2 interceptions. It was a poor performance by him and the offense as a whole.    The Steelers are still in the playoff hunt, but they no longer control if they get in or not. After the Jets upset the Patriots on Sunday, the Steelers now need to beat the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland (which seemed like a given just last week), and they'll need Rex Ryan to exact some revenge on his old team as his Buffalo Bills will host the New York Jets in what could be a win and they're in game.
