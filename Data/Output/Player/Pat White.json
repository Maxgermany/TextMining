   "comment":"White, meanwhile ran for no gain and was incomplete on 1 attempt, missing an open Ted Ginn downfield.    As for Miami's regular offense, the 7 points it put up pretty much speaks for itself. The score could have been a lot closer, but Anthony Fasano fumbled the ball away at the Atlanta 10. In total, the Dolphins had 4 turnovers after coming up with a plus-17 turnover differential last year - a sign that things won't be the same in 2009.    Chad Pennington was 21-of-29, but threw for just 176 yards, which gives him a pretty weak YPA of 6.1. Pennington also had a touchdown and an interception.    Perhaps Miami's greatest mistake was not getting Ronnie Brown involved enough. Despite the fact that Brown averaged 4.3 yards per carry against Atlanta's pedestrian run defense, Brown was given only 10 carries. He also had just 3 receptions for 10 more yards. I understand being scared of Brown wearing down late in the year, but with games coming up against Indianapolis and San Diego, this was 1 the Dolphins had to have.    Another concern the Dolphins suddenly have is pass protection; the Falcons, not known for being able to get after the quarterback consistently, managed 4 sacks on Pennington. John Abraham and Kroy Biermann had 2 each, exposing Jake Long and Vernon Carey.    Matt Ryan was as good as advertised, going 22-of-36 for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns. Ryan found Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White 5 times each. Gonzalez had 73 yards and a score, while White had 42 yards.    A disappointing outing for "
