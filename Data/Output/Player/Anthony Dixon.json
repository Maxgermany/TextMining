   "comment":"Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

As my LVH SuperContest partner Matvei wrote, If the refs aren't lead out of Orchard Park in chains, we may as well defund the FBI. There were terrible calls throughout, but the most egregious were a pair of awful offensive pass interference infractions called on them during 1 drive. There were legitimate penalties too, as "

Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point.

It's discouraging to see that he hasn't been able to remedy his primary issue.    As for the victors, Alex Smith also had problems with the opposing pass rush. He was sacked a whopping 6 times, as "
