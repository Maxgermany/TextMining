His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3-and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

   "comment":"Dixon (7 carries for 32 yards) and rookie Kendall Hunter (11 carries for 27 yards) took over, allowing Gore to rest up on a short week for the Harbaugh Bowl. A short field goal from Akers capped the drive and made it 3-0. Yet another opportunity opened up for San Francisco to blow this game open in the first half when the first play by Arizona resulted in a fumble by Beanie Wells, who had just 8 carries for 33 yards. Arizona only ran the ball a total of 11 times, never holding the ball on sustained drives to get the running game in a rhythm against a stout defense. The field position resulted in just 3 points after Alex Smith threw behind Braylon Edwards on third down and Akers connected from 43 yards out. I got a good laugh when Brian Billick referred to him as Fred while making a golf analogy about him getting his swing back. Maybe he thought he was covering Fred Couples at the Masters. The Cardinals had another unsuccessful drive as the first quarter wrapped up, but the 49ers were having trouble putting them away. Smith missed Crabtree for what should have been an easy touchdown and Akers had another field goal blocked, this time by Peterson who did not make his presence felt otherwise on special teams because he only got his hands on a punt return twice. San Francisco quickly got the ball back and drove down the field yet again. This march was highlighted by wide receiver Kyle Williams who slipped by linebacker Sam Acho for a pickup of 10 yards and had another reception for 15. It was somewhat of a breakout performance for Williams with 5 receptions for 54 yards and (spoiler alert) a touchdown. Since the injury to Josh Morgan, the team has been looking for someone to pick up the slack. The drive ended with Smith throwing to Davis, who came up just short of the first down. Akers hit the field goal, making it 9-0. After yet another failed Arizona drive, the game mercifully went to halftime. Finally, San Francisco asserted itself as the bully, taking the ball right up the field 84 yards capped by the aforementioned touchdown to Williams. Crabtree had 2 receptions for 44 yards early in the drive which put them up 16-0. At that point it might as well have been 100-0 given the ineptness of Arizona's offense. On the second play of their first possession of the half, John Skelton tried to find Larry Fitzgerald and instead got the ball to Donte Whitner. The 49ers made short work of the short field, needing just 4 plays capped off by an 18-yard pass to Davis for a 23-0 lead and the rout was on. Dashon Goldson ended the Cardinals' next drive with an interception, ending the misery that was Skelton's day. He finished 6-of-19 for 99 yards with 3 picks and a 10.5 QB rating. I'm not convinced Red Skelton would have been worse. After San Francisco stalled and punted, Navorro Bowman came up with the fumble by Peterson who definitely played like a rookie. However, Smith was intercepted by Daryl Washington on third-and-goal on a very poor decision. This was a setback game for Smith who had no business throwing a dangerous pass with the game well in hand. Then we got a special treat when Richard Bartel entered to play quarterback. He looks like the kind of guy who enjoys a dip of tobacco and thinks Yeah coach, put me in, I got you while sitting on the sideline looking like a gunfighter from the Wild West. Arizona went to the shotgun, but the drive went nowhere. When they got the ball back on the 49ers' second punt of the game, the Cardinals finally got somewhere thanks to Early Doucet and Goldson mixing it up after the play. Doucet popped Goldson who retaliated with a right hook that missed and a couple more punches that landed him an ejection on a play that actually featured rookie Aldon Smith sacking Bartel. Then Doucet caught a couple passes, veteran Chester Taylor broke off a 34-yard run and Larry Fitzgerald caught the first touchdown pass ever thrown by Bartel. By the way, Fitzgerald went over 9,000 yards receiving in this game. At 23-7, technically, this was still a game. Arizona got the ball back with 4:58 to play and scratched their way to the red zone before San Francisco decided enough was enough. From the 16-yard line, Bartel missed on 3 straight passes, and when he finally connected with Doucet, it was well short of the first down, and that was that. The 49ers drained the final 3:27 with Dixon running and Smith kneeling. It was a great win because Gore was able to rest a little bit, but Smith (20-of-38 for 267 yards 2 TDs, 1 INT) did not play very well. If not for the defense being dominant and the running game (164 yards) working, this might have been a much different story.   "
