It certainly wasn't pretty - Luck was nearly picked on several other occasions - but he got the job done in the end despite extremely difficult conditions.    I mentioned that there were several issues for Luck. The pressure was 1. while Reggie Wayne was the other. The future Hall of Fame receiver had 1 of the worst performances of his career. He reeled in just 1 of his 8 targets for just 5 yards. He had a whopping 4 drops. One would've moved the chains, but the drop eventually led to a punt. Another ruined a potential big gain. A third was on the 2-point conversion, which would have pushed this spread (though I'm sure Blakeman would've come up with some sort of penalty).    The Colts actually have a highly productive receiver, and that would be Hilton, who had a monstrous outing. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets and snatched 10 of them for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns. Coby Fleener (5-56) was second in receiving despite the return of Allen (1-5).    The Colts struggled to run the ball, as Luck was the team's leading rusher with 37 yards on the ground.
