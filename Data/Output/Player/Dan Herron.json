   "comment":"Herron run following a review - Luck found T.Y. Hilton in the end zone. Luck finished 24-of-53 for 294 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. It certainly wasn't pretty - Luck was nearly picked on several other occasions - but he got the job done in the end despite extremely difficult conditions.    I mentioned that there were several issues for Luck. The pressure was 1. while Reggie Wayne was the other. The future Hall of Fame receiver had 1 of the worst performances of his career. He reeled in just 1 of his 8 targets for just 5 yards. He had a whopping 4 drops. One would've moved the chains, but the drop eventually led to a punt. Another ruined a potential big gain. A third was on the 2-point conversion, which would have pushed this spread (though I'm sure Blakeman would've come up with some sort of penalty).    The Colts actually have a highly productive receiver, and that would be Hilton, who had a monstrous outing. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets and snatched 10 of them for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns. Coby Fleener (5-56) was second in receiving despite the return of Allen (1-5).    The Colts struggled to run the ball, as Luck was the team's leading rusher with 37 yards on the ground. Trent Richardson (7-30) and Dan Herron (8-26) couldn't get going, thanks in part to the big lead Cleveland maintained. That said, Herron did catch 4 balls for 45 receiving yards, and he could've scored a touchdown, but Luck overthrew him while being hurried. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Luck had 24 attempts compared to 11 rushes by Dan Herron (23-63, TD) by intermission. However, Indianapolis was able to move the chains on the ground when it absolutely needed to. The team controlled the clock for 8 minutes on a 4.h-quarter drive, setting up a field goal that put the team up 2 possessions, effectively sealing the victory.    It's not like Manning could even score once, so the final field goal may have been irrelevant. Manning's numbers were 26-of-46 for only 211 yards and a touchdown. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack. Manning's stats don't look terrible, but some of his completions occurred in garbage time, so that enhanced his yardage and already-hideous YPA (4.59). He was also nearly picked a couple of times, as the crowd frequently booed him throughout the second half. Perhaps Manning will get healthy next year, but he looked done as an elite quarterback late in the season, though I'm sure he would've found some way to lose in the playoffs even if he were 100 percent.    Manning wasn't the only Bronco who struggled. "
