   "comment":"Miller. The Raiders still have only 1 offensive first-half touchdown this season, and it doesn't look like they'll score another 1. That's because JaMarcus Russell, who was 9-of-13, 68 yards, 2 picks and a fumble, left the game in the second quarter with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, but his status is still unclear. Andrew Walter picked up where Russell left off, and finished 8-of-17, 61 yards and an interception.    Once again, the only target of note for Oakland was Zach Miller, who had 8 grabs for 64 yards.    "
