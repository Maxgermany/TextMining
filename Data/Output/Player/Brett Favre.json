Favre was 28-of-40 for 290 yards and 2 scores, but he also 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned 91 yards for a touchdown. There were rumors during the week that Favre is hiding an arm injury. Of course, he'll never admit that he's hurt so his consecutive-starts streak doesn't fall in jeopardy. But Favre now leads the league in picks (11) after having just 15 all last year.

   "comment":"Brett Favre chokes in a big game moment. Last year at Dallas, Favre lobbed up passes for grabs. In the subsequent NFC Championship, he tossed a near pick-six. I was expecting something similar in a fight for first place. Kudos to Favre (26-of-33, 258 yards, 2 TDs) for playing smart football. That said, don't think he won't choke on a larger stage. Though it may not sound like it, I love Favre. He's 1 of my favorite players. I'd like to see him win another Super Bowl. But the fact remains that since he claimed his first Lombardi Trophy, he's come up small in big moments. And I doubt that has changed simply because he's playing in a different city.    So, because my premise was incorrect and Favre didn't make a single error, I lost yet another pick. However, I do feel a bit vindicated because something I've been saying all year finally came to fruition tonight: The Patriots couldn't stop the pass. At all. Their disgraceful secondary allowed Brett Favre to fire just 7 incompletions and convert 9-of-16 third downs, including a painful third-and-15 in overtime. As a comparison, New England was just 4-of-14 on third downs.    And speaking of choking, I found it very odd that the Patriots were the 1. who gagged instead of Favre. New England dominated most of the second half, but managed a mere 11 points in the final 2 quarters until the last few seconds of the game. The Patriots simply killed themselves once they crossed into Jets territory. On the first drive of the third quarter, Favre chokes in a big game moment.

Dustin Keller disappointed, grabbing just 1 ball for 2 yards.    One has to wonder why Thomas Jones didn't get many opportunities. He rushed just 17 times for 67 yards, even though this was a 1.score contest until the 2.minute warning in the 4.h quarter.    The Seahawks, meanwhile, shot themselves in the foot repeatedly in the first half. They could have opened up an even larger lead, and they were fortunate that Brett Favre was an epic failure.

The Vikings could have had a mannequin under center and won this game; the Browns had absolutely no answer for Adrian Peterson, who rushed for 180 yards and 3 touchdowns on 25 carries. Good thing the Browns didn't spend so much money on defensive linemen a year ago. Oh, wait...    Favre was just 14-of-21 for 110 yards and a touchdown to Percy Harvin. Favre didn't exactly do anything to validate the signing, but the 1 important thing he didn't do was turn the ball over. That will probably happen later in the year.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 3 receptions for 36 yards and a score. Harvin also ran the ball twice for 22 yards. Harvin appears to be Brett Favre's favorite target, though it should be noted that Bernard Berrian (0 catches) was limited with an injury.Favre talk.

The Vikings simply had no answer for Aaron Rodgers, who went 22-of-31 for 301 yards and 4 touchdowns. Green Bay was down early (3-0 Vikings after the first quarter) because it seemed like Mike McCarthy was trying too hard to establish a running game. He eventually came to his senses after he watched Brandon Jackson (14-28) and Dimitri Nance (12-37) struggle.    Congrats to anyone who owns Greg Jennings; the stud wideout had 7 catches for 152 yards and 3 touchdowns. Donald Driver played, but didn't do much (4-31).
