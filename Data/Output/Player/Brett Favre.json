There were rumors during the week that Favre is hiding an arm injury. Of course, he'll never admit that he's hurt so his consecutive-starts streak doesn't fall in jeopardy. But Favre now leads the league in picks (11) after having just 15 all last year.    "

   "comment":"Favre chokes in a big game moment. Last year at Dallas, Favre lobbed up passes for grabs. In the subsequent NFC Championship, he tossed a near pick-six. I was expecting something similar in a fight for first place. Kudos to Favre (26-of-33, 258 yards, 2 TDs) for playing smart football. That said, don't think he won't choke on a larger stage. Though it may not sound like it, I love Favre. He's 1 of my favorite players. I'd like to see him win another Super Bowl. But the fact remains that since he claimed his first Lombardi Trophy, he's come up small in big moments. And I doubt that has changed simply because he's playing in a different city.    So, because my premise was incorrect and Favre didn't make a single error, I lost yet another pick. However, I do feel a bit vindicated because something I've been saying all year finally came to fruition tonight: The Patriots couldn't stop the pass. At all. Their disgraceful secondary allowed Brett Favre to fire just 7 incompletions and convert 9-of-16 third downs, including a painful third-and-15 in overtime. As a comparison, New England was just 4-of-14 on third downs.    And speaking of choking, I found it very odd that the Patriots were the 1. who gagged instead of Favre. New England dominated most of the second half, but managed a mere 11 points in the final 2 quarters until the last few seconds of the game. The Patriots simply killed themselves once they crossed into Jets territory. On the first drive of the third quarter, "

   "comment":"Favre now has 3 touchdowns, 7 interceptions and 3 fumbles near the Pacific Ocean. He has also taken 13 of his 30 sacks on the West Coast. In total, Favre now has more picks (15) than touchdowns (9) since the Jets' Week 5 bye.    As you can tell, Favre struggled in this contest. He was 18-of-31 for 187 yards and a pair of picks versus the defensively challenged Seahawks. You can't blame Favre for everything, however. "

However, they couldn't stop Chester Taylor (11 rushes, 73 yards), so it's not like the contained the run at all.    Brett Favre was nearly flawless, going 22-of-25 for 213 yards and 4 touchdowns.

The Vikings should have been awarded a first down and had the interception nullified, though to be fair, Favre wouldn't have been able to play right away and Tarvaris Jackson just would have thrown a pick anyway. But with that in mind, all the shady second-half and overtime calls would have been, as Emmitt would say, none and void if the Vikings hadn't committed 5 turnovers. Minnesota fumbled the ball 6 times and lost 3. Favre's second interception (at the end of regulation) was a horrific decision that Jay Cutler would have been proud of. Favre threw the ball late across his body over the middle of the field and had it picked off by "
