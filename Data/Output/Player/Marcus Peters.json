Hoyer answered with a drive led by passes to Nate Washington, Cecil Shorts, Jonathan Grimes, and a typical great catch by DeAndre Hopkins, who leapt over Peters for the score.

   "comment":"Peterson to jump the route. Peterson nearly picked Manziel again prior to intermission. Manziel also had terrible pocket presence at the beginning of the game. He reacted very poorly to the pressure he saw despite not going up against Justin Houston and Tamba Hali. However, Manziel turned things around in the second half. He made lots of nifty runs to pick up first downs. In fact, he scrambled so much that he appeared to be completely gassed. He did a good job of moving the chains, but ultimately came up short because a couple of mistakes. The 3 that stood out were a throw to right tackle "

He caught 7 of the 8 passes thrown to him for 83 yards and the touchdowns. He trailed only Edelman in the receiving department; Edelman saw a whopping 16 targets and hauled in 10 of them for an even 100 yards. As mentioned, he had a drop, and Brady missed him for what would have been a huge gain.    "

Fitzpatrick once again did not spot Johnson, and he undercut a route to make the play. He then returned the pick for a touchdown to make the game 24-3. That was the final dagger for the Jets. Fitzpatrick simply has to play better than he did today for the Jets. He was absolutely terrible and was a huge liability for the team. He really is not the answer at the quarterback position, and it appears as though his success last season was just a fluke.    Because of Fitzpatrick's struggles, New York's receivers did not do much. "

   "comment":"Peters was able to cover Jones relatively well, and then the stud receiver left due to an injury. After that, Ryan had to rely more on screens and gadget plays, solely because the other receivers are not too strong. Ryan was able to scramble for 23 yards on 3 carries though, and demonstrated a generally solid ability to evade the strong pass rush of the Chiefs.    As mentioned earlier, Jones was unsurprisingly the main target of Ryan. Jones led the team with 9 targets and caught 7 of them for 113 yards. He demonstrated great athleticism, and none of the Chiefs were able to cover him in the first quarter. Had he not gotten nicked up in the second half, he could have had an even better day.

Then, in the 4.h quarter, Roethlisberger took a sack on a rare occasion in which his excellent offensive line allowed heavy pressure. Roethlisberger finished 20-of-31 for 224 yards and the tipped interception. He played well, and was extremely clutch on a third-down pass to Antonio Brown at the very end to finish the game, but he and the rest of the offense needs to be better in the red zone against the Patriots.    Brown opened and concluded the game with big plays. He started by hauling in a 52-yard bomb, which Roethlisberger made after nearly getting tripped for a sack. At the end, Brown caught a third-down pass to move the chains and ice the game. Brown finished with 6 grabs for 108 yards. As mentioned, he nearly caught a touchdown, but Peters helped force a drop. Aside from Brown, only 3 Steelers caught multiple passes. Those were "
