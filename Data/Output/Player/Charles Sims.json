McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. His play made Jay Cutler look like a quarterback god even though he struggled as well. Cutler, who went 17-of-27 for 130 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, was booed heavily throughout the entire afternoon, particularly when Tampa dropped a potential interception of his on third down. He had some bad incompletions that weren't even close, and he was only able to generate 204 net yards of offense on just 3.6 yards per play.

   "comment":"Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, Sims.

   "comment":"Charles Sims for a touchdown but failed to connect with him. In other instances, DeSean Jackson was open. Winston will have time to improve on this, but it was a strong performance regardless.    As mentioned, the lead receiver for the Buccaneers was Evans (7-93, 1 TD). Evans was able to gain separation from Chicago's poor secondary easily, and justified his first-round fantasy billing. He will continue to be a WR1 week in and week out, and he can be trusted in almost any matchup. Elsewhere, DeSean Jackson had a solid performance, but it could have been better. Jackson caught 3 passes for 39 yards, but saw 7 targets in the game. Had Winston hit Jackson on some of the occasions when he was open, he could have had a superior line. Jackson is a boom-or-bust FLEX play, but can definitely be trusted against weaker secondaries.    Tampa Bay's run game started the contest poorly, but Jacquizz Rodgers eventually got going. He led the attack, notching 19 carries for 67 yards and a touchdown. He had some nice bursts, but looks more like a solid backup than a lead back. He may not hold on to the starting job when Doug Martin is back. For the other running backs, Charles Sims barely saw action (2 carries for 2 yards), while Peyton Barber saw more carries late in the contest finishing with 10 carries and 47 yards.Sims for a touchdown but failed to connect with him.
