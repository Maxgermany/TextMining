   "comment":"Kris Durham, who ran the wrong route on 1 play, resulting in an interception. Stafford eventually became so frustrated that he began heaving the ball off his back foot on what seemed like every other throw. He finished 27-of-45 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    The Packers tried their best to contain Megatron, but he still managed to catch 10 passes for 118 yards. He also drew a downfield penalty. He's now up to 1,538 yards on the season, leaving him 310 yards shy of Jerry Rice's single-season mark of 1,848. The record is definitely in reach.    The Lions split carries between "
