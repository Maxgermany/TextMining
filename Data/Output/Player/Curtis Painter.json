   "comment":"Painter. He was tackled, and for some unknown reason, tried to lateral to a teammate. His plan didn't work, however, as Carlos Dunlap scooped up the ball for the Bengals and ran it back for a touchdown. Cincinnati covered because of that score. It was bizarre. There was no reason for Garcon to do this. Had he just gone down, it would have been a 2nd-and-5 at his own 38 with about 2:10 remaining. Garcon just had a brain fart, and it cost Indianapolis bettors.    That play ruined a solid game for Garcon, who caught 8 balls for 52 yards. Reggie Wayne (5-58) and Dallas Clark (6-53, TD) had more yardage, though the latter hurt his team with a fumble on the opening drive. On the bright side, Clark redeemed himself with an impressive, 1.handed touchdown in the 4.h quarter.    Considering that he had no ground attack to speak of (Delone Carter had 45 yards on 14 carries), Curtis Painter played pretty decently. He went 23-of-34 for 188 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception that came in desperation mode.    When the schedule was released, and especially after Carson Palmer announced that he had $80 million in the bank, who in their right mind thought the Bengals would have the quarterback edge in this game?

   "comment":"Painter wasn't as terrible as usual Sunday. Keep the as usual in mind because he was still dreadful. He's just usually much, much worse, but wasn't completely inept against the Panthers. Considering how horrific Carolina's defense usually is, I guess this was to be expected. Painter's big mistake occurred in the 4.h quarter. Indianapolis had a 2nd-and-1 on the Panther 33-yard line with a few minutes remaining. The Colts' solid drive ended abruptly, however, because Painter foolishly decided to heave an underthrown ball into the end zone. There was no reason to do this because Carolina's defense was reeling. Painter had some other epic-fail moments. For instance, he had a miserable throw on 3rd-and-8 on the opening drive. I know most of Painter's passes are terrible, this was a work of art considering how bad it was. The ball was miles away from his intended receiver, and he wasn't trying to throw the ball away. Painter was also strip-sacked on the ensuing possession. He finished 15-of-29 for 226 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. Like I said before, he wasn't nearly as bad as he usually is, but he ultimately cost the Colts an opportunity to notch their first victory of the year.    Painter's score went to "

He caught 6 balls for 90 yards and a touchdown, and he also scored on a 49-yard rush. This wasn't a surprise, as the slot position is a big stat-producer in New York's offense. - Pierre Garcon (6-56) became the third receiver in NFL history to log 5 or more receptions in every single game this year. He did this on a day in which Antonio Brown accomplished the same feat, though Brown did so earlier in the afternoon. Jimmy Smith was the first. He accomplished this in 2001. - Alfred Morris didn't do much on the ground outside of a 19-yard scamper. He gained 62 yards on 16 carries. He also lost a fumble, though no damage was done because Painter tossed his pick on the ensuing Giants' possession. - This was a horrific offensive game.
