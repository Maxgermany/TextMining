   "comment":"Lamar Miller recorded just 3 yards on 10 carries. After 2 field goal drives in the first half, Tannehill threw a rocket to hit Brian Hartline for a 34-yard touchdown along the sideline after beating Buster Skrine. Miami was up 13-10 midway through the 4.h before Tannehill led a drive that ended with a 1.yard touchdown plunge by Daniel Thomas (8-14). The Dolphins tacked on another field goal with 4 minutes remaining. Tannehill's only miscue was a pass deflected by D'Qwell Jackson to set up an interception for Tashon Gipson, but that was a great play by Jackson. Tannehill completed 24-of-38 attempts for 272 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Hartline (9-114) was the Dolphins best receiver; he saw 16 targets fly his way. Brandon Gibson (7-77) dropped a few and Charles Clay (5-54) chipped in.    The Miami offensive line was a weakness. Lamar Miller (10-3) had a miserable game. "

Philbin awarded Miller more work following intermission, and Miller predictably gashed a weak run defense, gaining 53 yards and a touchdown on his 14 tries (he also had 3 catches for 40 receiving yards). Philbin also screwed up toward the end of the game. The Dolphins were unbelievably conservative on their final possession, as they didn't even bother to test a Green Bay secondary that had been reeling in the heat and humidity. Miami meekly punted away and gave Rodgers just enough time to engineer a game-winning drive.    While Rodgers was brilliant toward the end of the contest, "

Some quick stats for the Chargers: - Rivers was an atrocious 12-of-23 for 138 yards, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble (strip-sack). He just had no chance because his offensive line couldn't stop Miami's pass rush. The first pick occurred when Rivers couldn't step into the pocket amid a fierce pass rush. The second was forced into double coverage. The third was just a careless heave when the game was way out of hand. - "

   "comment":"Lamar Miller for a loss of 2 yards on the first play, and then he followed that up by sacking Ryan Tannehill for a loss of 10 on the ensuing snap, as he was able to beat Mike Pouncey with a power rush. Ziggy Ansah then took over on the next drive. He snuffed out a reverse and was able to tackle Jarvis Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - Matthew Stafford launched a pass toward Megatron deep downfield, but Brent Grimes was able to snare it with an amazing 1.handed catch. It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because DeAndre Levy dropped an easy interception in the end zone. - A field goal attempt by Detroit was blocked. Dion Jordan scooped up the ball and returned it to the Lions' 5-yard line. The Dolphins immediately converted with a Tannehill touchdown to Mike Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because Louis Delmas screwed up - but he broke up several passes intended for the league's best receiver.    Johnson wasn't the only Detroit receiver to eclipse the 100-yard barrier. Golden Tate was highly efficient, reeling in 11 of the 13 targets thrown in his direction for 109 yards. Tate made some key catches to move the chains.    The Lions didn't try to run the ball very much. Joique Bell mustered 44 yards on 10 carries, while Reggie Bush (4-20) hurt his ankle in the first half.    In addition to Bush, a couple of Detroit players got hurt. Stud guard Larry Warford was knocked out with a knee injury, and his absence didn't help an offensive line that couldn't block Cameron Wake. Safety James Ihedigbo also left the game, but was able to return.    Despite their slow start, the Dolphins held 2 separate leads in the second half. They held an advantage until there were 30 seconds remaining, and they easily could have prevailed. A horrible spot gave the Lions a first down, even after a review. Earlier, Charles Clay dropped a touchdown, and that conversion would've at least given Miami a chance to pull through in overtime. And even before that, Tannehill heaved a careless interception in the red zone. Being down by 1 would've made a difference; the Dolphins drove to their 40-yard line with 10 seconds left, so 1 long completion would have put them in position to try the game-winning kick. Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). "

He actually found the end zone twice, as he and Tannehill actually had some great chemistry with each other. He hauled in all 5 of his targets for 58 yards in addition to the scores.

   "comment":"Lamar Miller. Miami's running game had been non-existent in the first 4 games. But Miller was hot on Sunday. Miller had 19 carries for 113 yards and a touchdown. He was a guy you wanted to stay away from in fantasy leagues - until this week. Under Campbell, the Miami offense, which had passed the ball 73 percent of the time in the first 4 games, appears like it will be a much more balanced approach. In other words, pick up Miller now. He's worth a fantasy play if the Dolphins keep playing like this. Miller's touchdown was the first rushing score by the Dolphins this season and their first touchdown in the first quarter this season.    Miami quarterback "

Tannehill added his 4.h touchdown pass of the half with a 54-yard screen pass to Miller. He ran untouched into the end zone. If that wasn't bad enough, Texans tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz bobbled an easy catch, and Reshad Jones caught the deflection with a quick return of 23-yards for a touchdown. Under 3 minutes before the half, Lamar Miller ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run. Miami took a 41-0 lead into the locker room. Obviously, the second half was all garbage time.

   "comment":"Lamar Miller rushed for 20 times for the first time since December 1, 2013. And in the passing game, Tannehill threw the ball just 19 times. On the day, the Dolphins threw the ball 19 times and ran it 27 times. On the whole, Miami had 8 first downs and 219 total yards. That's not usually your recipe for a win, but the defense came up big.    The Dolphins' first score came in the second quarter with the game knotted up a0-0 after Reshad Jones intercepted a Matt Schaub pass deflected by defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. That turnover was quickly converted into a touchdown on the first play, as Tannehill put it up for rookie DeVante Parker, who jumped out of the stadium for a great catch to make it 7-0 Dolphins.    On a side note, Parker's ability has never been in question, but he wasn't doing enough in practice to move ahead of Rishard Matthews, but Matthews cracked his ribs last week against the Jets and Parker took over, catching a touchdown in the process. The Dolphins need his big-play ability to offset Jarvis Landry's slot receiver skills.    That Tannehill-to-Parker connection ended up being Miami's only offensive touchdown. The run-first, pass-sometimes game plan might not have worked if it weren't for miracle worker Matt Schaub, who, you guessed it, threw yet another pick-six. This 1 came about just 3 snaps and 20 game-play seconds after the Parker touchdown catch.    Schaub's pick-six was bad, but the fact that he threw 1 last week, in his first start of the season and that he now has thrown 6 pick-sixes in his last 9 starts, well, that's mind-bogglingly bad.    The Dolphins went up 15-0 after a Jay Ajayi 2-point conversion and that was all she wrote. Well, other stuff happened, but the Dolphins didn't score another point and still won the game.    That other stuff was mostly rookie Javorius Buck Allen, who played a great game, putting up 170 yards and a touchdown on 17 rushing attempts and an amazing 12 receptions! Matt Schaub was a checkdown machine with 13 targets to Allen, who did well to catch 12 of them and put up 107 yards receiving and his touchdown. Kamar Aiken couldn't do as much with his short- to mid-range targets, which he saw 11 of, but only caught 6 for 48 yards.    Schaub's conservative play almost got it done, as Justin Tucker hit 2 field goals and Allen took a short screen for a 41-yard touchdown, to bring the Ravens within 2 points, but that short timeframe when Schaub was picked twice in the second quarter, doomed Baltimore to yet another loss and a 4-8 record.    The Dolphins move to 5-7 and still have a slim hope of squeaking into the playoffs, but Tannehill has bred little confidence of late. And you don't get to play Matt Schaub every week. If Miami's defense can come up big the rest of the season, and Jay Ajayi and Lamar Miller can control the ground game, this team could turn things around enough to at least stay in the hunt.   "

   "comment":"Lamar Miller at running back, and drafting Will Fuller in the first round. Those 3 players came up huge for Houston's offense to lead the team to the victory. Bears quarterback Jay Cutler played really well in the first half, but the Texans' defense dominated the final 2 quarters and battered Cutler with a serious pass rush to shut out Chicago after intermission.    Osweiler had a good first drive going to open the game, but in Chicago territory, Tracy Porter out-fought DeAndre Hopkins for a 50-50 pass and came away with an interception. Jay Cutler took advantage and started moving the ball down the field, including an excellent catch by Alshon Jeffery. To end the drive, Jeremy Langford plunged into the end zone from a yard out and gave the Bears a quick 7-0 lead. Chicago's defense quickly got off the field and Eddie Royal had a 31-yard punt return to the Texans' 40-yard line, but the Texans stopped the Bears on 4.h-and-1 to get the ball back. Houston was able to get a field goal drive thanks to Miller's running. The Texans took the lead with a 23-yard touchdown to Hopkins as, once again, he made a phenomenal contested catch. At the end of the second quarter, Will Fuller dropped what would have been an 83-yard touchdown, and the Bears responded by hitting Jeffery for a 54-yard gain. With only a play before having to settle a field goal, Cutler threw a perfect strike to Royal for a 19-yard touchdown after he worked over Kareem Jackson. That gave the Bears a 14-10 halftime lead. At the start of the third quarter, Kevin White ran the wrong route, and that let Andre Hal pick off a pass to set up the Texans in Chicago territory. Houston had to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, Fuller caught a 27-yard pass to get into Bears territory. He finished the drive by making a shoestring catch on a wide receiver screen before using his speed to dart down the field for an 18-yard touchdown. Shortly later on a third down, Fuller made a superb leaping grab of about 30 yards and set up a short field goal for Nick Novak. Houston's defense then slammed the door for the win.    Brock Osweiler completed 22-of-35 for 231 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He threw the ball better than the numbers illustrate, and he easily could have had a couple more touchdown passes.    Lamar Miller ran for 106 yards on 28 carries with 4 receptions for 11 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins had 5 catches for 54 yards with a score. Will Fuller (5-107-1) had a great debut aside from his drop. Chicago's corners couldn't run with Fuller, especially in the second half. Osweiler targeted Fuller heavily, at times more than Hopkins, and if you need a wideout for your fantasy team, Fuller could be an adept pickup.    Jay Cutler was 16-of-29 for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He played better than the numbers illustrate as well. The Bears' offensive tackles got whipped in the second half.    Jeremy Langford ran for 57 yards on 17 carries, but bailed out his fantasy owners with a score.    Alshon Jeffery had 4 catches for 105 yards. Eddie Royal (4-57-1) chipped well in the first half, and Kevin White (3-34) flashed at times.    Chicago's front 7 played well overall, but the secondary struggled. "

   "comment":"Lamar Miller (3-29). Fiedorowicz is an interesting name, as he has some potential, but he was taking advantage of the slowest linebacking corps in the NFL. Ryan Grigson deserves a trophy for putting this abomination of a defense together.    Speaking of horrible defense, the Colts couldn't stop Miller on the ground. Miller gained 149 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. That's saying a lot, as the Texans were down 2 starting offensive linemen, and Miller hadn't produced very much prior to this contest.    "

   "comment":"Lamar Miller scored to give Houston a 14-0 lead. A Jadeveon Clowney sack led to a punt that set up the Texans in Lions territory with 80 seconds remaining in the half. However, Osweiler threw an interception to Johnson Bademosi. It was really the only bad play of the game for Osweiler and was a nice move by Bademosi. Stafford responded by moving the ball into the Texans' territory with a 33-yard pass to Eric Ebron, and this time, Prater was good on a 47-yarder to cut the lead to 14-3 at the half. In the third quarter, Osweiler led a drive past midfield. Jim Caldwell didn't challenge a potential fumble by Hopkins that was ruled incomplete and recovered by the Lions. A 23-yard pass to Will Fuller (1-23) set up a Houston field goal. Stafford answered by moving into Texans territory with 2 passes to Theo Riddick for almost 30 yards and a third-down conversion to Ebron. A pass interference on Corey Moore on Ebron in the end zone put the ball at the 1-yard line. A short touchdown pass to Theo Riddick cut the Texans' lead to 17-10 early in the 4.h quarter. Houston put a clock-eating drive together led by Miller and Alfred Blue running the ball into the red zone. However, guard Xavier Su'a-Filo ruined the drive with a holding call and then allowed a sack on third down, so the Texans settled for a Nick Novack field goal. Detroit got a good return to midfield and with quick passes to Tate (7-42) and Riddick, and moved the ball to Houston's 21-yard line. The Texans' defense a stopped the Lions there, and Prater hit a short field goal to cut it to 20-13 with just under 3 minutes remaining. Surprisingly, Detroit went for an onside kick with 2:52 remaining and all 3 timeouts available. The Texans easily recovered the ball, and that set them up in Detroit territory. It made more sense to kick it deep and make the Texans drive the ball while aiming for getting the ball back in better field position. In the end, it didn't matter because Miller ran well to get a few first downs and run out the clock on the Lions.    Stafford was 27-of-41 for 240 yards with a touchdown. The Texans have 1 of the best pass defenses in the NFL, and they proved it against the Lions, who were red hot entering this game. Cornerback A.J. Bouye played well against for Houston, while veteran cornerbacks Kareem Jackson and Johnathan Joseph had bounce-back performances and were very good in coverage.    Eric Ebron (7-79) led the Lions in receiving and ate up Texans safety Corey Moore. Marvin Jones (3-33) and Anquan Boldin (1-4) were non-factors. One mistake the Lions made was not running the ball more against Houston's vulnerable run defense. Theo Riddick was his normal dangerous self with 11 carries for 56 yards and 8 catches for 77 yards with 1 touchdown.    Osweiler completed 20-of-29 passes for 186 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. He plays much better at home and will have to improve his road performances coming off the bye.    Lamar Miller (17-56-1) struggled to get any yardage until the 4.h quarter. DeAndre Hopkins (4-44) and C.J. Fiedorowicz (5-43-1) were the Texans' leading receivers.   "
