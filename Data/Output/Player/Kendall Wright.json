   "comment":"Kendall Wright. Later on, a Wright. Later on, a Ryan Tannehill pass was tipped, picked and returned for 6. Tannehill would then toss another interception because he forced a throw. This led to another Titan score. As all of this was going on, the Dolphins were killing themselves with penalties (5 in the first half). Mix in poor tackling on both Chris Johnson and Locker, and that was the perfect recipe for their complete first-half meltdown.    CJ2K - I feel like I can call him that again - had yet another monstrous performance. He rushed for 126 yards and a touchdown on 23 tries. He still looked 10.ative while looking for running room, but the difference is that his blockers are doing a better job.    Locker finished with 9 completions out of 21 attempts for 122 yards. However, he threw 2 touchdowns and scrambled for 36 yards (Cam Newton, take note of another running quarterback who is actually running).    No Titan logged more than 2 receptions. In fact, only a pair of Titans - Kenny Britt (2-36) and Damian Williams (2-31) - had more than 1 catch. Locker's scores went to Jared Cook (26 yards) and Wright (9 yards).    Meanwhile, the Dolphins had a rough outing offensively. I mentioned the early turnovers; Ryan Tannehill threw yet another interception later on. He finished 23-of-39 for 217 yards and 3 picks and failed to complete a pass longer than 17 yards. This was a reality check after an alleged hot start.    "

   "comment":"Kendall Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Delanie Walker for a 10-yard touchdown. On the next third down, Schaub threw a weak pass off his back foot and it floated right to Alterraun Verner, who cruised into the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown. Hopkins ran the wrong route to set up the interception. The Texans responded by moving the ball with passes to Hopkins and a gain to Andre Johnson to the 3-yard line. Johnson (8-76) was injured on the play and headed into the locker room to end his game with what looked like a possible concussion courtesy of a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bernard Pollard. That set up a short touchdown run from Arian Foster. Foster carried a defender to convert the 2.point conversion to tie it at 24. Houston got the ball back, and a 34-yard pass play to Keshawn Martin set up a last-ditch field goal from 46 yards out that was missed by Randy Bullock, his third miss of the game. The first 2 were from 51 yards. In overtime, runs by Foster (19-79) and Ben Tate (9-93) set up a miraculous catch by Hopkins to get the Texans to the 2.yard line. Houston won the game on third-and-goal when Schaub threw a ball along the sideline to Hopkins (7-117), and the rookie made a fabulous reception while tapping his feet in bounds for the score. Schaub finished 26-of-48 for 298 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Owen Daniels (2-24) had a beautiful diving grab for a 12-yard score. Garrett Graham caught Schaub's other score.    Locker moved the ball well at times with some short precision passes to go along with some Johnson (25-96) runs. Locker tossed a short touchdown toss to Wright on a nice throw and catch in the first quarter. But aside from 2 drives, Tennessee struggled to move the ball. "

Baltimore got right back into the game as Bobby Rainey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. It was a weird play where Rainey was tripped up by his own teammate and the Bears' coverage unit stopped pursuing thinking he was down, but Rainey got up to dart downfield for the score. Late in the third quarter, the Ravens got a well-timed turnover as Eric Weddle stripped Cohen (14-32) of the ball, and Baltimore pounced on it to get set up at the Bears' 39-yard line. Flacco moved the ball inside the 10 with a third-down conversion to Nick Boyle, but Chicago's defense held strong to force a field goal and maintain a 17-13 lead. Baltimore got the ball back when Ladarius Webb blindsided Trubisky to force a fumble that the Ravens recovered near midfield. The Ravens moved well into Chicago territory before Flacco threw to a well-covered receiver. Kyle Fuller tipped the pass away, and Adrian Amos caught the deflection, returning the ball 90 yards for a touchdown. That gave the Bears a 24-13 lead with only 5 minutes remaining. The Ravens produced a field-goal drive to make it 24-16. Just after the 2-minute warning, Baltimore's Michael Campanaro returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown, and Flacco found Boyle wide open in the flat for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 24 and force overtime. It was a terrible move by Bears punter Pat O'Donnell to give Campanaro a chance. In overtime, Jordan Howard broke downfield on a 53-yard run to the Baltimore 40. Trubisky made a great play, scrambling to avoid rushers and slinging a pass to Kendall Wright (2-36) for a leaping grab of 18 yards. That set up Wright.
