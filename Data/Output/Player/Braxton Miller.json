   "comment":"Braxton Miller when Pacman Jones slipped in coverage, and then he had a pick-six that was dropped. Watson then held on to the ball too long on 1 occasion, and was absolutely flattened by Miller when Pacman Jones slipped in coverage, and then he had a pick-six that was dropped. Watson then held on to the ball too long on 1 occasion, and was absolutely flattened by Geno Atkins. I was wondering if Watkins had suffered a concussion, but he scampered for a brilliant 49-yard touchdown immediately afterward. It was a breath-taking play that had the announcers comparing it to Michael Jordon's athletic ability, referencing what Watson's college coach said of him. Watson's second half was nondescript until the penultimate offensive drive. Bill O'Brien suddenly had trust in Watson even though the Texans were pinned in their own territory. Rather than trying to run out the clock, O'Brien had Watson drop back to pass repeatedly, and it paid off big time. Watson had some clutch completions to DeAndre Hopkins, setting up a field goal to ice the victory. Watson was 4-of-6 for 31 yards with an 11-yard scramble on that possession, allowing Houston to kick a 42-yard field goal to go up 4. Watson, who went 15-of-24 for 125 yards, led the team in rushing, gaining 67 yards and a touchdown on 5 scrambles. Lamar Miller (18-61) and D'Onta Foreman (12-40) struggled to find running room, so they'll also benefit whenever Brown returns to action."

   "comment":"Braxton Miller wide open, but didn't see him. He took off for a scramble and was short of the line to gain, so the Texans had to punt. Watson also panicked on his real interception, as he threw off his back foot because of a heavy pass rush. What Watson did otherwise more than made up for it. He fired a touchdown to Miller wide open, but didn't see him. He took off for a scramble and was short of the line to gain, so the Texans had to punt. Watson also panicked on his real interception, as he threw off his back foot because of a heavy pass rush. What Watson did otherwise more than made up for it. He fired a touchdown to Bruce Ellington, with a perfect pass down the seam. He overthrew a tight end for a potential touchdown in the second half, but came back to get out of a potential sack by 4 New England defenders and connected with D'Onta Foreman for a 31-yard reception. Watson was brilliant considering the circumstances, and this game made it clear that he has the potential to be a star in the NFL. He still needs to work on his ball placement, but he could conceivably lead the Texans into the playoffs this year. If there's a rematch against the Patriots in January, I'll be looking for to it.    Only 4 Texans caught multiple passes, and the leading receiver was DeAndre Hopkins, who secured 7 receptions for 76 yards. He also drew a deep pass interference flag on Stephon Gilmore. Foreman (2-65), Ryan Griffin (5-61) and Ellington (4-59) were the others. Griffin caught Watson's other touchdown.    In addition to Foreman's receiving yardage, the rookie also rushed for 25 yards on 8 carries. Lamar Miller (14-56) handled more of the workload, but I can't help but think that Foreman should be featured more often.    Going back to the Patriots, Brady needed a heroic effort to win this game. Missing his right tackle and having his blind-side protector banged up, Brady had to fight a fierce Houston pass rush that harassed him all afternoon. Brady took 5 sacks in total, which is a high number for him. One of the sacks involved a strip, which "
