Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Phillips, which should've gone the other way.

Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On 4.h-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2.point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the 4.h quarter.
