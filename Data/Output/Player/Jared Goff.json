   "comment":"Jared Goff looked completely lost against Bill Belichick and Matt Patricia's schemes. Belichick and Patricia came into this contest planning on confusing Goff with dealyed blitzes. It definitely worked, as the Rams' protection assignments were horrible. Goff took 4 sacks as a result, and he could've been brought down on numerous other occasions as a result, but was able to use his mobility to escape. That was actually the 1 positive to take away from Goff's performance; his ability to escape pressure on some plays was actually quite impressive. Unfortunately for Goff, the passing left much to be desired. He failed to complete half of his throws, going 14-of-32 for only 161 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. With the heavy pressure that he saw, Goff had to dink and dunk. He tried to complete some intermediate passes, but his receivers dropped countless balls. I also wouldn't charge him with the picks either; the first was a bobble by "

   "comment":"Jared Goff would not be in the first round. Goff is that horrible. It's crazy that prominent members of the Rams' organization wanted to take Carson Wentz, and yet they selected Goff instead. Goff doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL.    The Falcons were without Julio Jones, but it didn't matter as they dominated Los Angeles. Through 3 quarters, Atlanta was up 42-0, as the Rams' offense was horrible at not turning the ball over and the defense was incapable of stopping Matt Ryan. Atlanta maintained its positioning with Tampa Bay for the NFC South, while Los Angeles will have to win its final 3 in order to maintain Jeff Fisher's 7-9 standard. After losing their ninth game of the season, this marks the 10th straight year that the Rams will be under .500.    The blowout started on the opening kickoff, as the Rams muffed the catch and the ball rolled around before Paul Worrilow recovered it for the Falcons at the Rams' 3-yard line. The next play saw Ryan hit a back-shoulder throw to Justin Hardy for a touchdown. Atlanta then put another touchdown on the board as Ryan used 5 different weapons with completions to Aldrick Robinson (3-42), Levine Toiliolo (1-19) and a 6.yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. The Falcons added to their lead when Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff demonstrated poor field vision, throwing a pass right to Deion Jones for an interception."

   "comment":"Jared Goff fail to win a single game in his rookie campaign; he also didn't cover a spread. According to metrics, no quarterback this decade was as awful as Goff was in 2016. In fact, no other quarterback was even close. With that in mind, the work that new head coach Sean McVay and quarterbacks coach Greg Olson have put into Goff is amazing. Goff looks like a totally new player. It helps that he has an improved offensive line, but Goff no longer has a deer-in-the-headlights look that he possessed so often last year. Goff still holds the ball too long in the pocket at times, and he has some mechanical issues that need to be worked out - he threw off his back foot on some occasions - but he looks light years better than he did in 2016. Goff finished 21-of-29 for 306 yards and a touchdown. The Rams kept Goff throwing until the very end because they wanted him to eclipse the 300-yard barrier. He managed to do so, and it was a nice moment for him. Granted, he played against what could be the worst defense in the NFL, but this initial victory is a nice building block.    Goff's favorite target in training camp and the preseason was "

   "comment":"Jared Goff had a fine performance that was certainly a regression from his Week 1 performance. Goff went 15-for-25 with 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. The pick was probably his worst throw of the game, and it came in the team's final drive of the contest. Goff looked directly at a short checkdown, allowing Mason Foster to jump the route. It essentially sealed the victory for the Redskins. Still, the California product looks a lot better in Sean McVay's offense than he did all of last season. Goff looked poised in the pocket and was confident in his arm. He was fairly accurate and his receivers when open. Goff did hold on to the ball too long at times, but he certainly has grown a lot since last year.    Goff's top receivers on Sunday were a couple of rookies. "
