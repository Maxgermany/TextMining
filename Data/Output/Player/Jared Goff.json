The Rams, who were winning at the time, had a ton of momentum, but it quickly vanished when a pass interference bailed New Orleans out. Ever since that play, the Saints were unstoppable on offense. They ripped through Los Angeles' defense with ease, thanks to poor tackling and even worse play-calling by Gregg Williams. The Saints' former coordinator was absolutely bewildered at times. He had no sense for what the Saints were trying to do, getting caught with his pants down on some trick plays. He also called a completely senseless blitz on a third-and-long, allowing Brees to score a touchdown to Mark Ingram on a simple dump-off pass.    Brees finished a nearly flawless 28-of-36 for 310 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Again, he was guilty of 2 early mistakes, but he recovered and was completely unstoppable after that. He misfired on just 3 occasions after halftime!    Two of Brees' 4 aerial touchdowns went to Michael Thomas, who reeled in 9 of his 10 targets for 108 yards. Thomas was a monster, as he was able to rebound off of 2 poor performances. The dynamic rookie made only 1 mistake on the afternoon, failing to run out of bounds in the 2-minute drill, which negated a scoring opportunity. Brees, meanwhile, didn't throw at all to Brandin Cooks. He was definitely on the field a bunch, but he inexplicably didn't see a single target. It's impossible to criticize this, however, as the Saints scored 49 points. Brees' other scores were thrown to Mark Ingram and Brandon Coleman. Tim Hightower also scored on a reception, a 50-yarder, but that was thrown by Willie Snead. Hightower was wide open, as it was 1 of Gregg Williams' many blunders of the afternoon.    Speaking of the running backs, Ingram performed brilliantly. He burst for a 61-yard rush to open the third quarter and later scored a touchdown when Williams foolishly called an all-out blitz. Ingram gained a whopping 146 yards on the ground and 2 total touchdowns on just 14 carries. Hightower (15-51) saw most of his workload in garbage time.    Moving on to the Rams, they had some unexpected offensive success in the early going, as Jared Goff torched the Rams on the opening drive. Goff to Kenny Britt.

It's crazy that prominent members of the Rams' organization wanted to take Carson Wentz, and yet they selected Goff instead. Goff doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL.    The Falcons were without Julio Jones, but it didn't matter as they dominated Los Angeles. Through 3 quarters, Atlanta was up 42-0, as the Rams' offense was horrible at not turning the ball over and the defense was incapable of stopping Matt Ryan. Atlanta maintained its positioning with Tampa Bay for the NFC South, while Los Angeles will have to win its final 3 in order to maintain Jeff Fisher's 7-9 standard. After losing their ninth game of the season, this marks the 10th straight year that the Rams will be under .500.    The blowout started on the opening kickoff, as the Rams muffed the catch and the ball rolled around before Paul Worrilow recovered it for the Falcons at the Rams' 3-yard line. The next play saw Ryan hit a back-shoulder throw to Justin Hardy for a touchdown. Atlanta then put another touchdown on the board as Ryan used 5 different weapons with completions to Aldrick Robinson (3-42), Levine Toiliolo (1-19) and a 6.yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. The Falcons added to their lead when Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff demonstrated poor field vision, throwing a pass right to Deion Jones for an interception.Goff would not be in the first round.

The pick was probably his worst throw of the game, and it came in the team's final drive of the contest. Goff looked directly at a short checkdown, allowing Mason Foster to jump the route. It essentially sealed the victory for the Redskins. Still, the California product looks a lot better in Sean McVay's offense than he did all of last season. Goff looked poised in the pocket and was confident in his arm. He was fairly accurate and his receivers when open. Goff did hold on to the ball too long at times, but he certainly has grown a lot since last year.    Goff's top receivers on Sunday were a couple of rookies. "

Third-string running back Raheem Mostert fumbled, which allowed the Rams to kick a field goal. Hoyer missed an open Pierre Garcon. George Kittle dropped a pass. It was a comedy of errors for the 49ers, who were playing in front of lots of empty seats in Santa Clara. The 49ers stopped committing unforced mistakes in the second half, perhaps because the Rams were so exhausted defensively. The injuries didn't help either. They lost star safety Lamarcus Joyner to a hamstring, and Michael Brockers and Robert Quinn had to leave the game with injuries at some point. San Francisco, a team that hadn't scored a single touchdown entering this contest, transformed into an offensive machine, as both Garcon and Marquise Goodwin made circus catches along the sidelines to help Hoyer, who was gaining more confidence with every throw. A Pharoh Cooper fumbled kickoff return helped, setting up the 49ers with the opportunity to tie the game, deep in Rams territory. They managed to score on 4.h down with a tough Carlos Hyde run, but missed on the 2.point conversion, as the receiver Hoyer threw to ran a bad route. The 49ers still had a chance after that because they recovered an onside kick. However, Aaron Donald closed out the game, sacking Hoyer on 4.h down.    Gurley was an absolute monster for the Rams. He rushed for 113 yards on 28 carries, and he was once again a big-time factor in the passing game, catching 5 of his 7 targets for 36 receiving yards. He scored thrice, but would've had 5 touchdowns had he not been stuffed on the goal line on 2 separate drives. A major reason for this was center John Sullivan getting knocked out with an injury. Backup Austin Blythe couldn't get as much of a push. It'll be important for the Rams to have Sullivan in next week's game against the Cowboys.    Goff continued to improve, as he misfired on just 6 occasions. Granted, this was against San Francisco's inept defense, but he looked so much better than last year, going 22-of-28 for 292 yards and 3 touchdowns. Goff still holds on to the ball too long, and as Cris Collinsworth mentioned, he drifts back in the pocket too often. That said, he works hard, so he should be able to improve in these facets. Until he does, however, he'll be in trouble when battling tough defenses. The 49ers simply couldn't get to the quarterback very often, but some other teams - like the Redskins last week - will be able to.    Two of Goff's touchdowns went to "

Six games into the season, Los Angeles is in great position to challenge for the playoffs this year. Jacksonville, meanwhile, continued its season of up-and-down play, dropping a game at home with some terrible special teams play and the limitations of Blake Bortles being visible again. The Jaguars' defense played well again, but they were unable to bail out their special teams units and quarterback.    Right out of the gate, Rams wideout Pharaoh Cooper returned the opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown. He made a great spin move away from a scrum to escape to the sideline, where he found open field to run away from the Jacksonville coverage unit. On the Jaguars' first play from scrimmage, Fournette ran untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. At just 15 seconds into the game, the score was tied at 7. The Rams produced a field goal drive with Greg the Leg Zuerlein drilling a 56-yarder. The Jaguars answered with a drive that produced a 22-yard touchdown with a screen pass to Chris Ivory (9-74). The Rams took the lead with a drive that saw them moved down the field with Goff completing passes to Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp."

Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs.
