Here's this week's edition in case you missed it: These 2 teams played 2 weeks ago, so you know they'll remember each other's names. Maybe Nessler needs to announce a game between the same 2 teams that he announced 2 weeks ago, since he has all kinds of problems knowing the players' names. I wonder who this Marcellus Lewis fellow is... Indeed. He referred to Marcedes Lewis as Marcellus Lewis when the tight end caught his first-quarter touchdown.
