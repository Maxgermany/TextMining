   "comment":"Melvin Ingram caused an interception with a nasty hit on Matthew Stafford. The Chargers preceded to go on a 30-0 run before Detroit made it look a bit closer with a late touchdown that finished out the game with a 33-28 San Diego win.    The Lions' offense looked unstoppable early on; rookie running back Ingram caused an interception with a nasty hit on Matthew Stafford. The Chargers preceded to go on a 30-0 run before Detroit made it look a bit closer with a late touchdown that finished out the game with a 33-28 San Diego win.    The Lions' offense looked unstoppable early on; rookie running back Ameer Abdullah ran for a 24-yard touchdown in a fashion that made Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle look like he was the rookie in the open field. Abdullah appeared to have an extra gear in in all aspects of the game as he finished with 7 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, 4 receptions on 4 targets for 44 yards and 105 yards on 3 kickoff returns. Maybe the Lions should have given him Joique Bell's 6 carries, which resulted in 14 yards.    Turnovers were a big part of this game as both Philip Rivers and Matthew Stafford threw a pair of interceptions, and rookie Melvin Gordon lost a fumble. Those 3 turnovers by the Chargers played a big part in their early deficit with 1 interception returned for a touchdown and the other 2 turnovers halting what were nice drives. So in reality, San Diego's surge wasn't exactly out of the blue.    Except for a couple of poor throws on his interceptions, Philip Rivers was on target all game, completing 35-of-42 passes for 404 yards and 2 touchdowns. A whopping 17 of those passes were aimed at Keenan Allen, who caught 15 - yes, 15 - for 166 yards. Allen was unstoppable on short to intermediate routes and picked up nice yards after the catch, highlighted by a third-and-19 situation when he caught an underneath pass and gained 20 yards for the first down.    The next most-targeted Charger, with 7. was Danny Woodhead, who took a back seat to Melvin Gordon on the first few drives, but as soon as the Chargers were down by over 2 touchdowns, Woodhead was the main back due to his pass-catching/pass-blocking ability. Woodhead caught 4 passes for 20 yards, but did most of his damage on the ground as he rushed 12 times for 42 yards and 2 touchdowns. Both touchdowns came in the red zone, with 1 being a draw play from 9 yards out. The other score was a 1-yard goal-line run with 6 minutes left in the game. Gordon is more suited for goal-line carries, but his fumble earlier in the game may have given the coaching staff pause with the lead 26-21 at the time.    Melvin Gordon looked excellent early in the game with strong, chain-moving runs, yet also showed agile feet and good hands as he caught 3 passes. This came against a strong Lions run defense and bodes well for games in which the Chargers get early leads. He finished with 14 carries for 51 yards and 3 receptions on 3 targets for 16 yards.    Matthew Stafford finished with a 63-percent completion rate, but couldn't get his top receivers, Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate, going. The Chargers concentrated on bracketing Megatron out of the game, and Tate ended up with the most targets, 8. but only caught 4 for 24 yards. No Lions' player topped 53 yards receiving, and Stafford never looked quite the same after taking the hard hit from Ingram, which caused Detroit's first interception. There's nothing to point toward that would prove Stafford has an injury, but the outlook of the game changed after that hit.    The 1 pass-catcher who put up decent numbers was tight end "

   "comment":"Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.    Blake Bortles was 31-of-50 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His accuracy was off in the first half. Allen Robinson (3-54) and Allen Hurns (5-64) were held in check as the Chargers cornerbacks of Jason Verrett, Casey Hayward and Brandon Flowers really played well.    Melvin Ingram led the San Diego defense with 2 sacks and played very well.    To add injury to insult, Jaguars left tackle Kelvin Beachum had to be braced and carted off the field in the third quarter after getting hit in the head. It looked very serious, but he was reportedly moving his hands and arms while on his way to the hospital. Jacksonville's offensive line was bad, and guard Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering.

   "comment":"Melvin Ingram scooped up loose ball and ran it 38 yards for a touchdown. Taylor led a touchdown drive, throwing a corner route to McCoy for a 12-yard touchdown.    Rivers completed 20-of-32 passes for 251 yards and 2 touchdowns. Allen has 12 receptions for 159 yards and 2 scores.    Gordon totaled 80 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown.    Taylor was 15-of-25 for 158 yards and a touchdown. Peterman was 6-of-14 for 66 yards with 5 interceptions.    McCoy was the lone bright spot for the Bills, totaling 114 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown catch.    The Chargers' defense got an excellent game from their pass-rushing tandem of Ingram and Bosa. They hit Peterman as he threw on a few of his interceptions, helping to cause some fo those turnovers; not to mention the Bosa strip-sack that Ingram returned for a score.   "
