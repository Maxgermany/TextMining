   "comment":"Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.    Blake Bortles was 31-of-50 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His accuracy was off in the first half. Allen Robinson (3-54) and Allen Hurns (5-64) were held in check as the Chargers cornerbacks of Jason Verrett, Casey Hayward and Brandon Flowers really played well.    Melvin Ingram led the San Diego defense with 2 sacks and played very well.    To add injury to insult, Jaguars left tackle Kelvin Beachum had to be braced and carted off the field in the third quarter after getting hit in the head. It looked very serious, but he was reportedly moving his hands and arms while on his way to the hospital. Jacksonville's offensive line was bad, and guard "

Rivers completed 20-of-32 passes for 251 yards and 2 touchdowns. Allen has 12 receptions for 159 yards and 2 scores.    Gordon totaled 80 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown.    Taylor was 15-of-25 for 158 yards and a touchdown. Peterman was 6-of-14 for 66 yards with 5 interceptions.    McCoy was the lone bright spot for the Bills, totaling 114 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown catch.    The Chargers' defense got an excellent game from their pass-rushing tandem of Ingram and Bosa. They hit Peterman as he threw on a few of his interceptions, helping to cause some fo those turnovers; not to mention the Bosa strip-sack that Ingram returned for a score.   "
