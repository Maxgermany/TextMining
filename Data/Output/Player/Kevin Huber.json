   "comment":"Huber punt. The second was the result of Benson being stopped twice with a yard to go to force the ball over on downs. Cincinnati came out strong on its first second-half possession. It was not a dominant drive, but they converted twice on third down and mixed up their play selection. The 51-yard drive resulted in a 41-yard boot from Nugent to tie the score at 6. After an exchange of punts on modest possessions, the Bengals changed the game. First the defense stood tall, quickly ending a possession on a 3-and-out when "

   "comment":"Huber left the game with various maladies.    Andy Dalton played poorly for most of this contest. He may have finished 25-of-44 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, but most of that came in garbage time. Just as Roethlisberger completed his 12th-consecutive pass to open the game, Dalton was a pathetic 2-of-10 for 15 yards. He was under tremendous pressure all evening, taking 8 sacks. Dalton's scores went to Marvin Jones (5-48), who had a drop, and Tyler Eifert (3-33). A.J. Green didn't find the end zone, but he snagged 9 catches for 93 yards. Ike Taylor, who has been torched by nearly everyone this year, inexplicably did a good job covering Green. Taylor also played well against Green in their Week 2 tilt.    Giovani Bernard handled most of the workload, but mustered just 33 yards on 13 carries. Bernard at least scored a touchdown. BenJarvus Green-Ellis, meanwhile, had just 4 yards on 4 carries. He spent most of the game standing on the sideline.    I mentioned earlier that the Steelers outplayed the Bengals in every facet. This includes special teams. In the first quarter, the Bengals botched a punt as the wind blew away a snap heading toward Huber, who picked up the ball and was tackled at his own 1-yard line. Later on, Brown returned a punt for a touchdown. Huber suffered a crushing hit after that, so he had to leave the game with a jaw injury. Kicker "
