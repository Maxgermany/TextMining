   "comment":"Tom Brady had to leave the game with a knee injury and Randy Moss fumbled - both of which happened on the same play.    You may argue that the Patriots' slim 7-point victory was the result of Tom Brady getting hurt, and I'm not sure I can really argue that all that much, except for the fact that the game was scoreless when Brady had to leave with his knee injury. It looks like Brady is out with a torn ACL.    Besides, "

   "comment":"Tom Brady after a loss. Everyone seemed down on them after they were physically dominated by the Jets. Bill Simmons even took the Falcons moneyline on his podcast. Yet, New England avoided consecutive losses once again; the last time they lost 2 in a row was in 2006.    Tom Brady was 25-of-42 for 277 yards and a touchdown. He was still a bit shaky and he was errant in the red zone, but he did a great job converting third downs and keeping drives alive. The Patriots were 8-of-18 on third downs and won the time-of-possession battle by 19 minutes.    One reason the Patriots really struggled in the red zone was "

   "comment":"Tom Brady struggles this much against 1 team. Including the playoffs, Brady is 102-30 as a starter. Against the Broncos, he's now 1-6.    The Broncos did a great job winning this contest and improving to 5-0, but they nearly gave the game away twice in the second half. The Broncos received a punt around midfield after holding the Patriots to a 3-and-out in the third quarter. However, there was a bogus running-into-the-kicker penalty that nearly caused Josh McDaniels to have an aneurysm. The Patriots got the first down. Later on the same drive but in the 4.h quarter, Denver once again forced the Patriots into a punting situation. Unfortunately, they were offside on 4th-and-4, giving New England yet another first down. At that point, it looked like Denver was destined to lose. But give them credit for eventually getting the Patriots to punt for a third time.    The Broncos ran a weird formation in this game that was dubbed the Wild Horses. Knowshon Moreno lined up in the backfield by himself. Kyle Orton, stationed in the slot, was allowed to scan the field and come in under center. It was pretty smart on McDaniels' part because it forced the Patriots to stick with their coverage. Orton completed every single pass out of the Wild Horses. Phil Simms, who called the game, was shocked by this phenomenon and opined that the Wild Horses could never be stopped. Expect every team to be running this by Halloween.    Kyle Orton did a phenomenal job moving the chains in this game, going 35-of-48 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick (off a Hail Mary). Orton played without a glove for the first time all year. If he keeps this up, he'll burn every single pair of gloves that he owns.    Eddie Royal - where have you been? Royal finally had the type of performance I expected of him going into the season. Royal caught 10 balls for 90 yards. I don't know if it was Orton's glove-less hand or the new Wild Horses formation, but let's hope he keeps this up.    Brandon Marshall continues to play well; he caught 8 balls for 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. Marshall showed up to his post-game interview in a full Colorado Rockies uniform (with the helmet too). It's only a matter of time before he punches another TV.    Moreno started this game with Correll Buckhalter out and got most of the carries. Moreno rushed 21 times for 88 yards. He also caught 4 balls for 36 yards. Unfortunately, Moreno lost a fumble early on and subsequently carried the ball with both hands on every touch.    Tom Brady went 19-of-33 for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had a chance to win the game late in the 4.h quarter, but fumbled the ball away. The story here is that while Brady had tons of protection early in the contest, he was pressured late after "

   "comment":"Tom Brady is back, but I honestly don't know if you can take away anything from this game. I know Tom Brady was 29-of-34 for 380 yards and 6 touchdowns, and I know he set the record for most touchdowns thrown in a single quarter (5) in the Super Bowl era, but it really looked like Brady was playing in a 7-on-7 drill. The Titans seemed as if they gave up, leaving all of Brady's receivers wide open. Given that they were 0-5 going into the contest and weren't prepared for the snow coming from Tennessee, that shouldn't be a surprise. This game really reminded me of New England's thrashing of Arizona last year.    Brady made "

Koetter, of course, elected to have David Garrard (19-25, 185 yards, 2 INTs, 1 fumble) throw the ball. Garrard's pass sailed over his receiver's head by about 10 yards, and was picked off by Brandon Meriweather, who returned it deep to Jacksonville territory. Brady scored yet another touchdown on a short field. On my <b> </b> page, I wrote that the Jaguars needed to give Jones-Drew 30-plus touches to have a chance. Apparently, Del Rio and Koetter don't read this Web site. Jones Drew had just 18 carries (63 yards) and 3 catches (35 more yards). The bottom line: Del Rio and Koetter have to go. Oh, and for the 20 Jags fans out there: Get ready to order your Tim Tebow jerseys.    The second thing you can take away from this game is that Tom Brady is completely healthy again. He looked great, continuously torching Jacksonville's secondary all afternoon. He was 23-of-26, 267 yards and 4 touchdowns.    Three of Brady's scores went to "

   "comment":"Tom Brady ran around and just heaved up a bomb to Brandon Tate.    Of course, the big news coming out of this game was Brett Favre's status. Favre played and went 22-of-32 for 259 yards and an interception, but left in the 4.h quarter with face lacerations. Tarvaris Jackson wasn't bad in limited relief, going 4-of-6 for 36 yards and a touchdown, as well as a 33-yard scramble in garbage time.    Adrian Peterson ran the ball well, rushing for 92 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 50 more yards.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 6 receptions for 104 yards, but had that aforementioned horrible gaff that really cost Minnesota the game.    Randy Moss notched just 1 catch for 8 yards. After the game, Moss told the media he won't answer anymore questions unless he's the 1 asking them. Moss is apparently content with being fined $25,000 each week. He'll be paying that in straight cash, homey.    Before moving on to New England's players, I have to bash Vikings corner Asher Allen. Allen missed a key routine tackle that set up a late Patriots score and was the 1 torched by Tate on that weird long touchdown.    Tom Brady went 16-of-27 for 240 yards and that fluky 65-yard score to Tate. Brady's days of putting up monster numbers every week are over, but he's still doing a great job of managing the game.    "

   "comment":"Tom Brady threw incomplete on a 3rd-and-24 very deep in his own territory. However, Robert Ayers felt the need to shove a hand into the face of a New England lineman, which gave the Patriots a free first down instead of a short field for Denver's offense.    And if Denver didn't commit all of those errors? Well, I'm sure it would have come down to which team had the ball last. The Patriots had no answer for the run, which the Broncos had to abandon because they fell into a huge hole. Denver's defense, meanwhile, looked completely helpless trying to stop Tom Brady. Brady went 23-of-34 for 320 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unlike last week in which he looked really lackadaisical, Brady played with a ton of a fire that we often see when he's an underdog. Perhaps someone didn't notify him that he was favored by a touchdown. Brady's scores went to "

   "comment":"Tom Brady, as the Colts' defense couldn't stop the Patriots' scoring machine. Indianapolis is still in good position to land a wild card, but this performance illustrated that the team's ceiling is a wild-card berth rather than a run in January.    The Colts started the game well. Luck engineered a first-quarter, 7.play, 80-yard drive that ended with a "

   "comment":"Tom Brady score, Mark Sanchez, who earlier tossed an ugly interception in the red zone, scrambled, inexplicably ran into his own guard and fumbled. The Patriots picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Joe McKnight had a fumble pop into the air, which was brought back for 6. A 56-yard Brady-to-Julian Edelman touchdown later, and New England was suddenly up 35-0. The frustrated crowd continuously chanted Te-bow for the rest of the evening, but Rex Ryan didn't listen to his fans' wishes. He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field. I think Ryan is full of crap. </i>    Tom Brady, meanwhile, went 18-of-28 for 323 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). He missed a couple of deep throws in the third quarter that had him frustrated, but was otherwise flawless. He was totally dialed in, as he was on a mission to prove that his offense could score without Rob Gronkowski.    Outside of "

   "comment":"Tom Brady at the very last second, which caused a key drop. Dobson continuously screwed up, but Brady inexplicably kept going back to him. I didn't understand the logic behind that. Stevan Ridley was benched for 1 fumble last week, so why wasn't Dobson taken out of the game after his third, 4.h or fifth drop? With Dobson and Thompkins playing so poorly, Brady seemed so out of sync. He spent the entire first half yelling at his teammates, but he just seemed defeated after intermission. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes for the first time in a game since Week 15, 2009, going 19-of-39 for 185 yards and a touchdown. The score came on the first drive of the contest - an 81-yard possession. The Patriots mustered just 151 yards the rest of the way, compared to 318 for the Jets. They were just 4-of-18 on third down and managed just moved the chains 9 times in this entire contest. The Patriots will be better eventually, but they'll need Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola back. And who knows when they'll be available? In the meantime, all Brady will have to work with is Edelman (13-78), who was the lone bright spot for New England's offense - and even he wasn't flawless; he appeared to lose a fumble, but the call was reversed. I'm not sure what Bill Belichick can do in the short term. I joked on Twitter (): #Patriots should play Alfonzo Dennard at receiver. Better than Dobson. Well, it wasn't really a joke. It's kind of the truth. The most telling moment for New England came just prior to halftime. The team was on the New York 25-yard line. The Patriots were faced a third down with 11 seconds and 1 timeout remaining. Instead of taking a shot at the end zone, as Brady normally would, he ran to the middle of the field and took a knee to give his kicker an easier field goal. Stephen Gostkowski whiffed in karmic fashion.    I brought up the Dennard tweet earlier because he caught a key interception from Geno Smith in the red zone. Aqib Talib, meanwhile, picked him off twice. Smith did some nice things in this contest, but there was more bad than good. He finished 15-of-35 for 214 yards and the 3 picks. He also had a 16-yard scramble. Smith endured many of the same issues Tom Brady faced. His receivers just let him down. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady had been struggling, but all he needed was his favorite intermediate target to get out of his funk. Well, it appears as though that's not the case. Gronkowski didn't play all of the snaps in this contest - for example, he was on the field for 23 of 36 plays in the first half - but he did lead the Patriots with 8 receptions for 114 yards. He also drew a holding penalty. However, Brady still barely completed half of his passes and failed once again to throw a touchdown. He continued to struggle to loft the football, unnecessarily throwing lasers downfield without any touch. He nearly lost a fumble, and Worst of all, he tossed a pick-six despite nursing a 21-10 advantage in the third quarter. Brady went 22-of-46 for 228 yards and the pick. He had a chance to win the game in overtime, but completed just 1 of 4 passes in the extra session. His incompletions weren't even close. It must be noted that the Jets' defensive line did a great job of controlling the line of scrimmage. Their 4 sacks aren't indicative of how much New York's line dominated New England's front.    A bit more on Gronkowski: He had 2 chances to find the end zone, but he and Brady had a miscommunication of sorts in the 4.h quarter. A bit later, Gronkowski dropped a 1.handed attempt. With Gronkowski eating up targets - including penalties, he saw a whopping 19 balls go his way - the other New England players saw a statistical regression. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady ruining my fantasy teams and yet covering this spread in bulls*** fashion, so I'll just post a link to the .    This was a game of 2 halves as the young Dolphins owned the first 2 quarters. The Patriots adjusted at halftime and came out like gang-busters in the second half. New England needed a bounce-back win after its loss to the New York Jets and got it thanks to dominating the final 2 quarters. On his first possession, Tom Brady had the uncharacteristic mistake of staring down Rob Gronkowski (2-27) and the route was jumped by Dimitri Patterson for an interception."

   "comment":"Tom Brady has struggled all year, and we finally discovered why last week when a camera caught a glimpse of Brady's throwing hand. The thing looked like a dead animal. It was so incredibly swollen, so I figured Brady would need a bye to get the thing healed. That, apparently, was not the case. Brady was razor-sharp for the first time all year. Letting the ball hit the ground just 10 times, Brady went 23-of-33 for a whopping 432 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was throwing strikes all afternoon, though it didn't hurt that the Steelers, looking extremely old and slow, blew a number of coverages. It's also worth noting that Brady just barely missed out on a fifth score; "

Two fumbles followed the pick, as Orton was strip-sacked and then C.J. Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards. Bill Belichick adjusted by rolling Tom Brady out to negate pressure, and the Bills simply had no answer for it. Brady caught fire as a consequence, misfiring just twice after halftime. He finished 27-of-37 for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady had some brilliant moments. His second touchdown was a great heave into triple coverage to someone named "

One pick occurred as Brady was getting hit, but the other was an ugly, careless heave off his back foot that set up an Indianapolis touchdown prior to intermission. This, however, sparked Brady, as he looked pissed coming out of the locker room. He was nearly flawless for the rest of the game, going 9-of-11 for 173 yards and 2 touchdowns in the second half. Brady's final numbers were 19-of-30 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Both scores went to his tight ends. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady as the big story in this game. And why not? Regardless of whether or not it was his fault, Brady had to endure Deflategate and everything that came with it, from an NFL investigation, to appearances in court. Brady's suspension was nullified just days ago, so he was able to take the field in the season opener. How would he do after a disastrous preseason? Well, pretty much as expected. Brady was projected for 300 yards in our , and he almost got there, going 25-of-32 for 288 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady's numbers look very impressive, but statistics can often be deceiving. Brady performed well, given the circumstances, but those circumstances were very easy. The Steelers have 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. In fact, if it weren't for the Redskins, they just might own the league's worst stop unit. The team fielded a poor defense last year, and it lost Dick LeBeau and Troy Polamalu this offseason, so how could it possibly improve? It actually looks so much worse, and it's far beyond the personnel. Don't get me wrong, Pittsburgh has a ton of crappy players starting on its stop unit, but the main issue is the defensive coordinator. LeBeau's replacement, Keith Butler, did a horrible job of coaching in this game. The players were often lining up in the wrong spots, and they were guilty of so many blown coverages and missed assignments. It was pathetic to watch. Perhaps things will get better - 9 days off could help - but I doubt the situation will improve very much. Pittsburgh fans yearning for the days of the Steel Curtain are going to be in for a very long season. Going back to Brady, and him doing everything that was expected of him, most of his completions were checkdowns to "

   "comment":"Tom Brady's preseason play identically, but this was real action. Manning looked awful, and based on the way he performed in this contest, it doesn't appear as though he'll be in the NFL much longer. Manning went 24-of-40 for 175 yards and an interception. Yes, that's good (bad?) for a 4.38 YPA. He was horrible. It should be noted that the Ravens basically lived in his backfield, as the offensive line couldn't block whatsoever, but when Manning had time, he often couldn't hit his receivers, especially when he threw deep. Manning showed zero zip on his passes, which fluttered carelessly over the heads of his wideouts. I don't know if he was serious, but Rodney Harrison said Manning had too much power on his throws, but that was hardly the case. A complete lack of power resulted in those inaccurate floaters. I don't want to keep harping about this - OK, I actually kind of do - but the amount of points Manning left off the board was unreal. He missed "

   "comment":"Tom Brady to an initial 3.and-out, they killed themselves with countless stupid mistakes. It began innocently enough on special teams, as 2 penalties ruined good field position. A long return by Danny Amendola and another infraction permitted the Patriots to start a possession inside Buffalo's red zone, which led to a touchdown. Tyrod Taylor then began screwing up, throwing an interception on a horribly inaccurate pass, allowing Malcolm Butler to come up with an impressive, diving catch, setting up yet another New England score. Taylor then took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, which was followed by a 33-yard punt. The Patriots established a 2.touchdown lead, yet the mistakes continued for the Bills. An illegal formation wiped out a 22-yard LeSean McCoy completion. A defensive hold negated a punting situation for the Patriots, which ultimately led to another New England score, thanks to a 40-yard catch by Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to "

   "comment":"Tom Brady would win by 7 or so touchdowns, covering 1 of the most absurd point spreads ever posted in NFL history. However, Indianapolis matched the intensity level of the Patriots, as this was clearly a revenge game for the AFC Championship defeat. This was a fairly even game until 1 of the most ridiculous play calls anyone has ever seen. You've all seen it by now. If not, the Colts, down just 6 points at the end of the third quarter, lined up in a strange formation on 4.h down. One player was behind the center, while everyone else was on the right side of the line of scrimmage. It resembled a swinging gate, except 1 door of the gate was broken. There was no way the player behind center was going to have any success because it was a 2.versus-five situation. However, the Colts snapped it anyway, resulting in a quick loss. If that wasn't horrible enough, Indianapolis was whistled for an illegal formation, turning something awful into sadly hilarious. A clueless Chuck Pagano kept asking, Why'd you snap it? on the sideline, but the question that needs to be asked to Pagano is, Why line up like that in the first place? It was a stupid play that was never going to work. Why risk it then? This sort of thing warrants a firing, and if the Colts weren't in such a terrible division and a lock to reach the playoffs as a result, they'd probably fire Pagano right now. That play was absolutely a fireable offense. It was ridiculous. The failed conversion took the air out of the tires for the Colts and set up an easy touchdown for the Patriots, who went up 2 scores. That inexplicable decision pretty much ended up costing Indianapolis the game; again, it was just a 6.point margin beforehand.    The Colts eventually scored a late touchdown to draw within 1 score and covered the spread in the process. It took a tough effort, as "

   "comment":"Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and their receivers to make the difference over the Jets. Still, Todd Bowles clearly has this New York team as a legitimate wild-card contender.    On the second play of the game, Chandler Jones tracked down Ryan Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5. and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain. A few more short throws moved the ball to the Jets' 6-yard line before the drive stalled and ended in another field goal. The Jets finally put together a nice drive after falling dormant in the middle of the game. They methodically moved the ball down the field before Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for "

Once Wake went out, however, Brady suddenly had more time, and the Patriots became unstoppable on offense against a deflated team. Brady went 26-of-38 for 356 yards and 4 touchdowns. He once again played extremely well - not at all like a rotting corpse - but the pass protection continues to be a problem, especially in the wake of guard "

For the latter, this contest saw LeGarrette Blount, Dominique Easley, Jonathan Freeny and Devin McCourty sustain injuries. Easley's seemed like the worst, as he was down for a while and had to be helped off with an apparent knee malady. McCourty (ankle) was the best player who got knocked out; he's a stellar safety, though Brian Hoyer was too inept to take advantage of his absence. Freeny (wrist) played extremely well before leaving, while Blount (hip) wasn't missed very much.    Tom Brady misfired on just 8 occasions, going 22-of-30 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well when he had time to throw, but he was hit quite often. As a consequence, the Patriots were limited to just 20 points until very late. Brady took 3 sacks, but that number isn't very indicative of the pressure he faced. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady. Roethlisberger now has 836 combined yards against the top 2 defenses in the league, Seattle and Denver.    Pittsburgh's wide receivers today caught 32-of-43 targets for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. Remember that stat earlier? The amazing 1 where the Broncos had allowed just 115 completions on 204 wide receiver targets for 1,316 yards and 2 touchdowns through 13 games? Good, because that's an amazing discrepancy.    So, the Steelers' win gets them in the wild card over the New York Jets for the time being. Pittsburgh will have to finish the season on the road, with games at Baltimore and Cleveland. Both are extremely winnable games, but both are division rivals on the road.    The Broncos are slipping down the playoff rankings quickly. If they were to lose their last 2 games, against Cincinnati and San Diego, they easily could fall out of the playoffs completely. If Denver wins 1 of 2. the team will look good for a wildcard spot after Kansas City jumps into the AFC West lead. It the Broncos win both, they hold onto the AFC West and would have a good chance of beating out the Bengals for the No. 2 seed. That's a wide range of outcomes, and with Brock Osweiler looking good early and then leading his team to zero points in the second half of the last 3 games, it could go any which way.   "

On a play that was called back by a penalty, the Bills left Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman wide open on 1 side of the field. No defender was within 10 yards of either of them. Edelman would have had the touchdown had it not been for the penalty. Later, the Bills made the mistake of somehow putting Nickell Robey-Coleman on Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long. Of all the corners on the field on Sunday, the worst may have been Stephon Gilmore. He was terrible in this game. Something must be wrong with him. Gilmore was torched repeatedly by the Patriots, and he allowed a 53-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    "

   "comment":"Tom Brady and LeGarrette Blount were stuffed for a total of 3 occasions, while 4.h down was a throw toward Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to "

   "comment":"Tom Brady finished 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns. He did this in 3 quarters of action before taking the final 15 minutes off. Brady obviously didn't have the best game, but he did have plenty of time in the pocket, as the Jets had absolutely no pass rush.    Because New England didn't have to throw the ball very much, only 1 player accumulated more than 32 receiving yards. That was Edelman, who snatched 5 balls for 89 yards. As mentioned earlier, he should've drawn pass interference in the end zone. "

The Patriots may have won, but the Texans were more impressive, as they played evenly with the Patriots despite going into Foxboro with a rookie quarterback and an absent left tackle. Watson was especially brilliant, as he went 22-of-33 for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions to go along with 8 scrambles for 41 rushing yards. Only 1 of his picks was legitimate, as the second occurred on a last-second Hail Mary. Watson made some mistakes in the early going. He had "
