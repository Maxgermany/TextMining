Yet, New England avoided consecutive losses once again; the last time they lost 2 in a row was in 2006.    Tom Brady was 25-of-42 for 277 yards and a touchdown. He was still a bit shaky and he was errant in the red zone, but he did a great job converting third downs and keeping drives alive. The Patriots were 8-of-18 on third downs and won the time-of-possession battle by 19 minutes.    One reason the Patriots really struggled in the red zone was "

The Broncos did a great job winning this contest and improving to 5-0, but they nearly gave the game away twice in the second half. The Broncos received a punt around midfield after holding the Patriots to a 3-and-out in the third quarter. However, there was a bogus running-into-the-kicker penalty that nearly caused Josh McDaniels to have an aneurysm. The Patriots got the first down. Later on the same drive but in the 4.h quarter, Denver once again forced the Patriots into a punting situation. Unfortunately, they were offside on 4th-and-4, giving New England yet another first down. At that point, it looked like Denver was destined to lose. But give them credit for eventually getting the Patriots to punt for a third time.    The Broncos ran a weird formation in this game that was dubbed the Wild Horses. "

   "comment":"Brady is back, but I honestly don't know if you can take away anything from this game. I know Tom Brady was 29-of-34 for 380 yards and 6 touchdowns, and I know he set the record for most touchdowns thrown in a single quarter (5) in the Super Bowl era, but it really looked like Brady was playing in a 7-on-7 drill. The Titans seemed as if they gave up, leaving all of Brady's receivers wide open. Given that they were 0-5 going into the contest and weren't prepared for the snow coming from Tennessee, that shouldn't be a surprise. This game really reminded me of New England's thrashing of Arizona last year.    Brady made "

   "comment":"Brady a short field and a subsequent score. A drive later, Jacksonville was moving the chains well with Maurice Jones-Drew ripping off 8- and 10-yard gains. Koetter, of course, elected to have David Garrard (19-25, 185 yards, 2 INTs, 1 fumble) throw the ball. Garrard's pass sailed over his receiver's head by about 10 yards, and was picked off by Brandon Meriweather, who returned it deep to Jacksonville territory. Brady scored yet another touchdown on a short field. On my <b> </b> page, I wrote that the Jaguars needed to give Jones-Drew 30-plus touches to have a chance. Apparently, Del Rio and Koetter don't read this Web site. Jones Drew had just 18 carries (63 yards) and 3 catches (35 more yards). The bottom line: Del Rio and Koetter have to go. Oh, and for the 20 Jags fans out there: Get ready to order your Tim Tebow jerseys.    The second thing you can take away from this game is that Tom Brady is completely healthy again. He looked great, continuously torching Jacksonville's secondary all afternoon. He was 23-of-26, 267 yards and 4 touchdowns.    Three of Brady's scores went to "

   "comment":"Brady ran around and just heaved up a bomb to Brandon Tate.    Of course, the big news coming out of this game was Brett Favre's status. Favre played and went 22-of-32 for 259 yards and an interception, but left in the 4.h quarter with face lacerations. Tarvaris Jackson wasn't bad in limited relief, going 4-of-6 for 36 yards and a touchdown, as well as a 33-yard scramble in garbage time.    Adrian Peterson ran the ball well, rushing for 92 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 50 more yards.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 6 receptions for 104 yards, but had that aforementioned horrible gaff that really cost Minnesota the game.    Randy Moss notched just 1 catch for 8 yards. After the game, Moss told the media he won't answer anymore questions unless he's the 1 asking them. Moss is apparently content with being fined $25,000 each week. He'll be paying that in straight cash, homey.    Before moving on to New England's players, I have to bash Vikings corner Asher Allen. Allen missed a key routine tackle that set up a late Patriots score and was the 1 torched by Tate on that weird long touchdown.    Tom Brady went 16-of-27 for 240 yards and that fluky 65-yard score to Tate. Brady's days of putting up monster numbers every week are over, but he's still doing a great job of managing the game.    "

   "comment":"Brady played so stoically. A week ago, Rex Ryan called Brady overrated and a product of Bill Belichick's system. I thought we'd see a furious Brady against the Jets. In fact, this is why I didn't make the Jets a multi-unit selection. Brady generally plays with a big chip on his shoulder, but he just looked like he didn't care. Note that I don't want to make it sound like it's all on Brady. He went 29-of-45 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He took 5 sacks and had to hurry a lot of his throws. The play-calling was abysmal as well. But Brady just seemed off. Fortunately for Brady, he'll get over this 1 pretty quickly. As Ted Berg tweeted, Tom Brady's going to be thinking about this 1 tonight, when he's sleeping with a supermodel atop piles of money.    Having said all that, I don't want to take anything away from the Jets. Ryan came up with an unbelievable game plan. He undoubtedly locked himself in a room after that 45-3 defeat and worked tediously to come up with a solution for the New England offense. Well done, Rex.    "

Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the 4.h quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown. The 31-19 final was secured when Campbell failed to find Chaz Schilens on the 2.point attempt.    The summary here is that New England got enough protection for Brady, thanks to the running of Ridley and Green-Ellis, who combined for 172 yards on 26 carries. Welker was the only receiver targeted, but it didn't matter because the defense couldn't stop him. As expected, Bill Belichick did not allow McFadden to beat him. He did total 123 yards on 18 touches, but 67 of that came on 2 plays and he failed to score. This is a good, not great Raider team ,and to no 1.s surprise, the Patriots were not excited about losing consecutive games.   "

Washington answered with some good runs from Roy Helu and a touchdown strike from Grossman to Jabar Gaffney. Down 14-10, the Redskins pulled off a gadget play. On a reverse to wide receiver Brandon Banks, Santana Moss broke open running downfield. Banks launched a ball up and it fell into Moss for a 49-yard touchdown. New England then got 2 field goals, but Washington followed that by kicking 1 to make it 20-20 at halftime. In the third quarter, Brady and Gronkowski hooked up for a beautiful touchdown. After a big pressure, Brady lofted the ball over Gronkowski's shoulder. He caught the ball just past the line of scrimmage and shed a tackle from "

   "comment":"Brady threw incomplete on a 3rd-and-24 very deep in his own territory. However, Robert Ayers felt the need to shove a hand into the face of a New England lineman, which gave the Patriots a free first down instead of a short field for Denver's offense.    And if Denver didn't commit all of those errors? Well, I'm sure it would have come down to which team had the ball last. The Patriots had no answer for the run, which the Broncos had to abandon because they fell into a huge hole. Denver's defense, meanwhile, looked completely helpless trying to stop Tom Brady. Brady went 23-of-34 for 320 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unlike last week in which he looked really lackadaisical, Brady played with a ton of a fire that we often see when he's an underdog. Perhaps someone didn't notify him that he was favored by a touchdown. Brady's scores went to "

Matt Light was hurt in pre-game warmups, so Bill Belichick opted to start Logan Mankins at left tackle. Mankins then left the contest with a knee injury.

There was a brief stretch in which Brady struggled in the middle of the first half, heaving an interception on 1 throw, tossing another near-pick and then missing an open "

   "comment":"Brady's stat line in the first half: 7-of-12, 75 yards, 1 interception. He, with the help of Ahmad Bradshaw's injury, capsized my fantasy day. I know you're all interested. - Adam Vinatieri kicked a game-winning field goal in the Vikings-Colts game. And then Stephen Gostkowski missed 1 about 5 real-time minutes later. I found this pretty hilarious. - Of course, Gostkowski wouldn't have had an opportunity if Ryan Williams fumbled the ball in the final minute. The Cardinals are 2-0, but I have to criticize the coaching staff for having Williams on the field when he coughed up the ball last week. - Danny Woodhead (I accidentally wrote Woodcock in my notes) had the decisive touchdown nullified by a penalty. I made a note on Woodcock earlier when he was stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a 3rd-and-2 at the beginning of the second quarter. I wondered why such a small back would get a short-yardage work when Stevan Ridley (18 carries, 71 yards) was available.    It took more than that bad call to derail the Patriots' offense, however. New England couldn't move the chains because its offensive line was completely abused by Arizona's front line, particularly Calais Campbell, who notched 10 tackles and 2 sacks. Bill Belichick called Campbell a Richard Seymour in his prime, and the the Cardinal 5.tech certainly lived up to the praise. Another issue for the Patriots was an early injury to Aaron Hernandez, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the first quarter. This completely ruined Belichick's game plan, and New England couldn't get anything going until it was too late.    Brady went 28-of-46 for 316 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The score went to "

   "comment":"Brady. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone typing that, but it's true. Wilson went 16-of-27 for 293 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Patriots focused so much on shutting down Marshawn Lynch (15 carries, 41 yards) that they allowed Wilson to try whatever he wanted downfield. It's tough to blame Bill Belichick for that strategy, given that Pete Carroll's previous conservative game plans limited Wilson from going deep. Give Carroll credit for adjusting though because Wilson hit numerous downfield throws. He had 3 completions of at least 46 yards. Wilson, who also had 17 rushing yards (13 of which came on a crucial 3rd-and-4 just prior to a score), threw touchdowns to Sidney Rice (3-81) and Doug Baldwin (2-74). Golden Tate (3-47) also caught a deep ball. Of course, Wilson was most impressive at the very end, scoring consecutive touchdowns in the final 7-and-a-half minutes to comeback from 23-10. It almost didn't happen though; the Seahawks had a 4.h-and-short in their own territory with slightly more than 3 minutes remaining. Carroll opted to punt, which I completely disagreed with at the time. I didn't think Seattle was going to get the ball back even though it was armed with 3 timeouts, but the defense did a great job of forcing the Patriots to give back possession.    Brady, meanwhile, went 36-of-58 for 395 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions. Those are awesome fantasy numbers, but Brady made a number of mistakes. One of the picks wasn't fault because "

   "comment":"Brady took the lead for the Patriots by moving the ball with Ron Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez. Gronkowski finished the drive with a diving 17-yard touchdown catch. New England tacked on 2 more after a botched handoff by Sanchez and Greene rolled into the end zone. Sanchez kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone for a safety. Massive penetration by Vince Wilfork caused the fumbled handoff. Sanchez got lucky on a few passes that could've been intercepted. His suspect decisions caught up with him when he threw a ball too late for an open receiver. It hung up in the air and that let Patriots corner Alfonzo Dennard recover to make a leaping catch. Sanchez should've had a touchdown on the play, but blew it by waiting. He did help move the ball down the field for a 54-yard field goal from Nick Folk just before halftime. Brady had a nice drive in the third quarter with a few third-down conversions by hooking up with Wes Welker (6-66)."

   "comment":"Brady is an egomaniac with pretty hair who would be in F-U mode in an attempt not to be upstaged by media-darling Andrew Luck. </i>    The big story coming out of this game is that Rob Gronkowski broke his forearm. He'll be out 4-6 weeks, so he should be back for the team's playoff run. Remember that Aaron Hernandez will return soon.    Andrew Luck has been great for the Colts thus far, but he's not ready to take down the elite of the AFC. The defending conference champions took the rookie to the woodshed in a dominating second half. This young Indianapolis team wasn't ready to win a shootout with Tom Brady, as the Colts' defense couldn't stop the Patriots' scoring machine. Indianapolis is still in good position to land a wild card, but this performance illustrated that the team's ceiling is a wild-card berth rather than a run in January.    The Colts started the game well. Luck engineered a first-quarter, 7.play, 80-yard drive that ended with a "

   "comment":"Brady, meanwhile, was a mess early on. He was just 10-of-19 for 76 yards and an interception that was his fault at halftime. He tossed a second pick in the third quarter, but that was on Aaron Hernandez, whose alligator arms allowed the 49ers tip the pass and intercept it. The Patriots had just 6 first downs at intermission, but moved the chains a whopping 26 times afterward. Brady ultimately finished 36-of-65 for 443 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 picks. He nearly led an amazing comeback from down 31-3, but fell just a bit short. Brady was magnificent for the most part in the second half, but uncharacteristically missed some manageable throws. He threw way high on a key 4th-and-2 inside his own 20, which gave the 49ers a chip-shot field goal that put this contest out of reach. Brady did lead the team completely back though - he tied the game at 31 in the middle of the 4.h quarter, but following a great return, Kaepernick hit "

He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun "

   "comment":"Brady had been struggling, but all he needed was his favorite intermediate target to get out of his funk. Well, it appears as though that's not the case. Gronkowski didn't play all of the snaps in this contest - for example, he was on the field for 23 of 36 plays in the first half - but he did lead the Patriots with 8 receptions for 114 yards. He also drew a holding penalty. However, Brady still barely completed half of his passes and failed once again to throw a touchdown. He continued to struggle to loft the football, unnecessarily throwing lasers downfield without any touch. He nearly lost a fumble, and Worst of all, he tossed a pick-six despite nursing a 21-10 advantage in the third quarter. Brady went 22-of-46 for 228 yards and the pick. He had a chance to win the game in overtime, but completed just 1 of 4 passes in the extra session. His incompletions weren't even close. It must be noted that the Jets' defensive line did a great job of controlling the line of scrimmage. Their 4 sacks aren't indicative of how much New York's line dominated New England's front.    A bit more on Gronkowski: He had 2 chances to find the end zone, but he and Brady had a miscommunication of sorts in the 4.h quarter. A bit later, Gronkowski dropped a 1.handed attempt. With Gronkowski eating up targets - including penalties, he saw a whopping 19 balls go his way - the other New England players saw a statistical regression. "

Letting the ball hit the ground just 10 times, Brady went 23-of-33 for a whopping 432 yards and 4 touchdowns.

The team trailed 24-0 at intermission, and it appeared as though Denver would easily run away with a victory. The Patriots didn't look like themselves in the first half. They killed themselves with so many mistakes. Here's the rundown: - Stevan Ridley lost a fumble in the first quarter that was returned for a touchdown. Ridley (4-14), who has chronic fumbling woes, wasn't seen or heard from ever again. - Tom Brady lost a fumble when Von Miller beat Nate Solder and forced a strip-sack."

   "comment":"Brady versus Peyton Manning XIV had so many crazy twists and turns, I don't even know where to begin. I don't think anyone even expected for this to have such a thrilling finish considering how terrible New England looked in the first half. The team trailed 24-0 at intermission, and it appeared as though Denver would easily run away with a victory. The Patriots didn't look like themselves in the first half. They killed themselves with so many mistakes. Here's the rundown: - Stevan Ridley lost a fumble in the first quarter that was returned for a touchdown. Ridley (4-14), who has chronic fumbling woes, wasn't seen or heard from ever again. - Tom Brady lost a fumble when Von Miller beat Nate Solder and forced a strip-sack."

This was just 1 of 3 instances in which Buffalo failed to convert on 4.h down. It was a bit odd because Thad Lewis was able to complete some impressive throws on third-and-long situations. This obviously does not include a Fred Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a 4.h-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though "

   "comment":"Brady and Peyton Manning battling each other earlier in the day, I can't help but draw parallels between them and this quarterbacking matchup. Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson will clash on countless occasions over the next 10-15 years, and as with the Brady-Manning dynamic, the flashier quarterback hasn't been able to defeat the clutch upstart, instead choking in big moments. Manning couldn't defeat Brady early in his career. He also came up small in the clutch prior to the AFC Championship following the 2006 season. The same can be said for Kaepernick, who is now 1-3 straight up and 0-4 against the spread versus Wilson. Kaepernick struggled at times in last year's Super Bowl, and he once again disappointed in this year's conference title game. This wasn't the case early on. Kaepernick was running all over Seattle's vaunted defense, scrambling 8 times for 98 rushing yards in the opening half, which includes a career-long 58-yard scamper that helped set up an "

Two fumbles followed the pick, as Orton was strip-sacked and then C.J. Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards. Bill Belichick adjusted by rolling Tom Brady out to negate pressure, and the Bills simply had no answer for it. Brady caught fire as a consequence, misfiring just twice after halftime. He finished 27-of-37 for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady had some brilliant moments. His second touchdown was a great heave into triple coverage to someone named "

   "comment":"Brady, who was on the field for just a half.    Kyle Orton opened the game on fire, hitting Sammy Watkins for a 43-yard gain and then ultimately leading the team into the end zone. He had a fantastic opening half, going 11-of-15 for 143 yards and a touchdown prior to the break. His only blemish in the first half was a strip-sack that allowed the Patriots to kick a field goal. Orton, however, looked like his usual self following intermission. He was just 4-of-8 for 33 yards in the second half, meaning he finished 16-of-23 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Bills need a quarterback, but they're not in position to take 1 during the draft. They'll have to use a second-rounder on 1.    Buffalo also needs a new running back. Fred Jackson (18-58) won't be able to play much longer, while C.J. Spiller (5-17) probably won't be back next year.    Watkins didn't do much following his initial long reception. He did lead the team in receiving though, snagging 3 balls for 57 yards. Robert Woods (4-39) reeled in Orton's sole touchdown.    Brady, as mentioned, played a half. He looked terrible without his dominant tight end, though the immense pressure he had in his face didn't help. The pass rush forced Brady into many errant passes, which would explain why he went just 8-of-16 for 80 yards. "

   "comment":"Brady as the big story in this game. And why not? Regardless of whether or not it was his fault, Brady had to endure Deflategate and everything that came with it, from an NFL investigation, to appearances in court. Brady's suspension was nullified just days ago, so he was able to take the field in the season opener. How would he do after a disastrous preseason? Well, pretty much as expected. Brady was projected for 300 yards in our , and he almost got there, going 25-of-32 for 288 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady's numbers look very impressive, but statistics can often be deceiving. Brady performed well, given the circumstances, but those circumstances were very easy. The Steelers have 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. In fact, if it weren't for the Redskins, they just might own the league's worst stop unit. The team fielded a poor defense last year, and it lost Dick LeBeau and Troy Polamalu this offseason, so how could it possibly improve? It actually looks so much worse, and it's far beyond the personnel. Don't get me wrong, Pittsburgh has a ton of crappy players starting on its stop unit, but the main issue is the defensive coordinator. LeBeau's replacement, Keith Butler, did a horrible job of coaching in this game. The players were often lining up in the wrong spots, and they were guilty of so many blown coverages and missed assignments. It was pathetic to watch. Perhaps things will get better - 9 days off could help - but I doubt the situation will improve very much. Pittsburgh fans yearning for the days of the Steel Curtain are going to be in for a very long season. Going back to Brady, and him doing everything that was expected of him, most of his completions were checkdowns to "

Manning looked awful, and based on the way he performed in this contest, it doesn't appear as though he'll be in the NFL much longer. Manning went 24-of-40 for 175 yards and an interception. Yes, that's good (bad?) for a 4.38 YPA. He was horrible. It should be noted that the Ravens basically lived in his backfield, as the offensive line couldn't block whatsoever, but when Manning had time, he often couldn't hit his receivers, especially when he threw deep. Manning showed zero zip on his passes, which fluttered carelessly over the heads of his wideouts. I don't know if he was serious, but Rodney Harrison said Manning had too much power on his throws, but that was hardly the case. A complete lack of power resulted in those inaccurate floaters. I don't want to keep harping about this - OK, I actually kind of do - but the amount of points Manning left off the board was unreal. He missed "

   "comment":"Brady to an initial 3.and-out, they killed themselves with countless stupid mistakes. It began innocently enough on special teams, as 2 penalties ruined good field position. A long return by Danny Amendola and another infraction permitted the Patriots to start a possession inside Buffalo's red zone, which led to a touchdown. Tyrod Taylor then began screwing up, throwing an interception on a horribly inaccurate pass, allowing Malcolm Butler to come up with an impressive, diving catch, setting up yet another New England score. Taylor then took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, which was followed by a 33-yard punt. The Patriots established a 2.touchdown lead, yet the mistakes continued for the Bills. An illegal formation wiped out a 22-yard LeSean McCoy completion. A defensive hold negated a punting situation for the Patriots, which ultimately led to another New England score, thanks to a 40-yard catch by Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to "

Greg Hardy, who had some strange things to say about Brady's wife during the week, accumulated 2 sacks. The woman-beater shouldn't be playing right now, but there's no denying that he's an unbelievable talent. DE Woman Beater treated Brady like 1 of his girlfriends on 1 occasion, hitting him so hard that the ball was jarred loose. Despite all of this, however, Brady wasn't sacked a single time in the second half. Bill Belichick made the proper adjustments, and the Dallas defense wore down because it was on the field so much. Brady consequently misfired on just 1 pass in the second half. He ended up finishing 20-of-27 for 275 yards, 2 touchdowns and the lost fumble. His sole incompletion following intermission was nearly picked, but he was flawless otherwise.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were drastically different. One was a short dump-off to "

   "comment":"Brady would win by 7 or so touchdowns, covering 1 of the most absurd point spreads ever posted in NFL history. However, Indianapolis matched the intensity level of the Patriots, as this was clearly a revenge game for the AFC Championship defeat. This was a fairly even game until 1 of the most ridiculous play calls anyone has ever seen. You've all seen it by now. If not, the Colts, down just 6 points at the end of the third quarter, lined up in a strange formation on 4.h down. One player was behind the center, while everyone else was on the right side of the line of scrimmage. It resembled a swinging gate, except 1 door of the gate was broken. There was no way the player behind center was going to have any success because it was a 2.versus-five situation. However, the Colts snapped it anyway, resulting in a quick loss. If that wasn't horrible enough, Indianapolis was whistled for an illegal formation, turning something awful into sadly hilarious. A clueless Chuck Pagano kept asking, Why'd you snap it? on the sideline, but the question that needs to be asked to Pagano is, Why line up like that in the first place? It was a stupid play that was never going to work. Why risk it then? This sort of thing warrants a firing, and if the Colts weren't in such a terrible division and a lock to reach the playoffs as a result, they'd probably fire Pagano right now. That play was absolutely a fireable offense. It was ridiculous. The failed conversion took the air out of the tires for the Colts and set up an easy touchdown for the Patriots, who went up 2 scores. That inexplicable decision pretty much ended up costing Indianapolis the game; again, it was just a 6.point margin beforehand.    The Colts eventually scored a late touchdown to draw within 1 score and covered the spread in the process. It took a tough effort, as Andrew Luck struggled in the second half. His overall numbers were solid - 30-of-50, 312 yards, 3 touchdowns; 4 carries, 35 rush yards - and he started hot, completing his first 7 passes for 57 yards, but could've easily had several turnovers. Luck had 3 interceptions dropped, and he sailed a bunch of passes over his receivers' heads. He also failed to see an open Coby Fleener for a crucial first down in the middle of the 4.h quarter. Luck definitely isn't 100 percent, so the Colts' only chance to advance deep into the playoffs is if he heals up by January.    Of course, it would help if the Colts' offensive line improved. The blocking unit was at it again; it surrendered 3 sacks (2.5 by Chandler Jones), and the number would've been much greater had Luck not been so mobile. The front line was also guilty of countless holding penalties. It seemed like a hold bogged down a drive every time it got something going, including a third-and-14 conversion in the second half. In total, Indianapolis was whistled for 11 penalties, most of which were crucial.    Luck's touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (6-74), Donte Moncrief (6-69) and Griff Whalen (2-30). Moncrief led the team with 11 targets, edging out Hilton's 9. Andre Johnson (3-35) disappointed after his brilliant Thursday night performance.    Frank Gore ran well, but the Colts for some reason didn't attempt to establish him more. He gashed the Patriots for 78 yards on just 13 attempts.    Moving on to the victors, Brady, expected to be in F-U Mode, had just a solid game. He went 23-of-37 for 312 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick-six, though that wasn't his fault (more on that in a second.) Brady took advantage of some blown coverages by the Colts, but he struggled to move the chains in the second half, save for the short drive following that absurd fake punt play. Perhaps the reason Brady didn't meet everyone's expectations and throw for 500 yards and 5 touchdowns was because of "

   "comment":"Brady took a number of sacks and the team lost numerous players to injury. For the latter, this contest saw LeGarrette Blount, Dominique Easley, Jonathan Freeny and Devin McCourty sustain injuries. Easley's seemed like the worst, as he was down for a while and had to be helped off with an apparent knee malady. McCourty (ankle) was the best player who got knocked out; he's a stellar safety, though Brian Hoyer was too inept to take advantage of his absence. Freeny (wrist) played extremely well before leaving, while Blount (hip) wasn't missed very much.    Tom Brady misfired on just 8 occasions, going 22-of-30 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well when he had time to throw, but he was hit quite often. As a consequence, the Patriots were limited to just 20 points until very late. Brady took 3 sacks, but that number isn't very indicative of the pressure he faced. "

   "comment":"Brady. Roethlisberger now has 836 combined yards against the top 2 defenses in the league, Seattle and Denver.    Pittsburgh's wide receivers today caught 32-of-43 targets for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. Remember that stat earlier? The amazing 1 where the Broncos had allowed just 115 completions on 204 wide receiver targets for 1,316 yards and 2 touchdowns through 13 games? Good, because that's an amazing discrepancy.    So, the Steelers' win gets them in the wild card over the New York Jets for the time being. Pittsburgh will have to finish the season on the road, with games at Baltimore and Cleveland. Both are extremely winnable games, but both are division rivals on the road.    The Broncos are slipping down the playoff rankings quickly. If they were to lose their last 2 games, against Cincinnati and San Diego, they easily could fall out of the playoffs completely. If Denver wins 1 of 2. the team will look good for a wildcard spot after Kansas City jumps into the AFC West lead. It the Broncos win both, they hold onto the AFC West and would have a good chance of beating out the Bengals for the No. 2 seed. That's a wide range of outcomes, and with Brock Osweiler looking good early and then leading his team to zero points in the second half of the last 3 games, it could go any which way.   "

   "comment":"Brady took the field and completed his first pass to Julian Edelman. He then connected with Rob Gronkowski for a 19-yard gain, as Gronkowski looked healthy for the first time all year. Following a 13-yard LeGarrette Blount run, Gronkowski snared a 34-yard reception and rumbled down to the Cleveland 2-yard line, breaking 5 tackles in the process. Two plays later, Blount skipped into the end zone, and just like that, the game was over. If a football fan were asleep for 4 weeks and woke up without any idea as to what was going on, they would've never suspected that Brady missed any practice time whatsoever. Brady was incredibly sharp, and having Gronkowski at 100 percent didn't hurt. With these 2 in full gear, the Patriots look like the best team in the AFC. OK, maybe it's a bit presumptive to read that much into a victory against the Browns, but Brady was incredibly sharp. He went 28-of-40 for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns. Had the Browns been able to keep up on the scoreboard, Brady may have had a shot at 500-plus yards; he was up to 271 yards at halftime, putting him on track for 542 on the afternoon (thank you, Windows calculator). He threw numerous beautiful passes, including a perfect 43-yarder down the field to "

Cincinnati had control of this game, but couldn't maintain it because of those 2 infractions. As a result, the Bengals have dropped to 2-4, and their playoff hopes are starting to look pretty bleak.    I mentioned that Brady was jittery early in the afternoon. He looked unsure of himself and seemed concerned with the offensive line. Something the Bengals did was bring their safeties closer to the line of scrimmage, which took away Brady's crossing patterns. The Patriots made the appropriate adjustments at halftime, and Brady's connection with "

   "comment":"Brady hit James White on a short pass that White took to the house for a 19-yard touchdown - his third in his last 2 games. Then, early in the second quarter, LeGarrette Blount went in from 3 yards out to put the score at what appeared to be an insurmountable 14-0 lead. Jones, who had a poor pass intercepted in the end zone to start this game, never lost his cool, which we've seen happen in the past as poor decisions accumulate. His best drive of the game came midway through the second quarter when he hit Antonio Brown with a beautiful pass for 51 yards, and then, 4 plays later, hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown on yet another nice throw. I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1.point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 36-yard touchdown."

There were numerous plays where the Bills did not matchup properly, which was a disaster. On a play that was called back by a penalty, the Bills left Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman wide open on 1 side of the field. No defender was within 10 yards of either of them. Edelman would have had the touchdown had it not been for the penalty. Later, the Bills made the mistake of somehow putting Nickell Robey-Coleman on Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long.

   "comment":"Brady and LeGarrette Blount were stuffed for a total of 3 occasions, while 4.h down was a throw toward Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to "

   "comment":"Brady was in his typical excellent form to spread the ball around and cruise over San Francisco. For a time, the 49ers kept the game close, but New England eventually pulled away to drop the 49ers to 1-9 and maintain San Francisco's draft position.    Early in the first quarter, Danny Amendola had a 30-yard punt return, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Julian Edelman. Surprisingly, the 49ers answered with a field goal drive thanks to a 26-yard pass to Shaun Draughn on a wheel route and an 11-yard run by Carlos Hyde. New England quickly tacked on another touchdown as LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to "

Miami, to its credit, attempted a comeback and drew to within 20-14. However, the Patriots responded with a 77-yard touchdown to Julian Edelman on third down. That put the game away for good, as the Dolphins didn't score after that, thanks in part to a Damien Williams fumble in the red zone that set up another quick New England score following a long return on the recovery.

   "comment":"Brady threw an interception on a deflection off Michael Floyd's hands, and the Texans capitalized with a field goal. Lewis then fumbled the ensuing kickoff, allowing Houston to score a quick touchdown. Suddenly, this was just a 1.point margin, and it was apparent that New England was going to struggle to put Houston away. The Patriots took just a 17-13 advantage into halftime, and while they eventually pulled away, it wasn't very convincing. They had to rely on a comedy of errors by Houston's inept offense. The Texans' defense, meanwhile, was incredible, as it did a great job of restricting the Patriots despite the 34 points; 7 came on Lewis' kickoff return, and some others were a result of turnovers by the Houston offense.    Tom Brady failed to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-38 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Brady was hit hard throughout the evening by "

   "comment":"Brady lost fumble that should've been rewarded to Pittsburgh. However, the Steelers struggled to stop the Patriots on too many drives, and they probably would've lost to the Patriots regardless. This game would've been a lot closer with Bell on the field, though.    Tom Brady finished 32-of-42 for 384 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also fumbled, but despite the Steelers getting a clear recovery, incompetent officiating ruled New England possession without any sort of explanation. That was Brady's sole mistake of the afternoon, and his numbers would've been better if it weren't for a couple of drops. It really helped that Brady was seldom hit this evening. He took a sack early, but was barely touched after that. Brady will be heading to his 7.h Super Bowl, and if he gets the win, he'll have the most championships of any quarterback in NFL history, breaking the current tie he has with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw.    Despite Brady's high yardage total, only 3 Patriots accumulated more han 13 receiving yards. They were "

   "comment":"Brady! Kansas City generated 537 yards of offense, most of which came on big chunk plays. We're used to the Chiefs dinking and dunking, but they were explosive in their season debut. Kareem Hunt and Tyreek Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns. What's crazy is that Travis Kelce had just 40 of those yards (5 catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no 1 should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. Eric Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just 2 of his 6 targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. Danny Amendola - not Chris Hogan - was being used as Julian Edelman's replacement, as he caught 6 balls for 100 yards. His 1 blemish was a dropped pass on third down. Amendola, however, was concussed. He has 10 days to clear concussion protocol, but it's a reminder of how utterly fragile Amendola is. I think the Patriots are going to regret not keeping preseason stud Austin Carr, as he could slot right in for Amendola. Perhaps Hogan will do that; Hogan snared just 1 of his 5 targets for only 8 yards.    I haven't gotten to Brady yet. His stat line was very uncharacteristic, as he went 16-of-36 for 267 yards. A chunk of that came on a 54-yard reception to "

   "comment":"Brady showed the rookie quarterback why he's the greatest player at his position in league history, as he engineered a trademark last-minute touchdown drive to win the game. The Patriots may have won, but the Texans were more impressive, as they played evenly with the Patriots despite going into Foxboro with a rookie quarterback and an absent left tackle. Watson was especially brilliant, as he went 22-of-33 for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions to go along with 8 scrambles for 41 rushing yards. Only 1 of his picks was legitimate, as the second occurred on a last-second Hail Mary. Watson made some mistakes in the early going. He had Braxton Miller wide open, but didn't see him. He took off for a scramble and was short of the line to gain, so the Texans had to punt. Watson also panicked on his real interception, as he threw off his back foot because of a heavy pass rush. What Watson did otherwise more than made up for it. He fired a touchdown to Bruce Ellington, with a perfect pass down the seam. He overthrew a tight end for a potential touchdown in the second half, but came back to get out of a potential sack by 4 New England defenders and connected with D'Onta Foreman for a 31-yard reception. Watson was brilliant considering the circumstances, and this game made it clear that he has the potential to be a star in the NFL. He still needs to work on his ball placement, but he could conceivably lead the Texans into the playoffs this year. If there's a rematch against the Patriots in January, I'll be looking for to it.    Only 4 Texans caught multiple passes, and the leading receiver was DeAndre Hopkins, who secured 7 receptions for 76 yards. He also drew a deep pass interference flag on Stephon Gilmore. Foreman (2-65), Ryan Griffin (5-61) and Ellington (4-59) were the others. Griffin caught Watson's other touchdown.    In addition to Foreman's receiving yardage, the rookie also rushed for 25 yards on 8 carries. Lamar Miller (14-56) handled more of the workload, but I can't help but think that Foreman should be featured more often.    Going back to the Patriots, Brady needed a heroic effort to win this game. Missing his right tackle and having his blind-side protector banged up, Brady had to fight a fierce Houston pass rush that harassed him all afternoon. Brady took 5 sacks in total, which is a high number for him. One of the sacks involved a strip, which "

   "comment":"Brady threw a great deal of short passes to the receiving backs for the team, and that, in effect, was the Patriots' rush offense. Both Rex Burkhead (7-68) and James White (5-85) had big days as receivers, and they were Brady's favorite targets for most of the game. Burkhead looked particularly good, as his elusive ability was on display and he was able to get a great deal of yards after the catch. Burkhead is worth a speculative add if you need a depth running back. Meanwhile, in terms of actual carries, the Patriots split the carries 4 ways. The aforementioned Burkhead and White only saw a combined 5 carries, so that left most of the workload for "

Following a Denver field goal, the Broncos kicked off, only to watch Dion Lewis take it the distance to give his team a 14-3 advantage. The special-teams gaffes didn't even stop after that, as the Patriots blocked a punt when they were up 17-6. The nail in the coffin was the Broncos being whistled for a hold to negate a C.J. Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns.
