   "comment":"Tom Brady struggles this much against 1 team. Including the playoffs, Brady is 102-30 as a starter. Against the Broncos, he's now 1-6.    The Broncos did a great job winning this contest and improving to 5-0, but they nearly gave the game away twice in the second half. The Broncos received a punt around midfield after holding the Patriots to a 3-and-out in the third quarter. However, there was a bogus running-into-the-kicker penalty that nearly caused Josh McDaniels to have an aneurysm. The Patriots got the first down. Later on the same drive but in the 4.h quarter, Denver once again forced the Patriots into a punting situation. Unfortunately, they were offside on 4th-and-4, giving New England yet another first down. At that point, it looked like Denver was destined to lose. But give them credit for eventually getting the Patriots to punt for a third time.    The Broncos ran a weird formation in this game that was dubbed the Wild Horses. Knowshon Moreno lined up in the backfield by himself. Kyle Orton, stationed in the slot, was allowed to scan the field and come in under center. It was pretty smart on McDaniels' part because it forced the Patriots to stick with their coverage. Orton completed every single pass out of the Wild Horses. Phil Simms, who called the game, was shocked by this phenomenon and opined that the Wild Horses could never be stopped. Expect every team to be running this by Halloween.    Kyle Orton did a phenomenal job moving the chains in this game, going 35-of-48 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick (off a Hail Mary). Orton played without a glove for the first time all year. If he keeps this up, he'll burn every single pair of gloves that he owns.    Eddie Royal - where have you been? Royal finally had the type of performance I expected of him going into the season. Royal caught 10 balls for 90 yards. I don't know if it was Orton's glove-less hand or the new Wild Horses formation, but let's hope he keeps this up.    Brandon Marshall continues to play well; he caught 8 balls for 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. Marshall showed up to his post-game interview in a full Colorado Rockies uniform (with the helmet too). It's only a matter of time before he punches another TV.    Moreno started this game with Correll Buckhalter out and got most of the carries. Moreno rushed 21 times for 88 yards. He also caught 4 balls for 36 yards. Unfortunately, Moreno lost a fumble early on and subsequently carried the ball with both hands on every touch.    Tom Brady went 19-of-33 for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had a chance to win the game late in the 4.h quarter, but fumbled the ball away. The story here is that while Brady had tons of protection early in the contest, he was pressured late after Brady struggles this much against 1 team. Including the playoffs, Brady is 102-30 as a starter. Against the Broncos, he's now 1-6.    The Broncos did a great job winning this contest and improving to 5-0, but they nearly gave the game away twice in the second half. The Broncos received a punt around midfield after holding the Patriots to a 3-and-out in the third quarter. However, there was a bogus running-into-the-kicker penalty that nearly caused Josh McDaniels to have an aneurysm. The Patriots got the first down. Later on the same drive but in the 4.h quarter, Denver once again forced the Patriots into a punting situation. Unfortunately, they were offside on 4th-and-4, giving New England yet another first down. At that point, it looked like Denver was destined to lose. But give them credit for eventually getting the Patriots to punt for a third time.    The Broncos ran a weird formation in this game that was dubbed the Wild Horses. "

It also seemed like he was forcing the ball into Moss too much. Considering this easy opponent, as well all of the scrutiny Moss received from the media and the Panthers, I can't blame him. Nine of Brady's completions went to Moss and "

   "comment":"Tom Brady ran around and just heaved up a bomb to Brandon Tate.    Of course, the big news coming out of this game was Brett Favre's status. Favre played and went 22-of-32 for 259 yards and an interception, but left in the 4.h quarter with face lacerations. Tarvaris Jackson wasn't bad in limited relief, going 4-of-6 for 36 yards and a touchdown, as well as a 33-yard scramble in garbage time.    Adrian Peterson ran the ball well, rushing for 92 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 50 more yards.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 6 receptions for 104 yards, but had that aforementioned horrible gaff that really cost Minnesota the game.    Randy Moss notched just 1 catch for 8 yards. After the game, Moss told the media he won't answer anymore questions unless he's the 1 asking them. Moss is apparently content with being fined $25,000 each week. He'll be paying that in straight cash, homey.    Before moving on to New England's players, I have to bash Vikings corner Asher Allen. Allen missed a key routine tackle that set up a late Patriots score and was the 1 torched by Tate on that weird long touchdown.    Tom Brady went 16-of-27 for 240 yards and that fluky 65-yard score to Tate. Brady's days of putting up monster numbers every week are over, but he's still doing a great job of managing the game.

Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Brady with long marches for 3 points. Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the 4.h quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown. The 31-19 final was secured when Campbell failed to find Chaz Schilens on the 2.point attempt.    The summary here is that New England got enough protection for Brady, thanks to the running of Ridley and Green-Ellis, who combined for 172 yards on 26 carries. Welker was the only receiver targeted, but it didn't matter because the defense couldn't stop him. As expected, Bill Belichick did not allow McFadden to beat him. He did total 123 yards on 18 touches, but 67 of that came on 2 plays and he failed to score. This is a good, not great Raider team ,and to no 1.s surprise, the Patriots were not excited about losing consecutive games.   "

Washington answered with some good runs from Roy Helu and a touchdown strike from Grossman to Jabar Gaffney. Down 14-10, the Redskins pulled off a gadget play. On a reverse to wide receiver Brandon Banks, Santana Moss broke open running downfield. Banks launched a ball up and it fell into Moss for a 49-yard touchdown. New England then got 2 field goals, but Washington followed that by kicking 1 to make it 20-20 at halftime. In the third quarter, Brady and Gronkowski hooked up for a beautiful touchdown. After a big pressure, Brady lofted the ball over Gronkowski's shoulder. He caught the ball just past the line of scrimmage and shed a tackle from "

He, with the help of Ahmad Bradshaw's injury, capsized my fantasy day. I know you're all interested. - Adam Vinatieri kicked a game-winning field goal in the Vikings-Colts game. And then Stephen Gostkowski missed 1 about 5 real-time minutes later. I found this pretty hilarious. - Of course, Gostkowski wouldn't have had an opportunity if Ryan Williams fumbled the ball in the final minute. The Cardinals are 2-0, but I have to criticize the coaching staff for having Williams on the field when he coughed up the ball last week. - Danny Woodhead (I accidentally wrote Woodcock in my notes) had the decisive touchdown nullified by a penalty. I made a note on Woodcock earlier when he was stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a 3rd-and-2 at the beginning of the second quarter. I wondered why such a small back would get a short-yardage work when Stevan Ridley (18 carries, 71 yards) was available.    It took more than that bad call to derail the Patriots' offense, however. New England couldn't move the chains because its offensive line was completely abused by Arizona's front line, particularly Calais Campbell, who notched 10 tackles and 2 sacks. Bill Belichick called Campbell a Richard Seymour in his prime, and the the Cardinal 5.tech certainly lived up to the praise. Another issue for the Patriots was an early injury to Aaron Hernandez, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the first quarter. This completely ruined Belichick's game plan, and New England couldn't get anything going until it was too late.    Brady went 28-of-46 for 316 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The score went to "

I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone typing that, but it's true. Wilson went 16-of-27 for 293 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Patriots focused so much on shutting down Marshawn Lynch (15 carries, 41 yards) that they allowed Wilson to try whatever he wanted downfield. It's tough to blame Bill Belichick for that strategy, given that Pete Carroll's previous conservative game plans limited Wilson from going deep. Give Carroll credit for adjusting though because Wilson hit numerous downfield throws. He had 3 completions of at least 46 yards. Wilson, who also had 17 rushing yards (13 of which came on a crucial 3rd-and-4 just prior to a score), threw touchdowns to Sidney Rice (3-81) and Doug Baldwin (2-74). Golden Tate (3-47) also caught a deep ball. Of course, Wilson was most impressive at the very end, scoring consecutive touchdowns in the final 7-and-a-half minutes to comeback from 23-10. It almost didn't happen though; the Seahawks had a 4.h-and-short in their own territory with slightly more than 3 minutes remaining. Carroll opted to punt, which I completely disagreed with at the time. I didn't think Seattle was going to get the ball back even though it was armed with 3 timeouts, but the defense did a great job of forcing the Patriots to give back possession.    Brady, meanwhile, went 36-of-58 for 395 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions. Those are awesome fantasy numbers, but Brady made a number of mistakes. One of the picks wasn't fault because "

He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field.

Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots.    As for the Raven receivers, Boldin scored twice, as he finished with 5 receptions for 60 yards. He humorously stood over "

   "comment":"Tom Brady at the very last second, which caused a key drop. Dobson continuously screwed up, but Brady inexplicably kept going back to him. I didn't understand the logic behind that. Stevan Ridley was benched for 1 fumble last week, so why wasn't Dobson taken out of the game after his third, 4.h or fifth drop? With Dobson and Thompkins playing so poorly, Brady seemed so out of sync. He spent the entire first half yelling at his teammates, but he just seemed defeated after intermission. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes for the first time in a game since Week 15, 2009, going 19-of-39 for 185 yards and a touchdown. The score came on the first drive of the contest - an 81-yard possession. The Patriots mustered just 151 yards the rest of the way, compared to 318 for the Jets. They were just 4-of-18 on third down and managed just moved the chains 9 times in this entire contest. The Patriots will be better eventually, but they'll need Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola back. And who knows when they'll be available? In the meantime, all Brady will have to work with is Edelman (13-78), who was the lone bright spot for New England's offense - and even he wasn't flawless; he appeared to lose a fumble, but the call was reversed. I'm not sure what Bill Belichick can do in the short term. I joked on Twitter (): #Patriots should play Alfonzo Dennard at receiver. Better than Dobson. Well, it wasn't really a joke. It's kind of the truth. The most telling moment for New England came just prior to halftime. The team was on the New York 25-yard line. The Patriots were faced a third down with 11 seconds and 1 timeout remaining. Instead of taking a shot at the end zone, as Brady normally would, he ran to the middle of the field and took a knee to give his kicker an easier field goal. Stephen Gostkowski whiffed in karmic fashion.    I brought up the Dennard tweet earlier because he caught a key interception from Geno Smith in the red zone. Aqib Talib, meanwhile, picked him off twice. Smith did some nice things in this contest, but there was more bad than good. He finished 15-of-35 for 214 yards and the 3 picks. He also had a 16-yard scramble. Smith endured many of the same issues Tom Brady faced. His receivers just let him down. Brady at the very last second, which caused a key drop. Dobson continuously screwed up, but Brady inexplicably kept going back to him. I didn't understand the logic behind that. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady had been struggling, but all he needed was his favorite intermediate target to get out of his funk. Well, it appears as though that's not the case. Gronkowski didn't play all of the snaps in this contest - for example, he was on the field for 23 of 36 plays in the first half - but he did lead the Patriots with 8 receptions for 114 yards. He also drew a holding penalty. However, Brady still barely completed half of his passes and failed once again to throw a touchdown. He continued to struggle to loft the football, unnecessarily throwing lasers downfield without any touch. He nearly lost a fumble, and Worst of all, he tossed a pick-six despite nursing a 21-10 advantage in the third quarter. Brady went 22-of-46 for 228 yards and the pick. He had a chance to win the game in overtime, but completed just 1 of 4 passes in the extra session. His incompletions weren't even close. It must be noted that the Jets' defensive line did a great job of controlling the line of scrimmage. Their 4 sacks aren't indicative of how much New York's line dominated New England's front.    A bit more on Gronkowski: He had 2 chances to find the end zone, but he and Brady had a miscommunication of sorts in the 4.h quarter. A bit later, Gronkowski dropped a 1.handed attempt. With Gronkowski eating up targets - including penalties, he saw a whopping 19 balls go his way - the other New England players saw a statistical regression. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady has struggled all year, and we finally discovered why last week when a camera caught a glimpse of Brady's throwing hand. The thing looked like a dead animal. It was so incredibly swollen, so I figured Brady would need a bye to get the thing healed. That, apparently, was not the case. Brady was razor-sharp for the first time all year. Letting the ball hit the ground just 10 times, Brady went 23-of-33 for a whopping 432 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was throwing strikes all afternoon, though it didn't hurt that the Steelers, looking extremely old and slow, blew a number of coverages. It's also worth noting that Brady just barely missed out on a fifth score; "

The Bills, meanwhile, didn't commit as many blunders, but they were more costly. T.J. Graham lost a fumble and also had a big drop on a 4.h-and-2. This was just 1 of 3 instances in which Buffalo failed to convert on 4.h down. It was a bit odd because Thad Lewis was able to complete some impressive throws on third-and-long situations. This obviously does not include a Fred Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a 4.h-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though "

Colin Kaepernick and Brady and Peyton Manning battling each other earlier in the day, I can't help but draw parallels between them and this quarterbacking matchup. Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson will clash on countless occasions over the next 10-15 years, and as with the Brady-Manning dynamic, the flashier quarterback hasn't been able to defeat the clutch upstart, instead choking in big moments. Manning couldn't defeat Brady early in his career. He also came up small in the clutch prior to the AFC Championship following the 2006 season. The same can be said for Kaepernick, who is now 1-3 straight up and 0-4 against the spread versus Wilson. Kaepernick struggled at times in last year's Super Bowl, and he once again disappointed in this year's conference title game. This wasn't the case early on. Kaepernick was running all over Seattle's vaunted defense, scrambling 8 times for 98 rushing yards in the opening half, which includes a career-long 58-yard scamper that helped set up an Anthony Dixon plunge into the end zone. He was just 3-of-5 for 17 yards in the first half - this prompted a drunken Terry Bradshaw to clamor for the 49er coaching staff to allow Kaepernick to air it out more often - but the passing numbers were so limited because the running lanes were just so wide open. Kaepernick didn't even have to throw, but when he did in the third quarter, he had success. He fired a high number of passes across his body that he was able to complete, thanks to his great throwing velocity. He also zipped a very impressive jump-pass touchdown to Anquan Boldin. However, Kaepernick struggled mightily in the 4.h quarter. He was strip-sacked by "

   "comment":"Tom Brady touchdown to Tim Wright came after a Kyle Orton interception when he didn't see Jamie Collins dropping into coverage. Two fumbles followed the pick, as Orton was strip-sacked and then C.J. Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards. Bill Belichick adjusted by rolling Tom Brady out to negate pressure, and the Bills simply had no answer for it. Brady caught fire as a consequence, misfiring just twice after halftime. He finished 27-of-37 for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady had some brilliant moments. His second touchdown was a great heave into triple coverage to someone named Brady touchdown to Tim Wright came after a Kyle Orton interception when he didn't see Jamie Collins dropping into coverage. Two fumbles followed the pick, as Orton was strip-sacked and then C.J. Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards.

   "comment":"Tom Brady. With Brady. With Muhammad Wilkerson back in the lineup, the defensive front put heavy pressure on him all afternoon, generating 3 sacks in the first quarter alone. Brady, consequently, could never really get anything going; he and the Patriots mustered just 231 net yards of offense, as they were outgained by about 80 yards.    Brady finished 23-of-35 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which occurred when Brady was hit as he released the ball, forcing a wide throw.

   "comment":"Tom Brady, who was on the field for just a half.    Brady, who was on the field for just a half.    Kyle Orton opened the game on fire, hitting Sammy Watkins for a 43-yard gain and then ultimately leading the team into the end zone. He had a fantastic opening half, going 11-of-15 for 143 yards and a touchdown prior to the break. His only blemish in the first half was a strip-sack that allowed the Patriots to kick a field goal. Orton, however, looked like his usual self following intermission. He was just 4-of-8 for 33 yards in the second half, meaning he finished 16-of-23 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Bills need a quarterback, but they're not in position to take 1 during the draft. They'll have to use a second-rounder on 1.    Buffalo also needs a new running back. Fred Jackson (18-58) won't be able to play much longer, while C.J. Spiller (5-17) probably won't be back next year.    Watkins didn't do much following his initial long reception. He did lead the team in receiving though, snagging 3 balls for 57 yards. Robert Woods (4-39) reeled in Orton's sole touchdown.    Brady, as mentioned, played a half. He looked terrible without his dominant tight end, though the immense pressure he had in his face didn't help. The pass rush forced Brady into many errant passes, which would explain why he went just 8-of-16 for 80 yards. "

   "comment":"Tom Brady to an initial 3.and-out, they killed themselves with countless stupid mistakes. It began innocently enough on special teams, as 2 penalties ruined good field position. A long return by Danny Amendola and another infraction permitted the Patriots to start a possession inside Buffalo's red zone, which led to a touchdown. Tyrod Taylor then began screwing up, throwing an interception on a horribly inaccurate pass, allowing Malcolm Butler to come up with an impressive, diving catch, setting up yet another New England score. Taylor then took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, which was followed by a 33-yard punt. The Patriots established a 2.touchdown lead, yet the mistakes continued for the Bills. An illegal formation wiped out a 22-yard LeSean McCoy completion. A defensive hold negated a punting situation for the Patriots, which ultimately led to another New England score, thanks to a 40-yard catch by Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield.

DE Woman Beater treated Brady like 1 of his girlfriends on 1 occasion, hitting him so hard that the ball was jarred loose. Despite all of this, however, Brady wasn't sacked a single time in the second half. Bill Belichick made the proper adjustments, and the Dallas defense wore down because it was on the field so much.

   "comment":"Tom Brady would win by 7 or so touchdowns, covering 1 of the most absurd point spreads ever posted in NFL history. However, Indianapolis matched the intensity level of the Patriots, as this was clearly a revenge game for the AFC Championship defeat. This was a fairly even game until 1 of the most ridiculous play calls anyone has ever seen. You've all seen it by now. If not, the Colts, down just 6 points at the end of the third quarter, lined up in a strange formation on 4.h down. One player was behind the center, while everyone else was on the right side of the line of scrimmage. It resembled a swinging gate, except 1 door of the gate was broken. There was no way the player behind center was going to have any success because it was a 2.versus-five situation. However, the Colts snapped it anyway, resulting in a quick loss. If that wasn't horrible enough, Indianapolis was whistled for an illegal formation, turning something awful into sadly hilarious. A clueless Chuck Pagano kept asking, Why'd you snap it? on the sideline, but the question that needs to be asked to Pagano is, Why line up like that in the first place? It was a stupid play that was never going to work. Why risk it then? This sort of thing warrants a firing, and if the Colts weren't in such a terrible division and a lock to reach the playoffs as a result, they'd probably fire Pagano right now. That play was absolutely a fireable offense. It was ridiculous. The failed conversion took the air out of the tires for the Colts and set up an easy touchdown for the Patriots, who went up 2 scores. That inexplicable decision pretty much ended up costing Indianapolis the game; again, it was just a 6.point margin beforehand.    The Colts eventually scored a late touchdown to draw within 1 score and covered the spread in the process.

That inexplicable decision pretty much ended up costing Indianapolis the game; again, it was just a 6.point margin beforehand.    The Colts eventually scored a late touchdown to draw within 1 score and covered the spread in the process. It took a tough effort, as Andrew Luck struggled in the second half. His overall numbers were solid - 30-of-50, 312 yards, 3 touchdowns; 4 carries, 35 rush yards - and he started hot, completing his first 7 passes for 57 yards, but could've easily had several turnovers. Luck had 3 interceptions dropped, and he sailed a bunch of passes over his receivers' heads. He also failed to see an open Coby Fleener for a crucial first down in the middle of the 4.h quarter. Luck definitely isn't 100 percent, so the Colts' only chance to advance deep into the playoffs is if he heals up by January.    Of course, it would help if the Colts' offensive line improved. The blocking unit was at it again; it surrendered 3 sacks (2.5 by Chandler Jones), and the number would've been much greater had Luck not been so mobile. The front line was also guilty of countless holding penalties. It seemed like a hold bogged down a drive every time it got something going, including a third-and-14 conversion in the second half. In total, Indianapolis was whistled for 11 penalties, most of which were crucial.    Luck's touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (6-74), Donte Moncrief (6-69) and Griff Whalen (2-30). Moncrief led the team with 11 targets, edging out Hilton's 9. Andre Johnson (3-35) disappointed after his brilliant Thursday night performance.    Frank Gore ran well, but the Colts for some reason didn't attempt to establish him more. He gashed the Patriots for 78 yards on just 13 attempts.    Moving on to the victors, Brady, expected to be in F-U Mode, had just a solid game. He went 23-of-37 for 312 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick-six, though that wasn't his fault (more on that in a second.) Brady took advantage of some blown coverages by the Colts, but he struggled to move the chains in the second half, save for the short drive following that absurd fake punt play. Perhaps the reason Brady didn't meet everyone's expectations and throw for 500 yards and 5 touchdowns was because of "

   "comment":"Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and their receivers to make the difference over the Jets. Still, Todd Bowles clearly has this New York team as a legitimate wild-card contender.    On the second play of the game, Chandler Jones tracked down Ryan Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5. and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain. A few more short throws moved the ball to the Jets' 6-yard line before the drive stalled and ended in another field goal. The Jets finally put together a nice drive after falling dormant in the middle of the game. They methodically moved the ball down the field before Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for Brady, Rob Gronkowski and their receivers to make the difference over the Jets. Still, Todd Bowles clearly has this New York team as a legitimate wild-card contender.    On the second play of the game, Chandler Jones tracked down Ryan Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to "

He then connected with Rob Gronkowski for a 19-yard gain, as Gronkowski looked healthy for the first time all year. Following a 13-yard LeGarrette Blount run, Gronkowski snared a 34-yard reception and rumbled down to the Cleveland 2-yard line, breaking 5 tackles in the process. Two plays later, Blount skipped into the end zone, and just like that, the game was over. If a football fan were asleep for 4 weeks and woke up without any idea as to what was going on, they would've never suspected that Brady missed any practice time whatsoever. Brady was incredibly sharp, and having Gronkowski at 100 percent didn't hurt. With these 2 in full gear, the Patriots look like the best team in the AFC. OK, maybe it's a bit presumptive to read that much into a victory against the Browns, but Brady was incredibly sharp. He went 28-of-40 for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns. Had the Browns been able to keep up on the scoreboard, Brady may have had a shot at 500-plus yards; he was up to 271 yards at halftime, putting him on track for 542 on the afternoon (thank you, Windows calculator).

Then, early in the second quarter, LeGarrette Blount went in from 3 yards out to put the score at what appeared to be an insurmountable 14-0 lead. Jones, who had a poor pass intercepted in the end zone to start this game, never lost his cool, which we've seen happen in the past as poor decisions accumulate. His best drive of the game came midway through the second quarter when he hit Antonio Brown with a beautiful pass for 51 yards, and then, 4 plays later, hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown on yet another nice throw. I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1.point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 36-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Tom Brady, ending up with 3 sacks. Buffalo's secondary, however, was atrocious during this contest.    The Bills were just unable to cover New England's receivers. There were numerous plays where the Bills did not matchup properly, which was a disaster. On a play that was called back by a penalty, the Bills left Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman wide open on 1 side of the field. No defender was within 10 yards of either of them. Edelman would have had the touchdown had it not been for the penalty. Later, the Bills made the mistake of somehow putting Nickell Robey-Coleman on Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long. Of all the corners on the field on Sunday, the worst may have been Stephon Gilmore. He was terrible in this game. Something must be wrong with him. Gilmore was torched repeatedly by the Patriots, and he allowed a 53-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    Brady, ending up with 3 sacks. Buffalo's secondary, however, was atrocious during this contest.

   "comment":"Tom Brady and LeGarrette Blount were stuffed for a total of 3 occasions, while 4.h down was a throw toward Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to "

Surprisingly, the 49ers answered with a field goal drive thanks to a 26-yard pass to Shaun Draughn on a wheel route and an 11-yard run by Carlos Hyde. New England quickly tacked on another touchdown as LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out.

   "comment":"Tom Brady! Kansas City generated 537 yards of offense, most of which came on big chunk plays. We're used to the Chiefs dinking and dunking, but they were explosive in their season debut. Brady! Kansas City generated 537 yards of offense, most of which came on big chunk plays. We're used to the Chiefs dinking and dunking, but they were explosive in their season debut. Kareem Hunt and Tyreek Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns. What's crazy is that Travis Kelce had just 40 of those yards (5 catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no 1 should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. Eric Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just 2 of his 6 targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. Danny Amendola - not Chris Hogan - was being used as Julian Edelman's replacement, as he caught 6 balls for 100 yards. His 1 blemish was a dropped pass on third down. Amendola, however, was concussed. He has 10 days to clear concussion protocol, but it's a reminder of how utterly fragile Amendola is. I think the Patriots are going to regret not keeping preseason stud Austin Carr, as he could slot right in for Amendola. Perhaps Hogan will do that; Hogan snared just 1 of his 5 targets for only 8 yards.    I haven't gotten to Brady yet. His stat line was very uncharacteristic, as he went 16-of-36 for 267 yards. A chunk of that came on a 54-yard reception to "

The Patriots may have won, but the Texans were more impressive, as they played evenly with the Patriots despite going into Foxboro with a rookie quarterback and an absent left tackle. Watson was especially brilliant, as he went 22-of-33 for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions to go along with 8 scrambles for 41 rushing yards. Only 1 of his picks was legitimate, as the second occurred on a last-second Hail Mary. Watson made some mistakes in the early going. He had Braxton Miller wide open, but didn't see him. He took off for a scramble and was short of the line to gain, so the Texans had to punt. Watson also panicked on his real interception, as he threw off his back foot because of a heavy pass rush. What Watson did otherwise more than made up for it. He fired a touchdown to Bruce Ellington, with a perfect pass down the seam. He overthrew a tight end for a potential touchdown in the second half, but came back to get out of a potential sack by 4 New England defenders and connected with D'Onta Foreman for a 31-yard reception. Watson was brilliant considering the circumstances, and this game made it clear that he has the potential to be a star in the NFL. He still needs to work on his ball placement, but he could conceivably lead the Texans into the playoffs this year. If there's a rematch against the Patriots in January, I'll be looking for to it.    Only 4 Texans caught multiple passes, and the leading receiver was DeAndre Hopkins, who secured 7 receptions for 76 yards. He also drew a deep pass interference flag on Stephon Gilmore. Foreman (2-65), Ryan Griffin (5-61) and Ellington (4-59) were the others. Griffin caught Watson's other touchdown.    In addition to Foreman's receiving yardage, the rookie also rushed for 25 yards on 8 carries. Lamar Miller (14-56) handled more of the workload, but I can't help but think that Foreman should be featured more often.    Going back to the Patriots, Brady needed a heroic effort to win this game. Missing his right tackle and having his blind-side protector banged up, Brady had to fight a fierce Houston pass rush that harassed him all afternoon. Brady took 5 sacks in total, which is a high number for him. One of the sacks involved a strip, which "
