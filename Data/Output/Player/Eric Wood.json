   "comment":"Eric Wood got away with a holding penalty, which enraged Justin Tuck.Woodson, which was a forced pass. He then nearly had another interception, but the ball hit the ground. Following that, Orton hurled a potential pick-six that was dropped, and then almost had another 1 in a careless heave into double coverage. Orton was extremely fortunate that he didn't toss 5 interceptions in the first half. As he was getting away with possible turnovers, he was heaving inaccurate passes that missed his targets. The Bills, consequently, had numerous 3.and-outs, and it didn't get any better until the Raiders were up 2 scores. Orton had yet another near-pick in the second half and then fired an actual interception on a high pass. He was even lucky on a late touchdown, as Eric Wood got away with a holding penalty, which enraged Justin Tuck."
