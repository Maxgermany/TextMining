   "comment":"Jon Beason's body. Raheem Morris also had a pretty bad blunder. With a 4.h down on Carolina's 3-yard line with 10 minutes left and down 7 points, Morris decided to eschew the field goal. The Buccaneers, who had trouble in the red zone all afternoon, predictably failed when Freeman overthrew a receiver despite having tons of time in the pocket. You may argue that Tampa Bay needed a touchdown to tie, but it's not like there were only 3 minutes left. There were 10 minutes remaining on the clock, and the Panthers made a field goal on their next possession, giving them a 2.score advantage. Had Morris opted top kick it, his team still would have had a chance.    Beason's body. Raheem Morris also had a pretty bad blunder.
