   "comment":"Remmers some help to combat Miller. The result was a more competitive battle in which the Panthers led by double digits at halftime. And yet, they still lost. The difference, once again, was Denver's defense. The Broncos' stop unit didn't fare all that well in the first half, but Wade Phillips made some tremendous adjustments at intermission. Following halftime, the Panthers gained just 123 net yards (210 beforehand), and Newton went just 7-of-16 for 83 yards and an interception in the final 2 quarters. He took some crushing hits. On 1 instance, he was down for a while on the sideline and appeared to be injured. On another, it seemed like he sustained a concussion, and Derek Anderson even began warming up. Newton stayed on the field, however, and even had the Panthers in a position to kick the game-winning field goal, but "

   "comment":"Remmers was a crushing liability. These predictable weaknesses have put Carolina in a huge hole after a quarter of this season.    Immediately in the first quarter, the Falcons got moving with 3 completions to Julio Jones for 50 yards. Atlanta finished the drive with Ryan rolling out to hit Jacob Tamme (2-3) for a short touchdown. Starting at their own 2.yard line, the Falcons continued to move the ball with a 44-yard pass to Jones. Devonta Freeman (13-57-1) then rumbled for a 12-yard run before gashing the Panthers up the middle on a 13-yard touchdown run. Atlanta center Alex Mack hit a great block on Luke Kuechly to spring Freeman. After a Carolina punt was downed just outside of the end zone, Thomas Davis then made a superb play to deflect a pass from Ryan that was picked off by Kurt Coleman, who coasted into the end zone to get the Panthers back into the game. The Falcons and Panthers traded field goal drives before the half, but Carolina was lucky to be in the game as Atlanta dominated with the pick-six being the only thing that kept the Panthers close at 17-10. By the half, Jones had 7 receptions for 170 yards. The Falcons expanded their lead after halfrime as the Panthers had busted coverage where they completely forgot to cover Austin Hooper (1-42-1). That 42-yard touchdown pass gave Atlanta a 24-10 lead. Another long pass to Jones set up Ryan to loft in a beautiful 35-yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson (2-48-1). In the 4.h quarter, Atlanta added a 53-yard field goal from Matt Bryant. Down by 24, Carolina got its first offensive touchdown of the game with a 6.yard strike to Kelvin Benjamin. Newton ran in the 2.point conversion, but took a massive hit from Deion Jones. That hit sent Newton into the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, Cam Newton completed 14-of-25 passes for 165 yards with a touchdown. Newton's footwork and accuracy were off all game. Derek Anderson was 17-of-23 for 172 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions.    Greg Olsen (6-76-1), Kelvin Benjamin (3-39-1) and Corey Brown (5-48-1) chipped in touchdowns for Carolina.    Atlanta's defense got a good game from Dwight Freeney as he put a ton of pressure on the quarterback, taking advantage of the inept Mike Remmers. Not only did Remmers give up a sack and multiple hits, but he committed multiple penalties. Remmers played left tackle as Michael Oher was out with a concussion. Robert Alford hauled in 2 interceptions for Atlanta.    Luke Kuechly had 12 tackles with a sack, and "
