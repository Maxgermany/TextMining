   "comment":"Trent Cole was called for a BS roughing-the-passer penalty on what looked like a textbook tackle. If FOX announcer Sam Rosen wore a hairpiece, it would have flown off when he continuously bashed the official for the poor call.    So, who was the culprit behind this? The official in this game was Jerome Boger, known as the worst referee in the NFL (at least he's known that way on this Web site).    "

  "comment":"Trent Cole. Carr limped off while not putting any weight on the leg and then was carted into the locker room. He was diagnosed with a fractured fibula, so Oakland will have to count on Matt McGloin moving forward. For the Colts, this loss put a nail in the coffin to their slim playoff hopes.    In the first quarter, the Raiders snuffed out a fake field goal to take away points from the Colts. That stop went nowhere before a punt, but Oakland was set up near midfield after ",
