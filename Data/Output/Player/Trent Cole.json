Al Michaels suggested that there was 75-percent booing from the crowd, though some of the patrons donned QBDK jerseys. QBDK was also booed when he walked off the field following the aforementioned injury. In a very classy move, he pointed to the scoreboard. As for his actual play, QBDK once again struggled with the blitz. He was sharp early on, but made the usual mistakes. He fumbled 3 times and tossed a pick. He was otherwise 19-of-28 for 242 yards and a pair of scores.    Vince Young was out, so QBDK's replacement was "

   "comment":"Cole Beasley (4-42).    DeMarco Murray has been dominant all year, but he's had trouble against Fletcher Cox and Philadelphia's strong defensive front in 2 performances. Murray had a nice 21-yard gain, but struggled for yardage otherwise, gaining 81 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 31 carries.    The Eagles have benefited from great special-teams plays all year, but that unit hurt them in this contest. The Cowboys started with a short opening kickoff that bounced in front of Josh Huff and behind the up men. No 1 knew what was going on, and Dallas recovered the loose ball to set themselves up in the red zone right away. The team found the end zone, which was the beginning of the early onslaught.    Give Philadelphia credit for coming back. Part of the Eagles' revival came when Mark Sanchez found Jeremy Maclin for a 72-yard gain in which Brandon Carr made a poor decision of biting for a potential interception. Maclin was tackled at the 1-yard line, setting up Chris Polk for the score. Following the ensuing, aforementioned Romo fumble, the Eagles took the lead. Sanchez had a meltdown after that. He was picked off twice late. One was a wide throw that bounced off Zach Ertz, which subsequently led to a touchdown. Another was underthrown, sealing the victory for Dallas. A Brent Celek lost fumble in between didn't help. Sanchez finished 17-of-28 for 252 yards and the 2 picks. He had some nice moments, but made too many mistakes. In addition to the interceptions, he overthrew LeSean McCoy on a third-and-long and once again passed too high toward Huff. He also took some bad sacks.    There's not much to note from Philadelphia's receiving corps. Maclin led the way with 98 yards off 4 receptions, but 72 of those yards came on the aforementioned big play. Ertz (3-32) disappointed yet again, while Jordan Matthews didn't log a single catch. He dropped a pass in Dallas territory.    My condolences if you're a LeSean McCoy fantasy owner. McCoy averaged 4 yards per carry (16-64), but was vultured a whopping 3 times at the goal line. Chris Polk found the end zone twice, while Darren Sproles ran in on the third occasion. It's hard to criticize Chip Kelly for this, given that the Eagles converted each time, but it has to be frustrating for those who started McCoy in the semi-finals.    Bad news for the Eagles: Trent Cole left this game to have an X-ray on his hand. No word on his status yet.   "
