   "comment":"Trent Cole was called for a BS roughing-the-passer penalty on what looked like a textbook tackle. If FOX announcer Sam Rosen wore a hairpiece, it would have flown off when he continuously bashed the official for the poor call.    So, who was the culprit behind this? The official in this game was Jerome Boger, known as the worst referee in the NFL (at least he's known that way on this Web site).    "

   "comment":"Trent Cole, who dominated this contest despite getting just 6 tackles and 1 sack.    As for the Eagles, QBDK was greeted by a chorus of boos. Al Michaels suggested that there was 75-percent booing from the crowd, though some of the patrons donned QBDK jerseys. QBDK was also booed when he walked off the field following the aforementioned injury. In a very classy move, he pointed to the scoreboard. As for his actual play, QBDK once again struggled with the blitz. He was sharp early on, but made the usual mistakes. He fumbled 3 times and tossed a pick. He was otherwise 19-of-28 for 242 yards and a pair of scores.    Vince Young was out, so QBDK's replacement was "

In the first quarter, the Raiders snuffed out a fake field goal to take away points from the Colts. That stop went nowhere before a punt, but Oakland was set up near midfield after "
