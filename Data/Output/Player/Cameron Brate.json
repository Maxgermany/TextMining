He gained 97 yards on 14 just carries, as he wasn't able to touch the ball as often as he should have because the Buccaneers were playing catch-up throughout the second half. As mentioned, Martin also scored, but had the touchdown wiped out because of a penalty.    The Colts, on the other hand, were not able to run the ball at all, so they had trouble putting this game away when they were up in the second half. "

Spence had another sack to force a punt, but Luke Stocker was called for a hold in the end zone to give Seattle a safety. The Seahawks took advantage thanks to a 29-yard pass interference to add a field goal. Before halftime, Tampa Bay moved into Seattle territory, but Roberto Aguayo missed the 48-yard field goal attempt. Wilson moved the ball into Tampa Bay territory before throwing an interception to Alterraun Verner. The Buccaneers took a 14-5 lead into the half. Both defenses played well in the third quarter, as the teams traded punts. Early in the 4.h quarter, Seahawks defensive lineman Ahtyba Rubin punched the ball out from Doug Martin and free safety Steven Terrell recovered the ball for Seattle close to midfield. The Seahawks moved well into Tampa Bay territory, but then Jimmy Graham fumbled the ball and Lavonte David scooped it up to return it 53 yards to the Seattle 25-yard line. A few plays later, Winston threw a touchdown to Brate, but a penalty on Demar Dotson took the score away."

When these teams last met, it was Brees turning the ball over, but this time it was Winston, who was intercepted twice by Jarius Byrd. Winston's first interception came early in the third quarter, which the Saints capitalized on quickly with Ingram's second rushing touchdown, a 14-yard score on the next play, which gave the Saints a 20-7 lead.
