Martin also just missed out on a great game. He gained 97 yards on 14 just carries, as he wasn't able to touch the ball as often as he should have because the Buccaneers were playing catch-up throughout the second half. As mentioned, Martin also scored, but had the touchdown wiped out because of a penalty.    The Colts, on the other hand, were not able to run the ball at all, so they had trouble putting this game away when they were up in the second half. "

   "comment":"Cameron Brate for a touchdown, the big tight end's 8. of the season. Brate has been incredibly steady this year and appears to have solidified his role with this team going into next season. Unfortunately, Brate took a hard hit in the back in the third quarter and couldn't return to the game.    When these teams last met, it was Brees turning the ball over, but this time it was Winston, who was intercepted twice by Jarius Byrd. Winston's first interception came early in the third quarter, which the Saints capitalized on quickly with Ingram's second rushing touchdown, a 14-yard score on the next play, which gave the Saints a 20-7 lead. The Buccaneers rallied back with a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a "
