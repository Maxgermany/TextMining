   "comment":"Heyward-Bey picked up 28 yards on a reception, and the return of Jacoby Ford was felt with a trick play run good for 30 yards. The drive ended on an interception I can't even describe. Announcer Solomon Wilcots assumed Campbell was trying to throw the ball away with no Raiders in the vicinity at the New England 6-yard line on second down and goal. I surmised he just delivered it directly to Patrick Chung, who caught it easily even with a hand in a cast. The Patriots drove for a field goal to make it 17-10 at the halftime gun. Wasted yardage, 75 on that drive, was a theme for the Raiders, who piled up 504 while never realistically having a shot to win down the stretch. If it feels like I am jumping ahead ,it is because the Patriots moved the ball at will in this game when they needed to. Welker's receiving and the hard running of rookie Stevan Ridley were unstoppable. Ridley capped the first drive of the second half with a touchdown run from 33 yards out. Oakland did answer with a drive for a field goal, but it took 7:34 to get it done. An offense built to wear teams down running the ball is not going to beat an offense run by Tom Brady with long marches for 3 points. Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the fourth quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown."

   "comment":"Heyward-Bey (4-42) back to the lineup for 19 yards. Unheralded tight end Brandon Myers had his only reception of the game for another 24 to put the offense in scoring position. As would be the theme of the day, they stalled from there, and Sebastian Janikowski made it 3-0 on a 40-yard field goal. The Bears needed to lean on the running game with a backup quarterback, but Matt Forte lost 3 yards to start their next drive, which went 3-and-out. He was mostly bottled up on the afternoon, collecting just 84 yards on 18 touches with a huge chunk (33 yards) coming on 1 carry. Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead. The aforementioned long run by Forte (33 yards) put the Bears in plus territory, but on third down, Hanie threw another interception with Michael Huff on the receiving end. The Raiders did nothing with the ball as the first quarter ended, but Lechler not only avoided dangerous punt returner Devin Hester, he also pinned Chicago at the 3-yard line. A quick 3-and-out put Oakland right back in business at midfield. They tried to get Michael Bush (24-69) going in the running game, but he was held in check all afternoon. Bush did manage to pick up a 4th-and-1, but the drive came up empty when Julius Peppers and Charles Tillman combined on a sack to back them out of field-goal range. The Bears finally got the chains moving with Marion Barber (10-69) looking like his old self running for 15, 4 and 8 yards to start the drive. Hanie (18-for-36 254 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) did more damage on the run (5-50), picking up 24 to convert a 3rd-and-18. Faced with 3rd-and-8, he found his hot receiver when the Raiders blitzed, and Johnny Knox (4-145, 1 TD) did the rest for the score. Despite being outplayed, the visitors were up 7-6. I have a little fun with fullback Marcel Reece calling him a matchup nightmare which is what radio announcer Greg Papa referred to him as in the preseason, but he looked like 1 taking a screen 47 yards down the sideline to start Oakland's next drive. That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2-minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end Kellen Davis helped them reach the 6. However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage. The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His sixth boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by Darrius Heyward-Bey, but Lechler delivered a franchise record 80-yard punt that sent an amazed Hester running backwards as the ball went into the end zone. Chicago's offense had some fight left with Hanie finding Knox on a pickup of 19 yards then going right back to him on an identical play for 16 more to put them in scoring range. Hanie scrambled for 7 yards and Gould connected from 53 yards out to trim the lead to 18-13. It looked like Oakland's next drive put a finish to any comeback bid. "

   "comment":"Heyward-Bey covering 30 yards to enter Green Bay territory. The visit would be short-lived, as 2 plays later D.J. Smith got the first of the 4 interceptions Carson Palmer tossed on the afternoon. Aaron Rodgers had a poor showing, relatively speaking, on the stat sheet (17-of-30 for 281 yards, 2 TDs, INT) and had a QB rating below triple digits for the first time in a long time. However, he was on fire when it came to drawing the defense offsides, which slowed down the pass rush. Rodgers did it on the opening play, and the first official play from scrimmage was a 47-yard touchdown romp by Ryan Grant (10-85, 2 TDs). The Packers had a brilliant game plan and were smart enough to take advantage of a porous run defense by utilizing Grant, who is finally healthy. After Green Bay forced a punt, Rodgers quickly showed why he is the MVP of the league, directing a 10-play, 80-yard scoring drive and distributing the ball to 5 different receivers. The touchdown went to rookie tight end Ryan Taylor who had not caught a pass yet entering today's action. I'm pretty sure while preparing for this game, Oakland's defense was more concerned about stopping any number of other weapons, and quite frankly, they did not let any 1 particular player hurt them. However, the problem remains that even with no player catching more than 4 passes and only Jordy Nelson (81 yards) and Donald Driver (75 yards) exceeding 50 yards receiving, all Rodgers does is find the open man and move the ball down the field. It was really a rinse-and-repeat situation for the next several drives. The Raiders went nowhere and the Packers kept scoring. First, Green Bay settled for a field goal on a drive wrecked by penalties to make it 17-0 early in the second quarter. Then they took what they wanted on a quick 84-yard drive covering just 6 plays. Two passes went to Driver for 28 yards, and the bookend completions were to Nelson who got loose down the sideline for a 37-yard score to start the bloodbath. Well, the rout was really on when Oakland's next drive ended early on a Charles Woodson interception in a clear case of Heisman-Trophy-winner-on-Heisman-Trophy-winner abuse. The Packers took advantage of a long penalty to set up first-and-goal from the 6, and Grant ran it in for a commanding 24-0 advantage. The first stop of the day for the Raiders came when Mike Mitchell took the ball away from Jermichael Finley in the end zone for an interception. The shutout was almost broken up, but after going 66 yards, Palmer connected with Rob Francois on another interception. The second half was just a matter of Green Bay holding on and staying healthy. The drives that mostly ended in touchdowns earlier in the afternoon were limited to field goals in the third quarter, but the points made sure the game stayed well in hand, allowing them to rest Rodgers for the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Oakland finally got on the board on its first possession of the second half via a very effective 80-yard march with all 9 plays going for positive yardage highlighted by a 34-yard pass to Heyward-Bey (5-78).

San Diego replied with a long touchdown drive of its own, mixing passes to Malcom Floyd with runs by Curtis Brinkley and Mike Tolbert to put the team in plus territory. From there, Rivers hit Antonio Gates for a 38-yard touchdown, tying the game at 7. As the first quarter ended, a rare failed drive followed. Palmer threw short to Kevin Boss and Oakland punted into the end zone. The Chargers quickly got into the Raiders' territory with a 37-yard pass to Gates, and Tolbert finished the drive with a 1-yard plunge, putting the visitors up 14-7. They would never relinquish the lead. Oakland got another big play from Heyward-Bey (9-130, TD) who finished just short of 1,000 yards on the season at 975. After a 19-yard reception from Murphy, the drive looked promising, but stalled. After a long field goal by "

Rogers responded well, showing so much more play-making ability than Heyward-Bey ever did. Rogers led the team ith 6 grabs for 107 yards and 2 touchdowns. Some of this production was the result of poor tackling, but the former Tennessee Vol was impressive nonetheless. He could have a bright future ahead of him if he continues to stay out of trouble, as he's donethis year.    As for the winners, "

   "comment":"Heyward-Bey because his foot slid out of bounds as he was making the catch. Things looked slightly smoother in the second half until the Steelers false started on the 1-inch line, forcing a field goal. Ben Roethlisberger then fired a pass into double coverage that was intercepted. On the following drive, Pittsburgh failed to line up correctly on multiple occasions. By the time Roethlisberger threw a touchdown to either push or cover the spread, time had pretty much expired, all because of horrible clock management.    There were 2 bright spots for the Steelers. The first was Antonio Brown. As expected, he dominated, catching 9 balls for 133 yards and a touchdown. The second was DeAngelo Williams, who was running like it was 2008. Williams found big holes through a Vince Wilfork-less defensive line, gaining 127 yards on 21 carries. Rookie Malcom Brown struggled, while Dominique Easley was sent into the locker room with a hip injury.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, went 26-of-38 for 351 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Those numbers are a bit deceiving, as a big chunk, as well as the score, came in garbage time. However, Big Ben also was betrayed by dumb mistakes, like the Heyward-Bey botched touchdown and some drops. Roethlisberger also had to target Heyward-Bey instead of the suspended Martavis Bryant, while center Maurkice Pouncey was missed.    One other Steeler worth mentioning is "

   "comment":"Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown on yet another nice throw. I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1-point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit "

   "comment":"Heyward-Bey - far too often. The end result happened to be tons of dropped passes and missed opportunities. New England's offense, meanwhile, did enough to get the victory. Thirty-6 points isn't indicative of their overall performance, as they scored a free, quick touchdown following an Eli Rogers lost fumble, and they were very fortunate to retain possession following a Tom Brady lost fumble that should've been rewarded to Pittsburgh. However, the Steelers struggled to stop the Patriots on too many drives, and they probably would've lost to the Patriots regardless. This game would've been a lot closer with Bell on the field, though.    Tom Brady finished 32-of-42 for 384 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also fumbled, but despite the Steelers getting a clear recovery, incompetent officiating ruled New England possession without any sort of explanation. That was Brady's sole mistake of the afternoon, and his numbers would've been better if it weren't for a couple of drops. It really helped that Brady was seldom hit this evening. He took a sack early, but was barely touched after that. Brady will be heading to his seventh Super Bowl, and if he gets the win, he'll have the most championships of any quarterback in NFL history, breaking the current tie he has with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw.    Despite Brady's high yardage total, only 3 Patriots accumulated more han 13 receiving yards. They were Chris Hogan (9-180), Julian Edelman (8-118) and Martellus Bennett (5-32). Hogan secured 2 of Brady's 3 touchdowns, while Edelman snatched the other. Both made big plays in this game, obviously, but Edelman really sparked the team with a 12-yard conversion on a third-and-10 between 2 defenders, ultimately leading to a score.    The Patriots tried to run with LeGarrette Blount in the early going, but weren't very successful; his 5 first-half carries went for just 4 yards. However, the flu-stricken Steelers wore down in the second half, and Blount finished with 47 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. His best run was when he managed to carry what appeared to be the entire Pittsburgh defense down to the 1-yard line.    Back to the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 31-of-47 for 314 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. While Roethlisberger accumulated a bulk of his numbers in garbage time, it's still amazing that he was competent when factoring in the utter trash he was throwing to. With Bell injured and Brown constantly double teamed, he had to resort to working with the aforementioned Coates, Hamilton and Heyward-Bey. The first drive saw Roethlisberger curiously take a deep shot to Coates on a third-and-1, which fell incomplete. Hamilton dropped a touchdown in the second quarter. Coates then did the same thing right after halftime. Heyward-Bey was responsible for Roethlisberger's interception, as he wasn't even aware the ball was heading in his direction. The Steelers could have Martavis Bryant back next year, but he needs to be reinstated. It's difficult for the Steelers to trust him, so they may target 1 of the 2017 NFL Draft Wide Receiver Prospect Rankings in the early rounds. Roethlisberger desperately needs someone reliable to throw to outside of Brown.    Pittsburgh's 2 leading receivers were predictably Brown (7-77)and Rogers (7-66). However, Brown didn't do much when this game was in doubt, while Rogers was responsible for a lost fumble that gave the Patriots a quick touchdown, putting this game completely out of reach.    With Bell limited to just 6 carries (20 yards), "
