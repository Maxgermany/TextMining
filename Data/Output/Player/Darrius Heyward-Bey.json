If I'm to criticize the Raiders, I have to do the same to the Chiefs: - The Chiefs wasted 2 timeouts early in the first half. Late in the second quarter, Cassel threw a short pass (shocker) to a receiver who couldn't get out of bounds deep in Oakland territory. The Chiefs didn't have a timeout, so they couldn't stop the clock and the half expired. - Heyward-Bey caught the first pass of his career, which was an 18-yarder.

   "comment":"Darrius Heyward-Bey, but Lechler delivered a franchise record 80-yard punt that sent an amazed Hester running backwards as the ball went into the end zone. Chicago's offense had some fight left with Hanie finding Knox on a pickup of 19 yards then going right back to him on an identical play for 16 more to put them in scoring range. Hanie scrambled for 7 yards and Gould connected from 53 yards out to trim the lead to 18-13. It looked like Oakland's next drive put a finish to any comeback bid. Heyward-Bey (4-42) back to the lineup for 19 yards. Unheralded tight end Brandon Myers had his only reception of the game for another 24 to put the offense in scoring position. As would be the theme of the day, they stalled from there, and Sebastian Janikowski made it 3-0 on a 40-yard field goal. The Bears needed to lean on the running game with a backup quarterback, but Matt Forte lost 3 yards to start their next drive, which went 3.and-out. He was mostly bottled up on the afternoon, collecting just 84 yards on 18 touches with a huge chunk (33 yards) coming on 1 carry. Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead. The aforementioned long run by Forte (33 yards) put the Bears in plus territory, but on third down, Hanie threw another interception with Michael Huff on the receiving end. The Raiders did nothing with the ball as the first quarter ended, but Lechler not only avoided dangerous punt returner Devin Hester, he also pinned Chicago at the 3-yard line. A quick 3.and-out put Oakland right back in business at midfield. They tried to get Michael Bush (24-69) going in the running game, but he was held in check all afternoon. Bush did manage to pick up a 4th-and-1, but the drive came up empty when Julius Peppers and Charles Tillman combined on a sack to back them out of field-goal range. The Bears finally got the chains moving with Marion Barber (10-69) looking like his old self running for 15, 4 and 8 yards to start the drive. Hanie (18-for-36 254 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) did more damage on the run (5-50), picking up 24 to convert a 3rd-and-18. Faced with 3rd-and-8, he found his hot receiver when the Raiders blitzed, and Johnny Knox (4-145, 1 TD) did the rest for the score. Despite being outplayed, the visitors were up 7-6. I have a little fun with fullback Marcel Reece calling him a matchup nightmare which is what radio announcer Greg Papa referred to him as in the preseason, but he looked like 1 taking a screen 47 yards down the sideline to start Oakland's next drive. That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2.minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end Kellen Davis helped them reach the 6. However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage. The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His 6.h boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by Darrius Heyward-Bey, but Lechler delivered a franchise record 80-yard punt that sent an amazed Hester running backwards as the ball went into the end zone. Chicago's offense had some fight left with Hanie finding Knox on a pickup of 19 yards then going right back to him on an identical play for 16 more to put them in scoring range. Hanie scrambled for 7 yards and Gould connected from 53 yards out to trim the lead to 18-13. It looked like Oakland's next drive put a finish to any comeback bid. "

   "comment":"Darrius Heyward-Bey covering 30 yards to enter Green Bay territory. The visit would be short-lived, as 2 plays later Heyward-Bey covering 30 yards to enter Green Bay territory. The visit would be short-lived, as 2 plays later D.J. Smith got the first of the 4 interceptions Carson Palmer tossed on the afternoon. Aaron Rodgers had a poor showing, relatively speaking, on the stat sheet (17-of-30 for 281 yards, 2 TDs, INT) and had a QB rating below triple digits for the first time in a long time. However, he was on fire when it came to drawing the defense offsides, which slowed down the pass rush. Rodgers did it on the opening play, and the first official play from scrimmage was a 47-yard touchdown romp by Ryan Grant (10-85, 2 TDs). The Packers had a brilliant game plan and were smart enough to take advantage of a porous run defense by utilizing Grant, who is finally healthy. After Green Bay forced a punt, Rodgers quickly showed why he is the MVP of the league, directing a 10-play, 80-yard scoring drive and distributing the ball to 5 different receivers. The touchdown went to rookie tight end Ryan Taylor who had not caught a pass yet entering today's action. I'm pretty sure while preparing for this game, Oakland's defense was more concerned about stopping any number of other weapons, and quite frankly, they did not let any 1 particular player hurt them. However, the problem remains that even with no player catching more than 4 passes and only Jordy Nelson (81 yards) and Donald Driver (75 yards) exceeding 50 yards receiving, all Rodgers does is find the open man and move the ball down the field. It was really a rinse-and-repeat situation for the next several drives. The Raiders went nowhere and the Packers kept scoring. First, Green Bay settled for a field goal on a drive wrecked by penalties to make it 17-0 early in the second quarter. Then they took what they wanted on a quick 84-yard drive covering just 6 plays. Two passes went to Driver for 28 yards, and the bookend completions were to Nelson who got loose down the sideline for a 37-yard score to start the bloodbath. Well, the rout was really on when Oakland's next drive ended early on a Charles Woodson interception in a clear case of Heisman-Trophy-winner-on-Heisman-Trophy-winner abuse. The Packers took advantage of a long penalty to set up first-and-goal from the 6, and Grant ran it in for a commanding 24-0 advantage. The first stop of the day for the Raiders came when Mike Mitchell took the ball away from Jermichael Finley in the end zone for an interception. The shutout was almost broken up, but after going 66 yards, Palmer connected with Rob Francois on another interception. The second half was just a matter of Green Bay holding on and staying healthy. The drives that mostly ended in touchdowns earlier in the afternoon were limited to field goals in the third quarter, but the points made sure the game stayed well in hand, allowing them to rest Rodgers for the 4.h quarter. Meanwhile, Oakland finally got on the board on its first possession of the second half via a very effective 80-yard march with all 9 plays going for positive yardage highlighted by a 34-yard pass to Heyward-Bey (5-78).

Heyward-Bey because his foot slid out of bounds as he was making the catch. Things looked slightly smoother in the second half until the Steelers false started on the 1-inch line, forcing a field goal. Ben Roethlisberger then fired a pass into double coverage that was intercepted. On the following drive, Pittsburgh failed to line up correctly on multiple occasions. By the time Roethlisberger threw a touchdown to either push or cover the spread, time had pretty much expired, all because of horrible clock management.    There were 2 bright spots for the Steelers. The first was Antonio Brown. As expected, he dominated, catching 9 balls for 133 yards and a touchdown. The second was DeAngelo Williams, who was running like it was 2008. Williams found big holes through a Vince Wilfork-less defensive line, gaining 127 yards on 21 carries. Rookie Malcom Brown struggled, while Dominique Easley was sent into the locker room with a hip injury.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, went 26-of-38 for 351 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Those numbers are a bit deceiving, as a big chunk, as well as the score, came in garbage time. However, Big Ben also was betrayed by dumb mistakes, like the Heyward-Bey botched touchdown and some drops. Roethlisberger also had to target Heyward-Bey instead of the suspended Martavis Bryant, while center Maurkice Pouncey was missed.    One other Steeler worth mentioning is "
