   "comment":"Erik Pears along the way and twice converting third downs. New York stiffened up on defense and Rayner tried to make amends for his kickoff flub by giving his team the 24-21 lead on a booming 53-yard field goal. After a quick exchange of punts, I pointed out on Twitter that the time was now for Sanchez and the Jets, even with 5:44 remaining. They responded. After drawing boos earlier in the game, the New York signal caller shook off his day-long inaccuracy by completing passes to convert a pair of third downs. Sanchez was 6-for-8 on what wound up being the winning drive for 65 yards and his final touchdown pass to, who else, Holmes covering 16 yards with 1:09 left on the clock. Keep in mind Sanchez entered the drive 11-for-27. The Bills came out in shotgun formation for their last ditch effort to pull out a victory and drove right down to the Jets' 27-yard line with quick passes to Nelson and Pears along the way and twice converting third downs.
