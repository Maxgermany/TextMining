Entering this game, the Redskins' offense had no turnovers on the season, which would explain their impressive and unexpected 4-1 record. Well, they had 3 on Sunday, which would explain this loss. This was a tough spot for Washington, coming off 2 consecutive divisional victories on the road. I can't really blame them for being unfocused. That said, there's no excuse for losing to the awful Rams. I thought this game would be close, but allowing Jim Haslett, a makeshift offensive line, a crippled Bulger and a Swiss cheese defense to beat you is inexcusable.    "
