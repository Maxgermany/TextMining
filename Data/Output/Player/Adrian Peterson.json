   "comment":"Adrian Peterson. Peterson caught the ball. After bobbling it initially, he established complete control. His knee, elbow and back were on the ground when the ball was knocked out by a Saints defender. It was ruled incomplete and challenged by Chicago. Carey reviewed it and inexplicably let the call stand. Even the Saints radio announcers said Carey made a mistake. The only reasonable explanation for this is that Carey had action on the Saints +3. It was an injustice that play was rule incomplete. At the end of regulation, Carey's crew missed an extremely obvious pass interference on Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized Pierre Thomas constantly, which is something they should have done at the beginning of the season. The Frenchman rushed for 87 yards, caught 7 balls for 59 more yards and scored twice.    Reggie Bush, meanwhile, frustrated his owners by compiling just 48 total yards. Lance Moore also disappointed with 5 grabs for 28 yards.    It was all Marques Colston downfield for New Orleans; Colston had 6 receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown.    I like Mike Carey as an official. OK, liked. He made a horrific call of Ed Hocchulian proportions on a Chicago fake punt in the 4.h quarter. Brad Maynard hooked up on a long pass to Adrian Peterson. Peterson caught the ball. After bobbling it initially, he established complete control. His knee, elbow and back were on the ground when the ball was knocked out by a Saints defender.

Good thing the Browns didn't spend so much money on defensive linemen a year ago. Oh, wait...    Favre was just 14-of-21 for 110 yards and a touchdown to Percy Harvin. Favre didn't exactly do anything to validate the signing, but the 1 important thing he didn't do was turn the ball over. That will probably happen later in the year.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 3 receptions for 36 yards and a score. Harvin also ran the ball twice for 22 yards. Harvin appears to be Brett Favre's favorite target, though it should be noted that Bernard Berrian (0 catches) was limited with an injury.

One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had 5 grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching 4 balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out.

Donovan McNabb was able to execute some play-action passing because of the strong running game that overwhelmed the Bucs defense. In the first half Peterson ran for 83 yards on 15 carries with 2 short touchdown runs. Peterson also had a fumble, but it was recovered by Minnesota. Gerhart had 36 yards on 2 carries with 1 reception for 42 yards. At halftime, McNabb completed 11-of-17 passes for 153 yards with no interceptions or touchdowns. McNabb had a good run for a first down to extend the Vikings' second touchdown drive. He did a good job as a game manager early, but couldn't come up with needed plays in clutch time in the second half. At halftime, Minnesota had a 17-0 lead. Peterson, McNabb and Vikings were slow to move the ball in the second half. Peterson had only 9 yards rushing on 4 carries in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Minnesota had a field goal drive, but the offense didn't do enough to seal the win for the Vikings and that let the Bucs offense pull out a comeback.    Peterson ran for 120 yards on 25 carries with 2 touchdowns. McNabb completed 16-of-27 passes for 193 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Wide receiver "

   "comment":"Adrian Peterson's knee injury was the best thing to ever happen to the Vikings, but that's what I initially thought when the All-Pro running back went down when his leg bent backward on the first play of the third quarter. I didn't totally see how bad it was at first, so I figured if Peterson were removed from the game with perhaps some sort of sprain, Minnesota would have a better chance to lose, thus keeping them alive in the Andrew Luck and Matt Kalil sweepstakes. Well, apparently not. Peterson had to be helped off the field and couldn't put any pressure on his left leg. He tore both his ACL and MCL, putting the beginning of next season in doubt. Adding insult to injury (2 injuries), Minnesota won this contest.

As it turns out, both would have a big impact in what would be the first NFL game to ever have an overtime possession following a score. Peterson was a monster. He rushed for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. He made a number of tough runs, breaking a ton of tackles like the Peterson of old. If I didn't know any better, I wouldn't have thought for a second that he was coming off major knee surgery. I would have only questioned why he had 17 carries, but that number will increase steadily as the season progresses. As for Jones-Drew, he gained 77 yards on 19 carries, but wasn't nearly as explosive as he was in 2011. "

   "comment":"Adrian Peterson's impressive running, the Vikings were able to establish a 17-14 lead in the second quarter. They managed just 3 points after that, however, as the offense got completely bogged down. So, what happened? Peterson's impressive running, the Vikings were able to establish a 17-14 lead in the second quarter. They managed just 3 points after that, however, as the offense got completely bogged down. So, what happened? Percy Harvin's injury happened. The dynamic wideout injured his ankle at the beginning of the second half. He missed some action and then reentered the contest, but he was completely ineffective once he took the field again. He was limping around, which really limited the offense. He finished with 2 catches for 10 yards and 4 carries for 24 rushing yards.    Christian Ponder didn't really have his top option in the second half, so some will blame Harvin's injury on Ponder's pathetic stats (11-of-22, 63 yards and an interception), but Ponder was just 7-of-13 for 42 yards prior to halftime, which is when Harvin was healthy. Ponder has regressed terribly the past few weeks, and those impressive home victories over the 49ers and Titans seem like a million years ago.    I mentioned Peterson earlier. He's the only reason why the Vikings were even competitive. He opened the contest with a 74-yard burst and finished with 182 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. Peterson had just 5 attempts after halftime, so the Vikings need to be criticized for abandoning the ground attack so willingly. Peterson also led the team with 3 catches for 11 receiving yards. Sadly, the leading Minnesota receiver was "

   "comment":"Adrian Peterson went nuts and inched very close to breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season yardage mark. But that was hardly the case. Peterson had several good runs, but this was mostly about great Minnesota defense and Christian Ponder making several impressive throws to keep drives alive. The Vikings' stop unit was absolutely dominant. They completely shut down the run, limiting Arian Foster to 15 yards on 10 carries. It was easily his worst outing of the season. Making matters worse, Foster lost a fumble in the first half and later exited the contest in the second half with an irregular heartbeat. Foster called it a very minor situation. Meanwhile, Ponder had some brilliant moments, as indicated earlier. He also made several terrible throws. It was crazy how inconsistent he was. He'd make an awful-looking pass and then come back and convert a long-yardage situation. In all, Minnesota was 9-of-18 on third down, as Ponder went 16-of-30 for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also had 7 scrambles for 48 rushing yards.    Adrian Peterson still was great though. The Texans loaded the box on every play, so Peterson had many losses. However, he broke loose for several impressive gains, ultimately finishing with 86 yards on 25 carries. Peterson now has 1,898 rushing yards. He needs 208 yards to break Dickerson's record, which is feasible, though the Packers, who happen to be next week's opponent, just limited Peterson went nuts and inched very close to breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season yardage mark. But that was hardly the case. Peterson had several good runs, but this was mostly about great Minnesota defense and Christian Ponder making several impressive throws to keep drives alive."

Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line.

He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Peterson to put up a 3.point drive.

   "comment":"Adrian Peterson ran the ball into the end zone. St. Louis answered with a nice play-fake to set up a 55-yard bomb to Kenny Britt. Todd Gurley finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then, the Rams went for the ill-fated 2.point conversion that saw a Gurley run stopped. The decision was even more questionable shortly later when Greg Zuerlein drilled a 61-yard field goal. Nick Foles led 2 more field goal drives, and the Rams took a 15-10 lead into the half. After a hot start, the Vikings' offense cooled. Bridgewater threw a deep ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Trumaine Johnson. Some runs by Peterson got Minnesota righted though, and Bridgewater ran in a 6.yard touchdown. He also ran in the 2.point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown. Then, the Vikings lost Bridgewater when he got nailed by a dirty hit from Lamarcus Joyner. Bridgewater was sliding and Joyner dived at his head. That knocked Bridgewater out of the game with concussion-like symptoms. After being held in check for most of the game, Gurley started pounding the Vikings' defense and moved the ball into Minnesota territory. That set up Zuerlein, but a 48-yard field goal attempt went wide right. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, Vikings backup Shaun Hill took a sack for an 11-yard loss. St. Louis timeouts between plays set up the Rams' offense to get the ball back at the Minnesota 39-yard line with a 1:12 to go. A completion and pass interference on Trae Waynes put the ball on the Vikings' 36-yard line. Zuerlein connected on his 53-yarder to force overtime. If the Rams had not gone for 2 in the first quarter, that would have won the game on that kick. In overtime, the Vikings forced a 3.and-out, before Marcus Sherels returned the punt 26 yards to midfield. Peterson did the rest to set up Blair Walsh as he was good on a 40-yarder, and Minnesota won its 4.h straight game.    Teddy Bridgewater was 13-of-21 for 144 yards with an interception. He ran 3 times for 17 yards and a score.    Adrian Peterson ran for 125 yards on 29 carries with a touchdown. Peterson ran the ball into the end zone.

Peterson also lost a fumble in the red zone during the 4.h quarter, which was a crushing blow for the Vikings, as they were just about a dozen yards away from trimming the margin to a 1.score game.    As for Bridgewater, he went 25-of-37 for 296 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled 4 times for 43 rushing yards. The numbers were fine, but Bridgewater didn't have an opportunity to keep drives alive because of all the sacks he took. He was very sharp early, converting some third-and-long situations, but he never was the same when he took a crushing blow on a sack late in the second quarter. Bridgewater missed just a couple of snaps, but he wasn't as effective after the jarring hit.    Bridgewater targeted "

   "comment":"Adrian Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald, all had magnificent performances.Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald, all had magnificent performances. Peterson, especially, was the difference. He struggled to do anything in New Orleans, so trading for him seemed like grasping at straws. It was a life boat instead, as Peterson was absolutely dominant. He gashed the hapless Buccaneers for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. This stat line was not the byproduct of fluky runs; Peterson showed the same sort of burst, power and juke moves that he displayed in his prime. I can't explain it, but it happened. Peterson was amazing, and if he keeps running like this, Arizona will be able to compete for the NFC West title.    Palmer, meanwhile, was also terrific. I can't believe I wrote that sentence after watching him struggle for the first 5 weeks of the season, but Palmer didn't even have an incompletion in this contest until the third quarter! He was 13-of-13 for 211 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half alone. Palmer didn't do much following halftime, which would explain why his stats didn't change much - he finished 18-of-22 for 283 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception on a careless deep shot into double coverage - but this is obviously an encouraging development for the Cardinals. It's hard not to forget how much Palmer struggled in the 5 previous weeks - plus, Palmer had a pick dropped by a linebacker in the 4.h quarter - but perhaps he'll continue to play better now that he appears to have a strong running game aiding him.    The last of the veterans, Fitzgerald snared 10 of his 11 targets for 138 yards and a touchdown. As with Peterson and Palmer, Fitzgerald performed as if he were in his prime, though unlike the other 2 veterans, he had thrived earlier this season. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, he made a mistake when he lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Along with Fitzgerald, "
