I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized Pierre Thomas constantly, which is something they should have done at the beginning of the season. The Frenchman rushed for 87 yards, caught 7 balls for 59 more yards and scored twice.    Reggie Bush, meanwhile, frustrated his owners by compiling just 48 total yards. Lance Moore also disappointed with 5 grabs for 28 yards.    It was all Marques Colston downfield for New Orleans; Colston had 6 receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown.    I like Mike Carey as an official. OK, liked. He made a horrific call of Ed Hocchulian proportions on a Chicago fake punt in the fourth quarter. Brad Maynard hooked up on a long pass to Adrian Peterson. Peterson caught the ball. After bobbling it initially, he established complete control. His knee, elbow and back were on the ground when the ball was knocked out by a Saints defender. It was ruled incomplete and challenged by Chicago. Carey reviewed it and inexplicably let the call stand. Even the Saints radio announcers said Carey made a mistake. The only reasonable explanation for this is that Carey had action on the Saints +3. It was an injustice that play was rule incomplete. At the end of regulation, Carey's crew missed an extremely obvious pass interference on "

   "comment":"Peterson 27-yard touchdown run.    Stafford finished 18-of-30 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had 5 grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching 4 balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out. Unfortunately, Detroit could not contain Peterson, who rushed for 92 yards and a score on just 15 carries. Of course, 1 has to wonder why Peterson got only 15 carries.

   "comment":"Peterson 27-yard touchdown run.    Stafford finished 18-of-30 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had 5 grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching 4 balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out. Unfortunately, Detroit could not contain Peterson, who rushed for 92 yards and a score on just 15 carries. Of course, 1 has to wonder why Peterson got only 15 carries.    Two games and 2 touchdowns for "

Donovan McNabb was able to execute some play-action passing because of the strong running game that overwhelmed the Bucs defense. In the first half Peterson ran for 83 yards on 15 carries with 2 short touchdown runs. Peterson also had a fumble, but it was recovered by Minnesota. Gerhart had 36 yards on 2 carries with 1 reception for 42 yards. At halftime, McNabb completed 11-of-17 passes for 153 yards with no interceptions or touchdowns. McNabb had a good run for a first down to extend the Vikings' second touchdown drive. He did a good job as a game manager early, but couldn't come up with needed plays in clutch time in the second half. At halftime, Minnesota had a 17-0 lead. Peterson, McNabb and Vikings were slow to move the ball in the second half. Peterson had only 9 yards rushing on 4 carries in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota had a field goal drive, but the offense didn't do enough to seal the win for the Vikings and that let the Bucs offense pull out a comeback.    Peterson ran for 120 yards on 25 carries with 2 touchdowns. McNabb completed 16-of-27 passes for 193 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Wide receiver "

Jared Allen, who occasionally made his presence felt in this 1, was there for the recovery. The Vikings went to Harvin on consecutive runs and quickly covered the 16 yards for a 7-0 lead. At least the Panthers did not let momentum sway too much, holding possession for 14 plays and converting a pair of third downs. The drive stalled when they failed twice on third down. The first time was an incomplete pass thrown into heavy traffic, but Byron Bell was called for holding. Leslie Frazier decided to back them up instead of risking a long made field goal. After an incomplete pass, the strategy paid off. A shovel pass to Adrian Peterson (5 receptions for 76 yards, 1 TD) for 22 yards helped Minnesota change field position, but it wound up not mattering.

   "comment":"Peterson nor Maurice Jones-Drew would play in this game. As it turns out, both would have a big impact in what would be the first NFL game to ever have an overtime possession following a score. Peterson was a monster. He rushed for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. He made a number of tough runs, breaking a ton of tackles like the Peterson of old. If I didn't know any better, I wouldn't have thought for a second that he was coming off major knee surgery. I would have only questioned why he had 17 carries, but that number will increase steadily as the season progresses. As for Jones-Drew, he gained 77 yards on 19 carries, but wasn't nearly as explosive as he was in 2011. "

   "comment":"Peterson's impressive running, the Vikings were able to establish a 17-14 lead in the second quarter. They managed just 3 points after that, however, as the offense got completely bogged down. So, what happened? Percy Harvin's injury happened. The dynamic wideout injured his ankle at the beginning of the second half. He missed some action and then reentered the contest, but he was completely ineffective once he took the field again. He was limping around, which really limited the offense. He finished with 2 catches for 10 yards and 4 carries for 24 rushing yards.    Christian Ponder didn't really have his top option in the second half, so some will blame Harvin's injury on Ponder's pathetic stats (11-of-22, 63 yards and an interception), but Ponder was just 7-of-13 for 42 yards prior to halftime, which is when Harvin was healthy. Ponder has regressed terribly the past few weeks, and those impressive home victories over the 49ers and Titans seem like a million years ago.    I mentioned Peterson earlier. He's the only reason why the Vikings were even competitive. He opened the contest with a 74-yard burst and finished with 182 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. Peterson had just 5 attempts after halftime, so the Vikings need to be criticized for abandoning the ground attack so willingly. Peterson also led the team with 3 catches for 11 receiving yards. Sadly, the leading Minnesota receiver was "

He was absolutely horrible, going 12-of-25 for 119 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. One of the picks was horrendous. Peterson trampled Green Bay's reeling defense on the entire drive, but Ponder was asked to throw inside the red zone. He scrambled right and didn't have anything, yet he still threw late across his body. The Packers snagged a very easy interception. Ponder just keeps getting worse. He now has 11 interceptions to just 10 touchdowns since Week 5. He's completed better than 54.3 percent of his passes just once since Week 7. He ruined what looked like a possible record-breaking day for Peterson, who was amazing. He rushed for 210 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He eclipsed the 200-yard barrier early in the fourth quarter, so it appeared as though he could break his own single-game rushing record of 296 yards. Unfortunately, the Vikings trailed because of Ponder's ineptitude, so they couldn't give Peterson enough carries.    The only Viking to catch more than 2 passes was "

Then, the Rams went for the ill-fated 2-point conversion that saw a Gurley run stopped. The decision was even more questionable shortly later when Greg Zuerlein drilled a 61-yard field goal. Nick Foles led 2 more field goal drives, and the Rams took a 15-10 lead into the half. After a hot start, the Vikings' offense cooled. Bridgewater threw a deep ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Trumaine Johnson. Some runs by Peterson got Minnesota righted though, and Bridgewater ran in a 6-yard touchdown. He also ran in the 2-point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when "

Minnesota could've easily won this game, but shot itself in the foot too many times.    Speaking of Peterson, the numbers show that he managed just 69 yards and a touchdown (the 100th of his career) on 23 carries. He was much better than the stats indicate, however. Peterson ran with explosion and moved the pile against 1 of the best ground defenses in the NFL. Peterson also did a great job of picking up the blitz.    Minnesota's leader in receiving yardage was "

   "comment":"Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald, all had magnificent performances. Peterson, especially, was the difference. He struggled to do anything in New Orleans, so trading for him seemed like grasping at straws. It was a life boat instead, as Peterson was absolutely dominant. He gashed the hapless Buccaneers for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. This stat line was not the byproduct of fluky runs; Peterson showed the same sort of burst, power and juke moves that he displayed in his prime. I can't explain it, but it happened. Peterson was amazing, and if he keeps running like this, Arizona will be able to compete for the NFC West title.    Palmer, meanwhile, was also terrific. I can't believe I wrote that sentence after watching him struggle for the first 5 weeks of the season, but Palmer didn't even have an incompletion in this contest until the third quarter! He was 13-of-13 for 211 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half alone. Palmer didn't do much following halftime, which would explain why his stats didn't change much - he finished 18-of-22 for 283 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception on a careless deep shot into double coverage - but this is obviously an encouraging development for the Cardinals. It's hard not to forget how much Palmer struggled in the 5 previous weeks - plus, Palmer had a pick dropped by a linebacker in the fourth quarter - but perhaps he'll continue to play better now that he appears to have a strong running game aiding him.    The last of the veterans, Fitzgerald snared 10 of his 11 targets for 138 yards and a touchdown. As with Peterson and Palmer, Fitzgerald performed as if he were in his prime, though unlike the other 2 veterans, he had thrived earlier this season. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, he made a mistake when he lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Along with Fitzgerald, "

The Rams dominated this game, though the injury to Palmer certainly helped matters. The Rams were up 6-0 in the second quarter, thanks to a missed Phil Dawson 32-yard field goal. Arizona had the ball, which changed when Palmer was hit as he threw, forcing an interception. Todd Gurley scored on the next play, but adding injury to insult, Palmer left the game with a broken arm and was replaced by Drew Stanton. The backup signal-caller was responsible for an interception on a miscommunication with John Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both "

   "comment":"Peterson paid off again, with the veteran back carrying them to a road win in San Francisco. This win puts the Cardinals at 4-4 and keeps them in the playoff chase. The 49ers fell to 0-9, but maintain their draft position for the 2018 NFL Draft.    Early in the first quarter, Cardinals quarterback Drew Stanton hit John Brown for 52 yards (his only catch), but Phil Dawson missed a short field goal for Arizona. The 49ers then gifted Arizona some points as Kyle Juszcyk was stripped by Tyrann Mathieu and the loose ball was scooped up by Patrick Peterson for a return to inside the 49ers' 10-yard line, which set up the Cardinals' offense.
