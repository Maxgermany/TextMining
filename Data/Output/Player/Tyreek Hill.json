Hill is really emerging as a weapon in the Chiefs' offense, and he has done enough to earn a starting job even when Jeremy Maclin comes back. Hill is a must-own in dynasty formats, and he is worth adding in standard leagues as well. Wilson, meanwhile, played well, but he is too inconsistent to be considered in fantasy. He did have a nice 55-yard touchdown run on a fake punt, but he is not likely to score much week in and week out.    Spencer Ware once again was the lead back for the Chiefs. He surprisingly had some issues against the Falcons' run defense, carrying the ball 14 times for 29 yards. The line could not get a lot of push up front, and the team had more success in the passing game. Ware did catch 3 passes for 23 yards and a touchdown, and he could have had more if Smith had hit him on that long pass. Ware is a low-end RB1 in most formats moving forward.    Final Note: Having "

   "comment":"Tyreek Hill. Later in the opening quarter, Hill. Later in the opening quarter, Alex Smith threw a bubble screen to Travis Kelce. The Broncos looked like they had never seen 1 before, and Kelce took advantage of terrific blocking to scamper 80 yards into the end zone. Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault. In fact, Smith's first poor throw of the night came on his 10th attempt when he made an errant throw to Spencer Ware. Smith later blew a field-goal chance by hurling a poor toss downfield instead of converting a sure thing for about 7 yards or so to give Cairo Santos a chance.    Kelce put together 1 of the best games of his career. He caught 11 of his 12 targets for a whopping 160 yards and a touchdown. In addition of sprinting 80 yards into the end zone, he also had so many key conversions on third down. The Chiefs were 9-of-17 on third downs, compared to Denver's 4-of-15 figure. I know the Broncos have had their issues against tight ends this year, but you'd think Wade Phillips would've devised a scheme to restrict Kelce. Denver will have to find an inside linebacker upgrade this offseason. I have the team doing this in my .    Kansas City's 2 receivers were disappointments in regard to their actual catching stats. Jeremy Maclin caught just 3 passes for 9 yards, and was nearly responsible for an interception when he ran the wrong route on 1 play. Hill, meanwhile, failed to haul in any of his 5 targets. However, Hill was effective on the ground, gaining 95 rushing yards and the aforementioned touchdown on his 70-yard sprint.    Ware had some nice carries as well, gaining 62 yards on 13 attempts. He lost late-game touches to "

Meanwhile, Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns. What's crazy is that Travis Kelce had just 40 of those yards (5 catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no 1 should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. "

In that short time frame, we saw some of the best, worst and most exciting football of the season. At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half. In the end, Dallas was able to convert on 7-of-12 third downs. The Chiefs also have some questions that need to be answered about their offense. Why did Kareem Hunt run the ball just 9 times, and why did Tyreek Hill see just 4 targets? The answer is likely to be the offensive line, which was not at its best despite being healthy. And as the run game has declined, so have Kansas City's wins. After getting off to a 5-0 start, the Chiefs have now lost 3 of their last 4 games, and a lack of strong ground game has been a big part of those losses.
