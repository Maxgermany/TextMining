   "comment":"Austin Davis.    Like Romo, Davis.    Like Romo, DeMarco Murray markedly improved after halftime. Murray lost a fumble in St. Louis territory early on, but finished with 100 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Sixty of his 100 yards came after intermission. He also chipped in as a pass-catcher, hauling in 4 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Romo's 2 scores went to Bryant (6-89), who drew that aforementioned key pass interference, and Terrance Williams (2-32). Jason Witten (4-49) didn't do much.    As for the Rams, they were so dominant early on, especially on their opening drive when they went 80 yards on 15 plays. They sucked nearly 9 minutes off the clock, and when they were up 17-0, it appeared to be a lock that they were going to pull the upset. However, they did plenty to bungle a potential victory. They made numerous mistakes, including: - The defense horribly blew a coverage in the third quarter, leaving Bryant wide open. Romo found him for a 68-yard touchdown. - Jeff Fisher opted to go for it on 4.h-and-inches on the Dallas 9-yard line. Zac Stacy was stuffed on a slow-moving play. The field goal that Fisher passed up proved to be the difference in this game. You have to wonder why inept offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer didn't call a quarterback sneak either. - Jared Cook dropped a touchdown in the second half. He had the ball in his hands, but bobbled it a couple of times. He then proceeded to yell at Davis on the sideline for some reason. He apologized to the team for being a bum afterward. - Carter, as mentioned, pick-sixed Davis. The Ram quarterback then was guilty of a game-ending interception when he overthrew his receiver. "

   "comment":"Austin Davis lost fumble on a strip-sack in the red zone; another Davis strip-sack that Philadelphia pounced on in the end zone for a touchdown; and a Zac Stacy lost fumble that was returned deep into St. Louis territory, setting up a Nick Foles-to-Jeremy Maclin touchdown.    With the Rams constantly committing turnovers and doing other things to hurt themselves - more on that later - all Nick Foles really had to do was manage the game. He did a good job of moving the chains on numerous occasions, but he nearly cost his team with a late fumble amid a ferocious St. Louis comeback. Foles went 24-of-37 for 207 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick in which he put too much air under the ball. Philadelphia's banged-up offensive line didn't turn out to be a liability in pass protection, as Foles didn't take a single sack.    Philadelphia's front didn't run block as well, as LeSean McCoy gained 81 yards on 24 carries. Some of that was McCoy's fault, as he made some terrible decisions on a few occasions. For instance, he lost a fumble because he ran around like an idiot and took a big loss before coughing the ball up. This gave the Rams an early red-zone trip, but it didn't end up mattering because St. Louis also turned the ball over on the ensuing possession.    Foles' scores went to Jeremy Maclin (5-76), who continued to stay hot, and Riley Cooper (4-33), whose touchdowns was an impressive, leaping grab over a defender in the end zone. Zach Ertz (3-39) finished second on the team in receiving.    The Rams, as mentioned, made so many careless errors. It was ridiculous, and their mistakes cost them a potential comeback from down 34-7. Here's a list of blunders they made in addition to the early blocked-punt touchdown: - There were so many drops. Kenny Britt let the ball fall through his hands early. Jared Cook dropped a potential first-down conversion on third-and-long in Eagles' territory. Austin Pettis was guilty twice in the final minute, single-handedly thwarting a potential game-winning drive. - Plenty of fumbles: Davis coughed up the ball twice (once in the red zone, once deep in his own territory that was scored by the defense) and Stacy lost the ball during a promising drive. - Countless procedural penalties: There were a ridiculous amount of false starts, including 1 out of a timeout. The Rams also were guilty of a delay-of-game infraction on 4.h-and-8 of the final drive.    Save for the fumbles and a couple of poor throws, Austin Davis performed pretty well. He went 29-of-49 for 375 yards and 3 touchdowns despite being victimized by so many drops. One of his best passes was a very impressive back-shoulder throw to Britt for a gain of 32 yards.    Two of Davis' touchdowns went to the emerging Davis lost fumble on a strip-sack in the red zone; another Davis strip-sack that Philadelphia pounced on in the end zone for a touchdown; and a Zac Stacy lost fumble that was returned deep into St."

The Rams entered the game with an NFL record for ineffective pass rush as they had only sack on the season, but that changed in the second quarter, as Aaron Donald and Eugene Sims recorded sacks on back-to-back plays. That forced a punt, and the Rams set up an amazing trick play. Tavon Austin went back to receive on the opposite side of the field from where the ball was going. Stedman Bailey was blocking a gunner on the other side. Bailey peeled off the gunner and tracked down the punt with an over-the-shoulder catch. However, all of the Rams' blockers had rand toward Austin, who acted like he was catching the ball. That drew the Seattle coverage. After Bailey caught the ball, he was untouched on a 90-yard touchdown return. It was 1 of the greatest special teams plays I've ever seen and an ingenious trick play by Fassel. After the Rams missed a 52-yard field goal, the Seahawks got going in the 2-minute drill as they moved the ball down the field by getting Wilson out of the pocket. Just before the half, the Seahawks tacked on a field goal. In the third quarter, Seattle had a good drive and Wilson ran in a 19-yard touchdown run on a read option, as linebacker ,Alec Ogletree blew containment. The Rams didn't make adjustments, as Ogletree blew contain again, and Wilson took off on a 52-yard run, the longest of his career. Wilson finished the drive by throwing a pass up to tight end Cooper Helfet (3-61), who made a fabulous hands catch with getting his toes in bounds before falling out of bounds for a 25-yard score. The 2.point conversion fell incomplete. St. Louis answered with a pretty 30-yard pass from Davis to Chris Givens (1-30)."

After the Rams missed a 52-yard field goal, the Seahawks got going in the 2-minute drill as they moved the ball down the field by getting Wilson out of the pocket. Just before the half, the Seahawks tacked on a field goal. In the third quarter, Seattle had a good drive and Wilson ran in a 19-yard touchdown run on a read option, as linebacker ,Alec Ogletree blew containment. The Rams didn't make adjustments, as Ogletree blew contain again, and Wilson took off on a 52-yard run, the longest of his career. Wilson finished the drive by throwing a pass up to tight end Cooper Helfet (3-61), who made a fabulous hands catch with getting his toes in bounds before falling out of bounds for a 25-yard score. The 2.point conversion fell incomplete. St. Louis answered with a pretty 30-yard pass from Davis to Chris Givens (1-30)."

The primary reason were the injuries to 3 offensive linemen and Brian Quick, who was carted off the field with a left arm injury in the second quarter. The linemen who went down were guard Rodger Saffold, center Scott Wells and left tackle Jake Long. The latter could be done for the year with a torn ACL. It's amazing how unfortunate the Rams have been. They've had injury issues to their linemen for years. They've missed Sam Bradford over the past couple of seasons. Chris Long has been out this year.

I mentioned that Boger screwed up San Francisco's chances late in the game. Boger was an equal-opportunity incompetent official Sunday afternoon, as he completely botched a call in the second quarter. Frank Gore (14-49) clearly fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Rams and taken the other way for a touchdown. However, Boger's crew ruled the play dead and incorrectly said that Gore's forward progress was stopped. Jeff Fisher looked like he wanted to murder the refs with his bare hands.    I'm sure Fisher feels better now that his team won. This was despite some very shaky play by Austin Davis, who went 13-of-24 for only 105 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.
