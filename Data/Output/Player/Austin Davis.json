   "comment":"Austin Davis. However, it was later revealed that Hill endured a thigh malady. Either way, Hill didn't look too pleased. He stood on the sidelines and shook his head the entire second half. Davis went 16-of-23 for 192 yards and a pick, but most of that was against prevent. Davis didn't look like a functional quarterback. In fact, Dick Stockton, who called the game, had some fun with Davis' ineptitude, citing that he was lofting dying quails to his receivers.    Some quick numbers on St. Louis' crappy offense: - "

   "comment":"Austin Davis lost fumble on a strip-sack in the red zone; another Davis strip-sack that Philadelphia pounced on in the end zone for a touchdown; and a Zac Stacy lost fumble that was returned deep into St. Louis territory, setting up a Nick Foles-to-Jeremy Maclin touchdown.    With the Rams constantly committing turnovers and doing other things to hurt themselves - more on that later - all Nick Foles really had to do was manage the game. He did a good job of moving the chains on numerous occasions, but he nearly cost his team with a late fumble amid a ferocious St. Louis comeback. Foles went 24-of-37 for 207 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick in which he put too much air under the ball. Philadelphia's banged-up offensive line didn't turn out to be a liability in pass protection, as Foles didn't take a single sack.    Philadelphia's front didn't run block as well, as LeSean McCoy gained 81 yards on 24 carries. Some of that was McCoy's fault, as he made some terrible decisions on a few occasions. For instance, he lost a fumble because he ran around like an idiot and took a big loss before coughing the ball up. This gave the Rams an early red-zone trip, but it didn't end up mattering because St. Louis also turned the ball over on the ensuing possession.    Foles' scores went to Jeremy Maclin (5-76), who continued to stay hot, and Riley Cooper (4-33), whose touchdowns was an impressive, leaping grab over a defender in the end zone. Zach Ertz (3-39) finished second on the team in receiving.    The Rams, as mentioned, made so many careless errors. It was ridiculous, and their mistakes cost them a potential comeback from down 34-7. Here's a list of blunders they made in addition to the early blocked-punt touchdown: - There were so many drops. Kenny Britt let the ball fall through his hands early. Jared Cook dropped a potential first-down conversion on third-and-long in Eagles' territory. Austin Pettis was guilty twice in the final minute, single-handedly thwarting a potential game-winning drive. - Plenty of fumbles: Davis coughed up the ball twice (once in the red zone, once deep in his own territory that was scored by the defense) and Stacy lost the ball during a promising drive. - Countless procedural penalties: There were a ridiculous amount of false starts, including 1 out of a timeout. The Rams also were guilty of a delay-of-game infraction on 4.h-and-8 of the final drive.    Save for the fumbles and a couple of poor throws, Austin Davis performed pretty well. He went 29-of-49 for 375 yards and 3 touchdowns despite being victimized by so many drops. One of his best passes was a very impressive back-shoulder throw to Britt for a gain of 32 yards.    Two of Davis' touchdowns went to the emerging "

   "comment":"Austin Davis at quarterback, and that was the biggest difference.    Even though the Browns routinely lived in Pittsburgh territory on Sunday, all they could muster were 4 Travis Coons' field goals. Davis started 2 games for the Browns this season and was unable to lead them to a touchdown in either.    Davis threw 2 interceptions and fumbled away another, while completing 24-of-46 passes for 240 yards - a poor 52-percent completion rate. He also was sacked 7 times.    But amazingly, this game was a 1.score affair into the 4.h quarter, even with Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown putting up big numbers once again. An early fumble by Brown and 2 interceptions by Roethlisberger kept this 1 close.    By halftime, Brown had 10 receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown, which is a career game for most wide receivers. There was inkling at that point, that Brown could make a push for Marvin Harrison's reception record, which Brown was 20 behind coming into the game. He managed just 3 more receptions, but for the season, a year in which Landry Jones and the other backup were his quarterbacks for a time, Brown finished with 136 receptions for 1,834 yards and 10 touchdowns. Those numbers broke his own Steelers' records.    Early in the 4.h quarter, the Steelers were up just 5 points, 17-12. The Browns had the ball on their own 20-yard line, when Lawrence Timmons sacked Austin Davis, dislodging the ball so teammate Arthur Moats could recover."
