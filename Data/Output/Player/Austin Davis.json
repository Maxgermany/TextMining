   "comment":"Austin Davis. However, it was later revealed that Hill endured a thigh malady. Either way, Hill didn't look too pleased. He stood on the sidelines and shook his head the entire second half. Davis went 16-of-23 for 192 yards and a pick, but most of that was against prevent. Davis didn't look like a functional quarterback. In fact, Dick Stockton, who called the game, had some fun with Davis' ineptitude, citing that he was lofting dying quails to his receivers.    Some quick numbers on St. Louis' crappy offense: - "

  "comment":"Austin Davis at quarterback, and that was the biggest difference.    Even though the Browns routinely lived in Pittsburgh territory on Sunday, all they could muster were 4 Travis Coons' field goals. Davis started 2 games for the Browns this season and was unable to lead them to a touchdown in either.    Davis threw 2 interceptions and fumbled away another, while completing 24-of-46 passes for 240 yards - a poor 52-percent completion rate. He also was sacked 7 times.    But amazingly, this game was a 1.score affair into the 4.h quarter, even with Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown putting up big numbers once again. An early fumble by Brown and 2 interceptions by Roethlisberger kept this 1 close.    By halftime, Brown had 10 receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown, which is a career game for most wide receivers. There was inkling at that point, that Brown could make a push for Marvin Harrison's reception record, which Brown was 20 behind coming into the game. He managed just 3 more receptions, but for the season, a year in which Landry Jones and the other backup were his quarterbacks for a time, Brown finished with 136 receptions for 1,834 yards and 10 touchdowns. Those numbers broke his own Steelers' records.    Early in the 4.h quarter, the Steelers were up just 5 points, 17-12. The Browns had the ball on their own 20-yard line, when Lawrence Timmons sacked Austin Davis, dislodging the ball so teammate Arthur Moats could recover.",
