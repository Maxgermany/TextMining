   "comment":"Wentz in this matchup, a quarterback the Browns could've selected with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Though Cleveland obtained numerous picks in the trade, they came out of this game looking pretty foolish that they didn't just take Wentz. Wentz had a terrific debut, albeit with a caveat. He went 22-of-37 for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he could've posted an even better stat line had he not endured 4 drops. Wentz's ball placement downfield was very impressive, as most of his longer throws were right on the money. He even showed some great pocket presence, drawing a player offside on his opening drive with his cadence. The caveat, however, is that he was battling the Browns, who are absolutely dreadful. They have 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL, and they have zero pass rush to speak of. Wentz, consequently, had all day to throw. He was guilty of holding the ball too long in the pocket on occasion, so I'm interested to see if this will become a problem against teams that are better at generating pressure on the quarterback. It was a problem once in this game, as a sack he took resulted in a missed, longer field goal.    Wentz's 2 touchdowns went to his primary receivers. "

   "comment":"Wentz could continue to perform well with worsened pass protection. Lane Johnson's 10-game suspension was finally upheld, so Philadelphia had a horrible matchup against the Redskins, where they had a rookie right tackle going up against the talented Ryan Kerrigan. It didn't seem like that would bode well for the Eagles, and my suspicions were confirmed right away. Kerrigan sacked Wentz twice on the opening drive alone, and Wentz was hit and hurried on nearly all of his drop-backs. The Eagles, as a result, couldn't do anything offensively. They managed jut 12 first downs and were outgained by more than 250 net yards. They struggled to maintain drives, as their offense was responsible for just 6 points; the 14 points came via special teams and defense. With poor protection, Wentz completed only half of his passes, going 11-of-22 for 179 yards. That actually includes some garbage-time totals, as he was only 3-of-8 for 28 yards in the opening 2 quarters. Wentz did have a chance at a late touchdown at the end, but "

Jordan Matthews, Wendell Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed. Special-teamer Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and "

The Redskin rush linebacker came screaming off of the edge with 20 seconds left to get a hit on Wentz, which knocked the ball loose. The Redskins recovered the fumble. That would be how the game ended. Needless to say, this was a huge win for the Redskins. They needed it to keep pace in the NFC playoff race, and they got just that. Part of the reason they were able to make it was the terrific play of their offense.    "

   "comment":"Wentz to have better protection. Wentz saw some pressure, but wasn't sacked on a single occasion. Wentz finished 13-of-24 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which occurred when he danced around the pocket forever and then fired carelessly downfield. Wentz made some mistakes - he nearly had a second pick, but the ball was dropped - and had to leave the game for a bit because of a potential concussion, but he had a solid game overall. He was victimized by some drops, of course, while his best play occurred when he somehow ducked underneath 2 pass-rushers and scrambled for a first down. Philadelphia fans have to feel very optimistic about Wentz going forward. Wentz went through a rookie funk after beginning the year ablaze, but it's evident that the potential is there, and he'll have more success as long as Johnson stays on the field. Wentz is now 4-1 with Johnson blocking for him, with wins over the Giants and Steelers.    Sproles also returned, and he had a significant impact. He rushed for 40 yards and a touchdown on 7 carries, and he also caught a pair of passes for 23 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a Vinny Curry sack to scramble for a first down. His 4 rushing attempts went for 21 yards.    Smith's sole score went to Travis Kelce, who hauled in 8 of his 10 targets for 103 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was amazing, seemingly hurdling every Philadelphia defender he could find throughout the afternoon. The numbers would've been surprising prior to the game, given that the Eagles defended tight ends so well last year and were able to shut down Jordan Reed in Week 1. However, the Eagles lost several defensive players throughout the afternoon, including Rodney McLeod. Elsewhere in Kansas City's receiving corps, Chris Conley and Tyreek Hill each caught 4 balls for 55 and 43 yards, respectively.    Kansas City's big star, aside from Kelce, was Kareem Hunt once again. Hunt couldn't get anything going in the opening half - 5 carries, 8 yards - but he finished with 81 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 attempts, thanks to a 53-yard burst. Hunt also snatched 3 receptions for 28 receiving yards.    The dark cloud over this victory is Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles.

   "comment":"Wentz converted a pair of third-and-11s on passes to Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery, setting up a touchdown. Following a poor Arizona drive, Kenjon Barner took a punt deep into Cardinals' territory to set up another score. On Philadelphia's next possession, Torrey Smith finally didn't drop a deep pass, hauling in a 59-yard touchdown. The Eagles sputtered a bit after that through the end of the opening half, but they put the clamps on Arizona following intermission, outscoring them 13-0 in the second half.    Wentz was excellent, going 21-of-30 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half, which was a deep shot into the end zone. Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to "

The Eagles, now 8-1, are heading into the bye with an impending matchup against the Cowboys following the week off. What's scary about the Eagles is that they're only going to be better following their bye. Top cornerback Ronald Darby and Zach Ertz will be back from injury, while Jay Ajayi will have a better understanding of the offense, so he'll be a greater part of the scoring unit in the second half of the season. Eagles fans had a taste of Ajayi in this game when he broke free for a 46-yard touchdown burst right before halftime. True to his word, Doug Pederson limited Ajayi's workload, giving him 8 carries compared to LeGarrette Blount's 9 and Corey Clement's 12. Clement's attempts were the byproduct of garbage time, but there's no doubt that in a few weeks, Ajayi will handle more carries than Blount. Ajayi outgained Blount, 77-37. Ajayi's production was not a surprise, as he had success last year with the Dolphins when they had a strong offensive line. The Eagles, despite Jason Peters' injury, have 1 of the top fronts in the NFL, so Ajayi should be able to replicate what he was able to accomplish with Miami in 2016.

Wentz misfired on just 2 occasions following halftime, throwing both of his touchdowns after the break. Wentz finished 14-of-27 for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns. It wasn't the best fantasy line, but keep in mind that Wentz was just 7-of-18 for 80 yards in the opening half. As mentioned, he endured several drops.
