   "comment":"Carson Wentz in this matchup, a quarterback the Browns could've selected with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Though Cleveland obtained numerous picks in the trade, they came out of this game looking pretty foolish that they didn't just take Wentz. Wentz had a terrific debut, albeit with a caveat. He went 22-of-37 for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he could've posted an even better stat line had he not endured 4 drops. Wentz's ball placement downfield was very impressive, as most of his longer throws were right on the money. He even showed some great pocket presence, drawing a player offside on his opening drive with his cadence. The caveat, however, is that he was battling the Browns, who are absolutely dreadful. They have 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL, and they have zero pass rush to speak of. Wentz, consequently, had all day to throw. He was guilty of holding the ball too long in the pocket on occasion, so I'm interested to see if this will become a problem against teams that are better at generating pressure on the quarterback. It was a problem once in this game, as a sack he took resulted in a missed, longer field goal.    Wentz's 2 touchdowns went to his primary receivers.

   "comment":"Carson Wentz was the superior prospect, the Eagles would probably be 1-2 right now with Jared Goff or Chase Daniel quarterbacking them. Wentz, on the other hand, is already breaking Tom Brady's early-career records. Crazy.    Both of these teams came into this game undefeated, but only 1 of those teams showed up, as the Philadelphia Eagles stomped their in-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, 34-3. The Steelers had a chance to get up to an early lead as Ben Roethlisberger and company drove into Eagles territory, but were stopped when Markus Wheaton dropped a touchdown pass that hit him squarely in the chest. Then, to add insult to inability, the Eagles blocked the field goal attempt by Chris Boswell, and they were off to the races. That first drive was probably Pittsburgh's best, as the Philadelphia defense showed up with intensity, shutting down the Steelers' run game, which had helped sustain them through their first 2 wins. The Steelers had a total of 2 rushing first downs and a net total of 29 yards rushing on 10 carries for the game, compared to the 135.5 rushing yards they averaged through the first 2 games.    This Eagles' stop unit is the real deal. Coming into this contest, Football Outsiders ranked them as the second-best defense in the league, with the best pass defense, which was based on games against Robert Griffin III and Jay Cutler, but now the Eagles can proudly say they held Ben Roethlisberger to a 54.5 percent completion rate, with 24-of-44 completions for 257 yards, no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble. Once Roethlisberger was forced to throw, his offensive line couldn't contain Philadelphia's front line and he was constantly running for his life. The Eagles sacked him 4 times and hurried him multiple times. Roethlisberger had thrown for 3 touchdowns in each of his first 2 games this season before running into the Eagles.    Eagles rookie quarterback Carson Wentz continued his stellar play on Sunday, spreading the ball around well as he hit receivers from multiple angles. His pocket awareness was superb, as he moved his team with ease on almost every drive. The offensive line held the Steelers to no sacks, and the offense had the Steelers on their heels at all times. Now 3 games into his rookie season, Wentz has now thrown 102 passes with no interceptions. He's good at football. Wentz completed 23-of-31 passes for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. His numbers would have been even better if it weren't for the Eagles defense, which stifled the Steelers at every point, which helped the Eagles create a big enough lead to run the ball in the 4.h quarter.    Philadelphia's lead running back, Wentz was the superior prospect, the Eagles would probably be 1-2 right now with Jared Goff or Chase Daniel quarterbacking them. Wentz, on the other hand, is already breaking Tom Brady's early-career records. Crazy.

Prescott, who sliced and diced Chicago's defense while only making 1 bad throw on the evening - a pass behind 1 of his targets - could've posted an even better stat line. Prescott missed out on 2 other passing scores, as 2 of his players were tackled at the 1-yard line. Prescott also lost out on an opportunity to get another touchdown when "

Lane Johnson's 10-game suspension was finally upheld, so Philadelphia had a horrible matchup against the Redskins, where they had a rookie right tackle going up against the talented Ryan Kerrigan. It didn't seem like that would bode well for the Eagles, and my suspicions were confirmed right away. Kerrigan sacked Wentz twice on the opening drive alone, and Wentz was hit and hurried on nearly all of his drop-backs. The Eagles, as a result, couldn't do anything offensively. They managed jut 12 first downs and were outgained by more than 250 net yards. They struggled to maintain drives, as their offense was responsible for just 6 points; the 14 points came via special teams and defense. With poor protection, Wentz completed only half of his passes, going 11-of-22 for 179 yards. That actually includes some garbage-time totals, as he was only 3-of-8 for 28 yards in the opening 2 quarters. Wentz did have a chance at a late touchdown at the end, but "

   "comment":"Carson Wentz was strip-sacked by Vic Beasley past midfield at the end of the first half. Darren Sproles appeared to fumble, but the play was ruled incomplete. Jordan Matthews, Wendell Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed. Special-teamer Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and "

Wentz was destined to lead a comeback that would essentially knock the Redskins out of the playoff picture. Ryan Kerrigan had other ideas. The Redskin rush linebacker came screaming off of the edge with 20 seconds left to get a hit on Wentz, which knocked the ball loose. The Redskins recovered the fumble. That would be how the game ended. Needless to say, this was a huge win for the Redskins. They needed it to keep pace in the NFC playoff race, and they got just that. Part of the reason they were able to make it was the terrific play of their offense.    "

Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a Vinny Curry sack to scramble for a first down. His 4 rushing attempts went for 21 yards.    Smith's sole score went to Travis Kelce, who hauled in 8 of his 10 targets for 103 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was amazing, seemingly hurdling every Philadelphia defender he could find throughout the afternoon. The numbers would've been surprising prior to the game, given that the Eagles defended tight ends so well last year and were able to shut down Jordan Reed in Week 1. However, the Eagles lost several defensive players throughout the afternoon, including Rodney McLeod. Elsewhere in Kansas City's receiving corps, Chris Conley and Tyreek Hill each caught 4 balls for 55 and 43 yards, respectively.    Kansas City's big star, aside from Kelce, was Kareem Hunt once again. Hunt couldn't get anything going in the opening half - 5 carries, 8 yards - but he finished with 81 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 attempts, thanks to a 53-yard burst. Hunt also snatched 3 receptions for 28 receiving yards.    The dark cloud over this victory is Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles. Darren Sproles (10-48) was next, followed by "

Wentz misfired on just 2 occasions following halftime, throwing both of his touchdowns after the break. Wentz finished 14-of-27 for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns. It wasn't the best fantasy line, but keep in mind that Wentz was just 7-of-18 for 80 yards in the opening half. As mentioned, he endured several drops. He wasn't blameless, as he was off the mark on some throws, but his second-half stat line - 7-of-9, 88 yards, 2 touchdowns - aptly described how prolific he was late in the game.
