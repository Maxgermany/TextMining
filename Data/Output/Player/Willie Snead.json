   "comment":"Willie Snead. Hightower was wide open, as it was 1 of Gregg Williams' many blunders of the afternoon.    Speaking of the running backs, Ingram performed brilliantly. He burst for a 61-yard rush to open the third quarter and later scored a touchdown when Williams foolishly called an all-out blitz. Ingram gained a whopping 146 yards on the ground and 2 total touchdowns on just 14 carries. Hightower (15-51) saw most of his workload in garbage time.    Moving on to the Rams, they had some unexpected offensive success in the early going, as Jared Goff torched the Rams on the opening drive. Snead.

Cooks saw the most targets with 10, but as mentioned earlier, Brees had some issues connecting with him. Cooks was overthrown on 1 potential touchdown throw and then dropped another 1 later in the contest. Cooks is still a low-end WR1 in fantasy, but if Brees cannot get better, Cooks' upside will be limited. Snead was probably the most impressive Saints receiver on the day. He worked over the middle of the field and had a lot of success doing so. He is becoming 1 of the better slot men in the league, and is a worthy WR3/FLEX in most matchups. Meanwhile, Coleman only saw significant action because rookie "
