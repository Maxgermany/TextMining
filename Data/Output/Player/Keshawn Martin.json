Later on, when the Broncos were in the red zone, Brock Osweiler took a sack from Alan Branch, who destroyed his center, but Denver was given new life on a defensive hold. It was more blatant than what happened to the Titans, as the New England defender actually touched Demaryius Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the 4.h horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a 4.h timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell."
