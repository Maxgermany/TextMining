   "comment":"Pilares. Sounds like some workout regimen. 8. Lions: The team gave the Panthers a first down on a 4th-and-4 because of an illegal use of hands penalty. Cam Newton would later score a touchdown as a result.    As mentioned, Carolina had a 24-7 lead in this game, so how did they blow both the straight-up victory and the cover? Well, they were the only ones making dumb mistakes in the second half. All they did after intermission was drop passes, take sacks, throw picks and miss tackles. It was amazing how much of a 180 this game took.    Newton was just dreadful after the break. He had a nice, game-tying touchdown drive with 5 minutes remaining, but his 3 picks were a killer. He finished 22-of-38, 280 yards, 1 touchdown and 4 interceptions to go along with 2 rushing scores.    Newton's top receiver was a running back; "
