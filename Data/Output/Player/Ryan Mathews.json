Mathews was cheated out of a rushing touchdown when Battle (15-39, TD) scored, but Mathews had way more yardage (61 yards on 14 carries). Mathews is the best runner on the roster though, so don't expect this Battle charade to last much longer. In fact, he's a nice buy-low target this week.    Philip Rivers didn't have to do much because he had a lead the entire afternoon. He threw just 5 incompletions, going 18-of-23 for 209 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Not included in those numbers was a drawn pass interference to "

Mathews' score, a 23-yarder on a wheel route, was 1 of Bradford's few pretty throws. He also lost a fumble in the 4.h quarter, but it didn't turn out to be a big deal. Mathews has proven that he can be started if Murray is out of the lineup, but it remains to be seen what Murray's status will be for Week 4. "

Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Jason Peters in the first half. Peters was carted off the field with a back injury, and losing him could be a huge blow to the Eagles' offense.    Ryan Mathews led the Eagles with 97 yards on 6 carries and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Ryan Mathews fumble in Detroit; the blown 10-point lead at Dallas in the 4.h quarter; the blocked field goal at New York last week. All of these things have crushed Philadelphia, but things finally went the Eagles' way in this contest. The Falcons were the team that made the mental errors this Sunday. A good amount of them, anyway. Matt Bryant whiffed on a field goal and uncharacteristically missed an extra point. Julio Jones dropped a pass on a crucial third-and-12 in the 4.h quarter. Austin Hooper dropped a ball as well. Matt Ryan couldn't connect with Jones on a 4.h down at the end of the afternoon and also threw an interception. The Falcons appeared to be close in this game, but just couldn't quite get there. Despite Atlanta's blunders, the Eagles allowed them to hang around for most of the afternoon because they kept making mistakes of their own. Carson Wentz was strip-sacked by Vic Beasley past midfield at the end of the first half. Darren Sproles appeared to fumble, but the play was ruled incomplete. Jordan Matthews, Wendell Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed.

Mathews is only a mediocre runner, and he is not a recommended start in most fantasy formats. If you are desperate, use him as a FLEX. Normally, I would prefer Darren Sproles, who saw 5 carries for 27 yards and caught a touchdown, but he got knocked out in the second half by a pretty dirty Deshazor Everett hit. Sproles was getting ready to return a punt when Everett put a massive blow on him. He got there a split second before the ball and gave Sproles a knock to the head.    There was actually some long snapper drama in this game for the Eagles. Their long snapper, "
