   "comment":"Galette sacked Kaepernick to help force a punt. Darren Sproles fair caught the punt at the 25-yard line, but was tackled by Kassim Osgood. That penalty put the Saints at the 40. A pass to Colston and 2 passes to Graham moved the ball in position for a 31-yard field goal by Hartley as time expired.    New Orleans' defense stepped up with a big game. Once again, Rob Ryan did a great job of coaching and scheming. Cam Jordan was excellent as he batted pass on a third-down throw, beat Anthony Davis to sack Kaepernick in the second quarter and almost had a safety in the fourth. Akiem Hicks (7 tackles, 1 sack), Galette (1 sack) and David Hawthorne (8 tackles) all played really well."
