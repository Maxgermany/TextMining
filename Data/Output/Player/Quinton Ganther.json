   "comment":"Quinton Ganther rushed for only 50 yards on 14 carries, but also had 3 catches for 43 more yards and 2 touchdowns. Ganther looked great; he doesn't have much physical talent, but he ran tough and continuously broke Oakland tackles, especially later in the game when the Raiders didn't look interested anymore.    "
