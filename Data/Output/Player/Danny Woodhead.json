   "comment":"Danny Woodhead on a 4.h down. The special teams also contributed by recovering a muffed punt by Eddie Royal. However, it was really the offense - particularly Terrelle Pryor - that was mostly responsible for Oakland's second victory of the season. Pryor opened with a 44-yard scoring bomb to Rod Streater following Rivers' first interception. Pryor ultimately completed his first 10 passes for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns. Not included in this was a 19-yard completion to Denarius Moore in which he rolled out and found his wideout downfield. Pryor later had a similar play for 20 yards to Brice Butler to convert a crucial third-and-14 in the final quarter. Pryor went on to finish 18-of-23 for 221 yards and the pair of scores to go along with 11 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. He also should've thrown a third touchdown, but Moore stepped out of bounds prior to catching the ball. Pryor's only real blemish was when he fumbled the ball trying to desperately do something while wrapped up in a sack. He's fortunate that 1 of his teammates recovered the ball.    As mentioned, Moore (5-84) and Streater (3-56) caught the touchdowns. Marcel Reece was the only Raider with more than 2 receptions. He had 3 catches for 25 receiving yards to go along with 32 rushing yards on 7 carries. Rashad Jennings (10-41) handled the workload early on, but he was knocked out of the game with a hamstring.    Philip Rivers, meanwhile, completed 36-of-49 passes for 411 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, the turnovers absolutely killed the team. Rivers tossed 3 interceptions, though 1 occurred at the end of the contest. A red-hot Rivers was effortlessly leading San Diego down the field to draw within 1 possession, but Keenan Allen slipped in the end zone, allowing first-round rookie D.J. Hayden to snag his first career pick.    Four of Rivers' targets had monstrous outings. The 3 non-running backs to do so were Allen (6-115, TD), Vincent Brown (8-117) and Antonio Gates (7-74). Including penalty plays, Rivers threw to Allen 10 times. The third-round rookie is legit.    Danny Woodhead scored Rivers' other touchdown. He snagged 9 balls for 58 receiving yards along with 13 rushing yards on 9 carries. Unfortunately, Woodhead lost a fumble that was returned for a score by "

   "comment":"Danny Woodhead took the ball to the 6-inch line, but a great tackle by Amerson kept Woodhead (7-21 rushing, 9-77 receiving) out of the end zone. The Redskins came up with a clutch goal-line stand to force a field goal and overtime. The Chargers had terrible play-calling by Ken Whisenhunt, as San Diego threw the ball twice despite having timeouts available and being less than a yard from a game-winning touchdown. In overtime, Morris (25-121) had a nice run, and Griffin had great throws to Reed and Garcon to move the ball down the field. Young (5-12) scored his third touchdown from a few yards out to win the game for Washington.    Griffin was 23-of-32 for 291 yards with an interception. He also ran for 17 yards.    Rivers was 29-of-46 for 341 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Ryan Mathews (7-34) started strong before being pulled with an apparent injury.    There was some horrible officiating in this game. Antonio Gates lined up obviously offsides late in the second quarter, but wasn't called for it. A few plays later, Keenan Allen was flagged for an offensive pass interference when there wasn't any contact between him and the cornerback. In the 4.h quarter, Danny Woodhead fumbled the ball away but the referee blew the challenge. In overtime, the officials got ticky-tack with a helmet-to-helmet hit on Garcon. This unit needs to get it together before screwing up a critical game down the stretch.   "

Woodhead, meanwhile, inexplicably had just 7 touches. Why the Chargers neglected to use Woodhead more frequently is beyond me.    The San Diego defense was dreadful as well. The unit had immense issues tackling. The Dolphins had more yardage after the catch than they should have, and as a result, "

Gates, who had 5 catches for 41 yards, was outclassed by the other tight end, Ladarius Green, who had 2 grabs for 45 yards and a touchdown. Allen, meanwhile, logged 8 receptions for 106 yards.    Rivers finished 23-of-37 for 252 yards, 1 touchdown and the Gates-related interception.

   "comment":"Danny Woodhead (3-27), and a critical third-down conversion to Travis Benjamin. Gordon finished the drive by plunging into the end zone from a few yards out. After trading punts, Bortles had a pass deflected by Casey Hayward, and Hayward caught the deflection while lying on his back. That set up the Chargers at the Jaguars' 34. Rivers took advantage with a few completions and a 6-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin. The Jaguars moved the ball into San Diego territory thanks to a completion to Allen Hurns (5-64), but Jason Myers missed a 54-yard field goal. The Chargers got Benjamin matched up on Paul Posluszny, and that led to a 43-yard completion for San Diego. The Jaguars jumped offsides on a 4.h-and-1 at the 4-yard line, and a play, later Rivers hit Antonio Gates (3-15) for a 2-yard score. With San Diego up 21-0, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.

   "comment":"Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, barely did anything; he was given 3 carries, which he turned into 9 yards, while his 2 receptions went for 14 receiving yards.    Moving on to the Lions, I saw a stat during the week that said that other than Jay Cutler, Matthew Stafford has had the worst spread record in December onward since 2003. Stafford played exactly like that in the early going, struggling against a stout Baltimore defense before Jimmy Smith got hurt. Stafford mishandled a poor snap from his backup center in the opening quarter to take the team out of field-goal position for Matt Prater. The snap was bad, but Stafford still should've caught it. That ruined a chance to get points in a scoreless game. Following a stalled drive in Baltimore territory that culminated with a missed 43-yard field goal by Prater, Stafford was strip-sacked in Baltimore territory, as he failed to sense the blind-side pressure. Stafford put together some solid drives in the second half, but his afternoon ended when he injured his hand. He went in for X-rays, but they came back negative. Jake Rudock finished the game, but Stafford, diagnosed with just a bruise, should be able to play next week in a do-or-die contest for the Lions. Of course, Stafford doesn't deserve nearly all the blame for his offense's poor showing in this contest. He was without starting center Travis Swanson, and his 2 best linemen, T.J. Lang and Ricky Wagner, left the field with injuries. They'll need to play to give the Lions a better chance against the Buccaneers. Stafford finished 24-of-29 for 292 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which he threw up for grabs in the second half. Stafford was hot following intermission with Smith gone, throwing no incompletions prior to the pick. The offensive line simply couldn't hold up.    Marvin Jones and Golden Tate each had decent stat lines. Jones caught 4 passes for 90 yards, while Tate paced the team in receptions, catching 8 balls for 69 yards.    Ameer Abdullah was out with an injury, but reports indicated that the Lions planned on going with a new running back anyway. That was Tion Green, who ran for 51 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. He'll need to be picked up in fantasy leagues this week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
