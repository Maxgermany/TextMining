Kubiak had no choice on 4.h-and-18 but to call for a field goal, and Rackers made it 25-20 from 40 yards out. Even with only 1 timeout remaining, Houston got the ball back with 1:50 left thanks to Campbell checking out of a run on first down and going for the sealing first down on a deep ball to "

   "comment":"Michael Huff wore the burnt orange for the team that benefitted from that gross BCS injustice, and it must have been fun for Rodgers to run up the score here even if there were no voters to impress. All of this fluff ties in actually. Woodson and Huff were both first-round Oakland draft picks. They do love to take defensive backs early don't they? Another, Fabian Washington, was the player they took instead of Rodgers in 2005. The funny thing is, he didn't technically fall to him that season. They actually traded up to No. 23, at which time I called my brother, a California alum, to gloat about my Raiders finally getting a franchise quarterback out of the draft. Instead the choice was Washington and, of course, 1 pick later, the Packers took Rodgers. Two rounds later, the Raiders did land Andrew Walter, who was naturally awesome, and is now out of the league.   "
