   "comment":"Calais Campbell strip-sacked Cousins and Markus Golden returned the fumble to the Redskins' 10-yard line. Carson Palmer then fired a fastball to Michael Floyd (3-18-1) for the score and a 17-13 lead. Cousins struck back with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder (3-42-1), who beat Tony Jefferson to get wide open. Arizona responded by ripping the ball down the field quickly and scored with a 25-yard pass to Johnson. The Redskins countered with a field goal to make it 24-23 Arizona midway through the 4.h quarter. The Cardinals went for a 4.h-and-1 at their own 34-yard line and Johnson ripped off an 18-yard run. Palmer then hit J.J. Nelson (1-42) for a 42-yard touchdown strike just after the 2-minute warning a few plays later. With forty seconds remaining, D.J. Swearinger blitzed to force a pass off the mark, and it was picked off by Patrick Peterson to clinch the Cardinals' win.    Palmer played very well, completing 30-of-46 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Fitzgerald continues to rewrite the record books as he totaled 9 catches for 91 yards.    David Johnson was the big star for the Arizona offense with 18 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Through the air, he had 9 receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Cousins was 21-of-37 for 271 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He added a rushing touchdown. Garcon led the Redskins in receiving with 78 yards on 7 receptions.    Rob Kelley totaled 63 yards on 14 carries.    Calais Campbell had an excellent game for the Cardinals with a big-time presence at the point of attack. Trent Murphy and "

   "comment":"Calais Campbell scooped up the ball and returned it 53 yards for a touchdown. Quickly, the Saints responded with Brandin Cooks turning around D.J. Swearinger to get wide open for a 65-yard touchdown pass. Just 2 minutes before the half, Cooks burned Tyrann Mathieu on a crossing route before exploding down the field for a 45-yard touchdown. Carson Palmer moved the ball down the field in the final second of the half before finding J.J. Nelson (5-38-1) on a 10-yard touchdown pass. The Saints took a 24-20 lead into the locker room. The Saints would add a third-quarter field goal before Palmer led Arizona down the field, from where David Johnson scored from a couple of yards out to tie the game at 27. Early in the 4.h quarter, the Saints had a drive stall and settle for a field goal, but an offside penalty gave New Orleans a first down. The Saints promptly turned that into a Tim Hightower (11-37-2) touchdown and a 34-27 lead. The Cardinals drove down the field, and Johnson scored again from a few yards away. The Saints got going again with a 36-yard completion to Cooks, and then Michael Thomas (7-52-1) made a leaping grab over Brandon Williams for the score. New Orleans' defense finally came up with a stop as Vonn Bell forced a fumble from Brittan Golden, which was recovered by New Orleans. That led to another short touchdown run from Hightower, and the Saints were up 48-34 with 3 and half minutes remaining. J.J. Nelson dropped an easy would-be touchdown, but John Brown (5-81-1) didn't, as Vonn Bell was late coming over the top on Brown's 30-yard score. Brees connected with Coby Fleener (2-10) after he beat Tony Jefferson to get a conversion that allowed New Orleans to run the clock out on the Cardinals.    Brees was 37-of-48 for 389 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was a big bounce back for Brees after 2 games without touchdown passes.    Cooks had 1 of the best games of his NFL career with 7 receptions for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Mark Ingram (17-78) led the Saints in rushing, but in the 4.h quarter, Ingram threw a temper tantrum on the sideline after Hightower scored his second touchdown. It was an extremely selfish display by Ingram.    Palmer finished 28-of-40 for 318 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played really well and abused a vulnerable Saints secondary. Fitzgerald notched 7 receptions for 57 yards, but his lost fumble was painful for Arizona.    David Johnson had 12 carries for 53 yards with 2 scores while catching 4 passes for 55 yards.    Defensively, Calais Campbell was excellent with 2 sacks and the fumble returned for a touchdown. Cam Jordan had a sack for the Saints to continue his excellent season. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Calais Campbell had 3.5 sacks in the first half to set a franchise record for the most sacks in a single game (4). Jacksonville's Yannick Ngakoue had 2 sack-fumbles as well by halftime. Texans quarterback Tom Savage was awful, routinely holding onto the ball too long, and Houston's offensive line was putrid. Savage was lucky to have only 2 fumbles by halftime. Conversely, the suspect Jaguars' offensive line was superb, Leonard Fournette ran hard, and Blake Bortles managed the game well enough to win.    On the first third down of the game, Allen Robinson made a catch of 17 yards to move the chains, but he came up limping after he was pushed out of bounds. Robinson went into the locker room and didn't return to action. A serious injury to Robinson could be devastating to Jacksonville, plus hurt his fantasy owners. Bortles had another chunk completion this time to Allen Hurns (3-42), and that set up a short field goal for Jacksonville. The Jaguars added a second field goal after using rookie Leonard Fournette to move the ball on the ground and through the air, with Chris Ivory (9-42) chipping in a 17-yard run. Then, Ngakoue strip-sacked Savage to set up the Jaguars around midfield. Jacksonville took advantage with the aid of some Texans penalties to move to the goal line. On 4.h-and-goal, Fournette powered into the end zone. Houston moved into Jacksonville territory afterward, but Ngakoue forced another strip-sack that was scooped up by Dante Fowler and returned 53 yards for a touchdown. The Jaguars took a 19-0 lead into the half. Deshaun Watson took over at quarterback for the Texans in the second half and promptly moved the ball down the field. A penalty on the Jaguars took away an interception, and Watson made them pay by throwing a short touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. Jacksonville answered by moving the ball down the field on the Houston defense as Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to fullback Tommy Bohanon. Watson moved the ball across midfield again before Fowler kicked the ball out of Watson's hand, and Ngakoue recovered the fumble. Late in the 4.h quarter, Watson moved the ball inside the 10-yard line, but threw an interception to Tashaun Gipson to finish off Houston.    Fournette ran for 100 yards on 26 carries and a touchdown in his NFL debut. He also caught 3 passes for 24 yards.    Bortles had an easy game, completing 11-of-21 for 125 yards with a touchdown.    Watson was 12-of-23 for 102 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. Savage finished 7-of-13 for 62 yards.    Lamar Miller ran for 65 yards on 17 carries, plus made 2 receptions for 31 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins caught 7 passes for 55 yards with a touchdown.    The Jaguars' defense was incredible, totaling 10 sacks. Calais Campbell (4 sacks, 5 quarterback hits), Yannick Ngakoue and Dante Fowler overwhelmed Houston's offensive line. The only thing that didn't really go well for the Jaguars was new cornerback "
