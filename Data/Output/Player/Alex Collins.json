   "comment":"Collins rushed 7 times for 55 yards in relief of Rawls. I do think we'll see more of Collins in the playoffs, as Rawls just hasn't looked like the same runner after his injuries.    This Seattle team is very talented, but also flawed. The Seahawks' offensive line is not putting it together, and their running game is a shadow of it once was. This season, the 49ers hadn't held a team under 51 rushing yards through 3 quarters all season, but they restricted the Seahawks to just 20 in this game, and 3 quarters were how long the starters played.    The 49ers will get the No. 2 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and hopefully they get a good general manager set up quickly for that pick, because they need it to hit.    Seattle will go into the playoffs as the No. 3 seed, which does give the team a home game against the Lions. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Nicknamed the Irish Dancer by Tony Romo, Collins gained 113 yards on 18 carries. The Dolphins had no answer for him, though it didn't exactly look like they were trying too hard to bring him down. The effort was absolutely non-existent. Still, Collins should be added in all fantasy leagues.    "

This wasn't too much of a surprise, as Collins took advantage of the Dolphins, who were lethargic in that game. Buck Allen (7-21) did some nice work as a receiver out of the backfield, logging 7 receptions for 44 yards and a touchdown. Allen converted a 4.h-and-2 in the opening half. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

As for the Packers, Hundley killed his team by taking big sacks and failing to anticipate throws. His passes were late, and he made too many mistakes. He finished 21-of-36 for 239 yards, 3 picks and a lost fumble. He took a major step backward this week, as he no longer had the luxury of battling a defense missing its star linebacker.
