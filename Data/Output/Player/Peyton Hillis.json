Hillis is worth starting in lucrative matchups, though he should be on your bench next week, as the Broncos battle the Jets.    Despite Higgins' kick return, the play of the game belongs to Tom Cable. In the middle of the contest, Cutler fired a ball out of bounds that looked like it was homing in on Cable's family jewels. At the last second, Cable was able to karate kick the ball out of the way, sparing himself some excruciating pain.    Oh, and I almost forgot... Congratulations to the Raiders for being the first team to score 4 points in a very long time. Here's proof:   "

That touchdown gave the Falcons the cover. - While Wallace went 11-of-15 for 139 yards, Delhomme was 13-of-23 for 97 yards, 2 picks and the aforementioned fumble.

   "comment":"Hillis actually threw a 13-yard pass to Colt McCoy.    Aside from succumbing to several trick plays, how did the Saints lose this contest? Well, it was more of the same at first. They couldn't take advantage of opportunities in the red zone. A touchdown to Lance Moore was called back because of a penalty early on. Afterward, it just seemed like Brees got frustrated and began forcing passes. He ended up with 4 interceptions, 2 of which were returned for touchdowns by linebacker David Bowens. Coincidentally, Brees' new baby son is named Bowen.    Marques Colston finally scored a touchdown, though it came very late in garbage time. Still, Colston finished with 10 grabs for 112 yards.    Chris Ivory was started by many after his great performance last week. However, the Browns are very good against the run, and limited Ivory to just 48 yards on 15 carries.    McCoy wasn't as good in this contest as he was at Pittsburgh. He went 9-of-16 for 74 yards, and seemed to settle for a ton of checkdowns. On a positive note, McCoy didn't turn the ball over. That's more impressive than it sounds because playing in the Superdome is a major challenge for any quarterback, especially a rookie.    Hillis rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts.    The star for the Browns defensively - aside from Bowens, of course - was linebacker "
