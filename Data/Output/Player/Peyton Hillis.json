Hillis is worth starting in lucrative matchups, though he should be on your bench next week, as the Broncos battle the Jets.    Despite Higgins' kick return, the play of the game belongs to Tom Cable. In the middle of the contest, Cutler fired a ball out of bounds that looked like it was homing in on Cable's family jewels. At the last second, Cable was able to karate kick the ball out of the way, sparing himself some excruciating pain.    Oh, and I almost forgot... Congratulations to the Raiders for being the first team to score 4 points in a very long time. Here's proof:   "

   "comment":"Peyton Hillis probably would have scored otherwise. - On a Browns 4.h down at midfield with 5 seconds remaining at the end of the first half, they didn't even try a Hail Mary. The crowd booed the Browns off the field even though they had a 7-6 lead; Cleveland essentially admitted that their quarterback can't throw a 50-yard pass even though they gave him $7 million guaranteed. - Delhomme threw a pick-six - to a defensive end. That touchdown gave the Falcons the cover. - While Wallace went 11-of-15 for 139 yards, Delhomme was 13-of-23 for 97 yards, 2 picks and the aforementioned fumble.    Peyton Hillis continues to be a stud; he only had 28 rushing yards on just 10 carries, but caught 4 passes for 49 receiving yards and yet another touchdown.    "

They simply made too many mistakes. It began early when Will Beatty false started on a 4.h-and-inches attempt. "
