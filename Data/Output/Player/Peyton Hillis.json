   "comment":"Peyton Hillis probably would have scored otherwise. - On a Browns 4.h down at midfield with 5 seconds remaining at the end of the first half, they didn't even try a Hail Mary. The crowd booed the Browns off the field even though they had a 7-6 lead; Cleveland essentially admitted that their quarterback can't throw a 50-yard pass even though they gave him $7 million guaranteed. - Delhomme threw a pick-six - to a defensive end. That touchdown gave the Falcons the cover. - While Wallace went 11-of-15 for 139 yards, Delhomme was 13-of-23 for 97 yards, 2 picks and the aforementioned fumble.    Peyton Hillis continues to be a stud; he only had 28 rushing yards on just 10 carries, but caught 4 passes for 49 receiving yards and yet another touchdown.    "

   "comment":"Peyton Hillis also saw some action (6-29), even getting a carry on the third down of the opening drive for some reason. It goes without saying that the Giants desperately need Rashad Jennings to return to action.    The Giants didn't lose this game because of their inability to run, however. They simply made too many mistakes. It began early when Will Beatty false started on a 4.h-and-inches attempt. "
