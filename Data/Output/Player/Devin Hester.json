   "comment":"Hester and Greg Olsen, the Bears receivers couldn't catch anything. In fact, Rashied Davis dropped a pass that deflected into the arms of a Saints defensive back. Orton was also horrific, going 24-of-40 for 172 yards, including a telegraphed pass to New Orleans linebacker Scott Fujita. Worst of all, the Bears couldn't get the running game going. It didn't even look like they wanted to. I know Matt Forte left the game in the first quarter with a toe injury, which must have scared all of his fantasy owners half to death, but he came back in the beginning of the second quarter. At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

   "comment":"Hester. He wasted timeouts in the second half. Throughout the afternoon, he just stood there bundled up in his puffy coat looking like a moron the whole time. It's sickening that he hasn't been fired yet. Rivers sucks. He's a cocky douche bag who never takes any of the blame for himself. He's physically gifted and is able to make pretty throws when he's not under pressure, but when the game is on the line, he chokes like a female porn star. Whether it's throwing into double coverage or sailing a pass into an opposing player's arms when trying to throw the ball away, Rivers has a knack for doing the perfect stupid thing when his team needs him most. This Charger team is done. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms discussed San Diego still being alive in the AFC West race, but that's just dumb. San Diego is just too dumb and too poorly coached to make any sort of run.    Let's get through these numbers before I have an aneurysm. Rivers went 21-of-31 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Despite all the injuries to the offensive line going into this contest, Rivers wasn't under pressure all that much.    Rivers' scores went to "

   "comment":"Hester, he also pinned Chicago at the 3-yard line. A quick 3.and-out put Oakland right back in business at midfield. They tried to get Michael Bush (24-69) going in the running game, but he was held in check all afternoon. Bush did manage to pick up a 4th-and-1, but the drive came up empty when Julius Peppers and Charles Tillman combined on a sack to back them out of field-goal range. The Bears finally got the chains moving with Marion Barber (10-69) looking like his old self running for 15, 4 and 8 yards to start the drive. Hanie (18-for-36 254 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) did more damage on the run (5-50), picking up 24 to convert a 3rd-and-18. Faced with 3rd-and-8, he found his hot receiver when the Raiders blitzed, and Johnny Knox (4-145, 1 TD) did the rest for the score. Despite being outplayed, the visitors were up 7-6. I have a little fun with fullback Marcel Reece calling him a matchup nightmare which is what radio announcer Greg Papa referred to him as in the preseason, but he looked like 1 taking a screen 47 yards down the sideline to start Oakland's next drive. That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2.minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end Kellen Davis helped them reach the 6. However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage. The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His 6.h boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by Darrius Heyward-Bey, but Lechler delivered a franchise record 80-yard punt that sent an amazed Hester running backwards as the ball went into the end zone. Chicago's offense had some fight left with Hanie finding Knox on a pickup of 19 yards then going right back to him on an identical play for 16 more to put them in scoring range. Hanie scrambled for 7 yards and Gould connected from 53 yards out to trim the lead to 18-13. It looked like Oakland's next drive put a finish to any comeback bid. "

   "comment":"Hester return to the 10-yard line, a Brian Urlacher pick-six of Matt Hasselbeck and a Chris Conte fumble recovery of Chris Johnson. It's amazing that the Bears didn't even really need to run a single offensive play to get out to a 26-point lead. In fact, it would have been a 28-point advantage had they completely gone with the anti-Bobby Boucher approach because they took a safety on an offensive line penalty in their own end zone. The Titans were guilty of 5 turnovers in the first half. I mentioned the blocked punt, pick-six and Johnson fumble; Johnson had another fumble in Chicago territory, while Kenny Britt coughed the ball up at midfield. Jared Cook also fumbled in the second half; his 2 catches for 6 yards makes you wonder why no team wanted to acquire him at the trade deadline.    Jay Cutler didn't have to do much, but he put together a solid performance. He went 19-of-26 for 229 yards and 3 touchdowns, though it's worth noting that most of his production came when his team was well ahead and several of the Titans seemed to quit. Amazingly though, Cutler was sacked thrice, which makes you wonder how he would have survived had Tennessee not killed itself with stupid mistakes.    All 3 of Cutler's touchdowns went to Brandon Marshall, who had a monstrous afternoon with 9 catches for 122 yards. Only 1 other Bear caught more than 2 passes (Earl Bennett: 4-22).    Matt Forte was set up with a short touchdown thanks to Hester's aforementioned return. He received just 12 carries on the afternoon, but was able to finish with 103 yards and the score.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, finished with 141 yards and a touchdown on just 16 attempts. Those are pretty bogus numbers, however, because he scored on an 80-yard scamper in garbage time. He otherwise would have mustered 61 yards on 15 tries, most notably getting stuffed twice on 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 on the second drive. He also fumbled twice.    Hasselbeck finished 20-of-35 for 194 yards, 1 score (to "

   "comment":"Hester got banged up. William Moore also exited with a shoulder, but the offensive line was Atlanta's biggest issue. By the end, tight end Levine Toilolo was playing right tackle. Matt Ryan, who didn't see much pressure early on, was suddenly feeling lots of heat and couldn't make a comeback as a consequence. He tossed 2 picks late, both of which were made out of desperation.    Of course, the most prevalent injury that occurred came when Teddy Bridgewater limped toward the sideline and was carted off to the locker room. It's a shame because Bridgewater had a brilliant performance in his first NFL start. He went 19-of-30 for 317 passing yards as well as 27 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Bridgewater made some great plays, including 1 where he juked to avoid a sack and rushed upfield to move the chains. He had the fans in a frenzy, who chanted, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! throughout the afternoon. The FOX sideline reporter said that Bridgewater gave her 2 thumbs up when he was being wheeled off, so hopefully that's a good sign. It would be a shame if Bridgewater missed significant time after this excellent display, albeit against a crappy defense. However, 1 of the few reasons Bridgewater fell in the 2014 NFL Draft was because some teams were worried about his durability. This might be something Minnesota fans will just have to get used to, unfortunately. Bridgewater opened the game with mostly short throws to Jarius Wright. The speedy receiver had a huge afternoon, hauling in 8 balls for 132 yards. Bridgewater also missed him for a possible touchdown. Meanwhile, it was surprising to see Cordarrelle Patterson (2 catches, 38 yards) do very little once again. Norv Turner talked about designing plays for Patterson, but save for the season opener, the 2013 first-rounder hasn't been much of a factor.    It really helped Bridgewater that his team was able to run the ball so well. Matt Asiata (20-78) scored thrice, but Jerick McKinnon was much more impressive. He gained 135 yards on 18 carries, including a 55-yard burst. He didn't face much of a challenge against Atlanta's pathetic front, but McKinnon still needs to get more touches going forward.    Moving back to the Falcons, Ryan was sharp early on, but as mentioned, his offensive line issues prevented him from doing anything late. Ryan finished 25-of-41 for 298 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 meaningless picks. He was terrific on third downs, converting 10-of-15 opportunities.    The Vikings didn't seem to have an answer for any of the 3 primary receivers, as Julio Jones (6-82), Roddy White (4-73, TD) and Hester (5-70, TD) all had big outings. White scored on a complete breakdown in coverage.    The Falcons continued to have their running backs split carries. "

   "comment":"Hester had Mike Smith not called a timeout to ice the kicker (a strategy that has been proven futile; I guess Smith never got the memo). Seeing this, you'd think Pettine would either concede or have Brian Hoyer throw a Hail Mary, but he tried a 60-yarder again. It fell short for the second time, and Hester nearly took it back for the touchdown. Pettine also misused his third timeout at the very end of the game, but it didn't matter because Cundiff was able to seal the victory. Pettine, however, needs to make a decision on his starting quarterback, as Hoyer was terrible once again. He deserves credit for leading his team on the final drive, but the Browns shouldn't have even been in that position, as Hoyer threw 2 horrific interceptions late in the game. The first occurred in the red zone when Hoyer inexplicably drifted back 15 yards in the pocket and forced it to "

   "comment":"Hester sprinted for a long punt return, taking the ball back inside Atlanta's 20-yard line. Seattle was going to have a great chance to take a 17-7 lead, but a holding penalty was called on Kevin Pierre-Louis on the return. The penalty was probably correct, but the hold didn't have anything to do with the play. As a result of the hold, the Seahawks were pinned inside their own 5-yard line. Their backup right guard, playing in place of the injured Germain Ifedi, stepped on Russell Wilson's foot, resulting in a safety. The Falcons then took the lead with a field goal on the ensuing possession, and they never looked back. The end result of this game was definitely misleading, but what's not is Atlanta's yardage total. The Falcons accumulated 422 net yards of offense, as the Seahawks had absolutely no answer for anything Atlanta was doing. Earl Thomas was clearly missed, and it didn't help that No. 2 cornerback Deshawn Shead was knocked out of the game when his knee buckled while trying to cover Taylor Gabriel. The Atlanta receiver actually pushed off, and Shead went down instantly. It's unclear why offensive pass interference wasn't called. The Falcons were flagged just twice all game. Hopefully official Gene Steratore makes great use of his new yacht. With Seattle's defense struggling big time, Matt Ryan torched the formerly dominant Legion of Boom with ease. Ryan went 26-of-37 for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. He validated his possible MVP status, as the Seahawks couldn't do anything to slow him down. They didn't put much pressure on him, and even when they did, he still found open receivers, punishing them for blitzing him. Even when Julio Jones was knocked out, Ryan still torched Seattle's secondary mercilessly. Atlanta punted just once in meaningful action.    Speaking of Jones, he left the game temporarily on the opening drive of the third quarter with a toe injury, as he was hobbling around on the sideline. Jones reentered the game, but left prior to the end of regulation. I imagine he still would've played had the contest not gotten out of hand, but it still has to be disconcerting for the Falcons. They'll obviously need Jones to beat a tougher opponent in the NFC Championship. Jones caught 6 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. He also dropped a pass. His score, the first of the game for the Falcons, was an obvious pass interference call - blocking downfield prior to the ball being released - that Steratore didn't call for some reason. The FOX announcers, including Mike Pereira, were befuddled as to why no flagged was tossed.    If Jones is hobbled next week, the other receivers will obviously have to pick up the slack. Gabriel (4-71) was top wideout producer as far as yardage is concerned, while Mohamed Sanu (4-44) found the end zone. Running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were big factors as receivers as well. Freeman hauled in 4 balls for 80 yards, while Coleman snatched 3 passes for 22 yards and a touchdown. Speaking of Freeman and Coleman, they ran well versus the Seahawks, which was surprising. Freeman (14-45, TD) and Coleman (11-57) combined to eclipse the century mark.    Atlanta moves on to the NFC Championship. It'll either host the Packers or travel to Dallas. If the Cowboys beat Green Bay, this will have been the final game in the Georgia Dome.    As for the Seahwks, they were hot offensively early on, as they engineered a 14-play touchdown drive to start the game. The possession lasted 8:34. There were some great runs, while Russell Wilson was precise. However, bad luck ensued; the Ifedi injury, the aforementioned penalty on the Hester return, and Wilson falling down all hurt. Then, Atlanta held the ball forever, and Seattle's offensive chances were limited as a result. The Seahawks' decision to punt on 1 occasion on a 4.h-and-1 from around their own 40-yard line also hurt. They pinned the Falcons down at the 1-yard line, but Ryan put together a 99-yard touchdown drive. Wilson went 17-of-30 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions in garbage time, 1 of which should've been called a reception down by contact. Wilson played well, but once again had issues on the offensive line. He constantly had to run out of the pocket, and many of his incompletions were thrown away.    If there's a silver lining for the Seahawks, it's that they may have found something in "
