   "comment":"Donald Brown had 5 attempts for 27 yards.    Houston was whistled for 10 penalties (129 yards) compared to Indianapolis' 3. Some of the calls were legit, but there were more than enough bogus calls, including a terrible pass interference call where a Texan defensive back grazed the arm of a Colt receiver on an overthrown ball. Rodney Harrison said the penalty was a disgrace, and even former Indianapolis head coach Tony Dungy expressed his displeasure with the infraction.    With this loss, the Texans have now fallen to 5-6 after a promising 5-3 start. This was their Super Bowl and they lost it. Their season is over.   Brown shared carries pretty evenly and posted similar rushing numbers. Slaton gained 57 yards on 10 carries, while Brown totaled 56 yards on 11 attempts. Brown had a touchdown, while Slaton chipped in with 7 receptions for 49 more yards.    Manning had those aforementioned 2 first-half picks, but was extremely sharp after intermission. He finished 27-of-35 for 244 yards, 3 touchdowns. As I said earlier, there was never a doubt in my mind that Manning would pull away with the win. He always does.    Manning's scores went to the usual suspects: "

Making matters worse, Chad Henne was picked off because of a miscommunication deep in Indianapolis territory. Antoine Beatha had a big return to set up a field goal, making this a 3.score affair at halftime. Indianapolis never looked back. This was a nice win, but the Colts sustained a number of injuries: Vontae Davis (groin), Aubrayo Franklin (knee) and Bjoern Werner (ankle) were all knocked out.    Here are some key stats/notes: - Andrew Luck went 26-of-37 (including a perfect 6-of-6 in the second half) for 282 yards and a touchdown.

Hilton, who had a huge game with 11 catches for 155 yards. - Both Indianapolis backs scored, as mentioned, though Brown (12-31) and Richardson (8-25) were both limited in terms of yardage. - Henne racked up garbage yardage, finishing 30-of-51 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. It must be noted that Henne had just 107 yards by halftime. - Jones-Drew, who fumbled, had just 39 rushing yards on 13 carries, but did catch 5 balls for 51 receiving yards. This may have been his final game in a Jaguars' jersey. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Donald Brown (4-12) didn't do as much.    As mentioned in the opening paragraph, Kaepernick and Gore trampled San Diego early on. Both players actually eclipsed 150 yards on the ground. Gore rumbled for 158 yards and a touchdown on 26 attempts. Coming off a concussion on a short work week, Gore ran with great power, but the 49ers made the mistake of not handing the ball enough to him after halftime; he was given just 12 carries in the second half and overtime.    Kaepernick, meanwhile scrambled 7 times for 151 rushing yards, 90 of which came on an impressive sprint into the end zone in the third quarter, featuring a crazy juke on Brown, they moved it into range for Nick Novak, who converted to keep the season alive. San Diego, now 9-6, still needs some help to earn 1 of the 2 wild-card spots, but at least it has a chance.    Rivers finished 33-of-54 for 356 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. It was ugly early; Rivers' first pick wasn't too bad, as Perrish Cox had great coverage, but his next 1 was returned for 6. as it was heaved right to Antoine Bethea. Rivers' third interception came after halftime; it was a high throw that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. As mentioned though, Rivers caught fire at the very end to help his team's hopes alive.    Rivers' main targets were Royal (10-94, TD) and Antonio Gates, who had 7 catches for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns. Floyd (4-50) secured the 4.h score. Meanwhile, someone named Dontrelle Inman, who had never caught a pass in the NFL prior to Saturday night, logged 7 receptions for 79 yards, stepping in for an injured Keenan Allen, as well as an ineffective Seyi Ajirotutu following halftime. Inman's numbers included a key grab on 4.h-and-10 of the final drive of regulation. He's worth picking up in dynasty formats.    With Ryan Mathews out, the Chargers utilized a 3.headed platoon at running back, with Branden Oliver leading the way. He paced the team in rushing with 53 yards on 13 carries and also had 3 catches for 28 receiving yards. He had some nice spurts where he avoided 49er defenders, but the Chargers went with Ronnie Brown (7-33) when the game was on the line. "

Gordon plodded for 41 yards on 15 carries before exiting with a knee injury. It wasn't surprising at all to see the duo of Brown and Woodhead be more effective than Gordon. If McCoy knew what he happened to be doing, he would've benched Gordon long ago.    Meanwhile, the Dolphins could barely do anything on offense because of offensive line issues. Right tackle Ja'Wuan James was already out, and the team lost "

   "comment":"Donald Brown before he could get to the first-down marker and having great coverage on Malcom Floyd on a downfield shot. The Raiders tried to make Woodson the hero by giving him the ball and rolling him out during a trip to the red zone in overtime. Nothing was open, so Woodson took a slight loss, but it didn't matter because Oakland ultimately prevailed. Woodson addressed the fans after the game, thanking them for welcoming him back as if he never left.    The Raiders were able to win because of a great overtime drive. They couldn't get much going on offense throughout the entire night because Amari Cooper was injured. Derek Carr overcame this in the extra session, leading his team to a close field-goal try. Carr finished 23-of-38 for 204 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage and caught by Kendall Reyes, which set up a San Diego score. Carr also scrambled 4 times for 30 rushing yards. He couldn't get anything going in the second half. The Chargers had some nice blitzes dialed up, and as mentioned, Cooper wasn't any sort of factor.    With Cooper banged up, Michael Crabtree led the way with just 6 catches for 39 yards and a touchdown, a perfect fade pass from Carr. As for Cooper, he murdered his fantasy owners with just 2 catches for 10 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Cooper would be credited with a reception of minus-20 yards because of a Stanford Band-type play at the end of the first half, but the box score apparently didn't penalize him for this.    Latavius Murray ran well, gaining 79 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. He was also second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 38 yards. Murray became the first Oakland back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season for the first time in 5 years. However, the Raiders made the mistake of not running the ball nearly enough. They were never down by double digits, so there was no reason to have a 2:1 pass-to-rush ratio.    As for the Chargers, they once again battled hard, but had nothing to show for it. They had a lead for the majority of the contest, but tight end David Johnson lost a fumble near midfield with about 4 minutes in regulation, which the Raiders recovered and returned inside the 5-yard line. This set up the Crabtree touchdown that helped send the game into overtime. San Diego appeared to be in complete control before that; they were actually running out the clock at that moment. They also made another atrocious mistake when they were flagged for unnecessary roughness on a second-and-29 in overtime. It's both a shame and a blessing for San Diego. The loss was crushing, but could end up being beneficial, as another victory would have ruined draft positioning.    Philip Rivers was sharp, going 31-of-49 for 277 yards and a touchdown. Those aren't the best numbers, but consider the following 3 items: First, Rivers' top options at receiver were Dontrelle Inman and a banged-up Malcom Floyd. Second, stud guard Orlando Franklin was lost to a concussion. And third, Rivers appeared to throw a second touchdown, but the officials ruled that Ladarius Green let the ball hit the ground, so they overturned it even though it was very close. Considering all of that, I'd say Rivers performed well.    Only 3 Chargers accumulated more than 35 receiving yards: Inman (8-82, TD), Danny Woodhead (8-53) and Floyd (3-42). The tight ends disappointed; Antonio Gates caught 2 balls for 11 yards, while Green (2-27) converted just twice on 6 targets. Some guy named Javontee Herndon (3-16) dropped 2 passes, including a crucial third down.    Speaking of Woodhead, he led the team in rushing with 55 yards on 11 carries. Donald Brown had more carries, but mustered only 17 yards. Brown, however, scored the game's opening touchdown. As expected, San Diego didn't miss Melvin Gordon at all.    I need to note that the officiating in this game was horrendous. Carl Cheffers' crew bungled some plays. They began early by correctly flagging the Raiders for a blatant hold. They then picked up the flag 45 seconds after making the announcement. It was absurd, and Nantz and Mike Carey were both completely appalled while Phil Simms asked himself some more questions. Later, there was an obvious pass interference on an Oakland linebacker, who shoved Woodhead as the ball was being thrown to him. No penalty was called, prompting Mike McCoy to complain. The refs eventually threw a flag - but on McCoy for yelling at them! <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Brown before he could get to the first-down marker and having great coverage on Malcom Floyd on a downfield shot.
