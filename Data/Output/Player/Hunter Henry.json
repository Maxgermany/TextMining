   "comment":"Hunter Henry fumbled near midfield, giving Indianapolis its first victory. Though the Colts prevailed, it didn't seem like they should have won. They made numerous mistakes throughout the afternoon. Frank Gore started by dropping a pass. Dwayne Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, Phillip Dorsett was a disappointment, catching 3 passes for 27 yards. Jack Doyle (6-65) and Dwayne Allen (3-35) picked up the slack with Donte Moncrief being out. Allen, as mentioned, dropped a touchdown.    Right after Allen missed out on a score, Frank Gore took advantage with an end zone trip of his own. He gained 82 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. Robert Turbin (4-9) vultured a score. The Colts may have run the ball better had guard Jack Mewhort not sustained an injury in the second half.    The Chargers gave this game away at the end, but they also made some mistakes earlier in the afternoon. An unsportsmanlike penalty allowed the Colts to turn an early field goal into a touchdown. Philip Rivers missed an open Dexter McCluster for a score. Rivers was then strip-sacked when his backup left tackle was beaten badly, and this occurred 1 play after a poor pass on a terrificly designed screen. Travis Benjamin was guilty of an error later, dropping a crucial third down. The real killers occurred at the end, however.    Rivers had a great game outside of the few blunders, finishing 26-of-39 for 330 yards. He was borderline unstoppable in the second half, going 18-of-23 for 224 yards following the break. Rivers, as mentioned, figured out that the Colts could not stop the slant to Tyrell Williams, who ended up catching 6 balls for 69 yards.    Rivers did manage to spread the ball around, as 3 players in addition to Williams caught at least 4 players. They were Travis Benjamin (4-82), Hunter Henry (5-76) and Melvin Gordon (4-43)."

For the day, Hunter caught 4-of-7 targets for 61 yards and a touchdown, plus had 2 other just misses in the end zone. We may be seeing Antonio Gates' replacement sooner than expected.    In the end, the Chargers gave this game away, but the Saints were good enough to take advantage. Neither team has the defense to win many games this year, but both will continue to put up points. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
