   "comment":"Moats lost a fumble on Indianapolis' 1-yard line. And of course, there was the missed kick. Houston is now 0-8 at Indianapolis, but they could have easily won this game. The players shouldn't hang their heads at all.    Aside from that bad pick, Schaub played pretty well, finishing 32-of-43 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (the second pick wasn't his fault).    Schaub found Andre Johnson 10 times. The athletic receiver turned those receptions into 103 yards.    Without Owen Daniels, Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, "
