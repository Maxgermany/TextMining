Prescott, who sliced and diced Chicago's defense while only making 1 bad throw on the evening - a pass behind 1 of his targets - could've posted an even better stat line. Prescott missed out on 2 other passing scores, as 2 of his players were tackled at the 1-yard line. Prescott also lost out on an opportunity to get another touchdown when "

   "comment":"Prescott managing the game well, while rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott ripped the 49ers' defense. San Francisco illustrated once again that it is in for a long season with a serious lack of talent to build on for the future.    The Cowboys moved the opening drive into field goal range before Dan Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal. San Francisco then marched down the field with Gabbert hitting Jeremy Kerley, who was wide open in blown coverage, for a 33-yard score. The next drive by the 49ers was led by completions to Garrett Celek (5-79) for 38 yards and a 17-yarder to Kerley. That set up a short touchdown run for Carlos Hyde. The Cowboys answered with a drive that was aided by the officials as they made a terrible roughing call on Jaquiski Tartt. Dallas took advantage with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams (4-44-1). Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock."

He was great, but Cleveland's secondary and linebacking corps have to shoulder much of the blame. For instance, on a Prescott touchdown to Jason Witten, newcomer Jamie Collins blew a coverage, as it didn't appear as though he knew what to do just yet."

   "comment":"Prescott will be Dallas' starting quarterback going forward, barring injury. Enough about whether Romo is 80.5-percent healthy or 80.6-percent healthy!    Not that often do games live up to the hype, but this Sunday in Pittsburgh, we witnessed an epic battle between 2 top offenses. There were 7 lead changes, a fake spike that resulted in a touchdown and a 3.touchdown day from the frontrunner for Rookie of the Year. If you like defense, maybe this game wasn't for you, but if you like offense, then you came to the right place. The Cowboys came into this day with the best time of possession per game, which had kept opponents' offenses off the field, but this week, the Steelers' offense was on point, with Ben Roethlisberger back at home and healthy. Roethlisberger got the scoring started with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Le'Veon Bell and then a 3-yard touchdown pass to Eli Rogers to put Pittsburgh up 12-3 right before the first quarter was up. And yes, those 12 points weren't 4 field goals; they were 2 touchdowns and 2 missed 2.point conversions. Mike Tomlin's proclivity for the 2.point conversion came back to bite him this week, as the Steelers scored 4 touchdowns on the day and failed all 4 of their conversions. With just 12 seconds left in the first quarter, down 12-3, Dak Prescott hit Ezekiel Elliott on a screen pass that Elliott took 83 yards for his first touchdown of the day."

As a result of all of this, Prescott was just 4-of-10 for 31 yards to begin the afternoon. Elliott wasn't having much luck either, mustering only 26 yards on 6 carries in the opening half. It appeared as though the Cowboys were going to lose because they overlooked the Ravens. At the very least, it seemed as though they would have to grind out a tough, defensive victory at the very end. And then, the second half happened. Dallas' offensive line was much better following the break, both in terms of pass protection and run blocking. "

Romo was on the field for just 1 drive, but that's all the Cowboys needed to see. Romo looked like he was rusty when his first pass was nearly picked by Leodis McKelvin. However, he bounced back with a strike to Terrance Williams to move the chains on a third-and-long attempt. Romo then helped Dez Bryant draw an interference flag in the end zone, as Nolan Carroll was guilty of some of the worst coverage you'll ever see from a professional cornerback. Romo capitalized by lofting a perfect touchdown to Williams. Romo's final numbers were 3-of-4 for 29 yards and the touchdown. It was a small sample size, but the Cowboys have to be confident that Romo can lead the team deep into the playoffs in the event of a Prescott injury. Prescott, by the way, went 4-of-8 for 37 yards. He was banged up pretty well, and I imagine the Cowboys regret using him at all in this game against an angry Eagle team.    The Cowboys used "

   "comment":"Prescott for only a quarter. Thus, all eyes were on Tony Romo, who played for the first time since suffering an injury on Thanksgiving last year. Romo was on the field for just 1 drive, but that's all the Cowboys needed to see. Romo looked like he was rusty when his first pass was nearly picked by Leodis McKelvin. However, he bounced back with a strike to Terrance Williams to move the chains on a third-and-long attempt. Romo then helped Dez Bryant draw an interference flag in the end zone, as Nolan Carroll was guilty of some of the worst coverage you'll ever see from a professional cornerback. Romo capitalized by lofting a perfect touchdown to Williams. Romo's final numbers were 3-of-4 for 29 yards and the touchdown. It was a small sample size, but the Cowboys have to be confident that Romo can lead the team deep into the playoffs in the event of a Prescott injury. Prescott, by the way, went 4-of-8 for 37 yards. He was banged up pretty well, and I imagine the Cowboys regret using him at all in this game against an angry Eagle team.    The Cowboys used "

   "comment":"Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott was tremendous. The man who was most responsible for this defeat was Jason Garrett, who was thoroughly out-coached by Mike McCarthy. Garrett looked like he was caught with his pants down when his substitution packages repeatedly resulted in penalties. Garrett also deserves harsh criticism for not recognizing the free kick after a fair catch rule. The FOX announcers completely missed it, but the Cowboys had an opportunity to attempt a kick off a tee - i.e. a kickoff - from around midfield right before halftime. Had Dan Bailey hit this kickoff through the uprights, the Cowboys would've scored 3 points. This happened because Dallas signaled for a fair catch on a punt as a half expired. Garrett didn't recognize it even though numerous readers did and asked me about it.    As for Prescott, he was brilliant in the 4.h quarter. The Burnett-less Packer secondary had no answer for him, as Prescott made numerous clutch plays, including a third-and-14 throw to "

A reason for this is because he saw more pressure than he's been used to. It's difficult to say if this was because of the Giants' great pass rush or the departure of Ronald Leary, but I suppose we'll find out in the coming weeks. Prescott had some errant throws, especially in the opening half. He whiffed on 3 tries in the red zone when the Cowboy fans were chanting Zeeeke! and then he threw behind "

On Twitter, I saw that 1 Cowboy beat writer said that the game was over, and it certainly appeared that way. It seemed like this would be a blowout. Instead, the Rams made some adjustments and were able to dominate on the defensive side of the ball in the second half. They were so much better on first down, as the Cowboys had to constantly operate in long-yardage situations. Meanwhile, Jared Goff continued to show major growth. He had some instances where he back-peddled and threw some bad passes as a result, but he was mostly on point, leading the Rams to a comeback and a surprise upset victory.    Goff was mostly excellent, going 21-of-36 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a huge third-and-11 deep in his own territory. He didn't face much resistance, as Dallas was missing Pro Bowl linebacker Sean Lee, but this was still a monumental improvement over how he looked last year. Sean McVay and Greg Olson have worked wonders with him.    As good as Goff was, Todd Gurley was the star of the show. Gurley not only rushed for 121 yards on 23 carries - which included a trademark hurdle of his - but he also led the team in receiving, catching 7 balls for 94 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gurley is a monster and happens to be rejuvenated by the upgrades the Rams have made to their offensive line.    Following Gurley, Cooper Kupp was next on the receiving chart with 5 rabs for 60 yards and a touchdown. Interestingly, Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because Ronald Leary departed for Denver. The mainstays aren't performing up to their abilities either.    Prescott finished 20-of-36 for 252 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because his elbow was hit as he released the ball. However, Prescott's stat line could've been far worse.

   "comment":"Prescott touchdown that seemed like it might give Dallas the victory. And it probably would have if the Packers didn't have the best current quarterback on the planet commanding their offense.    The Packers' victory was terrific, and the cherry on top is that they may have found a legitimate running back. Ty Montgomery is a solid player, but he's not a natural at the position. Rookie Aaron Jones definitely is, and he had a stellar performance in his first career start. Jones burst for 125 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries. He had a key run on the team's final drive; he picked up a big gain and also managed to step out of bounds.    Nelson was hampered with an injury, but he was still able to help his fantasy owners with a touchdown, catching 2 balls for 24 yards. He should've snatched a 2.point conversion in the 4.h quarter; he was wide open, but Rodgers sailed the ball over his head. Meanwhile, Adams' decisive score wasn't his only 1. He caught 7 balls for 66 yards and found the end zone twice. This was amazing, considering the brutal hit he took from Danny Trevathan on Thursday night. Elsewhere in the receiving corps, Randall Cobb had just 4 grabs for 29 yards. Martellus Bennett (3-53) made a couple of important catches to set up a pair of scores.    The Cowboys, meanwhile, had great performances from all 4 of their stars. Dak Prescott went 25-of-36 for 251 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He also had a 4.h score on the ground, as he scrambled 4 times for 37 rushing yards. The pick, which was taken back for 6. wasn't his fault, as it bounced off "

Prescott's ended up going 14-of-22 for 143 yards. He also scrambled for 16 yards in this uneventful performance. He did what was asked of him, but will have much bigger performances in the future, especially if Elliott gets suspended.

   "comment":"Prescott. It showed. Prescott simply didn't have enough times to make plays. Usually, Prescott would have a clean pocket and would be able to go through his progression to find an open receiver. Not on Sunday. Prescott struggled out the gate because he was constantly being chased down by opposing pass-rushers. He was sacked 8 times and evacuated the pocket on a majority of his pass attempts due to the pressure. When he was able to throw, Prescott was accurate on short- to medium-length passes. But there wasn't enough time for anything to develop downfield. So, Dallas' offense became limited to quick, short plays that had a high level of success, but didn't move the needle much when the team got down. This can't be entirely blamed on Prescott, as it was a product of the poor offensive line play. Prescott finished the day 19-of-29 for 176 yards. It was not a pretty performance for him, and the only saving grace for him was that he scrambled for 42 yards on 6 rushes and scored the team's lone touchdown on a scamper. Prescott will have better weeks, but the Cowboys need Tyron Smith to come back if they want to be competitive. And even then, Prescott won't be as effective due to the absence of Elliott.    With Prescott under pressure, "

   "comment":"Prescott, as it was once again apparent how much Dallas missed Tyron Smith. The Cowboys gave their left tackle some help this time, but not nearly enough. On 1 occasion, rookie Derek Barnett dashed right by Byron Bell to hit Prescott's arm, dislodging the ball in the process. The fumble was returned for a touchdown, though the game was already decided by then. Prescott finished with a horrible stat line, going 18-of-31 for only 145 yards, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. Two picks occurred in meaningful action; the first wasn't Prescott's fault, as the ball deflected off "

   "comment":"Prescott plenty of short-yardage opportunities. This was crucial for Dallas at the beginning of the second half. Prescott injured his thumb in the second quarter and even had X-rays taken. Prescott didn't miss a snap, but it wasn't clear if he was healthy. Some of his initial throws were off the mark, but he looked like his normal self by the final frame. When Prescott found Dez Bryant in the end zone, it was clear that he was just fine. This put the Cowboys up 24-7, and the game was over.    Prescott finished 11-of-22 for 102 yards and 2 touchdowns. The fantasy performance overall wasn't bad because of the 2 scores, but the completion percentage was a byproduct of the thumb injury and some jitters early in the evening. Prescott missed some early plays, but the Redskins failed to capitaize for reasons I'll discuss later.    Prescott's touchdowns went to Dez Bryant (5-61) and "
