   "comment":"Elliott, was very impressive. Prescott opened the game by going 6-of-7 for 49 yards on the initial drive. He moved the chains well at times and even appeared to have a touchdown to Dez Bryant, but the catch was ruled incomplete upon review because Bryant let the ball hit the ground. Prescott was only 11-of-26 in the second half, but was the victim of countless drops, as the Dallas players lost the ball in the sunlight in Jerry Jones' poorly designed stadium. Cole Beasley even mimicked Bryant, dropping a touchdown. Prescott finished 25-of-45 for 227 yards. He also rushed twice for 12 yards. Prescott's stat line would've been much better if it weren't for all of the drops, and it needs to be noted that he was battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL. Despite this, Prescott nearly led the Cowboys on a game-winning drive, but Terrance Williams stupidly did not get out of bounds as the clock was ticking down. Prescott attempted to spike the ball, but ran out of time.    As for his rookie teammate, Elliott didn't have as much success, mustering only 51 yards on 20 carries, though he did score once. What needs to be factored in is that Elliott was going against what could be the top run defense in the NFL. No 1 is going to rush the ball successfully against Snacks Harrison and "

   "comment":"Elliott lining up in the backfield together. On a day in which Carson Wentz lit up the Steelers, Prescott almost had to equal that performance. Prescott was brilliant, going 19-of-24 for 248 yards and a touchdown to go along with 36 rushing yards and a second score on 4 scrambles. Prescott, who sliced and diced Chicago's defense while only making 1 bad throw on the evening - a pass behind 1 of his targets - could've posted an even better stat line. Prescott missed out on 2 other passing scores, as 2 of his players were tackled at the 1-yard line. Prescott also lost out on an opportunity to get another touchdown when Terrance Williams lost a fumble deep in Chicago territory.    As for Ezekiel Elliott, the Bears had immense difficulty tackling him, as Elliott gashed Chicago's injury-ravaged defense. He gained 140 yards on 30 carries, and he also caught 2 balls for 20 receiving yards. Elliott looked great running behind his terrific defensive line, but once again, this wasn't much of a test because the Bears are missing half their defense. The 1 thing we can take away for sure is that Elliott didn't fumble, which has been his only issue thus far.    The first drive of the game was almost disastrous for the Cowboys. "

   "comment":"Elliott ripped the 49ers' defense. San Francisco illustrated once again that it is in for a long season with a serious lack of talent to build on for the future.    The Cowboys moved the opening drive into field goal range before Dan Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal. San Francisco then marched down the field with Gabbert hitting Jeremy Kerley, who was wide open in blown coverage, for a 33-yard score. The next drive by the 49ers was led by completions to Garrett Celek (5-79) for 38 yards and a 17-yarder to Kerley. That set up a short touchdown run for Carlos Hyde. The Cowboys answered with a drive that was aided by the officials as they made a terrible roughing call on Jaquiski Tartt. Dallas took advantage with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams (4-44-1). Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock. To start the second half, Hyde rumbled for 32 yards, and Gabbert threw a beautiful pass to Celek for 29 yards. The 49ers settled for a short field goal, but that was all the offense they could muster in the final 2 quarters. Dallas got going when Elliott ripped off a 23-yard run. Prescott connected on a couple of passes, and then Elliott plunged into the end zone for the game-winning score. Early in the 4.h quarter, Gabbert threw a poorly placed pass, and it was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Elliott continue to mature before our very eyes. Prescott was prolific against a Cincinnati defense with a strong front 7. Despite missing Dez Bryant, Prescott misfired on just 6 occasions, 1 of which was a drop by Jason Witten on a third down that would've moved the chains. His only blemish was a lost fumble in the red zone, which was the first turnover of his young career. Prescott was amazingly precise, finishing 18-of-24 for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). If he had a blank jersey on, you'd think he were some sort of 6.year veteran. He doesn't look like a rookie whatsoever, and he still hasn't thrown an interception. In the wake of Wentz's pick, Prescott now holds the record for most completions by a first-year quarterback without an interception. Elliott, meanwhile, ripped through a Cincinnati ground defense that was supposed to be better because of Vontaze Burfict's return."

Prescott followed that up by underthrowing Bryant for a touchdown and then having an interception dropped, only because Terrance Williams had to commit offensive pass interference to break up the play. On later drives, the Cowboys were flagged for a delay-of-game penalty, and then Elliott had a long run that was nullified by a hold, albeit a shaky 1. As you can see, the Cowboys screwed up so many times and clearly didn't have their heads in the game. And yet, they won. I don't know if that says more about the Eagles blowing it, or Dallas having amazing perseverance. Philadelphia did make mistakes of its own, especially late in the contest. "

   "comment":"Elliott wasn't having much luck either, mustering only 26 yards on 6 carries in the opening half. It appeared as though the Cowboys were going to lose because they overlooked the Ravens. At the very least, it seemed as though they would have to grind out a tough, defensive victory at the very end. And then, the second half happened. Dallas' offensive line was much better following the break, both in terms of pass protection and run blocking. Ezekiel Elliott began gashing the Ravens' worn-down defense, while Prescott made all of the throws he needed to. The Ravens appeared to have a chance in the 4.h quarter after scoring a touchdown, but the Cowboys held possession for about 7 minutes on a soul-crushing drive that culminated with a field goal, making the margin 10 points with less than 2 minutes remaining in regulation. Thus, Dallas was able to prevail by double digits despite playing poorly for a half, which shows just how good they are.    Remember how I said Prescott began 4-of-10 for 31 yards? Well, he finished 27-of-36 for 301 yards and 3 touchdowns, meaning he was an unreal 23-of-26 for 270 yards and 3 scores following that slow start. Considering how utterly confused Prescott was in the opening quarter, it's insane that he was able to rebound like he did. Almost every single rookie quarterback in NFL history would've continued to struggle, but Prescott and the coaching staff figured things out and were able to thrive afterward.    Elliott, meanwhile, failed to eclipse the century mark, but he did finished with 97 yards on 25 carries, running extremely well in the second half, especially on the final offensive drive I referenced earlier. He also caught 4 passes for 30 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Elliott was tremendous. The man who was most responsible for this defeat was Jason Garrett, who was thoroughly out-coached by Mike McCarthy. Garrett looked like he was caught with his pants down when his substitution packages repeatedly resulted in penalties. Garrett also deserves harsh criticism for not recognizing the free kick after a fair catch rule. The FOX announcers completely missed it, but the Cowboys had an opportunity to attempt a kick off a tee - i.e. a kickoff - from around midfield right before halftime. Had Dan Bailey hit this kickoff through the uprights, the Cowboys would've scored 3 points. This happened because Dallas signaled for a fair catch on a punt as a half expired. Garrett didn't recognize it even though numerous readers did and asked me about it.    As for Prescott, he was brilliant in the 4.h quarter. The Burnett-less Packer secondary had no answer for him, as Prescott made numerous clutch plays, including a third-and-14 throw to Jason Witten inside the red zone, a game-tying touchdown to Dez Bryant, and a rushing 2.point score. Prescott went 24-of-38 for 302 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, a telegraphed throw snatched by Micah Hyde. There was some question as to how Prescott would perform as a rookie in his first playoff game, and aside from the pick, he passed with flying colors. In fact, his numbers could've been much better had his receivers not dropped a few balls. There's no doubt that Tony Romo will be traded this offseason. The only question is to which team.    Elliott, meanwhile, registered 125 yards on 22 carries. He moved the pile on most of his attempts, and 1 of his best runs featured a sick spin move to avoid "

   "comment":"Elliott touchdown run. This put the Cowboys up 17-6, and the game was effectively over. </i> This was the mindset everyone had when Dallas established an 11-point lead in the early going. On Twitter, I saw that 1 Cowboy beat writer said that the game was over, and it certainly appeared that way. It seemed like this would be a blowout. Instead, the Rams made some adjustments and were able to dominate on the defensive side of the ball in the second half. They were so much better on first down, as the Cowboys had to constantly operate in long-yardage situations. Meanwhile, Jared Goff continued to show major growth. He had some instances where he back-peddled and threw some bad passes as a result, but he was mostly on point, leading the Rams to a comeback and a surprise upset victory.    Goff was mostly excellent, going 21-of-36 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a huge third-and-11 deep in his own territory. He didn't face much resistance, as Dallas was missing Pro Bowl linebacker Sean Lee, but this was still a monumental improvement over how he looked last year. Sean McVay and Greg Olson have worked wonders with him.    As good as Goff was, Todd Gurley was the star of the show. Gurley not only rushed for 121 yards on 23 carries - which included a trademark hurdle of his - but he also led the team in receiving, catching 7 balls for 94 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gurley is a monster and happens to be rejuvenated by the upgrades the Rams have made to their offensive line.    Following Gurley, Cooper Kupp was next on the receiving chart with 5 rabs for 60 yards and a touchdown. Interestingly, Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because "

   "comment":"Elliott touchdown run. This put the Cowboys up 17-6, and the game was effectively over. </i> This was the mindset everyone had when Dallas established an 11-point lead in the early going. On Twitter, I saw that 1 Cowboy beat writer said that the game was over, and it certainly appeared that way. It seemed like this would be a blowout. Instead, the Rams made some adjustments and were able to dominate on the defensive side of the ball in the second half. They were so much better on first down, as the Cowboys had to constantly operate in long-yardage situations. Meanwhile, Jared Goff continued to show major growth. He had some instances where he back-peddled and threw some bad passes as a result, but he was mostly on point, leading the Rams to a comeback and a surprise upset victory.    Goff was mostly excellent, going 21-of-36 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a huge third-and-11 deep in his own territory. He didn't face much resistance, as Dallas was missing Pro Bowl linebacker Sean Lee, but this was still a monumental improvement over how he looked last year. Sean McVay and Greg Olson have worked wonders with him.    As good as Goff was, Todd Gurley was the star of the show. Gurley not only rushed for 121 yards on 23 carries - which included a trademark hurdle of his - but he also led the team in receiving, catching 7 balls for 94 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gurley is a monster and happens to be rejuvenated by the upgrades the Rams have made to their offensive line.    Following Gurley, Cooper Kupp was next on the receiving chart with 5 rabs for 60 yards and a touchdown. Interestingly, Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because "

He converted 4.h-and-1 twice, though the second 1 came with some controversy. Elliott appeared to be stuffed, but replay review showed that he extended his arm past the first-down marker. Still, considering he wasn't down, he should have been ruled short because he pulled the ball back and then hit the ground. It was a confusing sequence, and it gave the Cowboys a touchdown, but the Packers won in the end, so it doesn't really matter.    The other 2 stars, "
