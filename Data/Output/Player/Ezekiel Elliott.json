   "comment":"Ezekiel Elliott lining up in the backfield together. On a day in which Carson Wentz lit up the Steelers, Prescott almost had to equal that performance. Prescott was brilliant, going 19-of-24 for 248 yards and a touchdown to go along with 36 rushing yards and a second score on 4 scrambles. Prescott, who sliced and diced Chicago's defense while only making 1 bad throw on the evening - a pass behind 1 of his targets - could've posted an even better stat line. Prescott missed out on 2 other passing scores, as 2 of his players were tackled at the 1-yard line. Prescott also lost out on an opportunity to get another touchdown when Terrance Williams lost a fumble deep in Chicago territory.    As for Ezekiel Elliott, the Bears had immense difficulty tackling him, as Elliott gashed Chicago's injury-ravaged defense. He gained 140 yards on 30 carries, and he also caught 2 balls for 20 receiving yards. Elliott looked great running behind his terrific defensive line, but once again, this wasn't much of a test because the Bears are missing half their defense. The 1 thing we can take away for sure is that Elliott didn't fumble, which has been his only issue thus far.    The first drive of the game was almost disastrous for the Cowboys. "

   "comment":"Ezekiel Elliott on a screen pass that Elliott took 83 yards for his first touchdown of the day. He had blockers helping him down the sideline, but his long speed was evident as he blew by the Steelers' defense. The second quarter and much of the third quarter slowed down a bit, as the 2 teams traded 2 field goals each to give the Steelers an 18-16 lead with a couple of minutes left in the third quarter. That's when Dak Prescott made 1 of the best plays of his career so far, as he eluded a heavy pass rush and hit Dez Bryant for a 50-yard touchdown. Prescott started off slowly in this 1. He missed a few throws and lost an early fumble, but he never lost his poise and came on strong, leading his team on 7 scoring drives. He completed 22-of-32 passes for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns, and has firmly taken control of the starting quarterback job over Tony Romo. Roethlisberger and the Steelers came back after the Bryant touchdown and retook the lead with a 1.yard rushing touchdown for Le'Veon Bell with 7:51 left in the game. Bell hadn't scored a touchdown this season, but he managed 2 in this game, plus totaled 134 yards on 17 carries and 9 receptions. He looked unstoppable at times as he stood at the line just waiting for a crease, which he would then explode through. He is fun to watch. That Bell touchdown put the Steelers up 24-23, as they missed yet another 2.point conversion. It was again time for the Cowboys with 7:51 left in the game, and they methodically drove down the field with their mammoth offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott navigating behind it. With 2 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys were 14 yards from a touchdown and could easily milk more clock, but the Steelers smartly backed off a bit and let Elliott coast in untouched for a 14-yard touchdown. This fact could be debated, as the Cowboys' offensive line can make any team look like they are giving up, but it was the best play for the Steelers, and it looked like they let him score. That touchdown gave Dallas a 29-24 lead and allowed the Steelers a minute and 55 seconds to move back down the field for the win, which they did, but too quickly. Roethlisberger and company had no trouble moving the ball down field, and then Roethlisberger pulled a Dan Marino and faked a clock-killing spike only to toss a beautiful 15-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Ezekiel Elliott began gashing the Ravens' worn-down defense, while Prescott made all of the throws he needed to. The Ravens appeared to have a chance in the 4.h quarter after scoring a touchdown, but the Cowboys held possession for about 7 minutes on a soul-crushing drive that culminated with a field goal, making the margin 10 points with less than 2 minutes remaining in regulation. Thus, Dallas was able to prevail by double digits despite playing poorly for a half, which shows just how good they are.    Remember how I said Prescott began 4-of-10 for 31 yards? Well, he finished 27-of-36 for 301 yards and 3 touchdowns, meaning he was an unreal 23-of-26 for 270 yards and 3 scores following that slow start. Considering how utterly confused Prescott was in the opening quarter, it's insane that he was able to rebound like he did. Almost every single rookie quarterback in NFL history would've continued to struggle, but Prescott and the coaching staff figured things out and were able to thrive afterward.    Elliott, meanwhile, failed to eclipse the century mark, but he did finished with 97 yards on 25 carries, running extremely well in the second half, especially on the final offensive drive I referenced earlier. He also caught 4 passes for 30 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Ezekiel Elliott was a monster. He pushed forward for 116 yards on 29 carries, growing stronger as the afternoon progressed. He converted 4.h-and-1 twice, though the second 1 came with some controversy. Elliott appeared to be stuffed, but replay review showed that he extended his arm past the first-down marker. Still, considering he wasn't down, he should have been ruled short because he pulled the ball back and then hit the ground. It was a confusing sequence, and it gave the Cowboys a touchdown, but the Packers won in the end, so it doesn't really matter.    The other 2 stars, "

   "comment":"Ezekiel Elliott scored 2 extra points because of a pair of point-after-touchdown attempts?    This historic NFL rivalry wasn't competitive, as the Cowboys controlled this contest from start to finish to end their 2.game losing streak. They needed this game coming off their bye to help get their season righted and remain in the NFC East race with Philadelphia and Washington. The 49ers have lost a lot of close games this year, but this game was a complete domination of San Francisco.    Early in the first quarter, diminutive 49ers rookie Trent Taylor fumbled a punt return that Dallas recovered to be set up at the 49ers' 20-yard line. Ezekiel Elliott bolted up the middle on 3 carries to find the end zone. Shortly later, Elliott scored again, this time from 25 yards out. The 49ers answered with a field-goal drive where "
