   "comment":"Coleman helmet-to-helmet hit on Austin Collie, who was knocked out with a concussion. I know many Eagles fans who were angered about this and felt like it shouldn't have been a penalty. I completely disagree. Coleman could have seriously injured Collie, and should absolutely be suspended. There's no room for this crap in the NFL. The second, which also infuriated Philly fans, was a penalty on the Eagles for a blow to the helmet on Manning that gave Indianapolis a first down in the 4.h quarter. The call was legitimate; it's part of the rules. You can't have your quarterbacks getting hurt; if the NFL has guys like Manning, "

   "comment":"Coleman easily picked it off. The 4.h pick, which ultimately led to Grossman's benching, was a pass thrown late across his body, which was also intercepted by Coleman. Grossman finished 9-of-22 for 143 yards and the quartet of picks. Beck was much better in relief, going 8-of-15 for 117 yards and a rushing touchdown. The BYU alumnus definitely needs to start next week. Grossman has gotten worse every single week this year.    It was really surprising that the Redskins weren't able to run the ball against the Eagles. "
