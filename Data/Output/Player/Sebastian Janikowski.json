   "comment":"Janikowski sent the opening kickoff short, and Percy Harvin set up the Vikings in good field position at their 32-yard line. However, left tackle Charlie Johnson forgot that false starts are for visiting teams indoors. The loss was crucial as a pass on 3rd-and-5 to Kyle Rudolph came up a yard short. After a good punt backed the Raiders up, the defense gave up a first down then killed Oakland's first drive with a sack by Chad Greenway. Christian Ponder (19-of-33 for 211 yards 2 TD 3 INT) has a chance to be a good player and his scrambling ability is a big reason why. He ran 5 times for 71 yards in the game, but came up on the short end because the pass rush was effective in getting him out of rhythm. The Raiders came up with 5 sacks even with Richard Seymour out of the lineup; not to mention Matt Shaughnessy sitting on injured reserve. Tommy Kelly had the first drive stopped with a sack, but clipped Ponder's face mask while taking him down for a 15-yard penalty. Another personal foul, this 1 a questionable call on linebacker Aaron Curry, who merely hit Rudolph squarely after a short gain, set up the Vikings in plus territory. Harvin had a sweet 35-yard touchdown run negated by a hold on wide receiver Michael Jenkins, but the drive still ended with a score thanks in part to another 15-yard penalty on Oakland's defense, this 1 a face mask on Tyvon Branch. Adrian Peterson's 12-yard run made it 7-0 on a drive that covered 77 yards including 45 on defensive penalties, which you knew if you read this paragraph carefully. The Raiders' offense took over with 5:07 left in the first quarter at their own 45-yard line after a great return by speedy rookie running back Taiwan Jones. Three consecutive drives would start close to midfield starting with this 1. and all of them resulted in scores. This is when the Silver and Black took this game by the throat, and they needed all of the lead they built up. The first march ended in a field goal and was highlighted by a 20-yard run by Marcel matchup nightmare Reece who ran 6 times for 45 yards on the game and caught 2 passes for 16 yards. Leading 7-3, Minnesota was backed up when Desmond Bryant sacked Ponder. Peterson ran up the middle for 12 yards, but left injured. Ponder's long run of 28 yards converted the third down, but this was clearly a turning point as the first quarter ended. Former Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart ran 7 times for just 18 yards in relief of All Day and did not take advantage of a defense giving up a lot of rushing yards this season. On 3rd-and-5 from the Oakland 21, Ponder was intercepted by Matt Giordano on a pass intended for Harvin, who was the only consistent offensive threat for the Vikings. He ran 5 times for 21 yards and caught 6 passes for 73 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. The big return by Giordano led to another short field and the Raiders marched right down it. When they were finally forced to third down, Carson Palmer hit oft-injured wide receiver Chaz Schilens for an 11-yard touchdown to give Oakland a 10-7 lead. They would never trail again. Minnesota took advantage of another short Janikowski kickoff and quickly drove to scoring range, but botched a field goal attempt. "

   "comment":"Janikowski made it 3-0 on a 40-yard field goal. The Bears needed to lean on the running game with a backup quarterback, but Matt Forte lost 3 yards to start their next drive, which went 3.and-out. He was mostly bottled up on the afternoon, collecting just 84 yards on 18 touches with a huge chunk (33 yards) coming on 1 carry. Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead. The aforementioned long run by Forte (33 yards) put the Bears in plus territory, but on third down, Hanie threw another interception with "

   "comment":"Janikowski at their disposal, this failure cost them 3 points they would desperately need later. Oakland's next drive began with a run from Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. He rumbled down the sidelines for 56 yards, but stepped out of bounds after 26. Jim Schwartz smartly threw the challenge flag and got back the yardage. When Cliff Avril sacked Palmer, it looked like the Lions would stop the drive, but he was flagged for a horse collar. Chris Houston drew a flag on the very next play for illegal contact, and 1 play later, Stephen Tulloch was nailed for yet another horse collar. The penalties set the Raiders up at the Detroit 12, and Louis Murphy ran it in for a touchdown on a reverse for the game's first score. The Lions answered with a touchdown drive that started off with small gains and ended with a bomb to Calvin Johnson (9-214, 2 TDs) for the 51-yard tying score. Megatron regularly made big plays against a defense that seemed confused about his status as an elite force of nature. After an exchange of punts, Oakland started to open up the passing game, which was open against a defense weakened by the loss of free safety Chris Harris. Darrius Heyward-Bey had a 35-yard gain to bail the Raiders out of poor field position, and then he caught a 43-yard touchdown to put Oakland back on top 14-7. Heyward-Bey (8-155 yards, TD) broke loose from Chris Houston's attempt to knock him over and sprinted to the end zone. Another exchange of punts, Detroit got its offense in gear again. Johnson was covered by Rolando McClain and responded with a 17-yard reception. Even after Tommy Kelly put the Raiders' defense in a hole with an offsides penalty, Oakland was able to force a third down. Johnson was the man again, this time on a 6-yard reception. One play later, Stafford went deep to Nate Burleson for a 39-yard score to tie the game. I immediately felt that the Lions scored too quickly, leaving a minute for an Oakland defense known for scoring late in halves this season. Palmer threw on 6 consecutive plays, completing 4 throws for 45 yards. Bush picked up 6 more yards on a run right up the middle, and Janikowski's 46-yard field goal put the Raiders up 17-14 at halftime. The third quarter was a mess for both offenses. Oakland struggled to convert third downs (1-of-9) the entire game, and even though Detroit was effective (8-of-17), they did most of their damage on big scoring plays. "

   "comment":"Janikowski came in to put Oakland up 3-0 very early. On Kansas City's first possession, Thomas Jones went right up the middle for 22 yards on the second play from scrimmage. It was by far the longest run of the game by either team though, and after that, Jones (11-51) and Jackie Battle (14-56) combined for just 85 yards on 24 carries for a 3.54 yard average. In other words, both run defenses stepped up in what felt like a playoff game, albeit a wild card, atmosphere. Jones was stopped on the next play, and 2 incompletions later, the Chiefs were punting. At least Dustin Colquitt trapped the Raiders at their own 3-yard line. Oakland battled its way out of poor field position, but the always-entertaining Carson Palmer threw while being hit, and his pass went right at Derrick Johnson for the easy interception. Earlier in the drive, Johnson had fallen down to allow a 17-yard pickup by Bush on a screen, so it was a bit of redemption for him. Kansas City small-balled its way on the next drive toward the end zone after starting at the Raiders' 36. All 8 plays were for gains, but none covered more than 7 yards. The march stalled inside the 10, a familiar failure for this offense all season, and Ryan Succop tied the game at 3. After an exchange of punts took the game into the second quarter, Oakland had a very Oakland sequence. Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by "

However, Richard Goodman returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to provide San Diego with a 21-10 cushion. The Raiders, of course, turned to Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. Palmer found him down the middle for 22 yards, and after some short gains, another Janikowski field goal trimmed the lead to 21-13. The Chargers' offense never let off the pedal (463 total yards) in this 1 though. In 5 plays, they were at the Oakland 33-yard line. The defense held, forcing 3 straight San Diego incompletions, but Nova's long field goal put the Chargers ahead 24-13. Typically, the Raiders would answer in a 2.minute drill, having done so all year. This looked like no exception when Heyward-Bey caught a pass for a gain of 23 followed by a 9-yard pass to Bush, but with 11 seconds left and no timeouts to stop the clock, Palmer inexplicably completed a short pass to Murphy for a gain of 6. Instead of a long, but certainly makeable 55-yard field goal attempt, Oakland entered the locker room for halftime to a chorus of boos from the home fans. The offenses kept piling up stats in the second half, but field goals never beat touchdowns. Palmer dropped a bomb to "

That put the Raiders up 24-7 at half. A 17-point lead is always nice to have at halftime, but those numbers seemed even more daunting when you realize that Newton had completed just 3 passes on 12 attempts in the first half. The Raiders got the ball to start the second half, and quickly, disaster struck as Derek Carr dislocated his right pinkie while fumbling a snap. That mangled pinkie was the spark the Panthers needed, because they then went on to score 3 touchdowns in the third quarter, 2 short Jonathan Stewart runs and a 88-yard score from Newton to Ted Ginn Jr. The Panthers had turned a 17-point deficit into a 1-point lead by the end of the third quarter, and they weren't done yet. After Carr left the game, Matt McGloin came in for the next possession. He wasn't able to move the ball, and by the time the Raiders got the ball back, the Panthers had scored 2 touchdowns and were only down by 4 points. If Carolina hadn't have scored so quickly, we might not have seen Carr back in this game, but as his lead had disappeared, he came back in with a glove on his throwing hand and promptly threw an interception, which led to Stewart's second rushing touchdown of the day. Now in the 4.h quarter, Newton struck again with a 44-yard touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin to give the Panthers a 32-24 lead. At this point, the Raiders had given up 4 unanswered touchdowns, lost a 17-point lead, and their star quarterback was hurting. Things did not look good for the home team. Carr had the glove on and couldn't take snaps from center, but he lined up in the shotgun and started the work to bring his team back. He methodically led his offense down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clive Walford. Then, Carr hit Seth Roberts for the 2.point conversion to tie the game midway through the 4.h quarter. The Panthers then stalled at midfield, and coach Ron Rivera opted to punt on 4.h-and-1 with 5 minutes left in the game. This was a decision that Riverboat Ron probably wants back. Carr then promptly moved his team down the field again, hitting Michael Crabtree twice, which Crabtree turned into great receptions; the last taking the Raiders down to the 5-yard line where Janikowski kicked a field goal to give his team the lead with 1:45 left on the clock. Newton had plenty of time to move his team down the field, but "

   "comment":"Janikowski field goal, and then, to cap it off with less than a minute before half, Khalil Mack picked off a Cam Newton screen pass and waltzed into the end zone for a 6-yard interception return for a touchdown. That put the Raiders up 24-7 at half. A 17-point lead is always nice to have at halftime, but those numbers seemed even more daunting when you realize that Newton had completed just 3 passes on 12 attempts in the first half. The Raiders got the ball to start the second half, and quickly, disaster struck as Derek Carr dislocated his right pinkie while fumbling a snap. That mangled pinkie was the spark the Panthers needed, because they then went on to score 3 touchdowns in the third quarter, 2 short Jonathan Stewart runs and a 88-yard score from Newton to Ted Ginn Jr. The Panthers had turned a 17-point deficit into a 1-point lead by the end of the third quarter, and they weren't done yet. After Carr left the game, Matt McGloin came in for the next possession. He wasn't able to move the ball, and by the time the Raiders got the ball back, the Panthers had scored 2 touchdowns and were only down by 4 points. If Carolina hadn't have scored so quickly, we might not have seen Carr back in this game, but as his lead had disappeared, he came back in with a glove on his throwing hand and promptly threw an interception, which led to Stewart's second rushing touchdown of the day. Now in the 4.h quarter, Newton struck again with a 44-yard touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin to give the Panthers a 32-24 lead. At this point, the Raiders had given up 4 unanswered touchdowns, lost a 17-point lead, and their star quarterback was hurting. Things did not look good for the home team. Carr had the glove on and couldn't take snaps from center, but he lined up in the shotgun and started the work to bring his team back. He methodically led his offense down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clive Walford. Then, Carr hit Seth Roberts for the 2.point conversion to tie the game midway through the 4.h quarter. The Panthers then stalled at midfield, and coach Ron Rivera opted to punt on 4.h-and-1 with 5 minutes left in the game. This was a decision that Riverboat Ron probably wants back. Carr then promptly moved his team down the field again, hitting Michael Crabtree twice, which Crabtree turned into great receptions; the last taking the Raiders down to the 5-yard line where Janikowski kicked a field goal to give his team the lead with 1:45 left on the clock. Newton had plenty of time to move his team down the field, but "

   "comment":"Janikowski's attempts, but in the end, it didn't really matter. Carr finished with absolutely dreadful numbers. He was 17-of-41 for only 117 yards. He was victimized by numerous drops, but he looked like a shell of his former self because of his injury, and once again, if things don't get better in that regard, the Raiders could lose their next 4 games. They're known for their dynamic offense, so it's going to be difficult for them to have any success averaging just 3.3 yards per play like they did in this divisional affair.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, have moved into first place of the AFC West in the wake of this victory, thanks to their season-sweep tie-breaker over the Raiders. However, they can't be feeling too good right now because of "
