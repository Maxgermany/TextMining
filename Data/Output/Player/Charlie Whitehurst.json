   "comment":"Whitehurst stepped in and immediately threw a couple of touchdowns, but struggled mightily in the second half. His inability to move the chains allowed the Browns to mount an amazing comeback, transforming a 28-3 deficit into a 1.point victory. Locker got X-rays on his thumb - it appeared as though he either suffered a concussion or hurt his shoulder at first glance - and they came back negative. He'll have an MRI on Monday. He'll need to return as quickly as possible because Whitehurst is completely inept. While Locker was 8-of-11 for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing), Whitehurst was just 11-of-18 for 108 yards following intermission. As mentioned, Whitehurst had some scores early, but it didn't take the Browns very long to figure him out. Locker, meanwhile, was much more effective on the ground (4 scrambles, 34 rushing yards) and his only mistake in nearly a half of action was overthrowing a potential score to "

   "comment":"Whitehurst. The most important aspect of this contest was the other quarterback, as Blake Bortles had a decent outing. Bortles went 32-of-46 for 336 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick came late in Tennessee territory, but it wasn't the rookie's fault because Allen Hurns slipped on the play. Bortles shook off the turnover and led his team down the field for a touchdown. The Jaguars recovered the ensuing onside kick and suddenly found themselves in field goal range, thanks to a pair of Bortles completions, but Josh Scobee's 55-yard attempt was blocked. This might be the best possible outcome for the Jaguars. Some of their young players stepped up, but they still managed to lose a crucial game for drafting position. Not only does this loss give them a better pick, but Tennessee's victory moves a divisional rival into a worse position.    The Jaguars once again struggled to run the ball, as Bortles actually led the team in rushing with 38 yards on 5 scrambles. Storm Johnson started in place of Toby Gerhart, but he proved to be a disappointment. He mustered only 21 yards on 10 carries, but salvaged his fantasy afternoon with a touchdown on a short plunge into the end zone.    Bortles' sole score went to Clay Harbor, who had a 59-yard gain early when he beat Michael Griffin. Cecil Shorts, meanwhile, paced the team with 10 catches for 103 receiving yards. Shorts had a whopping 16 targets, but hurt his team by losing a fumble in Tennessee territory. Allen Robinson pitched in with 8 grabs for 68 yards.    The Titans planned to feature their own rookie, Bishop Sankey, as Shonn Greene was out with an injury. Sankey was stuffed twice on the opening drive, but ultimately finished with 61 yards on 18 carries, thanks to a 22-yard burst. Unfortunately, Jackie Battle vultured a touchdown away from Sankey. That was Battle's only carry. Ken Whisenhunt must hate all Sankey fantasy owners.    Whitehurst wasn't bad, as he went 17-of-28 for 233 yards. Then again, all other quarterbacks have dominated Jacksonville's putrid back 7. so perhaps that stat line would indicate a poor outing. Whitehurst and Whisenhunt screwed up on 1 occasion, using a timeout on 4.h-and-2 at the Jacksonville 3-yard line when they initially planned to go for it. They lined up for a field goal following the stoppage, so why did they call timeout in the first place? It didn't end up mattering, but this type of coaching blunder could prove costly in future games.    "

   "comment":"Whitehurst on the final play of the game. Not only did he claim more than half-a-million bucks against his former team; he stopped a Tennessee drive right in its tracks to give Jacksnville its third victory of the season.    As for the Titans, I'm surprised by how well Whitehurst played. It appeared as though he was going to ruin Tennessee's chances of landing either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as he opened the game with a 6-of-6, 71-yard, touchdown-drive. Whitehurst continued to shred Jacksonville's secondary throughout the evening, finishing 24-of-35 for 287 yards and the score to Washington, but he couldn't get his team into the end zone again. Simple mistakes disrupted drives all evening, though Whitehurst was responsible for throwing short on a crucial 4.h down in the middle of the final quarter. His receiver had to come back from the ball and was consequently tackled short of the marker.    Washington who was playing in his home town, was second on the team in receiving, as he caught all 7 of his targets for 62 yards and the touchdown. "
