  "comment":"Matt Barkley self-destructing. Barkley, who threw 8 interceptions in the past 2 games heading into this contest, continued to be a turnover machine, adding 2 to his dubious total. Barkley's first pick occurred when he forced a poor pass into coverage when he had an underneath receiver open in the red zone. He did the same thing after halftime, once again deep in Minnesota territory. Barkley capped off his afternoon with strip-sack that was returned for a touchdown. Barkley misfired on only 4 occasions, going 10-of-14 for 125 yards. That's not bad, but the 3 give-aways obviously need to be taken into account. Barkley played well several weeks ago, but he has transformed into a turnover machine. He might still have a role as a No. 2 quarterback in this league, but he really needs to work on being more careful with the football.    The 1 piece of good news for the Bears is that ",
