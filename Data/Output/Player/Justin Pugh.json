   "comment":"Pugh sustained an injury in the first quarter. Still, the Giants had just 2 positive drives that didn't come off Philadelphia turnovers on the afternoon. Eli Manning finished 22-of-36 for 257 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He was nearly picked a third time by McLeod, but the ball barely hit the ground. Manning struggled following halftime, going 7-of-14 for 82 yards and 2 picks. Neither interception was really his fault, however, as the first 1 occurred when Nolan Carroll ripped the ball out of Beckham's hands. The other was tipped by Connor Barwin and snatched in the air by Jordan Hicks, who made a very athletic play. Still, this set up the Eagles for a short drive to potentially take the lead, but Wentz couldn't get the job done.    Beckham caught 2 of Manning's touchdowns, but had just 4 grabs for 46 yards. Beckham missed a drive when he took a helmet to the arm, but ended up being fine. Sterling Shepard (3-50) led the Giantsin receiving and hauled in the other touchdown, while Victor Cruz, who caught just 1 pass for 46 yards, sprained his ankle in the second quarter.    The Giants struggled to run the ball, which wasn't surprising at all with Pugh out of the lineup. Both "

   "comment":"Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive. That happened to clinch the spread victory; Manning took advantage of Slay's absence by connecting to "

Beckham dropped a pass in the third quarter, but he should've caught a touchdown, as Manning overthrew him in the final frame. Shepard and Victor Cruz were targeted a ton as well, which isn't a surprise considering that Manning threw the ball 63 times. Shepard (7-61) hauled in Manning's sole touchdown, while Cruz caught 8 balls for 84 yards.    The Giants ran better than expected once again, thanks in part to Pugh's return. "
