It seems like Booker will be the lead back going forward, but he should not be anything more than a high-upside FLEX most weeks.    For the Saints, this has to have been a frustrating game. They did everything they could to make a late comeback, but they came up short. A good chunk of that effort was led by the performance of "

Jacksonville's defense played well overall once again, but as is the case every week, the unit was betrayed by Bortles, who was horrendous as ever. I actually expected Bortles to throw 2 pick-sixes against 1 of the NFL's elite defenses, but he at least gave us 1. It was Bortles' 11th pick-six in 3 years. I have Jacksonville taking Lamar Jackson in my , which was updated this weekend. Bortles failed to complete half of his passes, going 19-of-42 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. He also lost a fumble to end the game. Bortles' first pick wasn't his fault because "
