This would have been a good game to go with Tim Tebow and use his portion of the offense. Tebow had a 22-yard run, but that was his 1 and only carry and he didn't throw any passes.

What was the point of trading the pick and spending time in practice on that portion of the offense if the team isn't going to use it? This is suspect coaching from Rex Ryan and Tony Sparano.

   "comment":"Powell, who was thrown to 13 times. Powell accumulated 8 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Powell didn't do much on the ground, which was expected. Chris Ivory gained 47 yards on 10 carries. He was given just 3 attempts after intermission because the Jets were behind so much and had to go into catch-up mode. It's a shame, as Ivory looked great, aside from his fumble. There was 1 carry where he broke 3 tackles and made a nasty spin move to pick up a 20-yard gain. The Giants were guilty of horrid tackling early on.    The Giants, meanwhile, screwed up as well. They seemed to be gifted a victory, but they threw it all away, beginning with Manning's interception. After that, Odell Beckham couldn't locate a deep pass and then was flagged for kicking the ball out of frustration. This was capped off by a 48-yard missed field goal in overtime to give the Jets the win.    "

He ran for 25 yards and a touchdown on just 6 attempts, and he also was a big part of the passing game once again, snatching 7 catches for 54 receiving yards.    As for the Cowboys, they benched Cassel in the second quarter after a very ugly performance. Cassel was just 3-of-8 for 37 yards and an interception that was so horrible that the officials ruled it as intentional grounding. Following a 19-yard loss on a sack, Jason Garrett made the change, moving to Kellen Moore, who was better, but only by default. Moore went 15-of-25 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Moore is severely limited and seemed overmatched. One of his picks was a desperation heave at the end, but Moore's other 2 interception were ugly. The first was a weak throw that he heaved up for grabs, while the second was telegraphed in the end zone. Moore hit some of his targets and moved the chains on occasion, but he's not an NFL-caliber quarterback.    "

   "comment":"Powell stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 at the Miami 47. The Jets were still down just 13-10 at that point, but the game quickly got away from them because of a blocked punt returned for a touchdown, a failure to pick up Ajayi's aforementioned fumble, and a Petty interception that happened to be a great play by Tony Lippett. The Dolphins managed to prevail, and they are now 9-5. However, they definitely were not as good as this 34-13 margin indicates. If they play like this against a real team, they are going to lose.    Matt Moore had nothing to do with Miami's struggles. In fact, he was 1 of the best offensive players the team had on the field on this particular evening. Moore misfired on just 6 attempts, going 12-of-18 for 236 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Moore was lucky to get away with a dropped pick in the first half, but he ate the Jets' secondary alive, as New York sent ineffective blitzes at him, exposing its horrible defensive backfield as a result. Moore's sole interception came on an underthrown pass. Now, before anyone gets excited, it needs to be noted that Moore was battling 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. We'll see what happens against legitimate NFL personnel.    Moore hit some big plays to Jarvis Landry and Kenny Stills for gains of 66 and 52 yards, respectively. Both scored touchdowns, as Landry eclipsed the century mark with 3 catches for 108 yards. Dion Sims (4-31) snatched a pair of scores.    Jay Ajayi and DeVante Parker had disappointing showings for their fantasy owners in the semi-finals. Ajayi managed just 51 yards on 19 carries and was lucky that his fumble bounced into the hands of a teammate, as some Jet players were in the area. Parker, meanwhile, secured only 1 of his 3 targets for 17 yards.    The Jets weren't given much of a chance in this game for numerous reasons, 1 of which was Petty. The Baylor product made some nice plays early despite being hurt by drops from Austin Seferian-Jenkins, Brandon Marshall and Quincy Enunwa. Petty led the Jets on an impressive opening drive to lead 7-0, but it all went downhill from there. As mentioned, Petty was strip-sacked and picked inside the Miami 30-yard line in the first half. Petty was intercepted again later, and then he overthrew Marshall for a big gain and a potential touchdown. Petty's night ended when he was sandwiched by 2 brutal tackles by Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake. Both players were able to flood the backfield quickly because the ball was snapped too early. Petty actually completed a deep pass on the play, but he was taken into the locker room. He finished 20-of-36 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and a pair of picks. Ryan Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way, and he went 5-of-10 for 31 yards. If Petty is out next week, that could force the Jets to actually activate Christian Hackenberg. It's a bit puzzling why Hackenberg hasn't been given any regular-season snaps yet. The front office needs to find out what they have in him prior to the offseason. If Petty is hurt, starting Fitzpatrick would be a huge mistake.    New York's top player in this game was Bilal Powell, who had a huge performance. Powell didn't find the end zone, but he handled most of the workload despite "

I don't understand this game plan, but once again, Bowles' hospitalization needs to be brought up as a possible explanation.    No Jet eclipsed 30 passing yards. In fact, Marshall and Powell were the only players on the team to catch more than 1 pass. Marshall's 2 receptions went for just 28 yards.    This game was not entertaining, so at least we were able to hear official Gene Steratore get caught with his mic on saying something very strange: Get a towel. Did you put any of that warm-skin s**t on your hands? I feel like that's something that has been said in Matt Millen's hotel room.   "

The officials reviewed it and upheld the call, which was inexplicable because there seemed to be no way he could've fallen down without being touched by a defender. Eli McGuire, playing for an injured Matt Forte, had a 69-yard rushing touchdown of his own. Powell had a ridiculous performance, gaining 163 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. And to think, Todd Bowles was using Forte over him when the veteran was healthy. McGuire (10-93) didn't do much outside of his long run.    "

   "comment":"Powell left the game early with a calf injury, which would explain why he had just 5 yards on 2 carries. Eli McGuire handled the workload in Powell's absence, but struggled, mustering only 20 yards on 11 attempts.    Going back to the Browns, Njoku had a nice performance. I mentioned earlier that Kizer didn't see him wide open for a touchdown. Njoku compensated for it later when he made a 1.handed catch in the end zone to give Cleveland its first lead of the season. Njoku made a great diving catch to put the Browns in Jets territory later in the second half. He caught 3 balls for 48 yards and the score. "
