   "comment":"Kyle Long committed a personal-foul penalty to negate a 15-yard play, and then a botched snap between Mitchell Trubisky and the center was returned for a touchdown. This sparked the Lions, while the Bears mustered just 7 points after that. Trubisky made some very poor throws in the second half. Prior to the final drive of the afternoon, Trubisky had just 4 completions following intermission. There was 1 drive in which Chicago took over with great field position, but went 3.and-out because of a pair of horrible Trubisky throws. However, Trubisky was able to lead Chicago into field-goal range with an impressive final possession. "
