We didn't know what the play clock was, or what the score was, or anything, Edwards said.    Viewers who wanted to see the game couldn't do so until there was 7 minutes remaining in the first half because some balloons hit a power line. That's not a joke. Power went out again 5 minutes later, and was up and running again in the third quarter. The poor people who were looking forward to this game were treated to a Bengals-Steelers snooze-fest instead. Not cool. Whoever brought those balloons to the stadium should be banned for life.    "
