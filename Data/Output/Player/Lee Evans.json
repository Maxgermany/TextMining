We didn't know what the play clock was, or what the score was, or anything, Edwards said.    Viewers who wanted to see the game couldn't do so until there was 7 minutes remaining in the first half because some balloons hit a power line. That's not a joke. Power went out again 5 minutes later, and was up and running again in the third quarter. The poor people who were looking forward to this game were treated to a Bengals-Steelers snooze-fest instead. Not cool. Whoever brought those balloons to the stadium should be banned for life.    "

   "comment":"Evans had no catches last week. The offensive line couldn't block. Yet, the Chiefs surrendered 54 points? Nice job with all of those draft picks you accumulated by trading Jared Allen! It's too bad the NFL isn't like college football in terms of being able to schedule your non-divisional foes; otherwise, I'd recommend every non-AFC West team to pencil in Kansas City in the middle of the season. They're the ultimate cure for any offensive woes!    While Buffalo's offense was unstoppable - the Bills punted only twice - Kansas City helped the opposition score as well. Tyler Thigpen, who had been playing brilliantly until Sunday, threw 2 picks and fumbled once. Still, Thigpen was able to lead the Chiefs to 24 points (the final 7 came from Quinn Gray). Thigpen was 17-of-31 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Thigpen located Tony Gonzalez a whopping 10 times for 113 yards and a score. Dwayne Bowe managed 3 grabs for 58 yards and a touchdown. Mark Bradley chipped in with 52 yards and a score.    Larry Johnson rushed for 81 yards on just 7 carries. Sounds insane, but 63 of those yards came on 1 attempt.    As indicated earlier, Edwards' struggles were cured against Kansas City's pathetic defense. Edwards finished 24-of-32 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Lee Evans and Josh Reed caught 5 passes each."
