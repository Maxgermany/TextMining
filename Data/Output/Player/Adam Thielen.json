   "comment":"Adam Thielen had a huge performance. He caught 5 balls for 98 yards and a touchdown, his first of the year. Thielen also drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone to set up a rushing touchdown. And speaking of pass interferences, Diggs drew 2 of them downfield, which would explain why his stat line - 4 catches, 27 yards - was so disappointing. Diggs was close to having a big game, and he should've had a nice catch in the 4.h quarter, but incompetent officiating ruled that he didn't secure the ball prior to falling out of bounds (even though it was fairly obvious that he did.) At any rate, Keenum's other touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Adam Thielen to get him into open space. Keenum also did well to find players in the red zone, and he made a pretty throw to Stefon Diggs for a score. Overall, Keenum ended up going 21-of-29 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The picks came late in the game, 1 on a lofted pass that he threw into double coverage, and another where he stared down the receiver and allowed D.J. Swearinger to undercut the route. These mistakes were emblematic of why Keenum shouldn't be counted on as an every-day starter for a Super Bowl contender. But, like Ryan Fitzpatrick, he could become 1 of the best spot starters in the league while he is in his prime.    Keenum's top receivers during the contest were Adam Thielen (8-166, 1 TD) and Stefon Diggs (4-78, 1 TD). The 2 were able to break away from the Washington corners seemingly all day. In particular, Thielen looked very good, as he made a couple of tough grabs, and also had a long catch that saw him catch the ball in space and use his speed to shred the defense. He can be started as a high-upside FLEX play most weeks. Meanwhile, Diggs was efficient, catching all but 1 of his targets, and he looks healthy again. He can be counted on as a WR2 for the rest of the year. Elsewhere, "
