   "comment":"Adam Thielen muffed a punt. The Cowboys recovered, and 1 play later, Prescott found Thielen muffed a punt. The Cowboys recovered, and 1 play later, Prescott found Dez Bryant for what would turn out to be the game-winning touchdown. Minnesota would reach the end zone to cover the spread with 25 seconds remaining, but missed on the 2.point conversion because right tackle Jeremiah Sirles was guilty of a false start. On the actual play, the officials missed an obvious blow to the head on Bradford.    It's a shame for the Vikings that they lost because they had a great defensive game plan against the Cowboys. Elliott was limited to 90 rushing yards for the first time since Week 2. Elliott gained 86 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, but 30 of his yards came on 1 attempt. He otherwise was limited to 56 yards on 19 tries. He also had a fumble overturned by replay, as mentioned. Granted, Elliott had a long burst negated by penalty, but Minnesota did a great job tackling him for minimal gains.    The Vikings also restricted Prescott to a season-low passing yardage total. Prescott went just 12-of-18 for 139 yards and a touchdown to go along with 37 rushing yards on 6 scrambles. He was guilty of 2 fumbles, 1 of which was lost. He still made some great plays - a 14-yard run of his on a third-and-13 set up the first touchdown - but he definitely didn't look like himself because of Minnesota's terrific defense.    Elliott's sole score went to Bryant, who caught 4 passes for 84 yards and the decisive touchdown. Bryant was just 1 of 4 Dallas players to catch passes. The others were Cole Beasley (2-23), Elliott (4-19) and Terrance Williams (2-13). Jason Witten didn't log a reception for the first time in 130 games, though he did recover Minnesota's last-gasp onside kick attempt at the end of the game.    Moving on to the Vikings, the defensive players have to feel extremely frustrated that their offense let them down once again. The special teams did as well, and I'll get to them later, but Bradford was underwhelming. He made some nice plays, including a third-and-16 conversion to Thielen in the early going. However, he was once again Captain Checkdown, going 32-of-45 for only 247 yards and a touchdown. That's a YPA of 5.49, which is trending into Brodie Croyle territory. He was also picked off on 1 occasion, but that was negated by a penalty. Bradford had some ugly checkdowns, where he tossed a 1-yard pass on third-and-6 and then hurled a 6-yard throw on third-and-18 with 7 minutes remaining. Bradford had "

   "comment":"Adam Thielen to win the game at the very end. The defense was very impressive in this contest. I know they were going against Thielen to win the game at the very end. The defense was very impressive in this contest. I know they were going against Case Keenum, but the unit was missing Jarrad Davis (concussion).    Matthew Stafford finished 19-of-31 for 209 yards. He refrained from throwing an interception, but with some luck, as a couple of Minnesota defenders dropped the ball. Stafford didn't have much time in the pocket, as he often had to use his mobility to escape sacks. On 1 occasion, he did this and found a receiver to convert a third down. He then hit Marvin Jones for 38 yards on a third-and-17 to set up a field goal.    With the Detroit receivers dealing with a tough secondary, the Lions focused on involving Abdullah as much as possible, and it paid off. Abdullah gained 94 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, with a big chunk of his output coming on a 20-yard burst in the first half.    Marvin Jones (2-42) and Golden Tate (3-29) both posted lackluster figures. Jones had to deal with Xavier Rhodes, so this lackluster showing was predictable.    As for the Vikings, Keenum took a major step backward from last week's performance. Keenum wasn't playing a skeleton-crew defense this time, and it showed. He went 16-of-30 for 219 yards. He began the game with a terrific back-shoulder throw to Thielen for 24 yards, but he had a meltdown following intermission. Keenum was just 8-of-17 for 100 yards after halftime despite "

Thielen also drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone to set up a rushing touchdown. And speaking of pass interferences, Diggs drew 2 of them downfield, which would explain why his stat line - 4 catches, 27 yards - was so disappointing. Diggs was close to having a big game, and he should've had a nice catch in the 4.h quarter, but incompetent officiating ruled that he didn't secure the ball prior to falling out of bounds (even though it was fairly obvious that he did.)
