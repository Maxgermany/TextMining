   "comment":"Cox flipped Finley over after a pass-interference call and then stepped on his ankle. It's good to know that Cox is still a scumbag.    It's time to address the aforementioned special-teams gaffe that occurred during Cobb's 75-yard return touchdown. There was a flag on the play, and as soon as Cobb saw it, he sulked in the end zone. There was an obvious block in the back, and it appeared as though the score would be nullified. The officials did, in fact, call a block in the back - on the 49ers. Yep. The Niners, who were punting, were blocking for some reason. These refs are geniuses.    Something else of note on special teams: "
