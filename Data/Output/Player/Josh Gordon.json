Immediately afterward, Weeden heaved an interception into the end zone. Weeden was mostly awful, which has to be especially discouraging for Cleveland fans because the Giants were missing half of their back 7.    Both of Weeden's scores went to Gordon, who caught just those 2 balls for 82 yards. Meanwhile, "

All of the mistakes ruined a very good afternoon for Brandon Weeden, who went 25-of-41 for 264 yards and 2 scores. He should've thrown a third touchdown, but as mentioned, Gordon lost a potential 55-yard score in the sun. Weeden had the luxury of throwing from a clean pocket all afternoon; the Colts couldn't put any pressure on him, as "

   "comment":"Josh Gordon, returning from his 2.game suspension, caught 10 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown. He was an absolute monster, and the Vikings had no answer for him. Perhaps this means that Lombardi will sell high on Gordon and deal him to a team desperate for a receiver like the Patriots. Perhaps he can obtain a second-rounder for him. Gordon's inevitable departure will hurt Hoyer, but the former New England quarterback is solid for now. He went 30-of-54 for 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Hoyer became the first Cleveland quarterback to throw 3 scores in a single game since Brady Quinn in December 2009. One of his picks wasn't his fault, as it was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted deep inside Minnesota territory.    The Browns predictably couldn't run the ball without Richardson.

   "comment":"Josh Gordon down the sideline. This was a rare, quality throw by Campbell, who had a disastrous afternoon after putting together a few good starts. Campbell's numbers don't look completely terrible - he was 27-of-56 for 248 yards and a touchdown - but he also threw 3 interceptions. His yardage was inflated - he had just 65 yards by halftime, so most of his stats came in garbage time - and he spent the entire afternoon throwing either behind or over his receivers. It's remarkable how inaccurate he was after several strong outings.    Dalton, meanwhile, wasn't any better. He threw 3 touchdowns, but that's a misleading stat, as he went 13-of-27 for 93 yards and the 2 aforementioned interceptions otherwise. He simply couldn't get anything going with Haden smothering his favorite receiver. Green finished with just 2 catches for 7 yards. With Green doing nothing, the Bengals' leading receiver, excluding Giovani Bernard, was Jermaine Gresham (2-27, TD), who had a bad drop. Mohamed Sanu and Alex Smith (the tight end) also scored.    The 1 thing Cincinnati was able to do offensively - remember, most of its scores came via the defense and special teams - was run the ball with both BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Bernard. The 2 backs had 16-62 and 10-45 lines, respectively. Bernard, who also had 4 catches for 41 receiving yards, aggravated his rib injury in the second quarter, but was able to gut it out.    The Browns, meanwhile, couldn't run very well, which really hurt them in the second-half monsoon conditions. Ogbonnaya broke a 43-yard run in the first quarter, but he finished with just 26 yards on his other 7 carries. Willis McGahee (6-13) also sucked.    Campbell's lone touchdown went to Josh Gordon (5-125), who caught a long bomb down the sideline. Gordon quit on a route during the prior series, so he's fortunate that Campbell decided to go back to him. Gordon later disappointed yet again, dropping a pass. As for "
