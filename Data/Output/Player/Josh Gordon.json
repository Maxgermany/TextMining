Perhaps this means that Lombardi will sell high on Gordon and deal him to a team desperate for a receiver like the Patriots. Perhaps he can obtain a second-rounder for him. Gordon's inevitable departure will hurt Hoyer, but the former New England quarterback is solid for now. He went 30-of-54 for 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Hoyer became the first Cleveland quarterback to throw 3 scores in a single game since Brady Quinn in December 2009. One of his picks wasn't his fault, as it was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted deep inside Minnesota territory.    The Browns predictably couldn't run the ball without Richardson.

   "comment":"Gordon for a touchdown. Weeden finished 13-of-24 for 197 yards and that score. Of course, the Browns wouldn't have won this game without Travis Benjamin. He had a 57-yard punt return in the first quarter to set up a field goal. He then took back a punt for a touchdown. The Bills were too terrified to kick it to him after that, so they had some short attempts to give Cleveland good field position. As it turned out, the Browns had more yardage on punt returns in the first half than net yardage on offense.    The Browns weren't the only team to lose their starting quarterback. E.J. Manuel banged his knee while going out of bounds in the third quarter. He walked off on his own power, and it appeared as though he'd be able to reenter the game, but Manuel eventually limped off into the locker room. Manuel finished 11-of-20 for 129 yards. Not included in this was a 29-yard pass interference on the opening drive. Manuel threw well when he had a clean pocket, but his accuracy issues were prevalent when he couldn't set his feet. He's incredibly inconsistent, but at least the talent is there. Rookie Jeff Tuel stepped in under center when Manuel exited the contest. Tuel impressed in the preseason, but he was horrendous in his professional debut. His numbers - 8-of-20 for 80 yards and a pick-6 - don't illustrate how bad he was. His lacking arm strength was extremely apparent, as his throws wobbled and fell short of his intended targets. He wasn't accurate in the slightest. Worst of all, he was constantly whining and complaining to his teammates, the coaching staff and the officials.    More injury woes for the Bills: Stevie Johnson had the aforementioned 29-yard pass interference and then caught 2 balls for 19 yards, but he aggravated his hamstring in the second quarter and left the game or good. Rookie wideout Robert Woods led the team with 5 catches and 64 receiving yards.    Both of Buffalo's running backs were iffy to play in this game, but they posted solid fantasy numbers. Most of C.J. Spiller's 66 yards (on 8 carries) came on a 54-yard touchdown to open the second half. Barkevious Mingo couldn't get off a block, and then T.J. Ward missed a tackle to help spring Spiller into the end zone. Fred Jackson was the better player once again, rushing for 53 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 attempts. He also caught 4 balls for 40 receiving yards.    It's hard to believe, but Willis McGahee was the leading rusher in this contest. He had just 1 solid run, which would explain his meager YPC (26 carries, 72 yards). However, he scored a touchdown, so those who started him as a bye-week filler were happy.    Gordon, who also scored, paced the Browns with 86 receiving yards off 4 catches. He had what seemed like a devastating drop on the opening drive that could have been a 90-yard touchdown. Gordon later dropped another pass, but at least he wasn't "

Gordon nearly made a great grab along the sideline in the fourth quarter, but senile official Walt Coleman incorrectly ruled that he was out of bounds, even after watching the replay.    Speaking of Coleman, he flagged the Browns for a horrible roughing-the-passer call late, as well as a pair of bogus pass interferences in the second quarter. "

   "comment":"Gordon down the sideline. This was a rare, quality throw by Campbell, who had a disastrous afternoon after putting together a few good starts. Campbell's numbers don't look completely terrible - he was 27-of-56 for 248 yards and a touchdown - but he also threw 3 interceptions. His yardage was inflated - he had just 65 yards by halftime, so most of his stats came in garbage time - and he spent the entire afternoon throwing either behind or over his receivers. It's remarkable how inaccurate he was after several strong outings.    Dalton, meanwhile, wasn't any better. He threw 3 touchdowns, but that's a misleading stat, as he went 13-of-27 for 93 yards and the 2 aforementioned interceptions otherwise. He simply couldn't get anything going with Haden smothering his favorite receiver. Green finished with just 2 catches for 7 yards. With Green doing nothing, the Bengals' leading receiver, excluding Giovani Bernard, was Jermaine Gresham (2-27, TD), who had a bad drop. Mohamed Sanu and Alex Smith (the tight end) also scored.    The 1 thing Cincinnati was able to do offensively - remember, most of its scores came via the defense and special teams - was run the ball with both BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Bernard. The 2 backs had 16-62 and 10-45 lines, respectively. Bernard, who also had 4 catches for 41 receiving yards, aggravated his rib injury in the second quarter, but was able to gut it out.    The Browns, meanwhile, couldn't run very well, which really hurt them in the second-half monsoon conditions. Ogbonnaya broke a 43-yard run in the first quarter, but he finished with just 26 yards on his other 7 carries. Willis McGahee (6-13) also sucked.    Campbell's lone touchdown went to Josh Gordon (5-125), who caught a long bomb down the sideline. Gordon quit on a route during the prior series, so he's fortunate that Campbell decided to go back to him. Gordon later disappointed yet again, dropping a pass. As for "

They eventually got their act together, and the spark may have been something that occurred late in the second quarter. Geno Smith ran out of bounds after a scamper, and a Cleveland player shoved him when he was well out of the field of play. The official nearest to the action initially didn't throw a flag, which drew the ire of Rex Ryan. The Jets' coach looked like he was going to have a heart attack as he barked at the ref, and upon seeing a flag come in from elsewhere, he then went to the Cleveland defender and yelled at him. This seemed to energize the Jets - Smith in particular, who went 10-of-16 for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. The rookie ultimately finished 20-of-36 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns ((2 passing, 1 rushing) to go along with 48 rushing yards on 10 scrambles.    Chris Ivory also ran well. He gained 109 yards on 20 carries. Bilal Powell chipped in with 54 yards on 7 totes, most of which came on a 39-yard burst in the second half.    As for the Browns, they had success early because Jason Campbell constantly targeted Gordon (6-97). I don't know what the Jets were thinking, but they elected to cover Gordon with "

Hoyer finished 23-of-40 for 322 yards and 3 interceptions (the other was underthrown in the first half). Johnny Manziel might be the better option, as Hoyer has been very sloppy with the football lately. He's a limited player, so he needs to be smarter and stop being so sloppy with the football.    The big story entering this game was that Gordon would be on the field for the first time this year. Hoyer tried to get Gordon involved early by taking a deep shot to him, but he overthrew his No. 1 wideout. Gordon, however, converted a third down deep in his own territory and then proceeded to dominate. He was targeted a whopping 16 times. There were some good moments for him - he caught 8 balls for 120 yards - but Hoyer's 2 second-half picks came while trying to force the issue to him.    Gordon returning opened things up for the other players. "

   "comment":"Gordon weren't on the same page on Cleveland's first passing play of the afternoon. Manziel then had a receiver open, but opted to run for the first down - but came up short of the marker. On the following drive, Mike Pettine had to burn a timeout because the unprepared Manziel couldn't get the team lined up properly. Manziel completed a nice pass to Andrew Hawkins, but injured his hamstring running left for 1 yard. He left the game permanently, finishing just 3-of-8 for 32 yards. Manziel is garbage and just doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL. He could be out of the league in 2 years. Brian Hoyer stepped in for Manziel and gave the team a chance. He actually put the team in the lead on an 81-yard touchdown to Jordan Cameron. Unfortunately, most of Hoyer's other passes were off the mark. He overthrew most of his targets, finishing 7-of-13 for 134 yards, the touchdown to Cameron and an interception late in the game. Hoyer is not the answer either, but unlike Manziel, he can serve as a solid backup in this league.    Cameron, as you can imagine, led the team in receiving with 88 yards and the touchdown on 3 catches. Josh Gordon was next with 45 yards on 4 grabs, but made some mental mistakes.    The Browns didn't get much out of their running game, save for 1 26-yard burst from "
