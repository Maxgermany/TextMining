   "comment":"Chris Clark hold. The right tackle had an abysmal afternoon, as it's clear that the Texans miss Derek Newton.    Moving on to the Jaguars, I mentioned that Bortles self-destructed. The numbers don't show it, as Bortles easily out-passed Osweiler, going 32-of-49 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. As is usually the case with Bortles, however, this was all phantom yardage that occurred late in the game. And yes, if you're wondering, Bortles was actually worse than Osweiler. Bortles was 24-of-34 for only 160 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception by the time the game was 21-10. He gave the game away early with a pick-six. Displaying horrific mechanics, Bortles made a late throw on the outside, and it was taken back the other way, as the Jacksonville players showed very little interest in tackling. Bortles had a second pick that was actually ruled a fumble, as he fired a short, backward pass unnecessarily hard toward Clark hold.
