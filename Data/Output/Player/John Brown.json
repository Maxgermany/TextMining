   "comment":"Brown (4-52). As mentioned, Stanton got away with a couple of interceptions. However, he was very hot in the second half, going 10-of-16 for 161 yards and a pair of scoles following the break. The 49ers helped him out with their dumb mistakes, but it was an impressive second-half performance nonetheless.    Stanton struggled to get the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, as the future Hall of Famer didn't log a single reception until the 4.h quarter for the second time in 3 games. Fitzgerald finally hauled in his 3 targets (for 34 yards) in the final period, but he hurt his team by losing a fumble inside the San Francisco 5-yard line. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Brown to take the lead with 1:21 remaining in regulation. Nick Foles then had his chance and did a good job of moving Philadelphia into the red zone. He fired a pass toward Jordan Matthews for what could've been the decisive score. Matthews caught the ball, but landed out of bounds, giving Arizona the victory in this battle of 5-1 teams. The Eagles were competitive and nearly triumphed, but their offensive game plan was highly questionable. Having Foles attempt 62 passes compared to giving LeSean McCoy just 21 rushes was not a winning formula. Philadelphia never trailed by more than 7 points, so there was no reason not to run McCoy as much, especially considering that he did a good job of picking up yardage on the ground. McCoy gained 83 yards on 21 carries and didn't have a rush of more than 13 yards, so it's not like he had just 1 great burst and did nothing else. McCoy is the team's best player, so giving him just 24 touches - he also had 3 catches for 14 receiving yards - was inexcusable in a game that could potentially determine playoff seeding. Foles, meanwhile, had a mixed night. His numbers look pretty from a fantasy perspective - 36-of-62, 411 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions - but the picks were killers and part of the overall persisting red-zone issues. His fist interception was a telegraphed throw late over the middle of the field. The second was a throw well behind Riley Cooper. Those weren't the only give-aways, as Josh Huff lost a fumble inside the 10-yard line. Had the Eagles converted in the red zone, they would have won easily. However, this has been an ongoing problem for them all year. They just can't find the end zone deep in enemy territory for some reason. Perhaps this aspect of their offense will improve once Evan Mathis and Jason Kelce return from injury.    Both of Foles' scores went to Jeremy Maclin, who had a monstrous outing with 12 catches for 187 yards. Maclin torched Patrick Peterson early on and then proceeded to do the same with Jerraud Powers once Peterson left with a concussion. Maclin and Peterson collided in the second quarter. Peterson was knocked out, while Maclin had to leave temporarily because of a brutal cut on his ear.    Three other Eagles secured at least 5 catches: Cooper (5-88), Zach Ertz (5-48) and Matthews (6-47).    The Cardinals were outgained by more than 100 net yards, but they played a much cleaner game. They committed just 1 turnover, as Andre Ellington fumbled near midfield. Ellington rushed for 71 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and also caught 3 balls for 14 receiving yards.    Palmer nearly had a turnover himself when he was strip-sacked in the first quarter. However, it was nullified by a Nate Allen penalty. Palmer went 20-of-42 for 329 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which were 75 yards or longer. Palmer's first big score went to Larry Fitzgerald on a short slip screen, while the other was the aforementioned bomb to Brown, who torched Allen. Both Fitzgerald and Brown saw 10 targets. Fitzgerald logged 7 catches for 160 yards, while Brown notched 5 receptions for 119 yards. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Brown on a third-and-11. He then launched a 42-yard touchdown bomb to Michael Floyd. Unfortunately, following a second Floyd score, things trended downward for Stanton. He threw an interception in the red zone when he didn't see linebacker Josh Bynes. He then tossed a second pick when he forced the ball into coverage. Stanton nearly had a third interception in the second half that was dropped, but he redeemed himself by converting a third-and-11 to Larry Fitzgerald that iced the game, which the FOX announcers called the biggest throw of his career. There's some question as to whether Fitzgerald was past the line to gain, but the Lions couldn't challenge because they were out of timeouts. Jim Caldwell used all of them prior to the 2-minute warning, which was a poor coaching gaffe.    Stanton went 21-of-32 for 306 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Those numbers look much better than how Stanton actually played, as he struggled to move the chains following the initial scoring drives.    Both of Stanton's aerial scores went to Michael Floyd, who only made 2 catches for 54 yards. John Brown (5-69) led the team in receiving, while Fitzgerald (2-33) didn't do much because he hurt his knee. He'll have an MRI on Monday, but it's a good sign that he was able to gut it out and snare the game-sealing reception.    "

   "comment":"Brown dropped a touchdown. There was that blocked punt, a missed field goal from 49 yards, an Andre Ellington drop and a poor interception by Drew Stanton. As a result, the Seahawks prevailed, giving themselves a legitimate chance to win the NFC West, since they play the Cardinals again in Week 16.    Wilson went 17-of-22 for 211 yards and a touchdown to go along with 73 rushing yards on 10 scrambles. He took 7 sacks in total, including 3 from Calais Campbell. It's quite evident that Seattle missed stud center Max Unger.    Unger was also missed in the ground game. The Seahawks struggled to run without him at Kansas City, and that continued in that contest, as Marshawn Lynch mustered just 39 yards on 15 carries. Granted, it's tough to pound the rock against the Cardinals, but Lynch would've had much better numbers had Unger been snapping the ball.    Wilson's sole aerial score went to someone named Cooper Helfet. Neither Jermaine Kearse (1-19) nor Doug Baldwin (2-6) did much. Seattle's leading receiver was Ricardo Lockette (48 yards) caught only 1 pass.    As for the Cardinals, Stanton struggled mightily, going 14-of-26 for 149 yards and the aforementioned pick. There were some drops, including 1 by Jaron Brown in the end zone, but Stanton's passes were all over the place, and he was overwhelmed by Seattle's pass rush. Stanton missed Larry Fitzgerald, who couldn't recover from the knee injury he sustained last week. He had just 2 reliable targets as a consequence, and 1 of them - "

It looked like he was playing blindfolded, carelessly heaving passes into coverage. He fired 3 interceptions, all of which were telegraphed passes, and he easily could've had a few more. Floyd and Larry Fitzgerald actually had to serve as defensive backs to break up interceptions on the same drive in the second quarter.

   "comment":"Brown in the end zone. This has to be disconcerting for the Saints because the offensive line was seen as a glaring hole for the Cardinals heading into this contest. While Palmer played well, he wasn't completely flawless. He was lucky to get away with 2 passes that could have easily been intercepted. He also made a huge mistake at the end of the first half, scrambling and sliding inbounds as time ticking down without any timeouts. The Cardinals were in field-goal range, but couldn't stop the clock, resulting in no points in the 2-minute drill.    New Orleans couldn't stop Andre Ellington either. The quick back sprinted for 69 yards and a touchdown on just 12 attempts. He looked very explosive in the early going, and was brilliant if you exclude a fumble that occurred during a 10-yard gain. Unfortunately, he was carted off with what appears to be a PCL injury. He could be out for a few weeks. Chris Johnson replaced Ellington, but wasn't nearly as potent, gaining just 37 yards on 10 carries. Perhaps David Johnson will be more of a factor; he had just 1 touch, but it was a 55-yard touchdown that iced the game. David Johnson is a better player than Chris Johnson at this stage of their careers, so the sooner the Cardinals realize this, the better. In the meantime, both Johnsons should be owned until Ellington returns to the lineup. However, I wouldn't be too excited to start Chris.    I mentioned that Brown (4-46) and Johnson caught touchdowns. Palmer's other score went to big tight end "

   "comment":"Brown, and he's definitely off to a great start. Gurley took off his knee brace and was extremely effective in his first start. Gurley rushed for 146 yards on 19 carries, rumbling with great power and blazing speed. On his longest run, a 52-yarder, he nearly outran Tyrann Mathieu. Gurley also showed impressive intelligence for a rookie at the end of the game. On 1 run, he danced around when there were several defenders in front of him just to make sure some extra seconds ticked off the clock. Gurley then slid down inbounds so that more time would expire. The Cardinals, down 24-22, were hoping to get the ball back to engineer a game-winning drive, but Gurley single-handedly made sure that they didn't have a chance.    You can't feel bad for the Cardinals, however, because they made so many mistakes in this game. They opened with a fumbled kickoff return, setting up the Rams with a short touchdown. Larry Fitzgerald lost a fumble following a long gain. Carson Palmer launched an interception into the end zone amid double coverage. David Johnson dropped a touchdown in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble on the kickoff. The Cardinals also sputtered in the red zone all afternoon. So, despite outgaining St. Louis, 447-328, Arizona lost its first game of the year.    I guess you can say that Palmer performed well in between the 20s - especially when considering the circumstances. Palmer went 29-of-46 for 352 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception despite having no time to throw on many of his snaps. He was hit constantly by the Rams' ferocious pass rush. Despite this, Palmer was able to move the chains, though his team just failed deep in St. Louis territory and screwed up with turnovers.    It's no surprise that Fitzgerald led the team in receiving (7-99), but had that aforementioned fumble, which led to a St. Louis touchdown. John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone."

   "comment":"Brown's fumble, yet it wasn't called. Martavis Bryant was out of bounds before the second foot landed in the end zone, yet the play was never reviewed. Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal. It's not a matter of whether or not this game was fixed; it's only a question of who happened to pay off Hochuli.    Bruce Arians' homecoming looked like it would be an inevitable win, even though the Cardinals' offense wasn't getting into the end zone, because Mike Vick was so unbelievably bad. At halftime, the Steelers had totaled just 59 yards, while the Cardinals had 279, but astonishingly, the score was 10-3 Cardinals (Editor's Note: Read the previous editor's note to understand why).    Carson Palmer and company were moving the ball with ease through the air, and he and Michael Floyd connected in the first quarter for a 3-yard touchdown. But that was the only touchdown Arizona would score all day. Floyd was called for offensive pass interference, which wiped away what would have been his second touchdown. The Steelers' defense played the epitome of bend, but don't break defense, picking Palmer off twice and stopping the Cardinals on 58 percent of third downs.    Palmer was not his usual, accurate self and relied on some big receptions from his receivers, especially John Brown, who continues to show his immense ability. Brown made catches all over the field on his way to a big day, finishing with 10 receptions on 14 targets for 198 yards. All 3 were career highs for him. The only blemish, and it was an ugly 1. was a fumble which set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Steelers.    Vick was stuck on negative passing yards for most of the first half, and by the time he left in the third quarter, he was 3-for-8 for 6 yards. He ended up leaving due to a hamstring strain or possibly was just benched for Oklahoma Sooners product "

   "comment":"Brown must have run the wrong route. Palmer later tossed a second pick, an overthrow into double coverage. Palmer had a chance at the very end because of a Sam Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Jermaine Gresham (2-33) snared Palmer's touchdown. The play featured a misplay by Harrison Smith, who thought he had an interception, and a missed tackle from Smith as well. Michael Floyd (2-21) didn't do much, while neither John Brown (4 targets) and J.J. Nelson (5 targets) managed a single receiving yard.    As for Minnesota's offense, it wasn't pretty, but the Vikings did enough to get the job done. Sam Bradford finished 20-of-28 for 169 yards and a touchdown. It has to be noted that "

   "comment":"Browns let him go for nothing; Gabriel isn't reliable enough to be a fantasy option, but he's a dynamic weapon to have in an offense, and he'll serve the Falcons well going forward.    Jones, meanwhile, couldn't get much going against Peterson. Arizona's stud corner was unjustly flagged for interference on some occasions, but he managed to limit Jones to 4 grabs for 35 yards. Peterson missed a few plays with an injury and looked somewhat gimpy upon his return, but Jones couldn't take advantage. Meanwhile, Mohamed Sanu caught all 8 of his targets for 65 yards. He was the recipient of a 4.h-and-3 conversion on the opening drive.    The Cardinals were able to limit Devonta Freeman for the most part, though he had some nice bursts late in the game when Arizona's effort level went down. Freeman gained 60 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, it's baffling to me why David Johnson was given just 13 carries. Don't blame the deficit, as this was a close affair for 2.and-a-half quarters, and Johnson had just 10 rushes at halftime. Johnson gained 58 yards on those 13 attempts. He did catch 8 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown, but Bruce Arians has to be downgraded for this silly game plan, given that the Falcons have been proven to be soft up the middle.    While Johnson carried just 13 times, a decrepit Carson Palmer aired the ball out on 45 occasions despite continued poor pass protection; 21 times in the first half. Again, Arians is looking more clueless each week. Palmer went 25-of-45 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers don't look horrible until factoring in the fact that Atlanta was missing top cornerback Desmond Trufant. Also, 1 of Palmer's scores came in garbage time.    With Trufant out, Larry Fitzgerald was expected to have a big game. That did not happen, as Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for only 53 yards. He was targeted just 4 times for some reason. Fitzgerald opened the game with a crazy, 1.handed grab over Brian Poole, but saw just 3 targets after that. Arians opted to work Gresham (5-35, TD) over the middle of the field instead, which turned out to be yet another mistake. This was just yet another baffling error from Arizona in this game. Elsewhere in the Arizona passing game, Michael Floyd (2-31) and J.J. Nelson (2-30) did nothing. John Brown (1-19) left the game with an injured hamstring, forcing a hobbled Floyd into action.   "

   "comment":"Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both Robert Woods (5-59) and Cooper Kupp (4-51) outgained Watkins. Kupp was the best fantasy producer of the duo, as he managed to score a touchdown. However, Kupp didn't have his best showing, as he dropped a couple of passes.    Todd Gurley dominated once again. Gurley gashed the Cardinals for 106 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, and he also reeled in 4 receptions for 48 receiving yards.    As for the Cardinals, they had an ugly offensive showing, which I'm sure you could tell by the final score. Stanton did not look like a functional quarterback, going 5-of-14 for 62 yards and the aforementioned interception. Bruce Arians had an opportunity to upgrade Stanton the past couple of years, but chose not to for some reason. The Cardinals had no chance with Stanton as a replacement for Palmer, who finished 10-of-18 for 122 yards and his pick, which was accomplished in nearly a half of work. Palmer will be out for at least 8 weeks, so Arizona's playoff dreams are effectively eliminated.    Peterson also took a big step backward compared to last week. He looked great on a 6-yard run in the first half, but he couldn't find any running room otherwise, as the Rams limited him to just 21 yards on 11 carries.    Things weren't much better for Fitzgerald, who was restricted to just 3 catches for 29 yards. Jaron Brown (2-37) and J.J. Nelson (2-35) led the Cardinals in receiving.   "
