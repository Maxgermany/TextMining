   "comment":"John Brown (4-52). As mentioned, Stanton got away with a couple of interceptions. However, he was very hot in the second half, going 10-of-16 for 161 yards and a pair of scoles following the break. The 49ers helped him out with their dumb mistakes, but it was an impressive second-half performance nonetheless.    Stanton struggled to get the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, as the future Hall of Famer didn't log a single reception until the 4.h quarter for the second time in 3 games. Fitzgerald finally hauled in his 3 targets (for 34 yards) in the final period, but he hurt his team by losing a fumble inside the San Francisco 5-yard line. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"John Brown on a third-and-11. He then launched a 42-yard touchdown bomb to Michael Floyd. Unfortunately, following a second Floyd score, things trended downward for Stanton. He threw an interception in the red zone when he didn't see linebacker Josh Bynes. He then tossed a second pick when he forced the ball into coverage. Stanton nearly had a third interception in the second half that was dropped, but he redeemed himself by converting a third-and-11 to Larry Fitzgerald that iced the game, which the FOX announcers called the biggest throw of his career. There's some question as to whether Fitzgerald was past the line to gain, but the Lions couldn't challenge because they were out of timeouts. Jim Caldwell used all of them prior to the 2-minute warning, which was a poor coaching gaffe.    Stanton went 21-of-32 for 306 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Those numbers look much better than how Stanton actually played, as he struggled to move the chains following the initial scoring drives.    Both of Stanton's aerial scores went to Michael Floyd, who only made 2 catches for 54 yards. John Brown (5-69) led the team in receiving, while Fitzgerald (2-33) didn't do much because he hurt his knee. He'll have an MRI on Monday, but it's a good sign that he was able to gut it out and snare the game-sealing reception.    "

   "comment":"John Brown. He even had a touchdown off a flea-flicker in the first quarter. The problem is that Lindley is so unbelievably careless with the football. It looked like he was playing blindfolded, carelessly heaving passes into coverage. He fired 3 interceptions, all of which were telegraphed passes, and he easily could've had a few more. Floyd and Larry Fitzgerald actually had to serve as defensive backs to break up interceptions on the same drive in the second quarter. Lindley finished 23-of-39 for 316 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Again, he did a good job of moving the chains on occasion, and he was even screwed by a big John Brown drop in the 4.h quarter, but he needs to be a lot more careful with the football to give the Cardinals any sort of chance in the playoffs.    Floyd and Brown saw way more targets than any other Cardinals. Floyd reeled in 8 of the balls thrown to him for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brown, seeing 9 targets, caught 4 balls for 51 yards. Fitzgerald, meanwhile, continued to struggle off his injury, catching just 2 passes for 29 yards.    "

   "comment":"John Brown in the end zone. This has to be disconcerting for the Saints because the offensive line was seen as a glaring hole for the Cardinals heading into this contest. While Palmer played well, he wasn't completely flawless. He was lucky to get away with 2 passes that could have easily been intercepted. He also made a huge mistake at the end of the first half, scrambling and sliding inbounds as time ticking down without any timeouts. The Cardinals were in field-goal range, but couldn't stop the clock, resulting in no points in the 2-minute drill.    New Orleans couldn't stop "

   "comment":"John Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. Alan Ball then took his turn with a deep pass interference flag, a 38-yarder, leading to a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. "

It was a mixed bag, as he also had a drop. He will cut into John Brown's targets as both ended up with 5. while Fitzgerald had 11.

   "comment":"John Brown's fumble, yet it wasn't called. Martavis Bryant was out of bounds before the second foot landed in the end zone, yet the play was never reviewed. Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal. It's not a matter of whether or not this game was fixed; it's only a question of who happened to pay off Hochuli. </i>    Bruce Arians' homecoming looked like it would be an inevitable win, even though the Cardinals' offense wasn't getting into the end zone, because Mike Vick was so unbelievably bad. At halftime, the Steelers had totaled just 59 yards, while the Cardinals had 279, but astonishingly, the score was 10-3 Cardinals (Editor's Note: Read the previous editor's note to understand why).    Carson Palmer and company were moving the ball with ease through the air, and he and Michael Floyd connected in the first quarter for a 3-yard touchdown. But that was the only touchdown Arizona would score all day. Floyd was called for offensive pass interference, which wiped away what would have been his second touchdown. The Steelers' defense played the epitome of bend, but don't break defense, picking Palmer off twice and stopping the Cardinals on 58 percent of third downs.    Palmer was not his usual, accurate self and relied on some big receptions from his receivers, especially John Brown, who continues to show his immense ability. Brown made catches all over the field on his way to a big day, finishing with 10 receptions on 14 targets for 198 yards. All 3 were career highs for him. The only blemish, and it was an ugly 1. was a fumble which set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Steelers.    Vick was stuck on negative passing yards for most of the first half, and by the time he left in the third quarter, he was 3-for-8 for 6 yards. He ended up leaving due to a hamstring strain or possibly was just benched for Oklahoma Sooners product "

Nelson was that player, as he snatched 4 of his 6 targets for a whopping 142 yards and a touchdown. Nelson's 64-yard score tied the game in the third quarter.

The Bengals did a great job of bottling up "

   "comment":"John Brown must have run the wrong route. Palmer later tossed a second pick, an overthrow into double coverage. Palmer had a chance at the very end because of a Sam Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Jermaine Gresham (2-33) snared Palmer's touchdown. The play featured a misplay by Harrison Smith, who thought he had an interception, and a missed tackle from Smith as well. Michael Floyd (2-21) didn't do much, while neither John Brown (4 targets) and J.J. Nelson (5 targets) managed a single receiving yard.    As for Minnesota's offense, it wasn't pretty, but the Vikings did enough to get the job done. Sam Bradford finished 20-of-28 for 169 yards and a touchdown. It has to be noted that "
