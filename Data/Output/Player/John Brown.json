   "comment":"John Brown to take the lead with 1:21 remaining in regulation. Brown to take the lead with 1:21 remaining in regulation. Nick Foles then had his chance and did a good job of moving Philadelphia into the red zone. He fired a pass toward Jordan Matthews for what could've been the decisive score. Matthews caught the ball, but landed out of bounds, giving Arizona the victory in this battle of 5-1 teams. The Eagles were competitive and nearly triumphed, but their offensive game plan was highly questionable. Having Foles attempt 62 passes compared to giving LeSean McCoy just 21 rushes was not a winning formula. Philadelphia never trailed by more than 7 points, so there was no reason not to run McCoy as much, especially considering that he did a good job of picking up yardage on the ground. McCoy gained 83 yards on 21 carries and didn't have a rush of more than 13 yards, so it's not like he had just 1 great burst and did nothing else. McCoy is the team's best player, so giving him just 24 touches - he also had 3 catches for 14 receiving yards - was inexcusable in a game that could potentially determine playoff seeding. Foles, meanwhile, had a mixed night. His numbers look pretty from a fantasy perspective - 36-of-62, 411 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions - but the picks were killers and part of the overall persisting red-zone issues. His fist interception was a telegraphed throw late over the middle of the field. The second was a throw well behind Riley Cooper. Those weren't the only give-aways, as Josh Huff lost a fumble inside the 10-yard line. Had the Eagles converted in the red zone, they would have won easily. However, this has been an ongoing problem for them all year. They just can't find the end zone deep in enemy territory for some reason. Perhaps this aspect of their offense will improve once Evan Mathis and Jason Kelce return from injury.    Both of Foles' scores went to Jeremy Maclin, who had a monstrous outing with 12 catches for 187 yards. Maclin torched Patrick Peterson early on and then proceeded to do the same with Jerraud Powers once Peterson left with a concussion. Maclin and Peterson collided in the second quarter. Peterson was knocked out, while Maclin had to leave temporarily because of a brutal cut on his ear.    Three other Eagles secured at least 5 catches: Cooper (5-88), Zach Ertz (5-48) and Matthews (6-47).    The Cardinals were outgained by more than 100 net yards, but they played a much cleaner game. They committed just 1 turnover, as Andre Ellington fumbled near midfield. Ellington rushed for 71 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and also caught 3 balls for 14 receiving yards.    Palmer nearly had a turnover himself when he was strip-sacked in the first quarter. However, it was nullified by a Nate Allen penalty. Palmer went 20-of-42 for 329 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which were 75 yards or longer. Palmer's first big score went to Larry Fitzgerald on a short slip screen, while the other was the aforementioned bomb to Brown, who torched Allen. Both Fitzgerald and Brown saw 10 targets. Fitzgerald logged 7 catches for 160 yards, while Brown notched 5 receptions for 119 yards. Meanwhile, "

The Seahawks struggled to run without him at Kansas City, and that continued in that contest, as Marshawn Lynch mustered just 39 yards on 15 carries. Granted, it's tough to pound the rock against the Cardinals, but Lynch would've had much better numbers had Unger been snapping the ball.    Wilson's sole aerial score went to someone named Cooper Helfet. Neither Jermaine Kearse (1-19) nor Doug Baldwin (2-6) did much. Seattle's leading receiver was Ricardo Lockette (48 yards) caught only 1 pass.    As for the Cardinals, Stanton struggled mightily, going 14-of-26 for 149 yards and the aforementioned pick. There were some drops, including 1 by Jaron Brown in the end zone, but Stanton's passes were all over the place, and he was overwhelmed by Seattle's pass rush. Stanton missed Larry Fitzgerald, who couldn't recover from the knee injury he sustained last week. He had just 2 reliable targets as a consequence, and 1 of them - "

The quick back sprinted for 69 yards and a touchdown on just 12 attempts. He looked very explosive in the early going, and was brilliant if you exclude a fumble that occurred during a 10-yard gain. Unfortunately, he was carted off with what appears to be a PCL injury. He could be out for a few weeks. Chris Johnson replaced Ellington, but wasn't nearly as potent, gaining just 37 yards on 10 carries. Perhaps David Johnson will be more of a factor; he had just 1 touch, but it was a 55-yard touchdown that iced the game. David Johnson is a better player than Chris Johnson at this stage of their careers, so the sooner the Cardinals realize this, the better. In the meantime, both Johnsons should be owned until Ellington returns to the lineup. However, I wouldn't be too excited to start Chris.    I mentioned that Brown (4-46) and Johnson caught touchdowns. Palmer's other score went to big tight end "

   "comment":"John Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. Alan Ball then took his turn with a deep pass interference flag, a 38-yarder, leading to a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. "

   "comment":"John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone.Brown, and he's definitely off to a great start. Gurley took off his knee brace and was extremely effective in his first start. Gurley rushed for 146 yards on 19 carries, rumbling with great power and blazing speed. On his longest run, a 52-yarder, he nearly outran Tyrann Mathieu. Gurley also showed impressive intelligence for a rookie at the end of the game. On 1 run, he danced around when there were several defenders in front of him just to make sure some extra seconds ticked off the clock. Gurley then slid down inbounds so that more time would expire. The Cardinals, down 24-22, were hoping to get the ball back to engineer a game-winning drive, but Gurley single-handedly made sure that they didn't have a chance.    You can't feel bad for the Cardinals, however, because they made so many mistakes in this game. They opened with a fumbled kickoff return, setting up the Rams with a short touchdown. Larry Fitzgerald lost a fumble following a long gain. Carson Palmer launched an interception into the end zone amid double coverage. David Johnson dropped a touchdown in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble on the kickoff. The Cardinals also sputtered in the red zone all afternoon. So, despite outgaining St. Louis, 447-328, Arizona lost its first game of the year.    I guess you can say that Palmer performed well in between the 20s - especially when considering the circumstances. Palmer went 29-of-46 for 352 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception despite having no time to throw on many of his snaps. He was hit constantly by the Rams' ferocious pass rush. Despite this, Palmer was able to move the chains, though his team just failed deep in St. Louis territory and screwed up with turnovers.    It's no surprise that Fitzgerald led the team in receiving (7-99), but had that aforementioned fumble, which led to a St. Louis touchdown. John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone."

   "comment":"John Brown must have run the wrong route. Palmer later tossed a second pick, an overthrow into double coverage. Palmer had a chance at the very end because of a Sam Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Jermaine Gresham (2-33) snared Palmer's touchdown. The play featured a misplay by Harrison Smith, who thought he had an interception, and a missed tackle from Smith as well. Michael Floyd (2-21) didn't do much, while neither John Brown (4 targets) and J.J. Nelson (5 targets) managed a single receiving yard.    As for Minnesota's offense, it wasn't pretty, but the Vikings did enough to get the job done. Sam Bradford finished 20-of-28 for 169 yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"John Brown (1-19) left the game with an injured hamstring, forcing a hobbled Floyd into action.   Browns let him go for nothing; Gabriel isn't reliable enough to be a fantasy option, but he's a dynamic weapon to have in an offense, and he'll serve the Falcons well going forward.    Jones, meanwhile, couldn't get much going against Peterson. Arizona's stud corner was unjustly flagged for interference on some occasions, but he managed to limit Jones to 4 grabs for 35 yards. Peterson missed a few plays with an injury and looked somewhat gimpy upon his return, but Jones couldn't take advantage. Meanwhile, Mohamed Sanu caught all 8 of his targets for 65 yards. He was the recipient of a 4.h-and-3 conversion on the opening drive.    The Cardinals were able to limit Devonta Freeman for the most part, though he had some nice bursts late in the game when Arizona's effort level went down. Freeman gained 60 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, it's baffling to me why David Johnson was given just 13 carries. Don't blame the deficit, as this was a close affair for 2.and-a-half quarters, and Johnson had just 10 rushes at halftime. Johnson gained 58 yards on those 13 attempts. He did catch 8 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown, but Bruce Arians has to be downgraded for this silly game plan, given that the Falcons have been proven to be soft up the middle.    While Johnson carried just 13 times, a decrepit Carson Palmer aired the ball out on 45 occasions despite continued poor pass protection; 21 times in the first half. Again, Arians is looking more clueless each week. Palmer went 25-of-45 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers don't look horrible until factoring in the fact that Atlanta was missing top cornerback Desmond Trufant. Also, 1 of Palmer's scores came in garbage time.    With Trufant out, Larry Fitzgerald was expected to have a big game. That did not happen, as Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for only 53 yards. He was targeted just 4 times for some reason. Fitzgerald opened the game with a crazy, 1.handed grab over Brian Poole, but saw just 3 targets after that. Arians opted to work Gresham (5-35, TD) over the middle of the field instead, which turned out to be yet another mistake. This was just yet another baffling error from Arizona in this game. Elsewhere in the Arizona passing game, Michael Floyd (2-31) and J.J. Nelson (2-30) did nothing. John Brown (1-19) left the game with an injured hamstring, forcing a hobbled Floyd into action.   "

   "comment":"John Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both Robert Woods (5-59) and Cooper Kupp (4-51) outgained Watkins. Kupp was the best fantasy producer of the duo, as he managed to score a touchdown. However, Kupp didn't have his best showing, as he dropped a couple of passes.    Todd Gurley dominated once again. Gurley gashed the Cardinals for 106 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, and he also reeled in 4 receptions for 48 receiving yards.    As for the Cardinals, they had an ugly offensive showing, which I'm sure you could tell by the final score. Stanton did not look like a functional quarterback, going 5-of-14 for 62 yards and the aforementioned interception. Bruce Arians had an opportunity to upgrade Stanton the past couple of years, but chose not to for some reason. The Cardinals had no chance with Stanton as a replacement for Palmer, who finished 10-of-18 for 122 yards and his pick, which was accomplished in nearly a half of work. Palmer will be out for at least 8 weeks, so Arizona's playoff dreams are effectively eliminated.    Peterson also took a big step backward compared to last week. He looked great on a 6-yard run in the first half, but he couldn't find any running room otherwise, as the Rams limited him to just 21 yards on 11 carries.    Things weren't much better for Fitzgerald, who was restricted to just 3 catches for 29 yards. Jaron Brown (2-37) and J.J. Nelson (2-35) led the Cardinals in receiving.   "
