   "comment":"Ponder. This Denver victory was the result of Tebow's great passing in the second half. But I doubt the stubborn fools on ESPN (Cris Carter, Merril Hoge, Bomani Jones) will want to give Tebow any sort of credit for this victory. So I'll be the 1 to do so.    Oddly enough, Tebow didn't look toward Eric Decker. The bulk of his yardage went to second-year Demaryius Thomas, who had 4 grabs for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns. If you remember, Thomas and Tebow were drafted only a few picks apart by Josh McDaniels back in April 2010. At least McDaniels got something right.    Tebow once again was the reason the running game was so effective. His presence really opened things up for Willis McGahee, who rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. McGahee had a blemish in that he fumbled in his own territory. He also took a safety, but that wasn't his fault.    As for the other quarterback, Christian Ponder really had an up-and-down day. He finished 29-of-47 for 381 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but was inconsistent throughout. Ponder was terrible early on. He had a horrible fumble, forced by "

Some of Ponder's passes were really good, but his mistakes were unforgivable. The worst of the bunch occurred on a play-action to no 1 in the backfield. Ponder rolled right and threw it really late across his body. The FOX play-by-play guy yelled, Ugh! at this happened. Webb, meanwhile, went 12-of-23 for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also had 109 rushing yards, including a 65-yard scoring scamper. Webb showed promise at the end of last season, so Minnesota's decision to spend such a high draft selection on Ponder seems a bit curious right now. I'm not saying Ponder will be a bust or anything, but Webb should have been given a chance, especially with blue-chip quarterbacks like Andrew Luck, Matt Barkley and Robert Griffin presumably available in the    Despite the quarterback switch, "

   "comment":"Ponder struggled mightily. He went 8-of-17 for 58 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 bone-headed interceptions. The first was a sloppy heave as he was escaping pressure. The second was a late throw over the middle in his own territory with 5 seconds remaining in the first half. Jay Feely was given a shot at a 47-yard field goal, but sailed it wide right.    Ponder's score went to Percy Harvin, who was the only Viking to log more than 2 receptions."

One of the picks was horrendous. Peterson trampled Green Bay's reeling defense on the entire drive, but Ponder was asked to throw inside the red zone. He scrambled right and didn't have anything, yet he still threw late across his body. The Packers snagged a very easy interception. Ponder just keeps getting worse. He now has 11 interceptions to just 10 touchdowns since Week 5. He's completed better than 54.3 percent of his passes just once since Week 7. He ruined what looked like a possible record-breaking day for Peterson, who was amazing. He rushed for 210 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He eclipsed the 200-yard barrier early in the 4.h quarter, so it appeared as though he could break his own single-game rushing record of 296 yards.

   "comment":"Ponder dead to rights in the backfield. However, Ponder somehow escaped a St. Louis defender who had his arms wrapped around him and then scampered into the end zone. What wasn't fluky was what Peterson did afterward. He broke free with an 82-yard score at the beginning of the second quarter. Peterson proceeded to trample St. Louis' defense the rest of the afternoon, ultimately finishing with 212 yards and that touchdown on 24 carries. He's now 294 yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards.    With Peterson running wild, Christian Ponder didn't need to do much. He went just 17-of-24 for 131 yards and the aforementioned rushing score. As a result, no Viking had more than 27 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Ponder making several impressive throws to keep drives alive. The Vikings' stop unit was absolutely dominant. They completely shut down the run, limiting Arian Foster to 15 yards on 10 carries. It was easily his worst outing of the season. Making matters worse, Foster lost a fumble in the first half and later exited the contest in the second half with an irregular heartbeat. Foster called it a very minor situation. Meanwhile, Ponder had some brilliant moments, as indicated earlier. He also made several terrible throws. It was crazy how inconsistent he was. He'd make an awful-looking pass and then come back and convert a long-yardage situation. In all, Minnesota was 9-of-18 on third down, as Ponder went 16-of-30 for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also had 7 scrambles for 48 rushing yards.    Adrian Peterson still was great though. The Texans loaded the box on every play, so Peterson had many losses. However, he broke loose for several impressive gains, ultimately finishing with 86 yards on 25 carries. Peterson now has 1,898 rushing yards. He needs 208 yards to break Dickerson's record, which is feasible, though the Packers, who happen to be next week's opponent, just limited "

The Lions would have punted the ball away, but they were awarded a free first down. Later on the possession, Xavier Rhodes was whistled for pass interference downfield. This eventually led to a Detroit touchdown. The game was a 27-24 affair at that point, so the 2 penalties helped the Lions pull away.    Detroit, of course, made some mistakes itself. Reggie Bush dropped a pass in the red zone on the opening drive. A field goal attempt was aborted because of a bobbled hold. Calvin Johnson let the ball hit the ground on a potential touchdown. A chop block nullified a pick-six. Brandon Pettigrew lost a fumble. The team burned a timeout in the beginning of the third quarter. Basically another day at the office for this team. The Lions look great at times, but these errors will cost them games down the road. They're just fortunate that the Vikings made similar mental mistakes.    It really helped the Lions that Ponder was so inept. He went 18-of-28 for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and a fumble.

   "comment":"Ponder took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, and then he threw an interception on the very next play by carelessly lofting a pass into double coverage. The Redskins took over and scored easily, so it appeared as though Minnesota wouldn't have a chance. The Vikings scored a couple of touchdowns after that, but the Redskins eventually led 27-14 in the third quarter. Minnesota's defense looked completely helpless. Washington receivers were open on seemingly every play, as the Vikings' injury-ridden secondary blew tons of assignments. So, with that in mind, I have no idea how Minnesota managed to turn the tide. The pass rush suddenly came alive out of nowhere and smothered Robert Griffin, holding Washington completely scoreless after that. The offense, meanwhile, got enough against the Redskins' poor defense to eventually take the lead and hang on despite a furious final drive by the Redskins that culminated with drops by Jordan Reed, Pierre Garcon and Santana Moss in the end zone.    Ponder, despite the dubious first possession, had a pretty solid outing. He let the ball hit the ground just 3 times, going 17-of-21 for 174 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was going up against a putrid defense, but the fact remains that he played very well after the ugly interception. Ponder also had a 14-yard scramble that appeared to be another score, but replay showed that the ball was fumbled and dribbled out of bounds just short of the goal line. Unfortunately, Ponder suffered an injury on the dive and had to leave the game. "

They tried to pound it with Adrian Peterson and Toby Gerhart, but to no avail; since struggling versus the rush in games against St. Louis and Tampa Bay, the Seahawks have improved tremendously against ground attacks. The limited Peterson to just 65 yards on 21 carries, while Gerhart didn't do much out of a 32-yard burst. You can't blame Minnesota for being so scared of Ponder because he proved to be inept.

   "comment":"Ponder was a shaky 3-of-8 for 40 yards before leaving the game in the second quarter with a concussion. Matt Cassel stepped in and played pretty well, albeit against 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL. He went 20-of-33 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception that was Ellison's fault. Cassel's pocket presence was so much better than Ponder's; the latter took 3 sacks on his first 3 drives. Cassel, on the other hand, went down just twice through nearly 4 quarters of action.    You can bet that "

   "comment":"Ponder would start, they must have been extremely deflated. Phil Simms criticized Minnesota for possibly acting this way in the wake of the Bridgewater news, but I don't blame them for being so flat. The players know what Ponder has - or rather, what he doesn't have - and it was extremely obvious that he had no chance of outscoring Aaron Rodgers in a potential shootout."
