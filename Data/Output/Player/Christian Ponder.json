   "comment":"Christian Ponder. This Denver victory was the result of Tebow's great passing in the second half. But I doubt the stubborn fools on ESPN (Cris Carter, Merril Hoge, Bomani Jones) will want to give Tebow any sort of credit for this victory. So I'll be the 1 to do so.    Oddly enough, Tebow didn't look toward Eric Decker. The bulk of his yardage went to second-year Demaryius Thomas, who had 4 grabs for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns. If you remember, Thomas and Tebow were drafted only a few picks apart by Josh McDaniels back in April 2010. At least McDaniels got something right.    Tebow once again was the reason the running game was so effective. His presence really opened things up for Willis McGahee, who rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. McGahee had a blemish in that he fumbled in his own territory. He also took a safety, but that wasn't his fault.    As for the other quarterback, Christian Ponder really had an up-and-down day. He finished 29-of-47 for 381 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but was inconsistent throughout. Ponder was terrible early on. He had a horrible fumble, forced by Ponder.

However, there was 1 Detroit 4.h-quarter drive in which defensive tackle Letroy Guion hit Matthew Stafford late on third-and-long. The Lions would have punted the ball away, but they were awarded a free first down. Later on the possession, Xavier Rhodes was whistled for pass interference downfield. This eventually led to a Detroit touchdown. The game was a 27-24 affair at that point, so the 2 penalties helped the Lions pull away.    Detroit, of course, made some mistakes itself. Reggie Bush dropped a pass in the red zone on the opening drive. A field goal attempt was aborted because of a bobbled hold. Calvin Johnson let the ball hit the ground on a potential touchdown. A chop block nullified a pick-six. Brandon Pettigrew lost a fumble. The team burned a timeout in the beginning of the third quarter. Basically another day at the office for this team. The Lions look great at times, but these errors will cost them games down the road. They're just fortunate that the Vikings made similar mental mistakes.    It really helped the Lions that Ponder was so inept. He went 18-of-28 for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and a fumble. He didn't even attempt a pass in the first quarter, as the coaching staff clearly doesn't trust him. Plus, there's always "

The Redskins took over and scored easily, so it appeared as though Minnesota wouldn't have a chance. The Vikings scored a couple of touchdowns after that, but the Redskins eventually led 27-14 in the third quarter. Minnesota's defense looked completely helpless. Washington receivers were open on seemingly every play, as the Vikings' injury-ridden secondary blew tons of assignments. So, with that in mind, I have no idea how Minnesota managed to turn the tide. The pass rush suddenly came alive out of nowhere and smothered Robert Griffin, holding Washington completely scoreless after that. The offense, meanwhile, got enough against the Redskins' poor defense to eventually take the lead and hang on despite a furious final drive by the Redskins that culminated with drops by "

They tried to pound it with Ponder air it out that they continuously ran the ball despite being down by 11 in the third quarter. They tried to pound it with Adrian Peterson and Toby Gerhart, but to no avail; since struggling versus the rush in games against St. Louis and Tampa Bay, the Seahawks have improved tremendously against ground attacks. The limited Peterson to just 65 yards on 21 carries, while Gerhart didn't do much out of a 32-yard burst. You can't blame Minnesota for being so scared of Ponder because he proved to be inept.
