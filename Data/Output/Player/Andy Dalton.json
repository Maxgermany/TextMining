   "comment":"Dalton. Cincinnati came out with an excellent blend of running Cedric Benson (5 carries for 15 yards) and completing passes primarily to Andre Caldwell (3 receptions for 32 yards). They chewed up almost half the opening quarter, but on first and goal from the 6. picked a bad time to run on consecutive plays for the first time in the drive. It stalled and a field goal put them up, 3-0. Little did we know they would not score again until the 4.h quarter. Alex Smith came out on San Francisco's first possession and immediately completed a pass to Bruce Miller for 11 yards. Then he got sacked and threw 2 incompletions. You can pretty much copy that a few times, and you get the gist of what the 49ers did on much of the afternoon, mixing in some unsuccessful runs by Frank Gore who finished with 42 yards on 17 carries. This is not lazy analysis - I am serious. Both defenses played well in this game obviously, with the final total yards going to Cincinnati just barely at 228-226. Cincinnati's 5 sacks were crucial in getting their defense off the field. Only once did the 49ers get a first down on a drive following a sack, and it was the result of a penalty. Meanwhile San Francisco's defense was getting it done on third down, stopping 9 out of 10 conversion attempts. If not for a Frank Gore fumble early in the 4.h quarter, the Bengals would not have scored after the opening drive. Vernon Davis was the offensive force for the 49ers. His 39-yard reception in the second quarter led to the tying field goal. Yes, it was 3-3 at halftime. Then with the game on the line, he had receptions for 8, 8 and 20 yards during a 72-yard march for the game's only touchdown. Kendall Hunter finished it off with a 7-yard run and he had a mild coming out party here. Gore was ineffective and the smaller rookie Hunter ran big. Immediately after the score, Carlos Rogers intercepted Dalton and even though the drive immediately stalled, David Akers drilled a field goal from 53-yards out to put them up 13-6."

   "comment":"Dalton with the No. 25 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. Instead, the team took struggling tackle James Carpenter, whom many regarded as a third-round prospect. Oops! This was not a great <i>complete</i> game for Dalton (18-29, 168 yards, 2 TDs, 2 INTs), but it looked to be at first. He was 13-of-18 for 125 yards and 2 touchdowns by halftime, which means he was only 5-of-11 for 43 yards and a pair of picks after the break. Pete Carroll screwed up in so many things in this contest (including a called run deep in Cincinnati territory with only a few seconds remaining in the first half, which allowed the clock to expire), so I'll at least give him credit for making some nice second-half adjustments.    What you have to bash the Seattle coaching staff for is the handling of its quarterbacks, both during the offseason and the week leading up to this game. How Carroll thought he could win with "

   "comment":"Dalton answered. He moved to his left and aired the ball out into the end zone. A.J. Green was in double coverage, but the big rookie jumped over the 2 defenders to make a great 36-yard touchdown catch. Green was injured on the play and that was his only reception of the game. He was on the field on the next Cincinnati possession and ran the ball for 7 yards, but was favoring his knee. Pittsburgh's next possession saw the Bengals get opportunistic when cornerback Leon Hall intercepted a bobbled ball. That set up Cincinnati at the Steelers' 41-yard line. The Bengals had to settle for a 43-yard field goal from Mike Nugent. Just before halftime, the Steelers put together a good drive with Roethlisberger moving the ball through the air. He hit some big throws to Antonio Brown to move the ball into Cincinnati territory. A second touchdown pass to Cotchery was called back due to an offensive pass interference penalty on Miller. The Bengals' defensive line came through with their third sack of the first half on third down to force a field goal. Pittsburgh was up 17-10 at halftime. Unfortunately, Hall suffered a ruptured Achilles' 10.on against the Steelers and will miss the rest of the season. It is a devastating injury for the Bengals. He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with "

   "comment":"Dalton to Jermaine Gresham touchdown on the opening drive was wiped out by an A.J. Green penalty. Two plays later, a field goal was erased because of a delay-of-game infraction. But 5 yards wouldn't be a big deal, right? Nope - the retry was blocked. Later in the first half, the Bengals were down 14-0 but were getting the ball back. Brandon Tate fumbled the kickoff return, however, and Pittsburgh would quickly score again. At 21-0, this game was out of reach, and if there was doubt, Antonio Brown scored on a punt return touchdown just prior to halftime, thanks in part to a missed block-in-the-back penalty.    It was a different story in the second half though. The Bengals mustered just 63 total yards after the break and were able to convert only 2-of-11 third downs overall. Dalton (11-of-24, 135 yards, TD) was knocked out of the game in the 4.h quarter because of a hip injury he incurred after a sack. It didn't appear to be serious; Marvin Lewis may have held him out because his team was trailing by 4 touchdowns.    Dalton struggled, but at least A.J. Green had a solid fantasy outing. The dynamic rookie wideout had more than half of Dalton's yardage, as he hauled in 6 grabs for 87 yards and a touchdown.    There was some concern about "

The Rams answered by driving 58 yards with a blend of Clemens passing (33 yards), a little Jackson rushing and a personal foul penalty on Chris Crocker for roughing Dalton. The drive stalled when Jackson couldn't pick up a yard on 3rd-and-1 and was driven backwards. "

   "comment":"Dalton was on fire, going 15-of-22 for 136 yards and 2 touchdowns in the first half. Skelton, meanwhile, was a dreadful 5-of-13 for 63 yards. Cincinnati had way more first downs (16-3) and total yards (218-56) than Arizona. Things were looking so bleak for the Cardinals that they even tried using Patrick Peterson on offense. But Skelton caught fire in the 4.h quarter. He finished 23-of-44 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He should have had a third score - which would have tied the game with a minute remaining on the clock - but Early Doucet, who was wide open in the end zone, fell down when he tripped over his own feet. It's unfortunate, but that's how Arizona's season would conclude.    Doucet hadn't done anything prior to that anyway (2-24), so maybe that's why the Bengals left him uncovered. Larry Fitzgerald (6-105, TD) and Andre Roberts (6-75) were much bigger parts of the offense.    Both running backs disappointed. Chris Wells (14-53) and Cedric Benson (16-57) struggled, though the latter was worse because he had 2 key fumbles in the 4.h quarter that gave Arizona a chance. One resulted in a touchdown, while the other led to that Doucet opportunity.    With a huge second-half lead, Dalton didn't have to do much. I listed his halftime numbers earlier; he finished 18-of-31 for 154 yards and the 2 scores. For those who don't have nifty Windows calculators, that's just 3-of-9 for 18 yards after intermission. He also had an interception nullified by a penalty.    "

The 2 teams started fighting, and the ultra-lazy Tommy Kelly, who apparently was bored with football and wanted a change of pace with his life, took off his helmet for no apparent reason. All 3 players were ejected.    The Raiders went down early, training 21-0, thanks to a career-long 48-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis burst - a sure sign that a defense has thrown in the towel. Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage.

Green Bay, meanwhile, saw Rodgers toss 2 picks in addition to the pair of aforementioned fumbles.    Each squad had 4 give-aways, but the Packers were better overall. They outgained Cincinnati, 399-297. The Bengals were helpless to stop the Green Bay ground attack - which makes it ironic that 1 of the Packer running backs was mostly responsible for this defeat.    Rodgers had a rough afternoon - 26-of-43, 244 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks - as the Bengals' defensive line was in his face the entire contest. Cincinnati also batted down what seemed like 100 passes. Rodgers was so frustrated that he and Mike McCarthy had an angry exchange of words on the sideline following a botched red-zone attempt. It seemed as though Rodgers was pissed because McCarthy opted to kick a field goal on a 4.h-and-goal opportunity inside the 1-yard line.    Rodgers' lone score went to James Jones (4-34). He produced fewer yardage than the other 2 receivers; Randall Cobb (5-54) was OK, but Jordy Nelson (8-93) made a spectacular, acrobatic catch where he tip-toed the sideline. This prompted the play-by-play announcer to exclaim, He catches everything! As for Jermichael Finley, he didn't catch a single pass because he was was knocked out in the first quarter because of a concussion.    Dalton had just 8 incompletions, going 20-of-28 for 235 yards, a pair of touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned turnovers. It helped his cause that "

He converted quality throws, including some clutch passes on third down, but his turnovers were costly. He opened with a lost fumble on a strip-sack deep in his own territory.

This was a matchup in which he was fully expected to succeed. After all, Kansas City's second-stringers would have defeated this team had the officials recognized an illegal defensive formation. Chase Daniel thrived against San Diego's defense, so no 1 envisioned Dalton failing, especially given that he was a perfect 8-0 at home this year. Dalton sucked. He really sucked. The stats will show that he threw for 331 yards and a touchdown on 28-of-50 passing, but he missed receivers all afternoon. He failed to connect with several open targets, but he at least stayed turnover-free in the first half. However, the floodgates opened following intermission. It started when Dalton lost a fumble when diving head-first toward the first-down marker. He then forced an interception under pressure and went on to toss another pick that he telegraphed.

Sanu also hurled a 50-yard pass to Brandon Tate. Meanwhile, Bernard and Hill both found the end zone. Bernard rushed for 90 yards on 27 carries and caught 5 balls for 79 receiving yards. Hill, meanwhile, rumbled for 74 yards on 15 tries.    Dalton's supporting cast was able to carry him to victory. Dalton made some nice throws, but left points off the board when he overthrew his receivers twice in the end zone. Dalton is responsible for the Bengals' red-zone woes, which didn't play a factor in this contest because the Falcons simply couldn't score.    Atlanta's offense was awful. The team mustered just 98 net yards of offense in the first half, and most of what it did after intermission was artificial because the Bengals were in prevent since they were up by so much. "

   "comment":"Dalton. Wreh-Wilson tried to half-intercept the ball and half-bring down Dalton, who easily avoided a pathetic cornerback.    The touchdown reception was 1 of Dalton's few bright moments of the afternoon. He was pretty mediocre, going 15-of-23 for 169 yards and an interception which occurred on a horrible attempt at a screen pass. Dalton is mostly responsible for his team's struggles in the red zone, and it's not going to get easier for him because he just battled 2 pretty weak defenses.    Cincinnati scored thrice on the ground. "

   "comment":"Dalton were exceptional down the stretch - especially the former, who looked like he was completely healthy for the first time all year. Newton went 29-of-46 for 284 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but what he did on the ground was most prominent, as he scrambled a whopping 17 times for 107 rushing yards and a third score. Newton had previously shied away from running, but he did whatever it took to move the chains in this contest. It was the Newton of old, as he glided on several of his scrambles. Newton was mostly great, but he nearly cost his game with the pick, which he unnecessarily forced to Kelvin Benjamin in a tie game. Reggie Nelson snatched the ball and returned it deep into Carolina territory. However, the Bengals were ultra conservative and settled for a field goal, leaving just enough time for the Panthers to drill a kick of their own to send the game into overtime. Newton also lucked out a bit on that ensuing drive. Already in field-goal range, he foolishly tried to force the issue downfield and was nearly intercepted in the process. He also checked the ball down on 1 occasion with no timeouts, and his target had no hope of getting out of bounds. The clock may have expired had linebacker Emmanuel Lemur not suffered an injury.    Newton's aerial scores went to Greg Olsen (6-62) and Kelvin Benjamin (7-49). The latter was flagged for offensive pass interference that negated another touchdown, while Olsen spent most of the afternoon hobbling around.    As for the Carolina ground attack, Fozzy Whittaker (9-25, TD) and Darrin Reaves (8-15) split touches with both DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart out with injuries.    Dalton, meanwhile, misfired on just 10 occasions, going 34-of-44 for 323 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Dalton did all of this despite missing both A.J. Green and Marvin Jones. He did a good job of moving the chains for the most part, but the picks were pretty brutal. One was a weak-armed attempt off his back foot, which the Panthers returned 80 yards to set up a Whittaker touchdown. The second sailed on Dalton and led to another Carolina score.    With Green and Jones out, "

   "comment":"Dalton, while the secondary was fantastic. Joe Haden completely shut down A.J. Green, limiting the All-Pro wideout to 3 catches for 23 yards. The offense, meanwhile, was highly efficient. Brian Hoyer's numbers weren't great - 15-of-23, 198 yards - but he played with confidence and made accurate strikes despite missing his top 2 targets (Jordan Cameron, Andrew Hawkins). Hoyer was guilty of a couple of errors - he overthrew an open Travis Benjamin downfield and had a possible interception dropped on a high pass over the middle of the field - but he played well otherwise.    The Browns also ran effectively. As projected, Terrance West handled most of the workload, gaining 94 yards on 26 carries. Things really opened up for him when Geno Atkins was knocked out of the game with a troubled knee. Meanwhile, Isaiah Crowell (12-41) and Ben Tate (10-34) made West's fantasy owners frustrated early on when they each vultured touchdowns away, but West found the end zone later on when he converted on a 1-yard plunge. West fumbled, but he had crossed the goal line prior to coughing up the football.    No 1 Cleveland receiver stood out. Miles Austin led the group with 5 grabs for 48 yards, while Gary Barnidge (2-46), Benjamin (3-46) and Taylor Gabriel (3-31) all contributed. Things will only get better for the Browns, as Hawkins will be back next week, and Josh Gordon will return in Week 12.    The Bengals, meanwhile, did not look like they were prepared to play. Every single NFL Network analyst picked them to win by double digits, so perhaps Cincinnati took this game for granted. The Bengals made so many mistakes all evening, such as an early timeout, a personal foul because of a Greg Little head butt, a flag for 12 men in the huddle, an offsides at the goal line, a Jeremy Hill fumble and countless drops. Having said that, Andy Dalton was the main culprit. He had 1 of the most dreadful performances of any quarterback in recent memory. Most of his passes were high and/or wide of the mark. He also made mental mistakes, including 1 instance where he threw the ball despite being close to 5 yards past the line of scrimmage. Dalton went 10-of-33 for 86 yards and 3 picks, ultimately getting pulled in favor of "

He still needs to win in the playoffs, but he at least was able to finally beat the Texans after dropping 2 postseason games to them earlier in his career. Dalton was stellar in this game despite several injuries to his offensive line. "

   "comment":"Dalton to win the first meeting between these divisional rivals. Roethlisberger began slowly - the teams traded punts on numerous series - but he eventually caught fire, particularly in the second half. Roethlisberger finished 25-of-39 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 11-of-16 for 207 yards and 2 scores after intermission, 1 of which was a 94-yard bomb to Martavis Bryant. Roethlisberger could've put even more points on the board had the officials correctly flagged the Bengals for pass interference in the end zone just prior to the break.    Roethlisberger helped expose the Bengals, who have endured defensive issues all season. The Bengals haven't been able to get pressure on the quarterback or stop the run. The latter problem was also prevalent, as Le'Veon Bell gashed them for 185 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. Bell could've had a third score on the ground, but was incorrectly ruled down inches short of the goal line. Mike Tomlin didn't bother challenging because the Steelers had a first-and-goal at the 1-inch line, and Roethlisberger would end up throwing a touchdown to Heath Miller anyway. Bell, however, made up for the bad call by doing lots of damage in the passing game. He caught 6 passes for 50 receiving yards and a third touchdown. He, Bryant (4-109) and Miller secured Roethlisberger's scores. Antonio Brown didn't find the end zone, but reeled in 9 of his 14 targets for 117 yards.    As for the Bengals, I mentioned that they had a couple of problems. Andy Dalton, of course, is another 1. Dalton has had issues in all 3 Decembers and Januarys in his brief NFL career thus far, and it appears as though that'll once again be the case this year. Dalton's numbers look pretty - 21-of-29 for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), but the bulk of his yardage came on 2 long bombs to "

   "comment":"Dalton and company. The talent mismatch was too apparent; Cleveland played well considering the skill on the roster, but the team was just outclassed.    I almost want to begin my analysis with Manziel, but I'll start with the quarterback who actually has a future in the NFL. Dalton misfired on just 6 attempts, going 21-of-27 for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 14-of-16 in the second half, which is just remarkable. With plenty of talented weapons at his disposal, the Browns and their skeleton-crew secondary simply didn't have a chance. However, something worth noting is that Dalton was under pressure quite a bit in this game. The box score says that the Browns sacked him twice, but in reality, he was brought down 4 times behind the line of scrimmage. Dalton has been protected extremely well all year, so this was a surprise. Offensive line play this year has been crucial, so it's imperative for the Bengals to shore up this area, which was once considered very strong.    "

His ability after the catch was a big factor, and kept the Bengals at least within striking distance.    The Bengals had no luck on the ground against Pittsburgh's front 4. and Jeremy Hill ran for just 22 yards on 11 carries. For the day, the Steelers allowed just 2.6 yards per carry and 46 total rushing yards. That, plus the Steelers' lead throughout, kept the Bengals throwing the ball, and Dalton wasn't up to the task in the rain, as he dinked and dunked and had trouble sustaining drives.    "

   "comment":"Dalton needs any despite what happened at Dallas. I definitely wouldn't say Dalton played poorly despite his team being shut out until late in the game. Dalton finished 29-of-41 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. While a chunk of his yardage came in garbage time, he didn't play poorly beforehand. He was 10-of-14 for 93 yards in the opening half. The problem was all of the pressure he was seeing. He was sacked 4 times, but it seemed like the Cowboys were swarming the backfield on almost every play. DeMarcus Lawrence's return had a lot to do with that. Lawrence didn't log a sack, but he pressured Dalton relentlessly and nearly brought him down on numerous occasions. His presence opened things up for Dallas' other pass-rushers. There was a scary moment for Dalton when he was tackled awkwardly. His foot bent backward and he began limping around after that. However, Dalton was able to move the chains effectively in garbage time after this, so it's probably not a big deal.    Dalton's 2 garbage-time touchdowns were both thrown to "

   "comment":"Dalton took a sack on the next play, resulting in a safety. Following a short kickoff, the Patriots were able to score quickly on their short field, allowing them to establish the lead that they would never relinquish. The third infraction, by the way, negated a forced punt on third-and-12 that would've given the Bengals a chance, down only 8. Again, a hold moved the chains on a situation of longer than 10 yards on third down, even though it was a 5-yard penalty. Pacman Jones was furious at the call, and understandably so. This is all a shame for the Bengals, as they did a great job of pressuring Tom Brady early. Brady definitely didn't look like himself, as he was jittery in the pocket. He also took a handful of sacks, as his offensive line isn't in good shape. Cincinnati had control of this game, but couldn't maintain it because of those 2 infractions. As a result, the Bengals have dropped to 2-4, and their playoff hopes are starting to look pretty bleak.    I mentioned that Brady was jittery early in the afternoon. He looked unsure of himself and seemed concerned with the offensive line. Something the Bengals did was bring their safeties closer to the line of scrimmage, which took away Brady's crossing patterns. The Patriots made the appropriate adjustments at halftime, and Brady's connection with Rob Gronkowski couldn't be stopped as a result. Brady finished 29-of-35 for 376 yards and 3 touchdowns. I never would've imagined that Brady would generate numbers like that after struggling in the opening quarter, but credit the coaching staff for making the appropriate changes and putting Brady into great position. Of course, Brady deserves credit as well for constantly hitting Gronkowski, who finished with 7 grabs for 162 yards and a touchdown. Gronkowski logged just 2 catches in the opening half.    Brady's other touchdowns both went to James White, who caught 8 passes for 47 receiving yards to provide an upgrade over his pedestrian rushing numbers (7-19). Something else Belichick did was have White take advantage of Karlos Dansby's poor coverage. Dansby has been woeful all season, and he was especially horrid this afternoon. He won't be in the league much longer.    Julian Edelman (4-30) didn't do much, but only because the Bengals took away his routes. I'd expect him to bounce back soon. Chris Hogan (1-39) and Martellus Bennett (5-48) also disappointed following solid performances last week.    LeGarrette Blount didn't get a full workload, but he had some impressive scampers. He rushed for 50 yards and a late touchdown on 13 carries. He did manage to outgain both Bengal running backs, however.    Speaking of the Cincinnati runners, Giovani Bernard (15-49) was better than Jeremy Hill (13-38), and he was also a greater factor as a receiver, catching 4 balls for 45 receiving yards. Cincinnati's usage of Hill is embarrassing, as it seems like a wasted down every time he touches the ball. Hill also whiffed on a block during Dalton's safety.    Dalton didn't have a bad performance, going 21-of-31 for 254 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). However, he missed out on a second aerial score because he underthrew "

They entered the red zone, up 3. but Dalton forced a poor throw while under pressure, and the ball sailed right to linebacker Will Compton. The Redskins were able to drive the field for a touchdown to take the lead, and the contest eventually went into overtime, the first extra session that British people have ever seen in person.

   "comment":"Dalton was mediocre for the entire day. His numbers may not look bad at a glance, as he went 24-of-43 for 207 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks, but he really did not do much. Dalton spent a majority of the day dinking and dunking to his receivers. He rarely threw more than 10 yards down the field, and that really hurt the Bengals during the contest. That said, Dalton did have some nice throws. In particular, his touchdown to "

   "comment":"Dalton to Tyler Boyd was negated by a Tyler Eifert hold. Joe Flacco then gift-wrapped an easy scoring opportunity when he threw an interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Bengals took over deep in Baltimore territory, but a botched snap gave the ball right back to the Ravens on a fumble recovery. In the second quarter, the Bengals were given a generous spot on a third down, converting it. They took a timeout for some reason, and Baltimore used that time to determine that the spot was off. John Harbaugh challenged the play, and won the review. The Bengals then declined a penalty that would've taken the Ravens out of field-goal range. Instead, Baltimore was able to kick for 3 points - 1 of 2 occasions in which Justin Tucker drilled a 50-yard field goal in the first half alone. Things didn't get much better for the Bengals after halftime. Mike Nugent missed yet another extra point - this prevented the Bengals from covering the spread - and Andy Dalton was strip-sacked a whopping THREE times. Dalton was fortunate that 2 fumbles that were forced by "

In fact, the Bengals couldn't get anything going whatsoever outside of the end of both halves, save for an 86-yard touchdown to Brandon LaFell that came out of nowhere. LaFell took a short pass and went the distance, thanks to a horrible angle by Andre Hal. Dalton finished 28-of-41 for 268 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, but if you take out that LaFell score, he would've thrown for just 182 yards on 40 attempts, good for a 4.55 YPA. It's difficult to criticize Dalton, however, because he was playing with a skeleton-crew offense.    LaFell naturally led the Bengals in receiving, catching 6 passes for 130 yards and his long touchdown. No 1 else registered more than 40 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Dalton didn't have many opportunities behind a horrific offensive line, so the Bengals had to adjust by making him release the ball much more quickly. This only helped marginally, as the Bengals accumulated 143 net yards in the second half. Dalton finished 20-of-35 for 224 yards. The numbers don't look terrible, but that adjective is exactly how I would describe the Bengal quarterback. Dalton was under duress quite a bit, but he had some chances to hit throws, and his inaccuracy killed him. Dalton had open receivers for big gains on a few occasions, but misfired very poorly. The awful line play is the primary culprit for Cincinnati, but Dalton is the clear No. 2 on the blame list.    "

   "comment":"Dalton was strip-sacked, setting up a short field for Cleveland. The Browns predictably did nothing with the possession, as Kenny Britt slipped on his route on third down, setting up a missed 48-yard field goal, which sailed wide left. The mistakes continued for the Browns after that. DeShone Kizer took a 15-yard sack when the ball was snapped over his head, and he didn't think quickly enough to throw it out of bounds after collecting it. Pacman Jones then had a 40-yard punt return to set up a touchdown. The Browns proceeded to move the chains after that, but a pair of drops ended the drive. Britt's drop turned into an interception because the ball popped into the air, and that set up another Cincinnati score. Giovani Bernard followed that up with a long touchdown on a busted coverage, and just like that, the game was over with the Bengals going up by 3 touchdowns. Dalton was extremely sharp, going 25-of-30 for 286 yards and 4 touchdowns. It helped that he was battling a defense missing its 2 best linemen, Myles Garrett and Danny Shelton, so his putrid blocking unit wasn't tested at all. Dalton was able to torch Cleveland's abysmal secondary with ease.    Cincinnati's poor blocking was apparent in the ground game. Many fantasy prognosticators expected a big game from "

   "comment":"Dalton was sacked 3 times, but pressured more often than a poor Indianapolis pass rush should be able to accomplish.    The Colts' passing offense was dink and dunking their way all day, but effectively, as tight end Jack Doyle caught 12-of-14 targets for 121 yards and 1 touchdown. His second-most targeted receiver, T.Y. Hilton, was kept under wraps, as he caught just 2-of-7 targets for 15 yards.    This week, we saw a bit of a resurgence from Frank Gore as well. He rushed 16 times for 82 yards and caught all 4 of his targets for 19 yards. His previous rushing high this season had been 57 yards, but on 25 carries against Cleveland in Week 2. Cincinnati had kept running backs rushing at a 3.6 yards-per-carry clip so far, this year, so old man Gore taking it to the Bengals was a bit of a surprise.    The Bengals once again started their offense with Jeremy Hill as the lead back for some reason. Hill did fine with a couple of good runs on their first drive, but then, as usual, Joe Mixon came in as the lead back. Mixon, on his first carry, tripped over himself as he tried getting outside, and later, he lost a fumble. Mixon is Cincinnati's best running back and deserves to start, despite his troubles this week, and giving Hill the honorary start is just ludicrous. Mixon did show his ability on a middle screen, which he took for 67 yards. Right now, I'd say he needs his coach to show more faith in him and take the good with the bad, because with Hill, all you are really getting is the bad. Mixon did little on the ground, but ended up with 3 receptions for 91 yards, while no other receiver topped 46, as the Colts did all they could to slow down A.J. Green. Green did find the end zone on a crucial third-and-goal, but ended the day catching just 3-of-8 targets for 27 yards and a touchdown. The Colts came into this game allowing the most 20-plus-yard receptions, which of course fit perfectly into Green's deep-ball ability, but not this week. It was a big reason the Colts were able to stay in this game.    Colts rookie running back Marlon Mack continues to shine in his limited role, but with Gore touching the ball 20 times, Mack's workload, though decent, is going to remain capped. He ran the ball 11 times, but for just 27 yards, but was able to do his best work in the air and at a crucial point in the game. With the Colts down after a 25-yard touchdown from Andy Dalton to rookie Josh Malone, the Colts, who aren't known for their quick answers, answered that touchdown with a nice 88-yard drive that capped off in a perfectly timed screen to Mack, which avoided the blitz on third down and went for a 24-yard touchdown, giving the Colts the lead, 20-17 as they went into the 4."
