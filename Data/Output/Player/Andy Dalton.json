   "comment":"Andy Dalton pass hit him right in the numbers. Dalton had a touchdown thrown to Bernard Scott, but the backup running back dropped the ball. Dalton also took unnecessary sacks and wasted too much time in 2 potential comeback drives in the 4.h quarter.    With all of that being said, the Bengals still had a chance to win this game with 2 35-yard Hail Mary attempts. The first should have given them the ball on the 1-yard line because corner Lardarius Webb committed a blatant pass interference penalty that wasn't called. I know that such infractions are seldom whistled on Hail Mary attempts, but it was ridiculous. Webb grabbed Green's shoulder and pulled him down. It looked like Green had a good chance to haul in the pass.    Green had a pretty disappointing performance, catching just 2 balls for 26 yards. That's because Andy Dalton was erratic all afternoon, going 22-of-44 for 232 yards. He should have been picked off a couple of times.    Paling into comparison to Rice's 191 yards (24 carries) and 2 touchdowns, "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton to the ground after a play was ruled dead in the 4.h quarter. This bothered Cincinnati left tackle Andrew Whitworth, who then headbutted Houston. The 2 teams started fighting, and the ultra-lazy Tommy Kelly, who apparently was bored with football and wanted a change of pace with his life, took off his helmet for no apparent reason. All 3 players were ejected.    The Raiders went down early, training 21-0, thanks to a career-long 48-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis burst - a sure sign that a defense has thrown in the towel. Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage. It also must be mentioned that Dalton was able to convert 9-of-15 third downs.    Two of Dalton's scores went to "

Dalton was very sharp if the 2 interceptions are excluded. He completed a high number of passes (26-of-33) for 282 yards and the 2 aforementioned touchdowns that Green caught.    Dalton and Green had a great connection, but the third-year quarterback also focused on getting the ball to his tight ends. "

They outgained Cincinnati, 399-297. The Bengals were helpless to stop the Green Bay ground attack - which makes it ironic that 1 of the Packer running backs was mostly responsible for this defeat.    Rodgers had a rough afternoon - 26-of-43, 244 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks - as the Bengals' defensive line was in his face the entire contest. Cincinnati also batted down what seemed like 100 passes. Rodgers was so frustrated that he and Mike McCarthy had an angry exchange of words on the sideline following a botched red-zone attempt.

Dalton's completion percentage and yardage - 32-of-53 for 338 yards - don't look too bad, but he missed too many open receivers in this contest. He converted quality throws, including some clutch passes on third down, but his turnovers were costly. He opened with a lost fumble on a strip-sack deep in his own territory. He then went on to throw 3 interceptions. The second 1 occurred in the red zone; it was behind his intended receiver on an out, which "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton? It's a fair question. Dalton failed to throw a single touchdown in 2 playoff losses prior to this game, but both of those were on the road in Houston. This was a matchup in which he was fully expected to succeed. After all, Kansas City's second-stringers would have defeated this team had the officials recognized an illegal defensive formation. Chase Daniel thrived against San Diego's defense, so no 1 envisioned Dalton failing, especially given that he was a perfect 8-0 at home this year. Dalton sucked. He really sucked. The stats will show that he threw for 331 yards and a touchdown on 28-of-50 passing, but he missed receivers all afternoon. He failed to connect with several open targets, but he at least stayed turnover-free in the first half. However, the floodgates opened following intermission. It started when Dalton lost a fumble when diving head-first toward the first-down marker. He then forced an interception under pressure and went on to toss another pick that he telegraphed. Linebacker Melvin Ingram, who has sparked San Diego's defense since his return in Week 14, made the interception. Ingram had a great game.    Dalton rightfully deserves most of the blame, but several other Cincinnati players screwed up. This includes "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton managed to hit A.J. Green with a 77-yard bomb. Green snagged it off a deflection and ran into the end zone for what turned out to be the decisive score. Dalton finished 25-of-38 for 301 yards and that touchdown, though he was just 7-of-14 following intermission. Green, meanwhile, made 6 catches for 131 yards and the score.    Giovani Bernard rushed for 48 yards on 14 carries, and he also paced the team with 10 targets, catching 6 of them for 62 receiving yards. His fantasy owners must have been thrilled to see Jeremy Hill receive just 4 carries. He won't be much of a fantasy factor unless Bernard gets injured.    With Marvin Jones out and Tyler Eifert banged up, Mohamed Sanu is worth an add. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards. He dropped a pass in the 4.h quarter, but it's not like Dalton has many other options.    While Baltimore's offense is decrepit, the defense has to be a major concern as well. There was zero pass rush in this game; Andy Dalton wasn't sacked at all, and I can't even remember him even getting hit once. As for Cincinnati's stop unit, "

Dalton is mostly responsible for his team's struggles in the red zone, and it's not going to get easier for him because he just battled 2 pretty weak defenses.

   "comment":"Andy Dalton were trying their best to lose. Both signal-callers had miserable performances, with each being responsible for multiple turnovers. Dalton, however, was the least worse of the 2. and he managed to stop being inept enough to lead his team to a victory at the very end. Dalton's completion percentage and yardage don't look terrible - 21-of-28, 266 yards - but he had the fans moaning and groaning in the 4.h quarter. Most of Dalton's errors came late. He had an overthrow in the end zone, missing a potential touchdown. He then did a poor job of securing the football and lost a fumble. Dalton followed that up with an interception on the next drive, but that was really a "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton, while the secondary was fantastic. Joe Haden completely shut down A.J. Green, limiting the All-Pro wideout to 3 catches for 23 yards. The offense, meanwhile, was highly efficient. Brian Hoyer's numbers weren't great - 15-of-23, 198 yards - but he played with confidence and made accurate strikes despite missing his top 2 targets (Jordan Cameron, Andrew Hawkins). Hoyer was guilty of a couple of errors - he overthrew an open Travis Benjamin downfield and had a possible interception dropped on a high pass over the middle of the field - but he played well otherwise.    The Browns also ran effectively. As projected, Terrance West handled most of the workload, gaining 94 yards on 26 carries. Things really opened up for him when Geno Atkins was knocked out of the game with a troubled knee. Meanwhile, Isaiah Crowell (12-41) and Ben Tate (10-34) made West's fantasy owners frustrated early on when they each vultured touchdowns away, but West found the end zone later on when he converted on a 1-yard plunge. West fumbled, but he had crossed the goal line prior to coughing up the football.    No 1 Cleveland receiver stood out. Miles Austin led the group with 5 grabs for 48 yards, while Gary Barnidge (2-46), Benjamin (3-46) and Taylor Gabriel (3-31) all contributed. Things will only get better for the Browns, as Hawkins will be back next week, and Josh Gordon will return in Week 12.    The Bengals, meanwhile, did not look like they were prepared to play. Every single NFL Network analyst picked them to win by double digits, so perhaps Cincinnati took this game for granted. The Bengals made so many mistakes all evening, such as an early timeout, a personal foul because of a Greg Little head butt, a flag for 12 men in the huddle, an offsides at the goal line, a Jeremy Hill fumble and countless drops. Having said that, Andy Dalton was the main culprit. He had 1 of the most dreadful performances of any quarterback in recent memory. Most of his passes were high and/or wide of the mark. He also made mental mistakes, including 1 instance where he threw the ball despite being close to 5 yards past the line of scrimmage. Dalton went 10-of-33 for 86 yards and 3 picks, ultimately getting pulled in favor of "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton to win the first meeting between these divisional rivals. Roethlisberger began slowly - the teams traded punts on numerous series - but he eventually caught fire, particularly in the second half. Roethlisberger finished 25-of-39 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 11-of-16 for 207 yards and 2 scores after intermission, 1 of which was a 94-yard bomb to Martavis Bryant. Roethlisberger could've put even more points on the board had the officials correctly flagged the Bengals for pass interference in the end zone just prior to the break.    Roethlisberger helped expose the Bengals, who have endured defensive issues all season. The Bengals haven't been able to get pressure on the quarterback or stop the run. The latter problem was also prevalent, as Le'Veon Bell gashed them for 185 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. Bell could've had a third score on the ground, but was incorrectly ruled down inches short of the goal line. Mike Tomlin didn't bother challenging because the Steelers had a first-and-goal at the 1-inch line, and Roethlisberger would end up throwing a touchdown to Heath Miller anyway. Bell, however, made up for the bad call by doing lots of damage in the passing game. He caught 6 passes for 50 receiving yards and a third touchdown. He, Bryant (4-109) and Miller secured Roethlisberger's scores. Antonio Brown didn't find the end zone, but reeled in 9 of his 14 targets for 117 yards.    As for the Bengals, I mentioned that they had a couple of problems. Andy Dalton, of course, is another 1. Dalton has had issues in all 3 Decembers and Januarys in his brief NFL career thus far, and it appears as though that'll once again be the case this year. Dalton's numbers look pretty - 21-of-29 for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), but the bulk of his yardage came on 2 long bombs to "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton and A.J. Green dominated the Ravens through the air. Dalton and Green each set career highs for yards. Baltimore almost pulled out a win thanks to the inspired play of Steve Smith, but in the end, Dalton and Green were too dominant for Smith to overcome.    The Bengals got on the board first when Dalton connected with Marvin Jones along the sideline for 32 yards. In the red zone, the Ravens hurt themselves as Courtney Upshaw dropped an interception and a penalty on Will Hill gave the Bengals a first down. Dalton finished the drive by diving into the end zone after a 7-yard run. Ravens answered with a drive that was led by a Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith. After the 2-minute warning, the Bengals were set up for a 4.h-and-1 that needed a half yard. Marvin Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by Chris Carter moved the ball to the Bengals' 23-yard line. The Cincinnati defense tightened and forced a short field goal to cut Cincinnati's lead to 14-10. The Ravens took the lead midway through the 4.h quarter when Elvis Dumervil beat Eifert around the corner to get a blind-side strip-sack on Dalton. Linebacker C.J. Mosley scooped up the loose ball and ran it 41 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 17-14 lead. The Bengals answered in tremendous fashion. Dalton hit Green down the seam to around midfield. He broke a tackle from Smith and maintained his feet to run 80 yards for a touchdown. It was a coverage bust as safety Kendrick Lewis was lined up at corner and Will Hill was caught out of position downfield. Baltimore moved back into Cincinnati territory thanks to completions to Smith. The old veteran beat the bigger cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick for a contested catch on a 16-yard touchdown to give the Ravens a 24-21 lead with just under 4 minutes remaining. At this point, the defenses looked gassed and incapable of covering. Dalton hit a 19-yard completion to Mohamed Sanu, and then, Jones caught a 31-yard pass over Kyle Arrington to the Ravens' 7-yard line. Dalton went back to his money-man with a touchdown pass to Green against Smith. Cincinnati's defense finally got a stop to clinch the win for the Bengals.    Andy Dalton completed 20-of-32 passes for 383 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for a touchdown. That yardage total was a career high for Dalton.    A.J. Green also set a new career high with 227 yards through the air on 10 receptions with 2 scores. Green was awesome, and the Ravens were completely incapable of covering him.    The Bengals' ground game was disappointing from a fantasy perspective as Gio Bernard (13-49) and "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton didn't have his best fantasy game ever. And your inference would be correct, but even with 4 touchdowns that are in no way credited to his fantasy day, he ended up throwing for 321 yards and a touchdown. This was his first game of the season with fewer than 2 touchdowns, and it shouldn't deter you from believing Dalton could have thrown 5 touchdowns in this game if the coaches had pushed the offense that way.    On the other side of the field was a team that was much less efficient near the end zone. Kansas City scored 21 points, but did not score 1 touchdown. That should be a riddle for middle-schoolers.

He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.

   "comment":"Andy Dalton and company. The talent mismatch was too apparent; Cleveland played well considering the skill on the roster, but the team was just outclassed.    I almost want to begin my analysis with Manziel, but I'll start with the quarterback who actually has a future in the NFL. Dalton misfired on just 6 attempts, going 21-of-27 for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 14-of-16 in the second half, which is just remarkable. With plenty of talented weapons at his disposal, the Browns and their skeleton-crew secondary simply didn't have a chance. However, something worth noting is that Dalton was under pressure quite a bit in this game. The box score says that the Browns sacked him twice, but in reality, he was brought down 4 times behind the line of scrimmage. Dalton has been protected extremely well all year, so this was a surprise. Offensive line play this year has been crucial, so it's imperative for the Bengals to shore up this area, which was once considered very strong.    "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton's injury. Dalton, unfortunately, appears to be out for the year.    The Cincinnati Bengals came into this game looking to clinch the division title with a win over their rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Both offenses came into this game playing well, with Pittsburgh averaging 35 points over their last 3 games and the Bengals 33 in that same span.    Injuries to their star quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, and star running back Le'Veon Bell, had kept the Steelers from hitting all cylinders this season, as was seen in these 2 teams' first meeting when Roethlisberger was just returning from a sprained MCL and looked extremely rusty as he threw 3 interceptions in a 16-10 loss at Heinz Field. In that game, Bell was lost for the season after a clean hit by Vontaze Burfict, but the Steelers took exception to Burfict celebrating while Bell was down in pain. No matter what side you are on, both teams were extremely hyped for this second meeting. Before the game started, these teams were scuffling and all throughout the game as well.    The drama and importance of this game lost a little of its edge after Andy Dalton broke his thumb on the Bengals' first possession. After Dalton had driven his team deep into the Steelers' territory on their first possession, he made an errant shovel pass that was intercepted by defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton needs any despite what happened at Dallas. I definitely wouldn't say Dalton played poorly despite his team being shut out until late in the game. Dalton finished 29-of-41 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. While a chunk of his yardage came in garbage time, he didn't play poorly beforehand. He was 10-of-14 for 93 yards in the opening half. The problem was all of the pressure he was seeing. He was sacked 4 times, but it seemed like the Cowboys were swarming the backfield on almost every play. DeMarcus Lawrence's return had a lot to do with that. Lawrence didn't log a sack, but he pressured Dalton relentlessly and nearly brought him down on numerous occasions. His presence opened things up for Dallas' other pass-rushers. There was a scary moment for Dalton when he was tackled awkwardly. His foot bent backward and he began limping around after that. However, Dalton was able to move the chains effectively in garbage time after this, so it's probably not a big deal.    Dalton's 2 garbage-time touchdowns were both thrown to "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton took a sack on the next play, resulting in a safety. Following a short kickoff, the Patriots were able to score quickly on their short field, allowing them to establish the lead that they would never relinquish. The third infraction, by the way, negated a forced punt on third-and-12 that would've given the Bengals a chance, down only 8. Again, a hold moved the chains on a situation of longer than 10 yards on third down, even though it was a 5-yard penalty. Pacman Jones was furious at the call, and understandably so. This is all a shame for the Bengals, as they did a great job of pressuring "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton was mediocre for the entire day. His numbers may not look bad at a glance, as he went 24-of-43 for 207 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks, but he really did not do much. Dalton spent a majority of the day dinking and dunking to his receivers. He rarely threw more than 10 yards down the field, and that really hurt the Bengals during the contest. That said, Dalton did have some nice throws. In particular, his touchdown to Tyler Boyd was a pretty pass. Dalton lofted it to the perfect spot in the back of the end zone where only his rookie receiver could grab it. That was Dalton's best play of the day. However, his interceptions were both brutal. The first was underthrown, and it was wobbling like crazy. On the second, he threw well behind Tyler Eifert, and it was tipped to Stephon Gilmore. Overall, Sunday was a tough day for Dalton, and the loss can partially be blamed on him.    Of course, there was another major reason for Dalton's struggles today. On the second offensive play of the day for the Bengals, A.J. Green left the game with a hamstring injury. He would not return. The stud receiver was writhing around in pain, and it frankly did not look good. The Bengals are fearing that Green tore his hamstring. With Green bound to miss time, look for Tyler Boyd to pick up some extra catches. The rookie looked fairly solid during the contest and emerged as Dalton's top target with Green out. Boyd ended up catching 6 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. This could be the beginning of a strong stretch for the second-round pick. Elsewhere, Brandon LaFell (4-32) and Eifert (3-37) were both decent. LaFell is still just a middling fantasy option at best. If Green is out longer term, LaFell could be a valuable bench asset.    In the running game, Jeremy Hill looked strong for the Bengals. Hill got 16 carries for 62 yards, but he performed better than those numbers. He ripped off a few nice gains and was able to move the pile in short-yardage and red-zone situations. Hill had a nice 20-yard burst that reminded many that he can be explosive when he needs to be. Hill should continue to be the starter for the Bengals. Meanwhile, Giovani Bernard put together a good game as well. He only got 21 yards on 7 carries, but he made an impact in the receiving attack. Bernard was Dalton's top checkdown, recording 5 catches for 40 yards. Unfortunately, Bernard tore his ACL.    The late-game clock management from Marvin Lewis and Andy Dalton was not too good. Dalton had just over 2 minutes to drive the ball down the field without any timeouts. Dalton was able to get the ball moving, but he constantly threw checkdowns over the middle of the field. The team needed a touchdown to have a chance at winning, but as a result of the play-calling, the Bengals were only able to have enough time to try a 30-yard Hail Mary. They were unable to convert as time expired.    Sunday was a bad day for kickers, and "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton was mediocre for the entire day. His numbers may not look bad at a glance, as he went 24-of-43 for 207 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks, but he really did not do much. Dalton spent a majority of the day dinking and dunking to his receivers. He rarely threw more than 10 yards down the field, and that really hurt the Bengals during the contest. That said, Dalton did have some nice throws. In particular, his touchdown to Tyler Boyd was a pretty pass. Dalton lofted it to the perfect spot in the back of the end zone where only his rookie receiver could grab it. That was Dalton's best play of the day. However, his interceptions were both brutal. The first was underthrown, and it was wobbling like crazy. On the second, he threw well behind Tyler Eifert, and it was tipped to Stephon Gilmore. Overall, Sunday was a tough day for Dalton, and the loss can partially be blamed on him.    Of course, there was another major reason for Dalton's struggles today. On the second offensive play of the day for the Bengals, A.J. Green left the game with a hamstring injury. He would not return. The stud receiver was writhing around in pain, and it frankly did not look good. The Bengals are fearing that Green tore his hamstring. With Green bound to miss time, look for Tyler Boyd to pick up some extra catches. The rookie looked fairly solid during the contest and emerged as Dalton's top target with Green out. Boyd ended up catching 6 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. This could be the beginning of a strong stretch for the second-round pick. Elsewhere, Brandon LaFell (4-32) and Eifert (3-37) were both decent. LaFell is still just a middling fantasy option at best. If Green is out longer term, LaFell could be a valuable bench asset.    In the running game, Jeremy Hill looked strong for the Bengals. Hill got 16 carries for 62 yards, but he performed better than those numbers. He ripped off a few nice gains and was able to move the pile in short-yardage and red-zone situations. Hill had a nice 20-yard burst that reminded many that he can be explosive when he needs to be. Hill should continue to be the starter for the Bengals. Meanwhile, Giovani Bernard put together a good game as well. He only got 21 yards on 7 carries, but he made an impact in the receiving attack.

   "comment":"Andy Dalton to Tyler Boyd was negated by a Tyler Eifert hold. Joe Flacco then gift-wrapped an easy scoring opportunity when he threw an interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Bengals took over deep in Baltimore territory, but a botched snap gave the ball right back to the Ravens on a fumble recovery. In the second quarter, the Bengals were given a generous spot on a third down, converting it. They took a timeout for some reason, and Baltimore used that time to determine that the spot was off. John Harbaugh challenged the play, and won the review. The Bengals then declined a penalty that would've taken the Ravens out of field-goal range. Instead, Baltimore was able to kick for 3 points - 1 of 2 occasions in which Justin Tucker drilled a 50-yard field goal in the first half alone. Things didn't get much better for the Bengals after halftime. Mike Nugent missed yet another extra point - this prevented the Bengals from covering the spread - and Andy Dalton was strip-sacked a whopping THREE times. Dalton was fortunate that 2 fumbles that were forced by "

When the Steelers and Bengals meet, there's always a heightened sense of competition and each hit seems to have more impact.

   "comment":"Andy Dalton will get blamed for the 4.interception performance, but this is the first time in his career that he's playing behind a weak offensive line. Dalton has always benefited from great blocking, but that won't be the case anymore. Now, we'll see his mediocrity get exposed as a result. Dalton finished 16-of-31 for 170 yards and the 4 picks. He also lost a fumble in the red zone. Two of the interceptions were tipped. One was a horrible decision, while the 4.h came in meaningless action late in the game. Dalon made some other horrendous throws, including a bad overthrow on a third down in the second quarter. "

   "comment":"Andy Dalton didn't have many opportunities behind a horrific offensive line, so the Bengals had to adjust by making him release the ball much more quickly. This only helped marginally, as the Bengals accumulated 143 net yards in the second half. Dalton finished 20-of-35 for 224 yards. The numbers don't look terrible, but that adjective is exactly how I would describe the Bengal quarterback. Dalton was under duress quite a bit, but he had some chances to hit throws, and his inaccuracy killed him. Dalton had open receivers for big gains on a few occasions, but misfired very poorly. The awful line play is the primary culprit for Cincinnati, but Dalton is the clear No. 2 on the blame list.    "

The Bengals then produced 2 more 3.and-outs before committing a turnover on downs. Cincinnati ended up with 1 first down the entire second half!
