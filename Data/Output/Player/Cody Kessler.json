   "comment":"Cody Kessler fumbled his first snap; and then Kessler was strip-sacked on third-and-9 when Cameron Wake ran around Austin Pasztor quite easily. Following a Miami touchdown, it appeared as though the Dolphins would win this game quite easily, but the Browns managed to hang around and even hold a 13-10 lead into the third quarter. The offense was run primarily through Terrelle Pryor, who threw passes, rushed on some plays and caught some balls. The Dolphins, meanwhile, killed themselves with mistakes, which I'll discuss later. Miami managed to take the lead, but the Browns struck back with multiple scores and put themselves in position to kick a game-winning field goal. Cody Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards. He was an absolute monster, and it makes me wonder what Oakland's offense would look like if it had Pryor in addition to Kessler fumbled his first snap; and then Kessler was strip-sacked on third-and-9 when Cameron Wake ran around Austin Pasztor quite easily."

It's a shame that the Browns couldn't get a full look at their young quarterback against a divisional rival, especially when considering that he was playing well. On the other hand, you could consider Cleveland to be very lucky that it continues to lose, given that it is currently the favorite to land the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. It seems as though the Browns would've been more competitive had Kessler managed to stay on the field. It was a tight game when he got knocked out, as Kessler was 9-of-11 for 82 yards.

His final snap in this contest occurred with a lead. The Ravens took over and managed to score a touchdown with a horrific non-call by incompetent official Jerome Boger on what should've been an intentional grounding on Flacco, who failed to get the ball past the line of scrimmage. The Ravens were leading only 13-7 at that point, and Cleveland was still well in the game. Considering that Kessler had not turned the ball over and wasn't performing poorly, no head coach with a clue would've benched him. But Jackson did. And the results were disastrous. Kessler had been playing somewhat well, as he stood 11-of-18 for 91 yards and a touchdown in slightly more than a half of action. His final snap in this contest occurred with a lead.
