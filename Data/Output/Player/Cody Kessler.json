It's a shame that the Browns couldn't get a full look at their young quarterback against a divisional rival, especially when considering that he was playing well. On the other hand, you could consider Cleveland to be very lucky that it continues to lose, given that it is currently the favorite to land the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. It seems as though the Browns would've been more competitive had Kessler managed to stay on the field. It was a tight game when he got knocked out, as Kessler was 9-of-11 for 82 yards. Even when Kessler was playing, Cleveland was utilizing fifth-string quarterback "

The Erving ejection did matter though, as the Browns scored just once in his absence. Dallas was able to rack up 4 sacks. When Cody Kessler had time in the pocket, he did an OK job. Kessler went 19-of-27 for 203 yards and a touchdown. He nearly threw a pick on an overthrow. These stats were actually not a byproduct of garbage time; Kessler was just 5-of-7 for 36 yards following intermission. He didn't get much of a chance to do anything because the Cowboys were able to grind the game out and control the clock. Dallas won the time-of-possession battle by a whopping 19 minutes, and Cleveland ran just 14 offensive plays in the second half!

The Ravens took over and managed to score a touchdown with a horrific non-call by incompetent official Jerome Boger on what should've been an intentional grounding on Flacco, who failed to get the ball past the line of scrimmage. The Ravens were leading only 13-7 at that point, and Cleveland was still well in the game. Considering that Kessler had not turned the ball over and wasn't performing poorly, no head coach with a clue would've benched him. But Jackson did. And the results were disastrous. "
