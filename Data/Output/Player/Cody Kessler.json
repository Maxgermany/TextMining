   "comment":"Cody Kessler fumbled his first snap; and then Kessler was strip-sacked on third-and-9 when Cameron Wake ran around Austin Pasztor quite easily. Following a Miami touchdown, it appeared as though the Dolphins would win this game quite easily, but the Browns managed to hang around and even hold a 13-10 lead into the third quarter. The offense was run primarily through Terrelle Pryor, who threw passes, rushed on some plays and caught some balls. The Dolphins, meanwhile, killed themselves with mistakes, which I'll discuss later. Miami managed to take the lead, but the Browns struck back with multiple scores and put themselves in position to kick a game-winning field goal. Cody Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards. He was an absolute monster, and it makes me wonder what Oakland's offense would look like if it had Pryor in addition to "
