   "comment":"Cole (3-47) didn't have the best stat line, but he made a sick, 1.handed catch on a third-and-10 in the opening quarter.    As for the Bengals, you can see that their stats were suppressed because of the lost time-of-possession battle. Dalton was just 10-of-18 for 136 yards. Considering that Cincinnati trailed throughout, it's an indication that the Jaguars dominated the clock. While Cincinnati's defense couldn't get off the field, the offense struggled to keep drives alive, converting only 1-of-8 third-down attempts. The Bengals simply couldn't block Jacksonville's front.    Only 2 Bengals generated more than 15 receiving yards: "
