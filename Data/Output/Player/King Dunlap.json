   "comment":"King Dunlap, Orlando Franklin, D.Dunlap, Orlando Franklin, D.J. Fluker, Manti Te'o, Corey Liuget, Ladarius Green and Denzel Perryman back from injury in this game. This was 1 of 8 reasons I made the Chargers my Pick of the Month. They were 2-7 entering this game, but I thought they'd play better with all of their players back. Apparently not, as my $880 went up in flames. The big issue for the Chargers has been their pass protection. Philip Rivers has barely had any time to hook up with his receivers. Dunlap, Fluker and Franklin returning should've helped, but apparently not. Dunlap was so bad that he was even worse than his replacements, prompting the Chargers to bench him. "
