   "comment":"Coples and was knocked out of the game with Charlie Whitehurst replacing him. Whitehurst moved the ball down the field in the third quarter for another Succop field goal. The Jets had a shocking answer, as Smith lofted a pass to Eric Decker down the sideline. Decker took off for another 55 yards after the catch to get an 81-yard touchdown for New York. However, the review ruled that Decker (7-100) stepped out of bounds at the 33-yard line. A fight broke out during the review with Casey throwing a punch to land a 15-yard penalty and help New York. After Percy Harvin (1 carry for 10 yards) dropped a potential touchdown, Smith tossed a touchdown pass to John Connor on a 4.h-and-1. The Titans answered with a 51-yard field goal from Succop to take a 11-10 lead. After stopping the Jets on a third down and poised to get great field position, Wesley Woodyard was flagged for an unsportsmanlike penalty that gave New York a first down. It was a critical play in the game. Chris Johnson (10-55) then took off on a run of 37 on a wildcat play to set up the Jets at Tennessee's 4-yard line. That was the only noteworthy play for Johnson going against his former team. A few plays later, Chris Ivory (12-25) ran the ball into the end zone for the game-winning score.    Whitehurst was 10-of-24 for 203 yards while Shonn Greene (16-50) led Tennessee on the ground. Delanie Walker had 4 receptions for 93 yards. He nearly scored on a crazy play at the very end that resembled the Music City Miracle, but he ran out of bounds about 10 yards short of the end zone.    Smith completed 16-of-28 for 179 yards for the Jets. He wasn't impressive, but avoided turnovers.    Both teams got good games out of their defenses. Casey and Coples both stood out with impressive play.   "
