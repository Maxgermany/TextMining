After a loss by Leonhard snagged an interception in plus territory, but injured his knee and is reportedly done for the season. Perhaps it is a case of d?j? vu, since he went down late in 2010, yet the team still rallied to make the AFC Championship Game. New York is going to miss his presence down the stretch, but the turnover led to a quick score. Greene caught a pass and took it 36 yards. After a loss by LaDainian Tomlinson, Sanchez threw to Santonio Holmes for a touchdown and the 14-3 advantage. Then the Jets relaxed and started to really impose their will. Tomlinson and Greene were given 3 carries each on the next drive with Greene capping the 69-yard touchdown march for a commanding 21-3 lead. The very next drive started at the Kansas City 35 because of a great punt return (26 yards) from rookie wide receiver Jeremy Kerley, who had to return punts in Leonhard's absence. Tomlinson had 1 of the receiving touchdowns, which was reminiscent of his prime with the Chargers, taking it 19 yards to the end zone, making it 28-3 at the half. There wasn't anything the Chiefs could do after the break, facing a huge deficit. They at least logged a bit of yardage to avoid the poor field position that plagued them in the second quarter, but the Jets went 90 yards for a touchdown to really ice the game. The big plays in that march were all Kansas City penalties. The Chiefs were flagged 5 times for an astounding 81 yards and Sanchez capped the drive with a 3-yard run, and at 35-3, the rout was on. After an exchange of punts, Kansas City's offense finally got something as the game entered the 4.h quarter. Palko (16-for-32 195 yards, TD, INT) connected with "
