All of Tampa Bay's running backs struggled to find running room against the Lions front 7. The Bucs' inability to control the ball prevented them from getting Blount more carries in the first half. In the final 2 quarters, Tampa Bay was forced to throw the ball and play their 2.minute offense package that has Earnest Graham in the game instead of Blount. The second-year Blount finished with 15 yards on 5 carries. In order for Blount to be featured more, the Bucs have to be competitive throughout the game.    Tampa Bay struggled to get their top receivers involved. Tight end Kellen Winslow had 6 catches for 66 yards while Mike Williams finished with 4 receptions for 50 yards and a score. Many of the passes thrown to Winslow and Williams were off the mark, and the 1. that were catchable rarely hit them when they had room to run.   "

   "comment":"Graham was knocked out of bounds and rolled through the legs of his head coach Sean Payton. Payton suffered a torn knee ligament and a leg fracture. That caused him to call the game for the bench for a time before moving upstairs. The Saints' offense didn't seem to click on all cylinders without their coach in his normal spot. A few plays after Payton went out, Saints running back Pierre Thomas fumbled the ball away and it turned into a field goal for Tampa Bay. The Saints answered with a 38-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees to Marcus Colston. Colston ran by Ronde Barber and safety Sean Jones was late coming over the top. Tampa Bay took the lead back with a 65-yard touchdown pass from Josh Freeman to wide receiver Arrelious Benn. The second-year wide out ran wide open in busted coverage, and Freeman lofted a ball that led him down the field. Backup running back Earnest Graham then had a 34-yard run and a 19-yard screen pass to set up a field goal for the Buccaneers. Safety "
