He should've picked up a defensive pass interference, but there was no call even though he was being tackled before the ball reached him.    Meanwhile, Patterson failed to do anything all afternoon, reeling in just 1 of his 7 targets for 9 yards. As mentioned, Patterson's struggles weren't really his fault (excluding a drop); Bridgewater just couldn't connect with him on some potential big plays downfield. Bridgewater will need to convert those passes if he wants to take the next step.    Before moving on to the Redskins, I have to say that I feel sorry for "
