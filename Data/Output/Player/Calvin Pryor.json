   "comment":"Calvin Pryor dropped an easy 1). Also, most of Carr's yardage came on the team's final offensive drive of the game in which the Jets were playing prevent because they were up 19-7. Carr barely attempted anything downfield. In fact, the Raiders' offense had 85 yards on 43 plays with 3 minutes remaining in regulation. At that time, Carr had thrown downfield more than 15 yards only once. He tried to dink and dunk the either contest, and that proved to be a poor strategy.    Carr's dinking and dunking didn't work because the Raiders couldn't establish the run at all. The Jets' ferocious run defense made sure that didn't happen. "
