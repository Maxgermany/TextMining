   "comment":"Bishop Sankey had been somewhat effective earlier on the possession. Baltimore's offense, meanwhile, had issues keeping possessions alive. It had just 5 first downs in the opening half, as the Titans placed heavy pressure on Sankey had been somewhat effective earlier on the possession. Baltimore's offense, meanwhile, had issues keeping possessions alive. It had just 5 first downs in the opening half, as the Titans placed heavy pressure on Joe Flacco. He took 1 sack on the afternoon, but Flacco had to hurry his throws, and Baltimore couldn't get into any sort of rhythm as a result. Things completely changed following intermission, as the Ravens made the appropriate adjustments. It was their goal to pound the ball with Justin Forsett, who totaled 92 of his 112 yards (on 20 carries) in the second half. He also scored twice, including 1 instance in which he broke outside on a 4.h-and-1 try in the red zone and outran Kamerion Wimbley. Flacco, meanwhile, converted 9-of-13 attempts in the second half after going 7-of-14 prior to intermission. He finished 16-of-27 for 169 yards and a touchdown, which was thrown to Torrey Smith. It was a 32-yarder that sealed the victory for the Ravens, putting them up 14.    Smith led the team with 5 catches for 75 yards. He was the only Raven with more than 26 receiving yards. Steve Smith saw 7 targets go his way, but converted only 3 of them for 17 yards.    The Ravens lost center Jeremy Zuttah to an injury late in the game. They're fortunate they have a bye coming up, so Zuttah will have an extra week to get healthy.    As for Mettenberger, he had a horrific second half. He completed just 3 passes following intermission, as it hurt him that he was missing Delanie Walker, who was carted into the locker room in the second quarter with a scary-looking concussion. Mettenberger finished 16-of-27 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception in desperation time. He also took a bad sack at the goal line that should have been ruled a safety. Mettenberger needs to stop holding on to the ball too long in the pocket. He took 5 sacks as a consequence. Mettenberger's leading receiver had just 53 yards. That was Kendall Wright, who converted 4 of 7 targets thrown to him. Walker was next (3-37) even though he missed a complete half of action.    As mentioned, Sankey was way more effective than Greene. He tallied 58 yards on 17 carries, and he also caught 3 balls for 19 receiving yards. Greene (3-5) was not seen following his fumble.   "
