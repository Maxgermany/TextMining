   "comment":"Beasley was an absolute monster, registering 3.5 sacks and a forced fumble, as he had his way with right tackle Ty Sambrailo, who, according to the announcers, wasn't healthy. Still, Beasley was dominant, and it made Lynch's first start extremely miserable. Lynch finished 23-of-35 for 223 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also fumbled once, but managed to recover it. The stat line doesn't look bad, but that's because Lynch generated a bunch of his yards in garbage time. He had accuracy issues, as a number of his early throws were all over the place. He also should've been picked a second time, but "

   "comment":"Beasley strip-sacked Rivers. Adrian Clayborn scooped up the ball and rolled into the end zone to give the Falcons a 27-10 lead. Rivers came right back to hit Tyrell Williams for 38 yards in busted coverage. A 21-yard pass to Travis Benjamin (4-54) got San Diego in the red zone at the 2-minute warning. A bullet to Hunter Henry (1-16) moved the ball to the 3-yard line, and Gordon ran in the touchdown to cut the Falcons' lead to 27-17 at the half. Midway through the third quarter, Rivers led a field goal drive to cut the point deficit to 7. Atlanta responded with runs from Devonta Freeman of 15, 14, and 8 yards to set up another Bryant field goal. San Diego then marched down the field as Rivers picked apart the Falcons' defense. He used Gordon as a receiver on a number of plays, including a 5.yard touchdown toss. That cut the Falcons' lead to 30-27 with 6 minutes remaining. San Diego's defense came through as Denzel Perryman picked off Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. Melvin Ingram (9 tackles, 1 sack), Joey Bosa (2 sacks, 5 tackles) and Denzel Perryman (7 tackles, 1 interception) all played really well. Atlanta got a good game from Vic Beasley has he had 2 sacks with a forced fumble. Rookie safety "

   "comment":"Beasley, fired a pass that was scooped up by Desmond Trufant, who ran the ball into the end zone. It looked like the pass was going forward, but the officials ruled it to be a lateral. Following the challenge, they inexplicably allowed the call to stand even though it was clearly the wrong 1. Suddenly, a 17-7 deficit turned into a 24-7 disadvantage at halftime, and the injured Packers couldn't climb out of that hole.    The Packers had a number of other things go against them as well. In addition to all the injuries, 2 big Cobb plays were negated by offensive pass interference. Mike McCarthy was so furious about the first that he was flagged for an unsportsmanlike penalty. As mentioned, Cobb (6-60) was knocked out with a shoulder injury, joining Nelson on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Martellus Bennett dropped 2 passes, though he still managed to catch 5 balls for 47 yards. Davante Adams (8-99) led the Packers in receiving, and he also scored a touchdown.    Rodgers' other touchdown was thrown to Ty Montgomery, who caught 6 balls for 75 yards. Montgomery scored once more on the ground, but was limited to 35 rushing yards on 10 carries.    Speaking of running backs with great fantasy numbers, Devonta Freeman exploded for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries. Tevin Coleman (6-42) had a 35-yard burst, and he also caught a touchdown.    Julio Jones looked like he was going to have a big game, as he caught 4 balls for 95 yards in the first half. The Packers held the ball for most of the second half, however, so Jones finished with 1 more grab, making it 5 for 108 yards. Mohamed Sanu (5-85) also had a nice outing versus a young secondary.    I mentioned Beasley earlier. Unfortunately for the Falcons, he was knocked out with a hamstring injury. "
