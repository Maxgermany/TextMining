   "comment":"Stanton interceptions. Again, these were just some of the blunders the 49ers committed. There were many more that I didn't mention. It's so strange because San Francisco used to be so well-coached. That's not the case this year, as Jim Harbaugh appears to have lost control of his team.    All of the mistakes ruined what was a solid performance from Colin Kaepernick. The 49er signal-caller ran more than he has in a regular-season game in a long while, as he scrambled 13 times for 54 rushing yards. He showed off great athleticism to elude some sacks, including 1 instance in which Thomas Keiser had him by the jersey. Kaepernick was able to shed him to help his team put points on the board during that possession. As a passer, Kaepernick misfired on just 8 occasions, going 29-of-37 for 245 yards and a touchdown. He got away with some mistakes early - Antonio Cromartie dropped 2 potential pick-sixes - and he misfired badly on his final attempt, but he was definitely not at fault for this defeat. Kaepernick's sole score went to Michael Crabtree, who reeled in 10 of his 11 targets for 80 yards. However, Stevie Johnson paced the 49ers in catches (9) and receiving yards (103). Boldin didn't do much (6-36) aside from costing his team points. You'd think a veteran like him would know better. Harbaugh spent some time yelling at Boldin on the sideline, but the message was lost because his team wouldn't stop shooting themselves in the foot.    The 49ers struggled to run the ball. Frank Gore managed just 10 yards on 6 carries, and making matters worse for his fantasy owners, Carlos Hyde (3-13) vultured a touchdown.    As for the victors, Drew Stanton went 18-of-33 for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which were thrown to third-round rookie John Brown (4-52)."

   "comment":"Stanton proved to be a liability. Seattle's offensive line did not have a good showing. The unit surrendered 3 sacks in just the first 19 minutes of the game. Russell Wilson took 2 sacks in the red zone during the first quarter. Following a third sack and a short pass on third down, the fans expressed their displeasure for the first of many occasions. A bit later in the second period, an illegal block downfield took away a Wilson scramble to the Arizona 1-yard line. Following 2 more sacks - giving the Cardinals 5 in the first half alone - the Seahawks had to settle for another field goal. Seattle's poor red-zone efficiency continued throughout the afternoon - a false start and another sack foiled an opportunity following a blocked punt - but the tide turned, as the Cardinals began making errors late in the game, adding to some they made earlier. For instance, Jaron Brown dropped a touchdown. There was that blocked punt, a missed field goal from 49 yards, an Andre Ellington drop and a poor interception by Drew Stanton. As a result, the Seahawks prevailed, giving themselves a legitimate chance to win the NFC West, since they play the Cardinals again in Week 16.    Wilson went 17-of-22 for 211 yards and a touchdown to go along with 73 rushing yards on 10 scrambles. He took 7 sacks in total, including 3 from "

Don't pay attention to the completions and yardage, as most of them came in garbage time. To illustrate his struggles, Stanton went 8-of-16 for only 128 yards and a pick in the opening half. Stanton could've been intercepted on several other occasions, including once where he carelessly flung the ball into triple coverage during the second half.    Larry Fitzgerald was out, but "

   "comment":"Stanton will likely start because of the short work week. That said, Los Angeles didn't win because Palmer and Johnson were knocked out; they held a lead before they both left the game. Palmer and Johnson were also responsible for 3 turnovers. Palmer heaved an interception early on when he underthrew his target in the end zone. He was later strip-sacked by Aaron Donald in the second half, and Johnson was then guilty of a lost fumble in Rams territory, ruining what appeared to be a promising drive with the Cardinals up 3 points.    Palmer ended up 23-of-36 for 288 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 turnovers. He was hurt by some drops, a couple of which were by Michael Floyd, but Palmer once again didn't seem like himself. He wasn't horrible, but Arizona's offense isn't nearly as dynamic as it was last year, as Palmer clearly has regressed. Stanton, in relief, went 4-of-11 for 37 yards and 2 interceptions, 1 of which was a horrific attempt at a Hail Mary in which Stanton didn't even bother waiting for his receivers to run to the end zone. Stanton was abysmal in the preseason, and I thought Matt Barkley should've been rostered instead.    Johnson's injury ruined what was a solid afternoon, aside from the lost fumble. Johnson gained 83 yards on just 17 carries, and he also caught 4 passes for 41 receiving yards. He'll probably be in the lineup on Thursday, but if he's not, "

   "comment":"Stanton hit Larry Fitzgerald for the tying touchdown on the very next play. Then, right after halftime, the San Francisco kick returner fumbled the ball inside his own 20. The Cardinals quickly reached the end zone once again with the help of a running-into-the-kicker penalty, taking a lead that they wouldn't relinquish. If there's anything that could've been learned from this dreadful game from Arizona's perspective, it's that Stanton is 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL. Battling 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL, Stanton struggled to move the chains. He was completely inaccurate on most of his throws. Stanton finished 11-of-28 for 124 yards. He did throw 2 touchdowns, but they were set up on short fields. The 1 silver lining is that Stanton didn't turn the ball over, but he was close on a couple of occasions. Arizona converted just 5-of-16 third downs because of his incompetence. What I really don't understand is why the Cardinals opted to keep Stanton over Matt Barkley during final cuts. Barkley was unquestionably the superior quarterback in the preseason, and it wasn't even close. Stanton was simply atrocious, and if the Cardinals played a real team this week, they would've lost. I don't understand what the point of the exhibition is if coaches are unwilling to keep obvious, superior talents at the position. All of the rhetoric that players are fighting for jobs is usually complete crap. Coaches know whom they're going to keep, and it usually doesn't matter what the players do.    Two Arizona offensive play-makers were factors in this contest. "

   "comment":"Stanton. The backup signal-caller was responsible for an interception on a miscommunication with John Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both Robert Woods (5-59) and Cooper Kupp (4-51) outgained Watkins. Kupp was the best fantasy producer of the duo, as he managed to score a touchdown. However, Kupp didn't have his best showing, as he dropped a couple of passes.    Todd Gurley dominated once again. Gurley gashed the Cardinals for 106 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, and he also reeled in 4 receptions for 48 receiving yards.    As for the Cardinals, they had an ugly offensive showing, which I'm sure you could tell by the final score. Stanton did not look like a functional quarterback, going 5-of-14 for 62 yards and the aforementioned interception. Bruce Arians had an opportunity to upgrade Stanton the past couple of years, but chose not to for some reason. The Cardinals had no chance with Stanton as a replacement for Palmer, who finished 10-of-18 for 122 yards and his pick, which was accomplished in nearly a half of work. Palmer will be out for at least 8 weeks, so Arizona's playoff dreams are effectively eliminated.    Peterson also took a big step backward compared to last week. He looked great on a 6-yard run in the first half, but he couldn't find any running room otherwise, as the Rams limited him to just 21 yards on 11 carries.    Things weren't much better for Fitzgerald, who was restricted to just 3 catches for 29 yards. "

   "comment":"Stanton had very little success against the Legion of Boom prior to Sherman's injury. Stanton finished 24-of-47 for 273 yards and a touchdown, but that hardly tells the whole story. Stanton missed open receivers all evening, including some who could've scored touchdowns. The only way the Cardinals moved the chains in the early going was via penalty - they had 6 first downs as a result of yellow flags - but Stanton was able to pick up the slack once Sherman left the game. Stanton had just 69 of his 273 yards in the opening half, but he engineered a late touchdown drive to give his team a chance to cover the spread. It ended up being a push on the closing number, however, because of a block on the extra-point attempt. Stanton struggled, but it wasn't all his fault. Humphries being out worsened his pass protection. Plus, Arizona dropped some passes. "
