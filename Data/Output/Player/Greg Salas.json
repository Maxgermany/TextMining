   "comment":"Salas was the only Jet receiver to finish with more than 1 catch. He logged 2 receptions for 48 yards. I listed Smith's numbers at that particular stage because he compiled some junk yardage in the final few minutes when the Ravens stopped caring. He ultimately finished 9-of-22 for 127 yards and 2 picks. He also caught a 13-yard pass on the second drive, as New York showed tons of Wildcat formations early on, with Joshua Cribbs taking plenty of snaps. Cribbs went 1-of-2 for 13 yards and also had 20 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. Smith could be benched next week, by the way. Rex Ryan was non-committal on whether Smith would get the nod versus the Dolphins.    The Jets didn't run the ball well. Both "
