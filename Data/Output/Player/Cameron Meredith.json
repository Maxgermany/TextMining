   "comment":"Meredith lost possession. The Colts scooped up the ball right before it trickled out of bounds, which set up 1 of Adam Vinatieri's 5 field goals. Despite all of this, Chicago had a chance to win at the end. Hoyer once again drove the team down the field, but on a fourth down, he somehow didn't seen an open Alshon Jeffery in the end zone. Instead, he hurled an inaccurate ball toward 1 of his other targets, which fell incomplete.    As for Andrew Luck, he threw a number of beautiful passes against Chicago's injury-ravaged defense. He lofted a perfect touch pass to Phillip Dorsett on a third-and-12 right outside the red zone, which ultimately led to a touchdown thrown to Dwayne Allen. Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2-and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as Willie Young logged a trio of sacks. Luck took 6 sacks the week before by the Jaguars, who put no pressure on quarterbacks, so this is obviously an issue. Ryan Grigson discussed not being able to build a championship defense because of Luck's contract... so what about the offensive line?    Luck's 2 touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (10-171) and Dwayne Allen (6-50). They were the only Indianapolis players to eclipse the 30-yard mark. This includes Dorsett, who was once again disappointing. He caught 2 balls for 26 yards, only seeing 3 targets. He was expected to be a greater factor with Donte Moncrief out with an injury, but that hasn't been the case.    The Colts didn't run the ball very much, but when they did, they had success doing so. Frank Gore gained 75 yards on 14 carries. He had just 4 rushes in the opening half, which is puzzling, to say the least.    Moving back to the Bears, Meredith will be seen as the goat for losing that key fumble, so it's a shame that it spoiled such a terrific afternoon. He caught a whopping 9 passes for 130 yards and a touchdown. He served as Hoyer's favorite target, as Jeffery (5-77) once again didn't look 100 percent, though he was certainly improved. Remember, Jeffery should've had a game-winning score, but Hoyer didn't see him. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Meredith may have proven that he's a viable, starting fantasy receiver.    The young Jaguars showed some resiliency with a comeback road win in Chicago. The Bears held a 13-0 lead at the start of the fourth quarter, but Blake Bortles and the Jacksonville defense come up with big plays to pull out a 1-point road win. If it weren't for some missed kicks against the Ravens, the Jaguars would be 3-2 and a real threat in the AFC South. In the grand scheme of things, the Bears aren't going anywhere this year, so they are better off losing to get a higher draft position for the 2017 NFL Draft.    On the Jaguars' opening drive, they went 90 yards down the field, but Allen Robinson dropped a would-be touchdown pass, and Tracy Porter caught the deflection for an interception to rob Jacksonville of early points. The Bears took advantage with a drive led by passes to Alshon Jeffery to set up a short field goal for Connor Barth. Chicago got the ball back and moved down the field using Jeffery some more. Jordan Howard then plunged into the end zone from a few yards out to take 10-0 lead into the half. Jeffery abused Jacksonville rookie Jalen Ramsey in the first half to the tune of 6 receptions for 90 yards. After trading punts in the third quarter, the Bears got moving when they hit Cameron Meredith for 36 yards on a wide receiver screen. "
