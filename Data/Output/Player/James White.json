One Patriot who proved to be a big disappointment was Martellus Bennett. Expected to be a big-time target with Gronkowski out, Bennett secured only 3 passes for 14 yards. The Cardinals cover tight ends well, but still, Bennett's fantasy owners have to be greatly disappointed.    While White handled all the receiving duties, LeGarrette Blount punched through Arizona's front for 70 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries."

   "comment":"White (5-50) was the second leading receiver, but he picked up a good chunk of his yardage in garbage time.    Both Julian Edelman (1-16) and Rob Gronkowski (1-11) were huge disappointments for the team. Edelman had trouble getting open against Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby, so Edelman can chalk this up to a tough matchup. As for Gronkowski, he was very quiet despite having a decent matchup. It appears as though Gronkowski is still not fully healthy, as he was not on the field for all of the Patriots' snaps. Definitely monitor his status going forward. So long as he is limited, he is nothing more than a high-risk, high-reward play in fantasy.    For LeGarrette Blount, this was his worst performance of the year. He was supposed to carry the load for the Patriots in this game, but he only received 13 carries. Though Blount turned those carries into 54 yards, the Bills did a very good job of containing the bruising back. Because of his early struggles, the Patriots gave some carries to James White, who was not very effective. White ran the ball 4 times for 12 yards.    This game was a huge, signature win for Rex Ryan and the Bills. The team really needed to get a big victory this year to help ensure that Ryan's job was safe. This definitely qualifies. After beating the Cardinals in the previous week, the team went on the road to play a divisional rival and shut them out. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the play of "

LeGarrette Blount helped his fantasy owners with a touchdown, but didn't do much otherwise, mustering only 37 yards on 18 attempts. He had 3 other chances to score, but Cleveland did a good job of stuffing him near the goal line.    As for the Browns, they never really had a chance, but they might have covered had Cody Kessler not left the game in the first quarter. Kessler, who put together a touchdown drive, was knocked out with a rib injury when he was sacked for a safety. The Patriots lost their momentum in the second half, leaving the Browns with an opportunity to sneak the margin to within single digits. Charlie Whitehurst didn't give Cleveland that opportunity. Whitehurst went 14-of-24 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick that bounced off "

The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5-yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the fourth quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.    The Patriots' defense had a good team effort with 4 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.   "

   "comment":"White (5-28). Rob Gronkowski didn't find the end zone; in fact, he had just 3 catches for 51 yards. However, he had a deep reception that was overturned by an offensive pass interference. Meanwhile, Chris Hogan led the team with 71 receiving yards on 4 grabs.    The Patriots' crowded backfield welcomed back Rex Burkhead, who took 6 carries for 31 yards to go along with an 11-yard catch. Dion Lewis had the most carries (13) and yards (76), while Mike Gillislee's role was reduced once again; he managed 31 yards on 8 attempts.    Going back to the Falcons, Sarkisian limited Devonta Freeman to just 12 carries, which he turned into 72 yards. The whole dynamic is odd. Sarkisian calls too many first-down carries, but doesn't give Freeman enough rushing opportunities. I don't know how Sarkisian does it, but he's that incompetent!    Julio Jones scored a late touchdown in garbage time to reward his fantasy owners. He caught 9 of his 13 targets for 99 yards otherwise. Mohamed Sanu (6-65) was the only other Falcon with more than 25 receiving yards.    The Falcons may have lost this game, but they at least had some guts. They went for it on a fourth-and-7 in their own territory on the second drive of the game, and they were able to move the chains with a Ryan scramble. However, they tried a fourth-and-6 in the second quarter, but they failed when Ryan overthrew Sanu on a miscommunication. This helped set up a Brady touchdown to White.   "
