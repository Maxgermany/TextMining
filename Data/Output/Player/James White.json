However, most of his production came after Ward left the game, as he caught just 2 balls in the opening half. Julian Edelman (7-53) was next on the receiving list.    One final note: I think Belichick screwed up big time in the 4.h quarter. He eschewed 2 field goals, opting to go for it on a pair of 4.h downs. His offense failed on both occasions. Had he kicked the ball, the score would've been 20-18 when Gronkowski caught his initial 4.h-down pass on the final drive. A short field goal would have won the game, 21-20. The Patriots had 6 minutes and 3 timeouts remaining when Belichick eschewed his first kick, so there was still plenty of time. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Hogan also had a solid showing with 3 catches for 60 yards and the aforementioned score.    One Patriot who proved to be a big disappointment was Martellus Bennett. Expected to be a big-time target with Gronkowski out, Bennett secured only 3 passes for 14 yards. The Cardinals cover tight ends well, but still, Bennett's fantasy owners have to be greatly disappointed.    While White handled all the receiving duties, LeGarrette Blount punched through Arizona's front for 70 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries."

Both Julian Edelman (1-16) and Rob Gronkowski (1-11) were huge disappointments for the team. Edelman had trouble getting open against Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby, so Edelman can chalk this up to a tough matchup. As for Gronkowski, he was very quiet despite having a decent matchup. It appears as though Gronkowski is still not fully healthy, as he was not on the field for all of the Patriots' snaps. Definitely monitor his status going forward. So long as he is limited, he is nothing more than a high-risk, high-reward play in fantasy.    For LeGarrette Blount, this was his worst performance of the year. He was supposed to carry the load for the Patriots in this game, but he only received 13 carries. Though Blount turned those carries into 54 yards, the Bills did a very good job of containing the bruising back. Because of his early struggles, the Patriots gave some carries to James White, who was not very effective. White ran the ball 4 times for 12 yards.    This game was a huge, signature win for Rex Ryan and the Bills. The team really needed to get a big victory this year to help ensure that Ryan's job was safe. This definitely qualifies. After beating the Cardinals in the previous week, the team went on the road to play a divisional rival and shut them out. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the play of "

   "comment":"James White on a short pass that White took to the house for a 19-yard touchdown - his third in his last 2 games. Then, early in the second quarter, LeGarrette Blount went in from 3 yards out to put the score at what appeared to be an insurmountable 14-0 lead. Jones, who had a poor pass intercepted in the end zone to start this game, never lost his cool, which we've seen happen in the past as poor decisions accumulate. His best drive of the game came midway through the second quarter when he hit Antonio Brown with a beautiful pass for 51 yards, and then, 4 plays later, hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown on yet another nice throw. I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1.point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 36-yard touchdown. It was a play over the middle that very few, if any defenders, could have stopped and very few tight ends could have made. The Brady-Gronkowski connection sets the New England offense apart, as we could see when they hooked up for a 37-yard reception, which was the key play on the Patriots' last scoring drive, and 1 they dial up whenever they are in need.    Even though receiving specialist James White was able to score, this game would easily be considered a Blount game. Blount, who was dismissed from the Steelers due to walking off the field while time still remained on the clock, might have had some revenge on his mind this week, as he accumulated 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 touches. He was the closer in this 1. with the bulk of his yards coming in the second half to salt the earth.    White on a short pass that White took to the house for a 19-yard touchdown - his third in his last 2 games. Then, early in the second quarter, "

   "comment":"James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5.yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the 4.h quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.    The Patriots' defense had a good team effort with 4 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.   "

   "comment":"James White (5-28). White (5-28). Rob Gronkowski didn't find the end zone; in fact, he had just 3 catches for 51 yards. However, he had a deep reception that was overturned by an offensive pass interference. Meanwhile, Chris Hogan led the team with 71 receiving yards on 4 grabs.    The Patriots' crowded backfield welcomed back Rex Burkhead, who took 6 carries for 31 yards to go along with an 11-yard catch. Dion Lewis had the most carries (13) and yards (76), while Mike Gillislee's role was reduced once again; he managed 31 yards on 8 attempts.    Going back to the Falcons, Sarkisian limited Devonta Freeman to just 12 carries, which he turned into 72 yards. The whole dynamic is odd. Sarkisian calls too many first-down carries, but doesn't give Freeman enough rushing opportunities. I don't know how Sarkisian does it, but he's that incompetent!    Julio Jones scored a late touchdown in garbage time to reward his fantasy owners. He caught 9 of his 13 targets for 99 yards otherwise. Mohamed Sanu (6-65) was the only other Falcon with more than 25 receiving yards.    The Falcons may have lost this game, but they at least had some guts. They went for it on a 4.h-and-7 in their own territory on the second drive of the game, and they were able to move the chains with a Ryan scramble. However, they tried a 4.h-and-6 in the second quarter, but they failed when Ryan overthrew Sanu on a miscommunication. This helped set up a Brady touchdown to White.   "
