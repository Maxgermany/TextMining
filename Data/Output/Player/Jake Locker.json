The Titans had no timeouts, yet they called a running play with less than a minute remaining. Later in the possession, when Tennessee was inside the New Orleans 5-yard line, Locker took a sack, which ended the game. There wasn't any time left on the clock, but he still should have thrown the ball into the end zone. It was simply a rookie mistake.    Locker was in the game because "

Locker is the better quarterback, so it's inexcusable that Munchak started an injured, inferior option.    Johnson sucked too. He ripped off a 35-yard burst on a draw, was otherwise bottled up, finishing with 55 yards on 15 attempts against Indianapolis' crap defense. He salvaged his fantasy day with 8 catches for 54 receiving yards.    The silver lining for the Titans is that some of their young skill-position players stepped up. "

   "comment":"Locker and Nate Washington were injured on the same play. Locker appeared to complete a deep pass to Washington, who fumbled the ball. Locker then tried to bring down the Patriot who had possession, but hurt his non-throwing shoulder while making the tackle. The play was reviewed and it was ruled an incompletion, but the damage was done. The good news is that Locker is expected to play next week. I haven't even heard anything pertaining to Washington, so I assume that he's OK.    Locker played relatively well considering the circumstances, going 23-of-32 for 229 yards, a touchdown and an interception. However, he was constant siege in the backfield, and the Patriots were able to force him into enough errors (the pick and the aforementioned strip-six) to establish complete control of the game.    New England also did an outstanding job of bottling up "

In the preseason, the Tennessee Titans' defense looked like it was going to struggle, but apparently defensive coordinator Ray Horton was hiding what he planned on doing because the Titans' stop unit played superbly against the Chiefs. Tennessee shut down Jamaal Charles to disappoint his fantasy owners. Charles ran for only 19 yards on 7 carries with 4 catches for 15 yards. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid abandoned the run when the Titans established a lead before halftime. Tennessee got an efficient game out of quarterback Jake Locker to earn an impressive road win at Arrowhead.    Kansas City got on the board first with a field goal drive before missing another field goal. Locker remained poised after a slow first quarter and moved the ball down the field to set up a 5.yard touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Locker came into the game and promptly threw an interception to Jumal Rolle on his first attempt. The very next play saw Andre Johnson (7-53-1) get stripped of the ball by Jason McCourty, who scooped it up and took the loose ball 62-yards for a touchdown. Just as the Titans got back in the game, Fitzpatrick made some plays with a 32-yard completion to Keshawn Martin. A few plays later, Hopkins made 1 of his typical great contested catches over Brandon Ghee for a 34-yard touchdown. Hopkins kept coming as he caught a crossing route and exploded down the field for a 56-yard gain. Johnson then made a phenomenal catch for a 4-yard score to end the drive. Watt produced his 6.h take-away of the year with a strip-sack that he recovered. After scooping it up, Watt ran it the Titans 25-yard line. A pass to Hopkins sent it to the 1-yard line, and Watt made a great hands catch for his fifth touchdown of the year (3 offensive, 2 defensive). Locker threw another pick this time to A."
