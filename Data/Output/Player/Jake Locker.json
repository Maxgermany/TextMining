The Titans had no timeouts, yet they called a running play with less than a minute remaining. Later in the possession, when Tennessee was inside the New Orleans 5-yard line, Locker took a sack, which ended the game. There wasn't any time left on the clock, but he still should have thrown the ball into the end zone. It was simply a rookie mistake.    Locker was in the game because "

   "comment":"Jake Locker in the 4.h quarter. Locker predictably outplayed Hasselbeck, going 11-of-16 for 108 yards and a touchdown. Locker is the better quarterback, so it's inexcusable that Munchak started an injured, inferior option.    Johnson sucked too. He ripped off a 35-yard burst on a draw, was otherwise bottled up, finishing with 55 yards on 15 attempts against Indianapolis' crap defense. He salvaged his fantasy day with 8 catches for 54 receiving yards.    The silver lining for the Titans is that some of their young skill-position players stepped up. "

   "comment":"Jake Locker was playing on the road against Dick LeBeau's defense. Well, Locker didn't really have to do much because Pittsburgh did a great job of self-destructing. The Steelers were stuck at 2 points for most of the afternoon - a byproduct of a Darius Reynaud blunder on the opening kickoff - as they couldn't maintain drives, converting just 4-of-13 tries on third down. The issue with the Steelers is pass protection. Their offensive line was absolutely anemic, and it's no surprise that they couldn't hold up for Ben Roethlisberger in this contest - especially when center Maurkice Pouncey was carted off the field with a knee injury. It was extremely unfortunate, as Pouncey's own teammate inadvertently rolled into his knee. Pouncey, who tore his ACL and MCL, is the most talented player on the front, so his absence will make it extremely difficult for Pittsburgh to move the chains this entire season. Roethlisberger went 21-of-33 for 191 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was sacked 5 times, including twice by Jurrell Casey, who had an amazing preseason. As I wrote in the preseason recaps, Casey is poised for a huge year.    Only 3 non-running back Steelers caught more than 1 pass: Antonio Brown (5-71), Emmanuel Sanders (7-57) and Jerricho Cotchery (4-34, TD).    The Steelers, as you can imagine, had issues running the ball. Isaac Redman, who started, gained just 9 yards on 8 carries. He also lost a fumble in the red zone. Felix Jones, meanwhile, didn't get a single touch because he blew a blitz pick-up. It makes you wonder why the Steelers cut Jonathan Dwyer, who was their most talented running back.    As mentioned, Jake Locker didn't have to do anything. He completed just 11-of-20 attempts for 125 yards. I wanted to see if he could put together a strong performance in hostile conditions, but we'll have to wait for that.    Only 3 Titans caught passes, with "

In the preseason, the Tennessee Titans' defense looked like it was going to struggle, but apparently defensive coordinator Ray Horton was hiding what he planned on doing because the Titans' stop unit played superbly against the Chiefs. Tennessee shut down Jamaal Charles to disappoint his fantasy owners. Charles ran for only 19 yards on 7 carries with 4 catches for 15 yards. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid abandoned the run when the Titans established a lead before halftime. Tennessee got an efficient game out of quarterback Jake Locker to earn an impressive road win at Arrowhead.    Kansas City got on the board first with a field goal drive before missing another field goal. Locker remained poised after a slow first quarter and moved the ball down the field to set up a 5.yard touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Jake Locker was dreadful. He went 17-of-34 for 185 yards and 2 interceptions, both of which occurred in the opening half. One of the picks was heaved behind his target. The other was thrown way late across his body after Dalton's interception. It was a crushing turnover because it appeared as though Tennessee would be able to get back into the game once Dalton gave it away. Locker could have easily thrown more interceptions, including 1 that looked like it was going back for 6. He made up for a bit statistically with 50 rushing yards on 6 scrambles, but with more games like this, it's fair to wonder if we'll see Zach Mettenberger anytime soon.    It would be nice if the Titans showcased their other offensive rookie sometime soon. "
