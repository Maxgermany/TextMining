The Titans had no timeouts, yet they called a running play with less than a minute remaining. Later in the possession, when Tennessee was inside the New Orleans 5-yard line, Locker took a sack, which ended the game. There wasn't any time left on the clock, but he still should have thrown the ball into the end zone. It was simply a rookie mistake.    Locker was in the game because "

Locker appeared to complete a deep pass to Washington, who fumbled the ball. Locker then tried to bring down the Patriot who had possession, but hurt his non-throwing shoulder while making the tackle. The play was reviewed and it was ruled an incompletion, but the damage was done. The good news is that Locker is expected to play next week. I haven't even heard anything pertaining to Washington, so I assume that he's OK.    Locker played relatively well considering the circumstances, going 23-of-32 for 229 yards, a touchdown and an interception. However, he was constant siege in the backfield, and the Patriots were able to force him into enough errors (the pick and the aforementioned strip-six) to establish complete control of the game.

   "comment":"Jake Locker was playing on the road against Dick LeBeau's defense. Well, Locker didn't really have to do much because Pittsburgh did a great job of self-destructing. The Steelers were stuck at 2 points for most of the afternoon - a byproduct of a Darius Reynaud blunder on the opening kickoff - as they couldn't maintain drives, converting just 4-of-13 tries on third down. The issue with the Steelers is pass protection. Their offensive line was absolutely anemic, and it's no surprise that they couldn't hold up for Ben Roethlisberger in this contest - especially when center Maurkice Pouncey was carted off the field with a knee injury. It was extremely unfortunate, as Pouncey's own teammate inadvertently rolled into his knee. Pouncey, who tore his ACL and MCL, is the most talented player on the front, so his absence will make it extremely difficult for Pittsburgh to move the chains this entire season. Roethlisberger went 21-of-33 for 191 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was sacked 5 times, including twice by Jurrell Casey, who had an amazing preseason. As I wrote in the preseason recaps, Casey is poised for a huge year.    Only 3 non-running back Steelers caught more than 1 pass: Antonio Brown (5-71), Emmanuel Sanders (7-57) and Jerricho Cotchery (4-34, TD).    The Steelers, as you can imagine, had issues running the ball. Isaac Redman, who started, gained just 9 yards on 8 carries. He also lost a fumble in the red zone. Felix Jones, meanwhile, didn't get a single touch because he blew a blitz pick-up. It makes you wonder why the Steelers cut Jonathan Dwyer, who was their most talented running back.    As mentioned, Jake Locker didn't have to do anything. He completed just 11-of-20 attempts for 125 yards. I wanted to see if he could put together a strong performance in hostile conditions, but we'll have to wait for that.    Only 3 Titans caught passes, with Locker was playing on the road against Dick LeBeau's defense. Well, Locker didn't really have to do much because Pittsburgh did a great job of self-destructing.

   "comment":"Jake Locker was dreadful. He went 17-of-34 for 185 yards and 2 interceptions, both of which occurred in the opening half. One of the picks was heaved behind his target. The other was thrown way late across his body after Dalton's interception. It was a crushing turnover because it appeared as though Tennessee would be able to get back into the game once Dalton gave it away. Locker could have easily thrown more interceptions, including 1 that looked like it was going back for 6. He made up for a bit statistically with 50 rushing yards on 6 scrambles, but with more games like this, it's fair to wonder if we'll see Zach Mettenberger anytime soon.    It would be nice if the Titans showcased their other offensive rookie sometime soon. "
