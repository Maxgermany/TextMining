The Titans had no timeouts, yet they called a running play with less than a minute remaining. Later in the possession, when Tennessee was inside the New Orleans 5-yard line, Locker took a sack, which ended the game. There wasn't any time left on the clock, but he still should have thrown the ball into the end zone. It was simply a rookie mistake.    Locker was in the game because "

Locker is the better quarterback, so it's inexcusable that Munchak started an injured, inferior option.    Johnson sucked too. He ripped off a 35-yard burst on a draw, was otherwise bottled up, finishing with 55 yards on 15 attempts against Indianapolis' crap defense. He salvaged his fantasy day with 8 catches for 54 receiving yards.    The silver lining for the Titans is that some of their young skill-position players stepped up. "

   "comment":"Locker and Nate Washington were injured on the same play. Locker appeared to complete a deep pass to Washington, who fumbled the ball. Locker then tried to bring down the Patriot who had possession, but hurt his non-throwing shoulder while making the tackle. The play was reviewed and it was ruled an incompletion, but the damage was done. The good news is that Locker is expected to play next week. I haven't even heard anything pertaining to Washington, so I assume that he's OK.    Locker played relatively well considering the circumstances, going 23-of-32 for 229 yards, a touchdown and an interception. However, he was constant siege in the backfield, and the Patriots were able to force him into enough errors (the pick and the aforementioned strip-six) to establish complete control of the game.    New England also did an outstanding job of bottling up "

Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid abandoned the run when the Titans established a lead before halftime. Tennessee got an efficient game out of quarterback Jake Locker to earn an impressive road win at Arrowhead.

The other was thrown way late across his body after Dalton's interception. It was a crushing turnover because it appeared as though Tennessee would be able to get back into the game once Dalton gave it away. Locker could have easily thrown more interceptions, including 1 that looked like it was going back for 6. He made up for a bit statistically with 50 rushing yards on 6 scrambles, but with more games like this, it's fair to wonder if we'll see Zach Mettenberger anytime soon.

The very next play saw Andre Johnson (7-53-1) get stripped of the ball by Jason McCourty, who scooped it up and took the loose ball 62-yards for a touchdown. Just as the Titans got back in the game, Fitzpatrick made some plays with a 32-yard completion to Keshawn Martin. A few plays later, Hopkins made 1 of his typical great contested catches over Brandon Ghee for a 34-yard touchdown. Hopkins kept coming as he caught a crossing route and exploded down the field for a 56-yard gain. Johnson then made a phenomenal catch for a 4-yard score to end the drive. Watt produced his 6.h take-away of the year with a strip-sack that he recovered. After scooping it up, Watt ran it the Titans 25-yard line. A pass to Hopkins sent it to the 1-yard line, and Watt made a great hands catch for his fifth touchdown of the year (3 offensive, 2 defensive). Locker threw another pick this time to A."
