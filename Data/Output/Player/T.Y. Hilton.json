   "comment":"Hilton.  The Patriots tied the game at 14 in the second quarter when Julian Edelman returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown. It was the start of a massive game for Edelman. Vince Wilfork got some pressure on Luck a bit later to cause a poorly thrown ball in the middle of the field. Aqib Talib ran under the floater and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown. The teams then traded field goals to make it 24-17 at the half. Brady moved the ball downfield in the third quarter and finished a drive with a short touchdown toss to Edelman. New England's defense played better in the second half and kept Luck from sustaining drives. Rob Ninkovich beat Anthony Castonzo late in the third quarter for a sack-fumble that Ninkovich recovered at Indianapolis 24-yard line. Brady threw a strike down the seam to Gronkowski (7-137) for his second score on the next play and a 38-17 lead entering the 4.h quarter.  The Patriots put the game away early in the 4.h quarter when Alfonzo Dennard jumped a sideline out route and returned it 87 yards for a touchdown. It was a bad throw from Luck as the ball came out late.  The Colts' rookie signal-caller bounced back and dropped in a nice pass to Hilton (6-100) for a 43-yard touchdown. The wide out beat Talib on a go route running down the field. It was the second touchdown the former Bucs corner allowed in his debut with the Patriots. Luck had a pass deflected in garbage time and it was intercepted by New England rookie safety "

   "comment":"Hilton Supercontest with, texted me and said that Chuck Pagano studied film of last year's 49ers-Packers tilt. That's exactly what it looked like. It seemed as though the Colts had no idea that Pryor could run the football. They didn't set the edge at all and looked completely unprepared. Fortunately for the Colts, this all didn't matter because Andrew Luck was sharp in the clutch. Once again leading his team on a game-winning drive, Luck had just 5 incompletions (18-of-23), compiling 178 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). It was very discouraging that Luck was constantly under pressure - the Raiders have no legitimate pass-rushers outside of Lamarr Houston, so I'm still not quite sure how this happened - but he's 1 of the top, young quarterbacks in the NFL and just has a knack of eking out victories. He also rushed for 38 yards, which includes 1 scamper where eluded 2 potential sacks. Linebacker Kevin Burnett had him wrapped up, but Luck somehow eluded him.    Luck's aerial scores went to Reggie Wayne (8-96) and Dwayne Allen (1-20). Allen injured his hip in the second half. His absence hurt Indianapolis' blocking. Meanwhile, both Darrius Heyward-Bey and T.Y. Hilton snagged 3 receptions for 33 and 20 yards, respectively.    "

   "comment":"Hilton. The second-year wideout had 7 catches for 121 yards and 3 touchdowns. Most of his production came after halftime, as he let his team down with a first-half drop on third down that would've moved the chains.    Luck, meanwhile, finished 18-of-40 for 271 yards and the 3 scores to Hilton. He was woeful in the first half - he completed just 3 passes - as he had issues getting anything out of the slot position. Pass protection was also an issue; he took 4 sacks and had to scramble around to avoid other hits. There was 1 sequence in which he took consecutive sacks and nearly lost a fumble in the process. He later took a sack in the red zone and then was hit as he threw on the following play. However, things really opened up for him following intermission, with Phillips focusing on managing the game, as mentioned.    Houston's quarterback actually had the superior statistical performance. Keenum's final numbers were 20-of-34 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cris Collinsworth remarked that Keenum reminded him of "

His team made a couple of errors early on, including some holding penalties and such, but they cleaned everything up after the break.    Luck's touchdowns went to Reggie Wayne (7-119), who had his greatest outing of the season by far, Dwayne Allen (3-38), Coby Fleener (2-26) and Ahmad Bradshaw. Hilton, who missed out on a score, led the team with 10 targets. He reeled in 6 of them for 105 yards.    Bradshaw once again outran Richardson. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone but Pep Hamilton, who is absolutely clueless. Richardson found the end zone once, as mentioned, but mustered only 47 yards on 20 carries. Bradshaw nearly did the same (32 yards) on just 9 attempts. It's really ridiculous that the Colts continue to feature Richardson so prominently when Bradshaw is obviously so much better.

It certainly wasn't pretty - Luck was nearly picked on several other occasions - but he got the job done in the end despite extremely difficult conditions.    I mentioned that there were several issues for Luck. The pressure was 1. while Reggie Wayne was the other. The future Hall of Fame receiver had 1 of the worst performances of his career. He reeled in just 1 of his 8 targets for just 5 yards. He had a whopping 4 drops. One would've moved the chains, but the drop eventually led to a punt. Another ruined a potential big gain. A third was on the 2-point conversion, which would have pushed this spread (though I'm sure Blakeman would've come up with some sort of penalty).    The Colts actually have a highly productive receiver, and that would be Hilton, who had a monstrous outing. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets and snatched 10 of them for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns. "

   "comment":"Hilton, which Bill Belichick nearly challenged (he would've lost). Otherwise, Indianapolis couldn't get out of its own way. Luck missed Reggie Wayne on the first drive, which was a 3.and-out. Joshua Cribbs muffed a punt when Indianapolis forced a 3.and-out on its own, which led to a New England touchdown. The following possession saw Robert Herron screw up with 2 drops, and Adam Vinatieri was way wide right from 51 yards out. The Colts scored their sole touchdown after that to make it 14-7, but the Patriots posted 10 points right before halftime and after intermission. Before the Colts knew what hit them, it was 31-7 in the middle of the third quarter. Luck had to start forcing the issue, which led to a pair of desperate interceptions.    Luck finished 12-of-33 for 126 yards and 2 picks. He didn't play well, but he wasn't as awful as his putrid numbers indicate. Some drops hurt him, and he didn't get the appropriate protection to help him maintain drives. He was just 5-of-14 for 37 yards and 2 interceptions following intermission when the game was mostly out of hand.    Hilton was Indianapolis' leading receiver even though he had just 1 catch - the aforementioned sideline grab - which went for 36 yards. "

   "comment":"Hilton involved. The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking.

   "comment":"Hilton sealed the game at the very end. Hasselbeck finished 18-of-29 for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns amid zero turnovers despite not practicing at all this week. His numbers could've been even better, but he suffered through a couple of drops. Houston's anemic defense had something to do with it, of course, but Hasselbeck played extremely well. He tearfully told Tracy Wolfson after the game that he had nothing left.    While Hasselbeck was great, the big story was Andre Johnson. The veteran receiver, making his return to Houston, had looked completely done through 3 games. He was targeted heavily, but could do nothing with those opportunities. It seemed like he would ultimately get phased out of the offense completely, but this resurgence came out of nowhere. Johnson reeled in 6 of the 7 balls thrown to him for 77 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a big pick-up on 4.h down. None of this was fluky; Johnson dominated, which has to be very promising for the Colts (and fantasy owners) going forward.    The third veteran I mentioned earlier, Gore ripped through Houston's defense, which once again had major issues versus the run. He nearly hit the century mark, going 98 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries. He had some big lanes to run through, as the Colts did a good job neutralizing J.J. Watt. What they did was double team and chip Watt often. The other Texans should've stepped up, but it never happened.    Other Colts worth noting are T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief."

A pass to Hilton went for about 15 to Jacksonville's 10-yard line, but once again Indianapolis settled for a short field goal.

The Titans still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Mariota was strip-sacked, and Robert Mathis returned the turnover for a touchdown.    Luck played extremely well, save for the near-interception. He finished 27-of-39 for 353 yards and 3 touchdowns, which is impressive considering that he endured countless drops to begin the game. Tennessee's secondary made things easy, however, as the team has major issues both at cornerback and safety. I have them addressing both spots in my .

Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9. and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.

He finished 25-of-38 for 290 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 5 times for 29 rushing yards. Perhaps a bit more was expected against the Colts, but Indianapolis was able to get stud safety Mike Adams back from injury. Still, Mariota engineered some great drives that started deep in his own territory.    Mariota's top target was once again Rishard Matthews, who had a monstrous afternoon, catching 9 of his 13 targets for 122 yards. He didn't score, however. Mariota's touchdowns went to Tajae Sharpe (4-68) and DeMarco Murray. Delanie Walker, meanwhile, was a major disappointment. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards despite the fact that many tight ends have abused Indianapolis' defense throughout the year.    Speaking of disappointing numbers, Murray couldn't muster much on the ground, as Tennessee's offensive line didn't block as well as usual. Murray mustered only 70 yards on 21 carries, though he helped his fantasy owners with the receiving touchdown.    Moving on to the Colts, Luck had that clutch conversion at the end of regulation, but struggled for most of the second half. He was brilliant early, going 12-of-16 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission, but his second-half numbers were just 3-of-12 for 76 yards and an interception on an underthrown pass, thanks to some very shaky pass protection. The Colts were holding on for dear life, as Tennessee's defense finally woke up, but it was too late for the Titans.    Luck's touchdowns went to the usual suspects: Hilton (5-97) and Donte Moncrief (4-37)."

It set up the Texans at the Colts' 16-yard line, but the Colts held the Texans to a game-tying field goal. Osweiler was able to drive to midfield on his next possession, but threw an interception to Akeem Ayers to set up the Colts just across the 50. Fortunately for Osweiler, the Texans' defense forced a 3.and-out. Houston got moving thanks to runs from Lamar Miller, a 22-yard third-down conversion to DeAndre Hopkins, and a third-and-5 was converted by Akeem Hunt with a run of 19 yards. A terrific catch by Fiedorowicz then set up the Texans at Indianapolis' 1-yard line, from where Miller charged into the end zone to finish the impressive drive and give them the 10-3 lead. Just before the half, Adam Vinatieri missed a 55-yard field goal as the ball fell short. The Texans took advantage of the short field with a couple of completions to get a 52-yard field goal from Nick Novak. They took a 13-3 lead into the locker room. Luck was only 9-of-22 for fewer than 100 yards by halftime. Early in the third quarter, Luck was clobbered by Jadeveon Clowney, which led to a floating pass that was picked off by Andre Hal. He returned the interception inside the Colts' 20-yard line. Darryl Morris dropped a potential interception in the end zone, but the Texans settled for a field goal. The Colts had a chance after they were set up in the red zone by a 41-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, and they turned that into a screen pass to Frank Gore for an 18-yard touchdown. Down 16-10, Colts moved into position to take the lead on a drive that had a completion to Chester Rogers for 21 yards, a 13-yard run by Gore, and then a 28-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, which set up the Colts at the 5.yard line. On third-and-goal, however, Clowney slammed into Luck for a blind-side strip-sack. That loose ball was recovered by Houston's Whitney Mercilus. Indianapolis was running a poorly designed play at the time, as tight end Dwayne Allen was blocking Clowney 1.on-one, and Clowney destroyed Allen. The Texans had a 20-yard pass to Fiedorowicz (3-32) and a 20-yard run from Miller to set up a 41-yard field goal from Novak, taking a 19-10 lead early in the 4.h quarter. The Colts struck back as Luck hit T.Y. Hilton for a 35-yard touchdown, who had beatend Robert Nelson to get wide open. Miller had a run of 20 yards and a gain of 16 yards on a screen to give the Texans another field goal as they ran off more than 6 minutes from the clock. Those 3 points left Luck needing a touchdown, but having less than 3 minutes remaining and no timeouts. Indianapolis crossed midfield, but the Texans forced an incompletion on a 4.h-and-1 on a horrible called screen pass by the Colts.    Luck completed 24-of-45 passes for 276 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Hilton caught 9 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. Dwayne Allen had 3 touchdowns against the Jets, but was shut out by Houston.    Gore had 41 yards on only 10 carries.    Miller was the workhorse for Houston, running for 107 yards on 21 carries with a touchdown and 15 yards receiving.    Hopkins caught 2 passes for 33 yards, but drew some critical pass-interference penalties on point-producing drives.    Osweiler completed 14-of-24 passes for 147 yards and 1 interception. He had some nice passes, but Houston's red-zone offense was brutal. Fortunately for the Texans, the defense picked them up and Nick Novak was a perfect 5-for-5 on field goals.    The Texans' defense was superb despite missing 2 of its top-three cornerbacks from injuries. Clowney stepped up with a huge game to produce 2 turnovers for his team. "

The Colts would end up reaching the end zone on that possession because the Vikings were flagged for a leverage penalty on Adam Vinatieri's successful field goal, and Robert Turbin ultimately crossed the goal line. Luck was great, and his strong statistical afternoon seemed even sweeter for a while because both the Texans and Titans were losing in the 4.h quarter. Unfortunately for the Colts, they're still 1 game back behind both teams, as Houston and Tennessee put together late comebacks.    At any rate, Turbin absolutely wrecked some fantasy semi-finals with a pair of touchdowns. It's not like he saw extensive work, or anything; he was given just 7 attempts to Frank Gore's 26. Gore gained 101 yards in the process, but his owners have to be pissed because of Turbin's vultured scores.    Speaking of disappointed fantasy owners, you'd think T.Y.

   "comment":"Hilton to set up the team at the 8-yard line. On the next play, however, Brissett underthrew an open receiver in the end zone, giving the 49ers a chance. San Francisco appeared as though it might score when Walt Coleman flagged Indianapolis for an absolutely horrendous pass interference on third down, but the Colts were able to force a punt after that. Following a big Marlon Mack play, Adam Vinatieri hit the 11th overtime field goal of his career to win the game. It was his 539th career field goal, moving him into second place, all time.    Speaking of Mack, he really put on a show, displaying his tremendous talent. Mack gained 91 yards and a touchdown on just 9 carries. He nearly had a second score, but replay review ruled him down a yard shy of the goal line. The FOX announcers remarked that the Colts may have found their running back of the future, and I would agree with that opinion. Mack could end up getting a larger workload as the year progresses, especially when considering that Frank Gore (14-48) is clearly not the same player. Mack provides Indianapolis with some game-breaking ability out of the backfield.    Hilton, meanwhile, had a huge performance. He caught 7 balls for 177 yards. He had 2 long catches; 1 in overtime prior to the pick, and the other when the game was 16-9 to set up a touchdown. His only blemish was a drop. Gore (3-38) was next on the stat sheet. "

   "comment":"Hilton got wide open in busted coverage for a 45-yard touchdown with a well-thrown pass from Jacoby Brissett. In the second quarter, another completion to Hilton set up a field goal and a 10-0 lead for Indianapolis. The Texans missed a field goal to spoil a drive, and that turned out to be a huge play in the game as the Texans had to go for a touchdown late in the 4.h quarter rather than a game-tying field goal. Brissett was rocked on a blitz by "

   "comment":"Hilton had been limited in practice this week with a groin injury, giving Rogers a bit more work this week, as he caught all 6 of his targets for 104 yards and a touchdown. He had returned from injury a month ago, but had only seen 6 targets total over his last 3 games.    Besides the 2 big touchdown passes, Pittsburgh's defense played well, sacking Brissett 3 times and forcing a huge interception to put their team into scoring position. It will be a quick turnaround for the Steelers though, as they, along with the offense, have to play on Thursday night against the Titans, while the Colts get a bye and then also get to face the Titans.    The Steelers, despite tremendous inconsistency on offense this season, are 7-3 and have a commanding lead in the AFC North. They will have to tighten the ship and Roethlisberger's deep ball if they want to contend in the playoffs though.   "
