Most of his production came after halftime, as he let his team down with a first-half drop on third down that would've moved the chains.    Luck, meanwhile, finished 18-of-40 for 271 yards and the 3 scores to Hilton. He was woeful in the first half - he completed just 3 passes - as he had issues getting anything out of the slot position. Pass protection was also an issue; he took 4 sacks and had to scramble around to avoid other hits. There was 1 sequence in which he took consecutive sacks and nearly lost a fumble in the process. He later took a sack in the red zone and then was hit as he threw on the following play. However, things really opened up for him following intermission, with Phillips focusing on managing the game, as mentioned.    Houston's quarterback actually had the superior statistical performance. Keenum's final numbers were 20-of-34 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cris Collinsworth remarked that Keenum reminded him of "

   "comment":"T.Y. Hilton on a long pass. Hilton got up, seemingly untouched, and tumbled into the end zone. Replay eventually ruled that Jackson barely brushed Hilton, but it didn't really matter because Trent Richardson scored on the next play. The Colts were eventually up 24-0, and by the end of the first quarter, they had outgained Houston, 218-2. The Texans were averaging just 0.2 yards per play and looked so incredibly pathetic. And then, something happened. The light switch flipped on, and Houston suddenly began playing well, as it seemingly got a spark when the Colts had an illegal formation on a field goal attempt that ultimately led to a Texan touchdown. Arian Foster picked up big chunks on the ground, Ryan Fitzpatrick actually completed some passes, while J.J. Watt dominated the line of scrimmage on the other side of the ball. Watt was an animal, finishing with 7 tackles, 2 sacks, several passes batted down and a fumble recovery for a touchdown that finally put the game in reach for the Texans. Watt, who is the first player in the NFL since 1961 to have a receiving touchdown, a pick-six and a fumble returned for a score in the same season - and it's only Week 6 - cut the deficit to 5. Houston had 2 possessions after that to potentially come away with a victory, but simply couldn't make it happen. Andre Johnson screwed up the first time, getting called for offensive pass interference and then losing a fumble. The second drive ended quickly, as former first-rounder Bjoern Werner strip-sacked Fitzpatrick. The Colts recovered, clinching a victory.    Both Andrew Luck and Watt didn't disappoint in their latest of many epic battles to come. Watt, as mentioned, was awesome, but Luck was a bit better. The former No. 1 pick generated 300-plus yards for the 4.h-straight contest, going 25-of-44 for 370 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped by Jared Crick. Luck's performance was exemplary, especially considering that he was dealing with 2 backup guards and a center making his second career start. The center screwed up on 1 play, snapping the ball before Luck was ready. This was when Watt scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown. Luck targeted T.Y. Hilton early and often. The speedy wideout hauled in all 9 of the passes thrown his way for a whopping 223 yards and a touchdown. His yardage total was just 1 shy of Hall of Famer Raymond Berry's single-game record for the Colts. "

The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking.

   "comment":"T.Y. Hilton sealed the game at the very end. Hasselbeck finished 18-of-29 for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns amid zero turnovers despite not practicing at all this week. His numbers could've been even better, but he suffered through a couple of drops. Houston's anemic defense had something to do with it, of course, but Hasselbeck played extremely well. He tearfully told Tracy Wolfson after the game that he had nothing left.    While Hasselbeck was great, the big story was Andre Johnson. The veteran receiver, making his return to Houston, had looked completely done through 3 games. He was targeted heavily, but could do nothing with those opportunities. It seemed like he would ultimately get phased out of the offense completely, but this resurgence came out of nowhere. Johnson reeled in 6 of the 7 balls thrown to him for 77 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a big pick-up on 4.h down. None of this was fluky; Johnson dominated, which has to be very promising for the Colts (and fantasy owners) going forward.    The third veteran I mentioned earlier, Gore ripped through Houston's defense, which once again had major issues versus the run. He nearly hit the century mark, going 98 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries. He had some big lanes to run through, as the Colts did a good job neutralizing J.J. Watt. What they did was double team and chip Watt often. The other Texans should've stepped up, but it never happened.    Other Colts worth noting are T.Y. Hilton and "

Still, his big-play ability makes him a high-upside WR1 week in and week out in fantasy. After Hilton, Jack Doyle (5-61) and Donte Moncrief (3-55, 1 TD) were the major producers. Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9. and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.

   "comment":"T.Y. Hilton for 17 yards, and that set up a short field goal for Indianapolis. After a 3.and-out, Luck had Dwayne Allen fall down, and that led to Quintin Demps picking off the pass. It set up the Texans at the Colts' 16-yard line, but the Colts held the Texans to a game-tying field goal. Osweiler was able to drive to midfield on his next possession, but threw an interception to Akeem Ayers to set up the Colts just across the 50. Fortunately for Osweiler, the Texans' defense forced a 3.and-out. Houston got moving thanks to runs from Lamar Miller, a 22-yard third-down conversion to DeAndre Hopkins, and a third-and-5 was converted by Akeem Hunt with a run of 19 yards. A terrific catch by Fiedorowicz then set up the Texans at Indianapolis' 1-yard line, from where Miller charged into the end zone to finish the impressive drive and give them the 10-3 lead. Just before the half, Adam Vinatieri missed a 55-yard field goal as the ball fell short. The Texans took advantage of the short field with a couple of completions to get a 52-yard field goal from Nick Novak. They took a 13-3 lead into the locker room. Luck was only 9-of-22 for fewer than 100 yards by halftime. Early in the third quarter, Luck was clobbered by Jadeveon Clowney, which led to a floating pass that was picked off by Andre Hal. He returned the interception inside the Colts' 20-yard line. Darryl Morris dropped a potential interception in the end zone, but the Texans settled for a field goal. The Colts had a chance after they were set up in the red zone by a 41-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, and they turned that into a screen pass to Frank Gore for an 18-yard touchdown. Down 16-10, Colts moved into position to take the lead on a drive that had a completion to Chester Rogers for 21 yards, a 13-yard run by Gore, and then a 28-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, which set up the Colts at the 5.yard line. On third-and-goal, however, Clowney slammed into Luck for a blind-side strip-sack. That loose ball was recovered by Houston's Whitney Mercilus. Indianapolis was running a poorly designed play at the time, as tight end Dwayne Allen was blocking Clowney 1.on-one, and Clowney destroyed Allen. The Texans had a 20-yard pass to Fiedorowicz (3-32) and a 20-yard run from Miller to set up a 41-yard field goal from Novak, taking a 19-10 lead early in the 4.h quarter. The Colts struck back as Luck hit T.Y. Hilton for a 35-yard touchdown, who had beatend Robert Nelson to get wide open. Miller had a run of 20 yards and a gain of 16 yards on a screen to give the Texans another field goal as they ran off more than 6 minutes from the clock. Those 3 points left Luck needing a touchdown, but having less than 3 minutes remaining and no timeouts. Indianapolis crossed midfield, but the Texans forced an incompletion on a 4.h-and-1 on a horrible called screen pass by the Colts.    Luck completed 24-of-45 passes for 276 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Hilton caught 9 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. Dwayne Allen had 3 touchdowns against the Jets, but was shut out by Houston.    Gore had 41 yards on only 10 carries.    Miller was the workhorse for Houston, running for 107 yards on 21 carries with a touchdown and 15 yards receiving.    Hopkins caught 2 passes for 33 yards, but drew some critical pass-interference penalties on point-producing drives.    Osweiler completed 14-of-24 passes for 147 yards and 1 interception. He had some nice passes, but Houston's red-zone offense was brutal. Fortunately for the Texans, the defense picked them up and Nick Novak was a perfect 5-for-5 on field goals.    The Texans' defense was superb despite missing 2 of its top-three cornerbacks from injuries. Clowney stepped up with a huge game to produce 2 turnovers for his team. "

   "comment":"T.Y. Hilton for a touchdown in the opening quarter. The Colts would end up reaching the end zone on that possession because the Vikings were flagged for a leverage penalty on Adam Vinatieri's successful field goal, and Robert Turbin ultimately crossed the goal line. Luck was great, and his strong statistical afternoon seemed even sweeter for a while because both the Texans and Titans were losing in the 4.h quarter. Unfortunately for the Colts, they're still 1 game back behind both teams, as Houston and Tennessee put together late comebacks.    At any rate, Turbin absolutely wrecked some fantasy semi-finals with a pair of touchdowns. It's not like he saw extensive work, or anything; he was given just 7 attempts to Frank Gore's 26. Gore gained 101 yards in the process, but his owners have to be pissed because of Turbin's vultured scores.    Speaking of disappointed fantasy owners, you'd think T.Y. Hilton would be a big factor in a game in which Luck threw for 250 yards, but that was not the case. Hilton caught just 3 of his 7 targets for 45 yards despite Donte Moncrief's absence. Luck's touchdowns went to "

He had returned from injury a month ago, but had only seen 6 targets total over his last 3 games.    Besides the 2 big touchdown passes, Pittsburgh's defense played well, sacking Brissett 3 times and forcing a huge interception to put their team into scoring position. It will be a quick turnaround for the Steelers though, as they, along with the offense, have to play on Thursday night against the Titans, while the Colts get a bye and then also get to face the Titans.    The Steelers, despite tremendous inconsistency on offense this season, are 7-3 and have a commanding lead in the AFC North. They will have to tighten the ship and Roethlisberger's deep ball if they want to contend in the playoffs though.   "
