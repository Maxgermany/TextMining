Smith didn't play poorly, but he just struggled to keep drives alive. The 49ers were just 2-of-10 on third downs, including 0-of-7 on 3rd-and-10 or longer. To be fair, Smith was going against 1 of the top pass defenses in the NFL.    Smith once again looked for Vernon Davis in the red zone; Davis caught 3 balls for 20 yards and Smith's lone score. Crabtree, meanwhile, finished with 6 grabs for 81 yards.    The 49ers were able to establish an early lead, thanks to a 64-yard touchdown by "

At this point the offense kept moving down the field only to watch their rookie kicker act like a rookie. Alex Henery missed field goals on consecutive drives sandwiched around forcing a San Francisco punt. Suddenly, the 49ers had the ball with the outcome in doubt and 6:28 left. They got big plays from Hunter and the physically limited Frank Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper. The icing on the cake was Akers striking the extra point to make it 24-23. Still, the Dream Team had a full 3 minutes to answer the bell. Short passes put them just inside San Francisco territory. A pass to Maclin had them at the 32 and pretty much in field goal range, assuming Henery was up to it. One problem - Justin Smith forced a fumble, and a pack of 49ers was there to cover it and end the threat. Again, it wasn't over until Philly's defense let Gore run for 4, 8, 4, 5 and 5 yards on consecutive plays when it knew what was coming. How do you let an injured running back average over 5 yards per carry on a drive like that with the game on the line? There is plenty of blame to go around, but clearly this team of stars lacks heart and finishing skills.    On the other side, San Francisco got decent play from Alex Smit,h whose only turnover was a lost fumble. They have something brewing in the backfield with Gore and Hunter (11 touches for 100 yards). The passing game was littered with big plays from Crabtree, Morgan and tight end Vernon Davis all getting involved."

St. Louis then had what would eventually be their second-longest drive of the game in terms of plays (5) and yards (35). It did not result in points, obviously. San Francisco picked up a couple first downs on the next possession before punting as the first quarter came to an ugly close. The 49ers' defense turned up the heat, with Ray McDonald doing the sack/fumble thing and rookie Aldon Smith, who had a huge game, recovering. From the 6-yard line, Frank Gore tried to do the rest, but 3 runs came up short. On the second attempt, linebacker James Laurinaitis saved a touchdown, and San Francisco went up 6-0 with a short field goal. Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal."

Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back Justin Forsett. Speaking of Forsett, did anyone else notice how many players on Seattle's offense have a Bay Area connection? Lynch and Forsett both were running backs for UC-Berkeley where backup tight end Cameron Moorah and reserve lineman Mike Gibson also went. Fullback Michael Robinson played for the 49ers, while starting left tackle Pat McQuistan, left guard Robert Gallery and tight end Zach Miller were drafted by the Raiders. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Doug Baldwin went to Stanford. Kind of ridiculous isn't it? In the third quarter, it looked like San Francisco was going to ice this game. The first possession went 74 yards on 8 plays, highlighted by a 27-yard pass to Michael Crabtree (5-85) on the first play of the half and a 17-yard pickup to Vernon Davis (4-54)."

Cadillac Williams substituted in for Jackson on the next drive for St. Louis, but again, the team couldn't move the ball, so it flipped back to the 49ers. Having started at their own 33-yard line, which on this day was par for the course, San Francisco executed 2 short runs, which Smith followed by hitting Vernon Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, "

A chunk pass to Anquan Boldin (6-93) on Richard Sherman moved the 49ers into Seahawks territory. Kaepernick finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Vernon Davis (2-21) just before halftime for a 16-14 San Francisco lead.

   "comment":"Crabtree (5-45). After San Francisco tacked on another field goal, Kaepernick threw a perfect bomb to Vernon Davis for a 52-yard touchdown following the 2-minute warning. Davis burned Mark Barron in man coverage. Tampa Bay answered with a quick drive down the field for an 11-yard touchdown pass from Mike Glennon to Vincent Jackson (5-58). The 49ers added a field goal in the third quarter. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Glennon hit Tim Wright (7-82) for a 24-yard touchdown in busted coverage. San Francisco needed to answer, and Kaepernick rolled out to hit a 14-yarder to Crabtree for a first down. It was a redeeming moment for Crabtree after he had an idiotic unsportsmanlike conduct penalty earlier in the drive. Kaepernick had an unreal scramble to escape a sack and tackle for a 10-yard gain on a third-and-7. That set up a field goal. The Bucs tried some trickery with a reverse on the ensuing kickoff, but they fumbled the ball after the handoff. "

   "comment":"Crabtree in the back of the end zone. Richard Sherman was able to tip the pass right into linebacker Malcolm Smith's arms to seal the victory. Kaepernick went 14-of-24 for 153 passing yards, 1 touchdown, 2 picks and the lost fumble to go along with 130 rushing yards on 11 scrambles. Wilson, meanwhile, wasn't very good to begin the game. He was stripped immediately by Aldon Smith while trying to scramble. The 49ers recovered deep in Seattle territory, but the defense stepped up and held them to a field goal. Wilson then missed Jermaine Kearse downfield for what would've been a big gain. Luckily for the Seahawks, Wilson got stronger as the game went on despite seeing heavy pressure from the San Francisco front. He was able to keep a play alive by avoiding multiple sacks and finding Doug Baldin downfield for a 51-yard gain. Wilson was then able to take advantage of a 49er offside penalty on a 4.h-and-7 to find Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown. His only blemish down the stretch was not giving Marshawn Lynch a sure handoff on a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, allowing San Francisco to pounce on the fumble. Wilson finished 16-of-25 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He didn't do anything on the ground, rushing for zero yards on his 5 scrambles.    Wilson was credited with the lost fumble to Lynch, but it was the running back who was distraught on the sideline right after the play. Perhaps Lynch was to blame, and if that was the case, it was his only mistake of the afternoon. Lynch struggled to find running lanes in the opening quarter, but each of his carries seemed to wear San Francisco down more and more. Suddenly, his 2-yard gains turned into 8-yard rushes. He then broke free for a 40-yard scamper, which was Seattle's first touchdown of the afternoon. He ultimately rushed for 109 yards and the score on 22 carries.    While Lynch was strong in the second half - 66 of his yards came after intermission - Frank Gore couldn't get anything going throughout. Gore mustered just 14 yards on 11 carries. He had a 9-yard scamper, so take that away and he had a pathetic line of 10-5.    As mentioned, Wilson's lone touchdown went to Kearse (2-44). Baldwin led all Seahawks in receiving yardage, catching 6 balls for 106 yards. Golden Tate (4-31) and Zach Miller (3-25) were the only other Seattle players with more than 2 receptions.    Kaepernick's aerial score, once again, was thrown to Boldin (5-53), who had 2 drops in this contest. Vernon Davis managed just 2 catches for 16 yards, while Crabtree (4-52) never had a chance for the game-winning touchdown because Sherman tipped the pass away. Sherman was then flagged for taunting Crabtree, giving the throat-slash gesture. And if that wasn't completely over the top, he shrieked at Erin Andrews in the post-game interview, exclaiming that he was the best cornerback in the NFL and that Crabtree was just a mediocre at best receiver. This prompted the following ridiculous feedback on Twitter :   "

   "comment":"Crabtree at 1 point. He was responsible for horrific clock management, forcing the 49ers to waste timeouts or take delay-of-game penalties. On 1 occasion, Kaepernick took a timeout on a 4.h-and-2 when he was trying to force the defense offside. Jim Harbaugh was irate because he wanted to just take the 5-yard infraction, since he planned on punting anyway. It's this sort of lack of awareness that's costing Kaepernick and the 49ers thus far. Kaepernick ultimately finished 17-of-30 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He made countless mistakes, but made up for them a bit with his scrambling ability. He ran 7 times for 58 rushing yards.    A 49er victory seemed in doubt for multiple reasons. One was their constant mistakes; another was Vernon Davis' injury in the third quarter. Davis (2 catches, 8 yards) was hit cheaply in the back and had to leave the game, which was horrible news for Kaepernick, who has never played well without his prized tight end. However, Kaepernick overcame Davis' absence and was able to lead his team on several second-half scoring drives to lead his team to victory.    Michael Crabtree also got hurt. He suffered a foot injury, but was able to shake it off, save for a dropped pass. He tied Anquan Boldin with 5 catches each, with Boldin outgaining him, 62-43. "

Crabtree clearly had possession over the goal line, but Boger was too incompetent to realize that. Boger then screwed up again; Kaepernick fumbled the snap on an attempted quarterback sneak, which was recovered by James Lauriniaitis in the end zone for the game-sealing touchback. However, replay showed that Kaepernick's elbow was down. Boger once again botched the call. Boger was once again an embarrassment - it seems like he screws up every week - but that doesn't excuse the 49ers for losing. They were a double-digit favorite, and if they were any good, they would've taken care of business. They'll get some defenders back soon, but if they can't block for Kaepernick, it won't matter at all.    Kaepernick went 22-of-33 for 237 yards, a touchdown and 2 lost fumbles. Those numbers aren't bad, but they would've been so much better if he had decent protection. That said, Kaepernick had a couple of close calls on potential interceptions, including 1 in the first quarter when he telegraphed a ball that was dropped by LaMarcus Joyner. Kaepernick's score went to Boldin, who had a big game. He was 1 of the few outstanding San Francisco players on this side of the ball; he reeled in 6 of his 7 targets for 93 yards and the touchdown.

   "comment":"Crabtree then screwed up, dropping a pass on a crucial third down along the sideline. Crabtree redeemed himself, however, by hauling in a 51-yard bomb on the very next play that set up a game-tying field goal that sent the contest to overtime. The 49ers ultimately prevailed by recovering a Brees strip-sack and then kicking a short field goal right away.    Kaepernick went 14-of-34 for 210 yards and a touchdown. The completion percentage looks terrible, but once again, he was hurt by several big drops in the second half. Kaepernick also scrambled 4 times for 24 rushing yards. He took some bad sacks, and that's something he needs to fix. Kaepernick's sole score was thrown to Boldin, who had 6 catches for 95 yards. He dropped some balls, as mentioned, but he was the only weapon of Kaepernick's who played well. Crabtree (3-62) had that long completion, but he seemed to be temporarily benched in favor of Stevie Johnson at 1 point. "

That is, until the 4.h quarter.    Carr finished the day with 24-of-31 attempts for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns. That 77.4 percent completion rate was his highest of the season and is especially nice considering the Chargers were allowing a 61 percent completion rate coming into the game. This performance puts him right back up in the conversation of up-and-coming quarterbacks; now, if he can just find some consistency.    The Raiders let off the gas, and Philip Rivers gave it a run, making 3 touchdown passes in the last quarter. There never really was much of a chance San Diego would be able to come back all the way, but there were a couple times that it felt like it was in the realm of possibility.    After an ugly start, Rivers finished the game having gone 38-of-58 for 336 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. This wasn't a game he'll remember fondly, but he has now topped 300 yards in 5-of-7 games, and has multiple touchdown passes in 6-of-7.    "

Crabtree made a nice catch surrounded by defenders, but he could have been completely covered and the ball wouldn't have been touched by anyone else.    Carr had thrown an interception in the end zone earlier in the 4.h quarter, which set him up as the fall guy, but returning with that pass to Crabtree erased that pick and pushes anyone to realize that Carr is for real. Of course, his 300-plus yards and 4 touchdown passes helps us realize that as well. He's now thrown for multiple touchdowns in 6-of-8 games and now has 11 touchdowns to 1 interception and 923 yards passing over his last 3 games. These aren't numbers that average quarterbacks put up consistently, even against sub-par defenses.    So, Crabtree put up the best numbers on the day, but "

   "comment":"Crabtree for a potential touchdown. The Raiders would've gone up 13 points had Carr connected with his open receiver. Instead, he hung on to the ball for far too long on an ensuing play. Like an idiot, he danced around the pocket and heaved an interception that was nearly taken back for a touchdown by linebacker Josh Mauga, who was tackled at the 2-yard line. The Chiefs scored shortly after, but couldn't take the lead because of a botched snap on the extra point. Still, the Raiders appeared as though they were going to take the lead to break the 20-20 tie. However, Crabtree dropped a pass, and then Carr followed that up with an interception on a miscommunication, which the Chiefs turned into a touchdown. They once again screwed up the extra point, so they were up 6. The Raiders had a chance to slice the Kansas City advantage in half, but "

   "comment":"Crabtree led the way with just 6 catches for 39 yards and a touchdown, a perfect fade pass from Carr. As for Cooper, he murdered his fantasy owners with just 2 catches for 10 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Cooper would be credited with a reception of minus-20 yards because of a Stanford Band-type play at the end of the first half, but the box score apparently didn't penalize him for this.    Latavius Murray ran well, gaining 79 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. He was also second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 38 yards. Murray became the first Oakland back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season for the first time in 5 years. However, the Raiders made the mistake of not running the ball nearly enough. They were never down by double digits, so there was no reason to have a 2:1 pass-to-rush ratio.    As for the Chargers, they once again battled hard, but had nothing to show for it. They had a lead for the majority of the contest, but tight end David Johnson lost a fumble near midfield with about 4 minutes in regulation, which the Raiders recovered and returned inside the 5-yard line. This set up the Crabtree touchdown that helped send the game into overtime. San Diego appeared to be in complete control before that; they were actually running out the clock at that moment. They also made another atrocious mistake when they were flagged for unnecessary roughness on a second-and-29 in overtime. It's both a shame and a blessing for San Diego. The loss was crushing, but could end up being beneficial, as another victory would have ruined draft positioning.    "

   "comment":"Crabtree for the game-winning score, prompting the announcers to dub Del Rio Black Jack. Though Oakland prevailed, there were some concerning things about its offense. That might seem like a strange thing to say, given that Derek Carr went 24-of-38 for 319 yards and a touchdown, but keep in mind that the Saints quite possibly might have the worst defense in the NFL and sustained an injury to its top cornerback, Delvin Breaux, in this contest. Things won't be as easy against better opponents, and Carr and the rest of the offense need to clean up some of their mistakes. For instance, there were some drops, including 1 from Seth Roberts inside the New Orleans 5-yard line. Carr, meanwhile, had some poor throws. One was off his back foot on a third down despite having a clean pocket. He also led Clive Walford out of bounds in the red zone and then floated a high pass out of play on a 4.h down that seemingly ended the game, but he was bailed out by a horrible pass interference call; the pass should've been deemed uncatchable. Again, I don't want to sound overly negative because the Raiders made a great comeback and ultimately prevailed, but they were fortunate because of both the officiating and the opposition. If they want to make a playoff run - and they certainly have the talent to do so - they need to clean up their mistakes because they'll be penalized versus tougher foes. Something that would also help would be getting their right tackle situation shored up. It was fine heading into the game, but Menelik Watson and his backup both got hurt. To compensate for this, the Raiders moved Donald Penn to right tackle, sliding guard Kelechi Osemele to the blind side. Meanwhile, on defense, cornerback Sean Smith wishes he sustained an injury, so that he could at least have an excuse for being torched so brutally. Smith was ultimately benched.    Roberts scored Carr's lone touchdown, which happened to put Crabtree in position to secure the 2.pointer. Crabtree caught 7 passes for 87 yards. His 2 blemishes were a dropped pass and a horrible call on an unsportsmanlike penalty for celebrating too much after giving the Raiders the decisive score. Crabtree did throw the ball up into the air, but the officials need to calm the hell down. Players can't be mindless automatons, so they're going to celebrate after a game-winning play. As for "

   "comment":"Crabtree to move the ball down the field. Oakland was stopped on the goal line to settle for a short field goal. Promptly, Rivers tossed an underthrown pass that was picked off by Sean Smith and returned into San Diego territory, but Sebastian Janikowski missed the field goal. The Chargers got moving and Rivers hit Tyrell Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1.yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On 4.h-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2.point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the 4.h quarter.

Sadly, Crabtree trailed the Raider leader in receiving yardage by only 8 yards, as Cooper snatched 5 of his 10 targets for just 29 yards. Cooper should've had more, but as mentioned, Carr couldn't hit an open Cooper for a long touchdown.    Seth Roberts needs to be brought up again. He dropped 3 passes, including 1 in the end zone. Though he converted a 4.h-and-4, Roberts is 1 of the worst receivers in the NFL.    As for the running game, Cris Collinsworth kept harping about how much more effective Oakland's rushing attack would've been had Kelechi Osemele not been a late scratch. Osemele is 1 of the top guards in the NFL, and his unexpected absence certainly had a big impact. Even with him gone, "

   "comment":"Crabtree could grab it, and the receiver had an epic toe tap that gave them the score. It was 1 of the best plays of the day. The only negative for Carr was his interception. It was lazily thrown into good coverage, and the Chargers had no issues taking advantage of the mistake. Still, the pick was uncharacteristic of Carr, and he will likely improve as his finger continues to heal.    Carr really spread the wealth among the Raiders, as they saw 10 different receivers catch a pass on Sunday afternoon. Carr's preferred target was Crabtree (6-60, 1 TD). Crabtree was able to frequently get open in the mid-range areas, and Carr was able to locate him. Crabtree may have been able to do better, as he did have trouble getting his hands on a couple of balls, but he should be the top receiver for the team for the rest of the season. "

It's still way too early in the season to make final judgments, but the early returns are not looking good.    Conversely, Marshawn Lynch had a strong debut. The numbers don't pop out - he gained 76 yards on 18 carries - but he had some powerful runs. On 1 occasion, he appeared to be stopped on short yardage, but he muscled through the defender to pick up the first down.    Cooper may have scored the first touchdown, but he converted on just 5 of his 13 targets. He logged 62 yards, but should've scored on 2 other occasions if it weren't for a couple of drops.

In fact, Carr misfired on just 5 occasions, going 23-of-28 for 230 yards and the 3 scores. Crabtree caught 6 passes for 80 yards otherwise.    As for Lynch, he didn't get to do much because of the blowout. He pushed the Jets around, moving piles for 45 yards and a score on 12 carries. "

   "comment":"Crabtree and Amari Cooper drop passes, with the instances sandwiching a holding penalty that negated a first down. Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a "

The Raiders were pushed back to the 11-yard line, and Carr tossed an incomplete ball, but a defensive hold gave Oakland another chance. The same exact thing happened on the next play. Carr, finally, was able to connect with Crabtree in the end zone for the decisive score as time expired. Carr had a tremendous performance, especially considering his back injury. Carr could barely throw 10-yard passes last Sunday, so I didn't think he'd play well in this contest, considering it was just 4 days later. However, Carr was prolific, and the stats tell the whole story. He went 29-of-52 for 417 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had some errant throws, so he's not 100 percent, but he was obviously much better than he was on Sunday. At this rate, Carr should be completely healthy for next week's game in Buffalo.
