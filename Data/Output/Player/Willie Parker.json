  "comment":"Willie Parker that took the ball down to Miami's 8-yard line. Had Parker stayed inbounds, the game would have been over because the Dolphins didn't have any timeouts. Instead, the crooked Parker for some reason angled toward the sideline and consequently stopped the clock. This game Miami a long-shot chance, but instead allowed Pittsburgh to kick a field goal to give it a 6-point advantage. Like I said, really frustrating.    Ben Roethlisberger was on top of his game, helping the Steelers move the chains all afternoon; they were 7-of-14 on third downs and 403 total net yards of offense. It's worth noting, however, that Roethlisberger suffered an arm injury in the 4.h quarter that probably would have impacted him if the Steelers would have reached the playoffs. Big Ben was 18-of-27 for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns. His scores went to Mike Wallace (2-64), Heath Miller (5-56) and Santonio Holmes (1-5). Hines Ward didn't get into the end zone, but played well despite his hamstring, collecting 8 receptions for 61 yards.    The Steelers rushed for 202 yards in this contest, with Rashard Mendenhall and Willie Parker garnering 94 and 91 yards, respectively.    The Dolphins, meanwhile, didn't run the ball well at all, which was a bit of a surprise because the Steelers had been struggling against the rush without Troy Polamalu. ",
