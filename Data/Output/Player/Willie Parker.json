When that happened, I had a pretty good feeling that the Steelers weren't going to cover the spread.    Two big stories for the Steelers. On the defensive side, Troy Polamalu played just his second game of the season. Polamalu made his presence known with an interception. Polamalu limped off the field on the same left knee he hurt in the opener after making the pick, but he returned to the game later on.    On offense, Ben Roethlisberger was 23-of-35 for a whopping 417 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Roethlisberger was sacked 3 times, but often had a ton of time to throw on most plays. On his first score, Roethlisberger seriously had 10 seconds in the pocket.    Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes both had huge games. Ward caught 8 balls for 159 yards and a touchdown, while Holmes grabbed 5 balls for 104 yards. Heath Miller, meanwhile, chipped in with 5 receptions for 80 yards and a score.    Rashard Mendenhall shouldered most of the workload in this contest, rushing for 62 yards and a score on 17 carries. Willie Parker had just 7 attempts for 26 yards, but fumbled the ball away in the third quarter. I was ready to criticize Mike Tomlin for using Parker, but Mendenhall fumbled on the next drive.

   "comment":"Willie Parker that took the ball down to Miami's 8-yard line. Had Parker stayed inbounds, the game would have been over because the Dolphins didn't have any timeouts. Instead, the crooked Parker for some reason angled toward the sideline and consequently stopped the clock. This game Miami a long-shot chance, but instead allowed Pittsburgh to kick a field goal to give it a 6-point advantage. Like I said, really frustrating.    Ben Roethlisberger was on top of his game, helping the Steelers move the chains all afternoon; they were 7-of-14 on third downs and 403 total net yards of offense. It's worth noting, however, that Roethlisberger suffered an arm injury in the 4.h quarter that probably would have impacted him if the Steelers would have reached the playoffs. Big Ben was 18-of-27 for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns. His scores went to Mike Wallace (2-64), Heath Miller (5-56) and Santonio Holmes (1-5). Hines Ward didn't get into the end zone, but played well despite his hamstring, collecting 8 receptions for 61 yards.    The Steelers rushed for 202 yards in this contest, with Rashard Mendenhall and Willie Parker garnering 94 and 91 yards, respectively.    The Dolphins, meanwhile, didn't run the ball well at all, which was a bit of a surprise because the Steelers had been struggling against the rush without Troy Polamalu. Parker that took the ball down to Miami's 8-yard line. Had Parker stayed inbounds, the game would have been over because the Dolphins didn't have any timeouts.
