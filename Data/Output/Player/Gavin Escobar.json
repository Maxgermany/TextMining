   "comment":"Gavin Escobar. The latter touchdown came right after Maxwell dropped a potential Romo pick-six early on, which would've made the score 17-0. Romo was also charged with a lost fumble much later, but that was the center's fault, as it was a botched snap on a silent count.    Wilson, meanwhile, completed just half of his passes, going 14-of-28 for 126 yards and an interception, which came very late on an overthrow. He salvaged his fantasy day with 12 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground, but he had a miserable performance overall. Wilson and the rest of the team simply looked unprepared. The Seahawks were penalized 9 times, and many of the infractions were very sloppy, such as flags for 12 men on the field. The Seahawks also uncharacteristically burned through their timeouts in the second half, which they desperately needed in crunch time.    Lynch, as mentioned, didn't get much work. He was given just 10 carries, but ran well when given the opportunity. He managed 61 yards on his limited attempts.    Escobar.
