Henry is not a real factor in fantasy yet, but if he get more carries, he could become a high-upside flex play.    The Titans were happy to get Delanie Walker healthy. Walker led the team in targets, catches and yards, finishing the day with 5 catches for 66 yards and a touchdown. On the score, Walker caught a bullet pass from Mariota over the middle of the field. Walker dragged a defender the last 3 yards before lunging in for the score. "

   "comment":"Derrick Henry and a reception to Delanie Walker set up a first-and-goal that Henry turned into a touchdown. The Texans responded with a 51-yard pass to Hopkins, but ultimately had to settle for a field goal. Cassel soon loaded up a 50-yard completion to Matthews after he beat Robert Nelson once again, and that set up a field goal for Tennessee to take a 24-10 lead. Nelson and Texans backup Denzel Rice were being beaten like a drum. Osweiler hit Wendall Williams for a 26-yard reception, and on a 4.h-and-goal, Osweiler ran the ball into the end zone to cut the lead to 24-17 with just over 3 minutes remaining. Derrick Henry ran the clock down, and Osweiler was unable to engineer a touchdown drive in the final minute.    Savage was 5-for-8 for 25 yards before leaving the game. Osweiler was 21-of-40 for 253 yards with a touchdown passing and another 1 rushing.    DeAndre Hopkins made 7 receptions for 123 yards. The Texans pulled him early to protect him for their playoff game.    Cassel was 16-of-26 for 150 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Henry led Tennessee in rushing with 65 yards on 15 carries. "

   "comment":"Derrick Henry was more effective on the ground (11-52), which wasn't a surprise because Murray came into the game with an injury. It's unclear why Tennessee gave Murray so much work; it wouldn't been a better strategy to allow him to heal. Instead, Murray looked sluggish and risked further injury.    Matthews, who had the aforementioned dropped touchdown, was second on the team with 50 receiving yards on 5 catches. However, his drop not only took 7 points off the board; Tennessee didn't even get any points on the drive because of a missed field goal. "
