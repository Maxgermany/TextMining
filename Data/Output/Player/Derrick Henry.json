They led 27-7 and appeared to think that this game was over. Except, it wasn't. Thanks in part to Jurrell Casey's injury (sprained foot), the Bears roared back, trimming the lead to 27-21. They had a chance to win at the end and even had the game won, but Josh Bellamy dropped an easy catch in the end zone. This was 1 of countless drops Chicago was guilty of down the stretch. The Bears were able to get wide open against Tennessee's poor secondary, but couldn't prevent themselves from dropping lots of passes. Of course, this is what happens to a team missing 3 of its top weapons.    At any rate, Mariota finished 15-of-23 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well overall, especially in the first half, but he barely threw the ball following the break; he was just 5-of-9 for 87 yards after intermission. The Titans didn't need to throw much at first, and this appeared to ruin Mariota's rhythm. This was apparent when he overthrew a wide-open Kendall Wright for a long touchdown late in the game. Mariota, by the way, didn't have to do much running. He scrambled only 4 times, but picked up 46 yards in the process, which includes a 29-yard scamper.    Mariota's scores were thrown to Rishrd Matthews (3-64) and Delanie Walker (3-50). Neither Wright (0 catches) nor Tajae Sharpe (2-11) did much, though the former would've secured a long touchdown had Mariota not missed him.    It might be time for the Titans to give Henry a greater workload. "

DeMarco Murray continued to lead the backfield and showed no signs of the hamstring injury that had made him questionable in the leadup to the contest. Overall, Murray totaled 115 yards on 14 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run that saw him follow his blockers perfectly and cut into open space all across the field. He is a low-end RB1 right now, though Henry could take some opportunities away from him in the future. Speaking of Henry, he started the game poorly, and at 1 point, had 4 carries for minus-6 yards. By the end of the day, Henry had racked up 54 yards on 13 carries, and he looked good in the second half. Henry has RB1 potential for the future, but that won't happen this year unless Murray misses time.    Tennessee's offensive line also deserves credit for this performance. The team's line is 1 of the top units in the league and will continue to provide quality blocking for Mariota and the backs all season, provided that the linemen can stay healthy. Speaking of Mariota, he had an impressive performance against a stout Seattle defense. Early on, Mariota was under pressure, but he was able to scramble away from sacks and make plays outside the pocket. He used his mobility to his advantage, and that helped to take away the effectiveness of the Seahawks' defensive line, which is their strongest part of the defensive unit. Mariota was very accurate per usual, and he was able to spread the ball around and find the open man. Overall, Mariota went 20-of-32 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he helped the Titans to control the game. Mariota has a great grasp of the offense, and his ability to analyze defenses and find effective matchups will be a major weapon for the Titans.    With Corey Davis out, Mariota focus on targeting "

Following a 17-yard DeMarco Murray reception, Mariota escaped some pressure to find a wide-open Eric Decker in the end zone. Mariota finished 19-of-28 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and a careless interception in the 4.h quarter. He threw well for the most part, but still didn't show that he has recovered from his hamstring. He scrambled just 2 times for 7 yards.    Speaking of formerly injured Titans, Walker and rookie receiver Corey Davis made their return to the field. They tied for second in targets with 5 each, with Walker outgaining Davis, 71-28. Davis was matched up against fellow rookie cornerback Marlon Humphrey. As for the Titans' leader in targets, that was Rishard Matthews, who secured 4 of the 7 balls thrown his way for 70 yards and a touchdown. Matthews' sole blemish dropped pass in the second half.    Murray, who also fits under the category of banged-up Tennessee players, missed some action in this game with an injury, though he returned to the field in the second half. Despite this, Murray had more carries than Henry, 9-8. Unsurprisingly, Henry generated more yardage than Henry, 26-19. Henry, who scored a touchdown, needs to get more work than Murray because he's just better at this stage of their careers. Still, neither had much running room against a Baltimore defense that has been better against ground attacks with "

It's unclear why Tennessee gave Murray so much work; it wouldn't been a better strategy to allow him to heal. Instead, Murray looked sluggish and risked further injury.    Matthews, who had the aforementioned dropped touchdown, was second on the team with 50 receiving yards on 5 catches. However, his drop not only took 7 points off the board; Tennessee didn't even get any points on the drive because of a missed field goal. "
