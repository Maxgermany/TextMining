   "comment":"Boldin 11 times for 87 yards and a touchdown. Larry Fitzgerald had 5 grabs for 71 yards, while Steve Breaston collected 6 receptions for 86 yards.    New York's victory over the Cardinals is pretty remarkable. First of all, Arizona had been undefeated at home going into this contest. Second, the Giants didn't have the services of Brandon Jacobs or Plaxico Burress (Burress lasted only 1 series).    Without Jacobs to rely on, Manning took matters into his own hands, going 26-of-33 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Manning spread the ball around to Domenik Hixon (6 catches, 57 yards), Kevin Boss (4 catches, 48 yards, TD), Steve Smith (4 catches, 45 yards), Amani Toomer (4 catches, 30 yards, TD) and Derrick Ward (4 catches, 30 yards). Ward also had 69 rushing yards and a score on 20 carries. Surprisingly, Ahmad Bradshaw touched the ball only 4 times for 9 yards.    Some notable things: 1) Arizona attempted a 68-yard field goal at the end of the half. Credit Ken Whisenhunt for calling an old rule, the fair catch for a free kick. Neil Rackers had the opportunity to try the field goal without any sort of rush. Unfortunately, he hit the ball off the side of his foot. The kick wouldn't have been good from 1 yard out. 2) Giants corner Aaron Ross was whistled for 4 penalties. 3) Larry Fitzgerald caught his 400th career pass in this game, becoming the second-fastest player in NFL history to reach that mark (71 games). The fastest? Anquan Boldin, 67 games.   "

This is a moot point because the Cardinals won, but it seemed like the zebras seemingly missed every call in Arizona's favor, prompting Wraith to ask So how much money do the refs have on the Falcons? Larry Fitzgerald was mugged twice on what should have been obvious pass interference infractions. Bert Berry was also held in the end zone for a possible safety. It's almost as if the officials were thinking, Wait a second, these Cardinals aren't supposed to be here! That looks like a penalty, but I'm not quite sure what to do! Hopefully for all the new Arizona fans out there, this doesn't carry over to the Carolina/New York game.   "

Rice had just 14 touches, including only 9 carries. That's just inexcusable. Cameron didn't give Rice any touches when the Ravens were pinned inside their own 6-yard line in the first quarter, which led to the safety and Houston's subsequent barrage of points. I'd say it's time for Baltimore to begin searching for a new play-caller, but I've been criticizing Cameron for years.   "

   "comment":"Boldin early on, and that's why Joe Flacco began the contest just 1-of-6. Talib grabbed his hamstring after an incompletion and then headed to the locker room. He returned to the sidelines, but never saw the field again. Later in the first half, safety Patrick Chung was knocked out after Baltimore's first touchdown. Talib and Chung being out made life extremely easy for Flacco, who finished 21-of-36 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 20-of-30 for 223 yards following that slow start, hitting so many key throws. It seemed like Bill Belichick had a great game plan in place for stopping Flacco, but that was thrown out the window when 2 starters in his secondary went down. The third injury was to Stevan Ridley, who was knocked out with a concussion during a fierce Bernard Pollard hit. Ridley (18 carries, 70 yards) simply collapsed and lost control of the football as a consequence. The Ravens pounced on it and would go on to score a touchdown to put the game out of reach. By the way, how happy will Patriot fans be when Pollard retires? He's already been responsible for tearing the ACLs of Tom Brady and Wes Welker, and he also caused an injury to Rob Gronkowski last year. Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster.    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key fourth down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots.    As for the Raven receivers, Boldin scored twice, as he finished with 5 receptions for 60 yards. He humorously stood over "

   "comment":"Boldin was whistled for offensive pass interference. Donte Whitner dropped an interception. Colin Kaepernick nearly tossed a pick himself. It was pretty ugly, but despite all of this, the Rams just led 3-0. The 49ers were fortunate St. Louis struggled to do anything following a promising first couple of drives; they eventually got into a groove and converted touchdowns, putting this game away. The 49ers were able to do this via the ground attack. After completely neglecting the run against the Colts, they made sure they rammed it down St. Louis' throat. Frank Gore rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, while Kendall Hunter chipped in with 49 yards and a score on 11 attempts. Anthony Dixon (3-6) also found the end zone. San Francisco's offensive line pushed around a Rams' front that has been atrocious this season.    Kaepernick misfired 4 times in each half, going 15-of-23 for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was very sharp in the red zone, allowing his team to score sevens instead of threes. His flaw, however, is that he sometimes stares down his receivers. He's lucky James Laurinaitis didn't pick off a couple of his passes. Kaepernick's scores went to his main targets: Anquan Boldin (5-90) and Vernon Davis (2-18)."

   "comment":"Boldin (6-56) to tie the game at 7. Kaepernick got extremely lucky in the second quarter after Saints cornerback Corey White picked off him and raced down the sideline. As White tried to extend the ball over the goal line, he lost control and fumbled the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. Frank Gore (13-48) then ripped off a 24-yard run to help set up a 55-yard field goal for Phil Dawson. New Orleans responded with Travaris Cadet taking the kickoff back 82 yards. Fullback Jed Collins powered into the end zone from a yard out and the Saints were up 14-10 at the half. In the third quarter, 49ers' linebacker Ahmad Brooks made a great play to record a leaping interception when Brees tried to float a ball over the linebacker to Jimmy Graham (6-41). Brooks' pick set up San Francisco's offense just outside the 20. The 49ers took the lead with Kaepernick rolling to his right to hit Vernon Davis (4-33) in the middle of the end zone. San Francisco had a drive go inside the Saints 20 with a critical 14-yard reception by Boldin on a third down, but the Saints' defense stepped up to force another 49er field goal. Brees answered with a 34-yard pass to Meachem (2-78) and dropped in a beautiful 26-yard touch pass to "

This is illegal, and San Francisco should've moved backward 5 yards, which would've probably forced a field goal, given that the team didn't have much time remaining on the clock.    Given that the Panthers were battling the unstoppable combination of Jim Harbaugh and the officials, it's understandable that some of the players would get deflated. This, however, does not excuse Cam Newton sulking on the sideline. He showed terrible body language, and even though a comeback was possible down 23-10 with 8 minutes remaining, it was obvious that the 49ers would come away with the victory. Newton had a horrific second half. After going 8-of-10 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (the pass thrown behind Brandon LaFell) in the first half, Newton was just 7-of-12 for 72 yards and a pick (overthrow into double coverage) after the break, subtracting a garbage-time 59-yard flip to Ted Ginn. His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from "

   "comment":"Boldin. However, Kaepernick struggled mightily in the fourth quarter. He was strip-sacked by Cliff Avril early in the period. Michael Bennett scooped up the ball and ran inside the San Francisco 10-yard line. Kaepernick then telegraphed an interception right to Kam Chancellor. After that, he drove the team deep into Seattle territory on what appeared to be the final offensive possession of the game, but he underthrew Michael Crabtree in the back of the end zone. Richard Sherman was able to tip the pass right into linebacker Malcolm Smith's arms to seal the victory. Kaepernick went 14-of-24 for 153 passing yards, 1 touchdown, 2 picks and the lost fumble to go along with 130 rushing yards on 11 scrambles. Wilson, meanwhile, wasn't very good to begin the game. He was stripped immediately by Aldon Smith while trying to scramble. The 49ers recovered deep in Seattle territory, but the defense stepped up and held them to a field goal. Wilson then missed Jermaine Kearse downfield for what would've been a big gain. Luckily for the Seahawks, Wilson got stronger as the game went on despite seeing heavy pressure from the San Francisco front. He was able to keep a play alive by avoiding multiple sacks and finding Doug Baldin downfield for a 51-yard gain. Wilson was then able to take advantage of a 49er offside penalty on a fourth-and-7 to find Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown. His only blemish down the stretch was not giving Marshawn Lynch a sure handoff on a fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line, allowing San Francisco to pounce on the fumble. Wilson finished 16-of-25 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He didn't do anything on the ground, rushing for zero yards on his 5 scrambles.    Wilson was credited with the lost fumble to Lynch, but it was the running back who was distraught on the sideline right after the play. Perhaps Lynch was to blame, and if that was the case, it was his only mistake of the afternoon. Lynch struggled to find running lanes in the opening quarter, but each of his carries seemed to wear San Francisco down more and more. Suddenly, his 2-yard gains turned into 8-yard rushes. He then broke free for a 40-yard scamper, which was Seattle's first touchdown of the afternoon. He ultimately rushed for 109 yards and the score on 22 carries.    While Lynch was strong in the second half - 66 of his yards came after intermission - Frank Gore couldn't get anything going throughout. Gore mustered just 14 yards on 11 carries. He had a 9-yard scamper, so take that away and he had a pathetic line of 10-5.    As mentioned, Wilson's lone touchdown went to Kearse (2-44). Baldwin led all Seahawks in receiving yardage, catching 6 balls for 106 yards. Golden Tate (4-31) and Zach Miller (3-25) were the only other Seattle players with more than 2 receptions.    Kaepernick's aerial score, once again, was thrown to Boldin (5-53), who had 2 drops in this contest. "

   "comment":"Boldin headbutt wiped out out a touchdown opportunity. It instead forced a field goal, which was blocked. The 49ers were then whistled for taunting out of bounds when Arizona was flagged for a hold. A second-and-long transformed into a manageable situation, which the Cardinals were able to convert. San Francisco was also flagged for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Larry Fitzgerald, all while dropping several potential Drew Stanton interceptions. Again, these were just some of the blunders the 49ers committed. There were many more that I didn't mention. It's so strange because San Francisco used to be so well-coached. That's not the case this year, as Jim Harbaugh appears to have lost control of his team.    All of the mistakes ruined what was a solid performance from Colin Kaepernick. The 49er signal-caller ran more than he has in a regular-season game in a long while, as he scrambled 13 times for 54 rushing yards. He showed off great athleticism to elude some sacks, including 1 instance in which Thomas Keiser had him by the jersey. Kaepernick was able to shed him to help his team put points on the board during that possession. As a passer, Kaepernick misfired on just 8 occasions, going 29-of-37 for 245 yards and a touchdown. He got away with some mistakes early - Antonio Cromartie dropped 2 potential pick-sixes - and he misfired badly on his final attempt, but he was definitely not at fault for this defeat. Kaepernick's sole score went to Michael Crabtree, who reeled in 10 of his 11 targets for 80 yards. However, Stevie Johnson paced the 49ers in catches (9) and receiving yards (103). Boldin didn't do much (6-36) aside from costing his team points. You'd think a veteran like him would know better. Harbaugh spent some time yelling at Boldin on the sideline, but the message was lost because his team wouldn't stop shooting themselves in the foot.    The 49ers struggled to run the ball. "

   "comment":"Boldin on a third down. He missed an available Michael Crabtree at 1 point. He was responsible for horrific clock management, forcing the 49ers to waste timeouts or take delay-of-game penalties. On 1 occasion, Kaepernick took a timeout on a fourth-and-2 when he was trying to force the defense offside. Jim Harbaugh was irate because he wanted to just take the 5-yard infraction, since he planned on punting anyway. It's this sort of lack of awareness that's costing Kaepernick and the 49ers thus far. Kaepernick ultimately finished 17-of-30 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He made countless mistakes, but made up for them a bit with his scrambling ability. He ran 7 times for 58 rushing yards.    A 49er victory seemed in doubt for multiple reasons. One was their constant mistakes; another was Vernon Davis' injury in the third quarter. Davis (2 catches, 8 yards) was hit cheaply in the back and had to leave the game, which was horrible news for Kaepernick, who has never played well without his prized tight end. However, Kaepernick overcame Davis' absence and was able to lead his team on several second-half scoring drives to lead his team to victory.    Michael Crabtree also got hurt. He suffered a foot injury, but was able to shake it off, save for a dropped pass. He tied Anquan Boldin with 5 catches each, with Boldin outgaining him, 62-43. "

   "comment":"Boldin. Michael Crabtree caught a pass that appeared to be a touchdown, but Jerome Boger didn't rule it to be so because he isn't aware of what the NFL rules are. Crabtree clearly had possession over the goal line, but Boger was too incompetent to realize that. Boger then screwed up again; Kaepernick fumbled the snap on an attempted quarterback sneak, which was recovered by James Lauriniaitis in the end zone for the game-sealing touchback. However, replay showed that Kaepernick's elbow was down. Boger once again botched the call. Boger was once again an embarrassment - it seems like he screws up every week - but that doesn't excuse the 49ers for losing. They were a double-digit favorite, and if they were any good, they would've taken care of business. They'll get some defenders back soon, but if they can't block for Kaepernick, it won't matter at all.    Kaepernick went 22-of-33 for 237 yards, a touchdown and 2 lost fumbles. Those numbers aren't bad, but they would've been so much better if he had decent protection. That said, Kaepernick had a couple of close calls on potential interceptions, including 1 in the first quarter when he telegraphed a ball that was dropped by LaMarcus Joyner. Kaepernick's score went to Boldin, who had a big game. He was 1 of the few outstanding San Francisco players on this side of the ball; he reeled in 6 of his 7 targets for 93 yards and the touchdown.

   "comment":"Boldin for a 30-yard touchdown after he got open on a corner route against Brandon Meriweather. The Redskins got going as Alfred Morris ripped off a 23-yard run, but Chris Borland and Justin Smith dropped Griffin for no gain on a third-down run to force a punt. That refrain repeated itself with a good run by Morris, but the drive ended courtesy of a Ray McDonald sack. Meriweather forced a fumble from Carlos Hyde that let the Redskins took over at their own 40, but they did nothing with the possession. Washington finally got a nice drive going thanks to passes to Andre Roberts and Pierre Garcon (3-34). Morris (21-125) charged hard with 11 yards to the 1-yard line. He then finished the drive with a plunge into the end zone. Just before the half, the 49ers moved the ball with a tremendous 25-yard catch by Michael Crabtree (5-58) to set up a 41-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Kaepernick threw a ball up for grabs in the third quarter that was picked off by Greg Ducre. The Redskins didn't get anything out of that possession, but on the next drive, they moved the ball with an 11-yard run by Morris and a 31-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (2-39). Aaron Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. "

In the fourth quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal.

   "comment":"Boldin for a gain of 29 yards while taking a bit hit on a third-and-18. This improbable conversion set up the tying field goal after Minnesota linebacker Eric Kendricks was able to temporary stop the bleeding with a terrific tackle on third down. The Kendricks stop seemed to be absolutely huge, especially after the Vikings moved the chains on the ensuing drive, but Cordarrelle Patterson negated that conversion by lining up incorrectly. The play immediately following the penalty was Bradford's pick, snatched by Darius Slay. Stafford was also on fire in the early going, starting 8-of-8 for 69 yards. His initial incompletion was a Golden Tate drop. Stafford's receivers betrayed him throughout the afternoon. Andre Roberts dropped a deep touchdown after a Minnesota corner fell down. Marvin Jones also had a considerable gain wiped out when the ball slipped through his hands. Stafford finished 23-of-40 for 232 yards and a touchdown (as well as 30 rushing yards), but as you can see, his numbers should've been a lot better. The Vikings were able to stymie Stafford in the third quarter with some great pressure, but the Detroit signal-caller eventually came through in the clutch, as he's been wont to do this year.    Stafford's sole aerial score went to Boldin, who caught 7 passes for 69 yards. He trailed only Tate in that category, as Tate snatched 5 balls for 77 yards. Jones saw the most targets (11), but had a disappointing result - 4 catches, 54 yards - thanks to "
