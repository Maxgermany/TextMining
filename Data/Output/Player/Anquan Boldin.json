New York's victory over the Cardinals is pretty remarkable. First of all, Arizona had been undefeated at home going into this contest. Second, the Giants didn't have the services of Brandon Jacobs or Plaxico Burress (Burress lasted only 1 series).    Without Jacobs to rely on, Manning took matters into his own hands, going 26-of-33 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Manning spread the ball around to Domenik Hixon (6 catches, 57 yards), Kevin Boss (4 catches, 48 yards, TD), Steve Smith (4 catches, 45 yards), Amani Toomer (4 catches, 30 yards, TD) and Derrick Ward (4 catches, 30 yards). Ward also had 69 rushing yards and a score on 20 carries. Surprisingly, Ahmad Bradshaw touched the ball only 4 times for 9 yards.    Some notable things: 1) Arizona attempted a 68-yard field goal at the end of the half. Credit Ken Whisenhunt for calling an old rule, the fair catch for a free kick. Neil Rackers had the opportunity to try the field goal without any sort of rush. Unfortunately, he hit the ball off the side of his foot. The kick wouldn't have been good from 1 yard out. 2) Giants corner Aaron Ross was whistled for 4 penalties. 3) Larry Fitzgerald caught his 400th career pass in this game, becoming the second-fastest player in NFL history to reach that mark (71 games). The fastest? Anquan Boldin, 67 games.   Boldin 11 times for 87 yards and a touchdown. Larry Fitzgerald had 5 grabs for 71 yards, while Steve Breaston collected 6 receptions for 86 yards.    New York's victory over the Cardinals is pretty remarkable. First of all, Arizona had been undefeated at home going into this contest.

   "comment":"Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, was the star skill-position player for the Ravens. He caught 5 balls for 145 yards and a touchdown, with his only blemish being an offensive pass interference in the third quarter. Flacco's other score went to Dennis Pitta (2-27). As for Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.    Wayne naturally was Luck's top target, snagging 9 balls for 114 yards. TY Hilton also had a decent performance, catching 8 passes for 66 yards, though he dropped a key reception.    The Colts ran on the Ravens successfully, as most teams have this year. Vick Ballard tallied 91 yards on 22 carries.    The officiating was terrible in this contest. There were 4 blown calls in the first quarter alone. Mike Carey's crew whistled the Colts for a terrible pass interference, then incorrectly ruled who recovered the ball on Rice's first fumble. The ensuing drive saw 2 missed face mask penalties. Later on, Carey failed to blow a play dead when Baltimore had 12 men on the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

He returned to the sidelines, but never saw the field again. Later in the first half, safety Patrick Chung was knocked out after Baltimore's first touchdown. Talib and Chung being out made life extremely easy for Flacco, who finished 21-of-36 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was 20-of-30 for 223 yards following that slow start, hitting so many key throws. It seemed like Bill Belichick had a great game plan in place for stopping Flacco, but that was thrown out the window when 2 starters in his secondary went down. The third injury was to Boldin early on, and that's why Joe Flacco began the contest just 1-of-6. Talib grabbed his hamstring after an incompletion and then headed to the locker room.

It seemed like Bill Belichick had a great game plan in place for stopping Flacco, but that was thrown out the window when 2 starters in his secondary went down. The third injury was to Stevan Ridley, who was knocked out with a concussion during a fierce Bernard Pollard hit. Ridley (18 carries, 70 yards) simply collapsed and lost control of the football as a consequence. The Ravens pounced on it and would go on to score a touchdown to put the game out of reach. By the way, how happy will Patriot fans be when Pollard retires? He's already been responsible for tearing the ACLs of Tom Brady and Wes Welker, and he also caused an injury to Rob Gronkowski last year. Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots.    As for the Raven receivers, Boldin scored twice, as he finished with 5 receptions for 60 yards. He humorously stood over "

   "comment":"Anquan Boldin was whistled for offensive pass interference. Donte Whitner dropped an interception. Colin Kaepernick nearly tossed a pick himself. It was pretty ugly, but despite all of this, the Rams just led 3-0. The 49ers were fortunate St. Louis struggled to do anything following a promising first couple of drives; they eventually got into a groove and converted touchdowns, putting this game away. The 49ers were able to do this via the ground attack. After completely neglecting the run against the Colts, they made sure they rammed it down St. Louis' throat. Frank Gore rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, while Kendall Hunter chipped in with 49 yards and a score on 11 attempts. Anthony Dixon (3-6) also found the end zone. San Francisco's offensive line pushed around a Rams' front that has been atrocious this season.    Kaepernick misfired 4 times in each half, going 15-of-23 for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was very sharp in the red zone, allowing his team to score 7. instead of 3.. His flaw, however, is that he sometimes stares down his receivers. He's lucky James Laurinaitis didn't pick off a couple of his passes. Kaepernick's scores went to his main targets: Anquan Boldin (5-90) and Vernon Davis (2-18)."

Kaepernick got extremely lucky in the second quarter after Saints cornerback Corey White picked off him and raced down the sideline. As White tried to extend the ball over the goal line, he lost control and fumbled the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. Frank Gore (13-48) then ripped off a 24-yard run to help set up a 55-yard field goal for Phil Dawson. New Orleans responded with Travaris Cadet taking the kickoff back 82 yards. Fullback Jed Collins powered into the end zone from a yard out and the Saints were up 14-10 at the half. In the third quarter, 49ers' linebacker Ahmad Brooks made a great play to record a leaping interception when Brees tried to float a ball over the linebacker to Jimmy Graham (6-41). Brooks' pick set up San Francisco's offense just outside the 20. The 49ers took the lead with Kaepernick rolling to his right to hit Vernon Davis (4-33) in the middle of the end zone. San Francisco had a drive go inside the Saints 20 with a critical 14-yard reception by Boldin on a third down, but the Saints' defense stepped up to force another 49er field goal.

The 49ers were then whistled for taunting out of bounds when Arizona was flagged for a hold. A second-and-long transformed into a manageable situation, which the Cardinals were able to convert. San Francisco was also flagged for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Larry Fitzgerald, all while dropping several potential Drew Stanton interceptions. Again, these were just some of the blunders the 49ers committed. There were many more that I didn't mention. It's so strange because San Francisco used to be so well-coached. That's not the case this year, as Jim Harbaugh appears to have lost control of his team.    All of the mistakes ruined what was a solid performance from Colin Kaepernick. The 49er signal-caller ran more than he has in a regular-season game in a long while, as he scrambled 13 times for 54 rushing yards. He showed off great athleticism to elude some sacks, including 1 instance in which Thomas Keiser had him by the jersey. Kaepernick was able to shed him to help his team put points on the board during that possession. As a passer, Kaepernick misfired on just 8 occasions, going 29-of-37 for 245 yards and a touchdown. He got away with some mistakes early - Antonio Cromartie dropped 2 potential pick-sixes - and he misfired badly on his final attempt, but he was definitely not at fault for this defeat. Kaepernick's sole score went to Michael Crabtree, who reeled in 10 of his 11 targets for 80 yards. However, Stevie Johnson paced the 49ers in catches (9) and receiving yards (103). Boldin didn't do much (6-36) aside from costing his team points. You'd think a veteran like him would know better. Harbaugh spent some time yelling at Boldin on the sideline, but the message was lost because his team wouldn't stop shooting themselves in the foot.    The 49ers struggled to run the ball. "

In the third quarter, Kansas City got moving with a 26-yard run by Charles and a 15-yard pass to Dwayne Bowe (3-42). Smith then threw a swing pass to De'Anthony Thomas, who bolted into the end zone from 17 yards out to give the Chiefs a 17-13 lead. Kaepernick responded with 27-yard bullet to Boldin, but the drive stalled as Kansas City got sacks from Justin Houston and Alvin Bailey with pressures from Dontari Poe."

   "comment":"Anquan Boldin. Boldin. Michael Crabtree caught a pass that appeared to be a touchdown, but Jerome Boger didn't rule it to be so because he isn't aware of what the NFL rules are. Crabtree clearly had possession over the goal line, but Boger was too incompetent to realize that. Boger then screwed up again; Kaepernick fumbled the snap on an attempted quarterback sneak, which was recovered by James Lauriniaitis in the end zone for the game-sealing touchback. However, replay showed that Kaepernick's elbow was down. Boger once again botched the call. Boger was once again an embarrassment - it seems like he screws up every week - but that doesn't excuse the 49ers for losing. They were a double-digit favorite, and if they were any good, they would've taken care of business. They'll get some defenders back soon, but if they can't block for Kaepernick, it won't matter at all.    Kaepernick went 22-of-33 for 237 yards, a touchdown and 2 lost fumbles. Those numbers aren't bad, but they would've been so much better if he had decent protection. That said, Kaepernick had a couple of close calls on potential interceptions, including 1 in the first quarter when he telegraphed a ball that was dropped by LaMarcus Joyner. Kaepernick's score went to Boldin, who had a big game. He was 1 of the few outstanding San Francisco players on this side of the ball; he reeled in 6 of his 7 targets for 93 yards and the touchdown.

The Redskins got going as Alfred Morris ripped off a 23-yard run, but Chris Borland and Justin Smith dropped Griffin for no gain on a third-down run to force a punt. That refrain repeated itself with a good run by Morris, but the drive ended courtesy of a Ray McDonald sack. Meriweather forced a fumble from Carlos Hyde that let the Redskins took over at their own 40, but they did nothing with the possession. Washington finally got a nice drive going thanks to passes to Andre Roberts and Pierre Garcon (3-34). Morris (21-125) charged hard with 11 yards to the 1.yard line. He then finished the drive with a plunge into the end zone. Just before the half, the 49ers moved the ball with a tremendous 25-yard catch by Michael Crabtree (5-58) to set up a 41-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Kaepernick threw a ball up for grabs in the third quarter that was picked off by Greg Ducre. The Redskins didn't get anything out of that possession, but on the next drive, they moved the ball with an 11-yard run by Morris and a 31-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (2-39). Aaron Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. "

Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but Justin Tucker slipped on the field goal attempt and it hit off the upright no good. San Francisco took advantage again of the Ravens' weak secondary as Kaepernick laid out a pretty 51-yard bomb that Boldin made a superb catch to Baltimore's 25-yard line. A few plays later, Quinton Patton got wide open in the end zone after Shareece Wright fell down, and Kaepernick hit him for a 21-yard score. A missed 2.point attempt had the 49ers' lead at 25-13. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Ravens weren't quite done as they drove down the field. On 4.h-and-goal, Kamar Aiken made a leaping catch for a score. Baltimore got the ball back with a little over a minute remaining, and needing to go 80 yards, but the 49ers' defense came up with a stop led by Eric Reid breaking up a pass in the end zone on the final play of the game.    Kaepernick was 16-of-27 for 340 yards with 2 touchdowns. He threw the ball best when he scrambled out of the pocket. Don't expect similar performances going forward, as Baltimore's secondary has given up big outings to all quarterbacks.    Baltimore's run defense held Carlos Hyde to 55 yards on 21 carries. Hyde appeared to injure his ankle at 1 point, but remained in the game.    Anquan Boldin had 5 receptions for 102 yards. Torrey Smith (3-96) and Quinton Patton (2-38) caught Kaepernick's touchdowns. Most of Smith's production came on his score.    Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal.

   "comment":"Anquan Boldin for a gain of 29 yards while taking a bit hit on a third-and-18. This improbable conversion set up the tying field goal after Minnesota linebacker Boldin for a gain of 29 yards while taking a bit hit on a third-and-18. This improbable conversion set up the tying field goal after Minnesota linebacker Eric Kendricks was able to temporary stop the bleeding with a terrific tackle on third down. The Kendricks stop seemed to be absolutely huge, especially after the Vikings moved the chains on the ensuing drive, but Cordarrelle Patterson negated that conversion by lining up incorrectly. The play immediately following the penalty was Bradford's pick, snatched by Darius Slay. Stafford was also on fire in the early going, starting 8-of-8 for 69 yards. His initial incompletion was a Golden Tate drop. Stafford's receivers betrayed him throughout the afternoon. Andre Roberts dropped a deep touchdown after a Minnesota corner fell down. Marvin Jones also had a considerable gain wiped out when the ball slipped through his hands. Stafford finished 23-of-40 for 232 yards and a touchdown (as well as 30 rushing yards), but as you can see, his numbers should've been a lot better. The Vikings were able to stymie Stafford in the third quarter with some great pressure, but the Detroit signal-caller eventually came through in the clutch, as he's been wont to do this year.    Stafford's sole aerial score went to Boldin, who caught 7 passes for 69 yards. He trailed only Tate in that category, as Tate snatched 5 balls for 77 yards. Jones saw the most targets (11), but had a disappointing result - 4 catches, 54 yards - thanks to "
