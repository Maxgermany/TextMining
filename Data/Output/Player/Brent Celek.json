I also have to criticize Andy Reid for game mismanagement in the 4.h quarter. Down 18, Reid had a 4th-and-goal at the 4-yard line. Reid opted to kick a field goal to bring the deficit to within 15, which I don't have a big problem with. However, on the next drive, the Eagles had a 4th-and-goal at the 18. Reid called for another field goal despite the fact that there was 4:52 remaining in regulation. Now, converting a 4th-and-goal from the 18 is pretty improbable, but what the hell was the point of that field goal? Whether the deficit is 15 or 12, the Eagles still needed 2 touchdowns. There simply wasn't enough time for a meaningless kick like that.    At any rate, QB Dog Killer's touchdowns went to Celek (3-50) and Jeremy Maclin (4-47)."

Much of the same was expected from Philadelphia's stop unit, but the Eagles were inexplicably dominant on the defensive side of the ball. They put a massive amount of pressure on Robert Griffin, who often didn't have any time to throw whatsoever. This was particularly prevalent on a trip to the red zone when Griffin was hit as he was about to release the ball. He lost a fumble as a result, negating Washington's best scoring chance of the day until a late touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Griffin struggled to get anything going for most of the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - a high number considering that he scrambled out of some tackles - and as a result, he was just 7-of-15 for 57 yards and an interception on a tipped screen that was overturned before Philadelphia's defense eased up a bit. Griffin finished 17-of-35 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick along with 44 rushing yards on 10 scampers, but don't be fooled; the Eagles smothered him, prompting many poor throws, including 1 where he missed an open "

   "comment":"Celek to operate as the long snapper for a field goal. Celek had a poor snap on what was a missed field goal, and then was injured on a punt. After that, another tight end, Trey Burton, played the position. He executed on the 1 field goal he snapped for. It was a pretty interesting storyline from what was an exciting NFC East battle.    Final Note: The Redskins may have lost 2 of their top middle linebackers this week. "
