   "comment":"Joique Bell (9-49), who outgained him and also scored. In fact, the only reason Bush saw action in the second half was because Bell suffered an injury.    This is obviously a disappointing result for the Lions. Good teams are supposed to beat lesser opponents on the road, but Detroit came up short. The players disappointed, as did Jim Schwartz, who made a stupid decision to fake a field goal deep in Pittsburgh territory. The Steelers snuffed out the play, giving them momentum when they were down in the second half. Schwartz then spent some time lashing out at the media afterward, as he was rightfully criticized for not opting to go up a touchdown when he had a 4.point lead.   "

   "comment":"Joique Bell cough-up in the red zone. The dome-based Lions had major issues early on, as 1 might expect. In fact, their troubles started before kickoff when Reggie Bush slipped on the turf and aggravated his calf injury. They then had 5 fumbles in the first 16 minutes of the game, losing 2 of them. Once they started moving the ball, they opted to eschew a field-goal attempt on the 12-yard line. They even went for 2 after each touchdown. They tried just 1 kick in this contest, an extra-point try, and it was blocked and returned for what should have been 2 points if the NFL adopted the fun college rule. The Eagles also had issues in the heavy snow early on. Nick Foles fired his first interception of the season on an overthrow. LeSean McCoy, meanwhile, was guilty of running backward and taking huge losses on several occasions. They also had trouble moving around on special teams, surrendering 2 touchdowns to Jeremy Ross. However, being the cold-weather team, they were able to adjust. McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well. Nick Foles, meanwhile, was so much more effective after halftime. He was just 4-of-10 for 35 yards and the pick prior to intermission, but he went 7-of-12 for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) afterward. Foles, whose final numbers were 11-of-22 for 179 yards, fired his 1 aerial score to DeSean Jackson (4-59), while Riley Cooper (3-74) paced the team in receiving.    While the Eagles made great adjustments to the weather, the Lions were shell shocked throughout. The receivers continued to drop passes, while Stafford kept struggling with botched snaps. Stafford had an awful statistical outing, finishing 10-of-25 for 148 yards. He completed passes to just 4 players, 2 of whom were receivers. Calvin Johnson (3-49) disappointed his fantasy owners.    Joique Bell, taking the injured Bush's place in the lineup, led the Lions in both rushing and receiving. He gained 69 rushing yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and also caught 4 balls for 58 yards. However, Bell also hurt his team, losing a pair of fumbles.   "
