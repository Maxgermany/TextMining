   "comment":"Bell, replacing the inept Stefan Logan on kickoffs, lost a fumble on a return. - Matthew Stafford, who got away with a lost fumble on what turned out to be a tuck-rule situation, was eventually strip-sacked by Israel Idonije. - Stafford lobbed a weird, side-armed overthrow that was intercepted. - Stafford then lost another fumble to give the Bears the ball inside the red zone. Chicago kicked an easy field goal.    Jay Cutler didn't have a terrific game, by any means, as his team was just 4-of-15 on third-down attempts. However, he took advantage of Detroit's stupidity and took care of the football. He went 18-of-31 for 257 yards and a touchdown.    For once, Cutler's leading receiver was not Brandon Marshall (5-42). In fact, Marshall was behind both Earl Bennett (5-109, TD) and Alshon Jeffery (4-76) thanks to numerous drops.    Matt Forte served as a great complement to Cutler, gaining 103 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries despite being questionable entering the contest. He outgained Mikel Leshoure (15-57), who received all but 2 of Detroit's carries. Bell was given just 4 touches, perhaps as punishment for his aforementioned fumble.    Stafford finished 24-of-42 for 272 yards, 3 scores and an interception. The numbers look good, but the 3 turnovers ruined Detroit's chances of pulling the upset. That's been the story of the Lions' disappointing 2012 campaign.    "

   "comment":"Bell had defenders bouncing off of him left and right, while Washington had absolutely no answer for Nate Burleson. It's a sad state of affairs, as the Redskins might just have the worst stop unit in the NFL (though the Eagles and Jaguars may have something to say about that.)    Matthew Stafford went 25-of-42 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that was returned for 6 by DeAngelo Hall. The pick was the byproduct of a miscommunication between Stafford and Calvin Johnson in the first half. Stafford and Megatron were able to hook up often after that. Johnson caught 7 balls for 115 yards and a touchdown, though he missed out on another score because Stafford overthrew him. Megatron didn't even lead his team in receiving. Burleson held that distinction, hauling in 6 passes for 116 yards.    Stafford's other score went to undrafted rookie tight end Joseph Fauria. The UCLA product caught just 1 pass (for 5 yards), but he was targeted in the end zone on another occasion. The important thing here is that Brandon Pettigrew has been phased out of the offense. Stafford threw to him twice on the opening drive, but that was it.    As mentioned, defenders were bouncing off Bell as if he were Jim Brown. He generated 63 rushing yards (20 carries), 69 receiving yards (4 catches) and a touchdown.    Bell's counterpart also scored. "

However, he was a greater factor in the aerial attack, catching 4 passes for 52 receiving yards, though he had 1 of those aforementioned red-zone drops early in the game.    Bush also struggled to get anything on the ground. He managed only 31 yards on 12 carries to go along with 2 catches for 23 receiving yards and the aforementioned fumble. He nearly had a second lost fumble, but the officials made a bad call. He nearly lost a second fumble, and as a consequence, was benched in favor of Joique Bell (9-49), who outgained him and also scored. In fact, the only reason Bush saw action in the second half was because Bell suffered an injury.    This is obviously a disappointing result for the Lions. Good teams are supposed to beat lesser opponents on the road, but Detroit came up short. The players disappointed, as did Jim Schwartz, who made a stupid decision to fake a field goal deep in Pittsburgh territory. The Steelers snuffed out the play, giving them momentum when they were down in the second half. Schwartz then spent some time lashing out at the media afterward, as he was rightfully criticized for not opting to go up a touchdown when he had a 4-point lead.   "

   "comment":"Bell cough-up in the red zone. The dome-based Lions had major issues early on, as 1 might expect. In fact, their troubles started before kickoff when Reggie Bush slipped on the turf and aggravated his calf injury. They then had 5 fumbles in the first 16 minutes of the game, losing 2 of them. Once they started moving the ball, they opted to eschew a field-goal attempt on the 12-yard line. They even went for 2 after each touchdown. They tried just 1 kick in this contest, an extra-point try, and it was blocked and returned for what should have been 2 points if the NFL adopted the fun college rule. The Eagles also had issues in the heavy snow early on. Nick Foles fired his first interception of the season on an overthrow. LeSean McCoy, meanwhile, was guilty of running backward and taking huge losses on several occasions. They also had trouble moving around on special teams, surrendering 2 touchdowns to Jeremy Ross. However, being the cold-weather team, they were able to adjust. McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well. Nick Foles, meanwhile, was so much more effective after halftime. He was just 4-of-10 for 35 yards and the pick prior to intermission, but he went 7-of-12 for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) afterward. Foles, whose final numbers were 11-of-22 for 179 yards, fired his 1 aerial score to DeSean Jackson (4-59), while Riley Cooper (3-74) paced the team in receiving.    While the Eagles made great adjustments to the weather, the Lions were shell shocked throughout. The receivers continued to drop passes, while Stafford kept struggling with botched snaps. Stafford had an awful statistical outing, finishing 10-of-25 for 148 yards. He completed passes to just 4 players, 2 of whom were receivers. Calvin Johnson (3-49) disappointed his fantasy owners.    Joique Bell, taking the injured Bush's place in the lineup, led the Lions in both rushing and receiving. He gained 69 rushing yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and also caught 4 balls for 58 yards. However, Bell also hurt his team, losing a pair of fumbles.   "

Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1, powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1, powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

   "comment":"Bell and Reggie Bush. The Lions, however, struggled after that despite having the luxury of Rolando McClain out of the game with an obscure injury. Stafford was nearly intercepted in the red zone at the end of the first half when he carelessly flung the ball into double coverage. He was then picked right after the break because of a tipped pass by Jeremy Mincey. Stafford topped that off with 2 fumbles on the final drive of the game. He was fortunate to get the first back because the Dallas defender also coughed up the ball, but he didn't have the same luck the second time.    Stafford finished 28-of-42 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown, the interception and 2 lost fumbles. As mentioned, he was hot early on, but was just 11-of-18 for 132 yards and 3 turnovers following halftime. Much like Romo has done in the past, Stafford choked down the stretch.    Stafford's sole score was the 51-yarder to Tate, who led the team with 89 receiving yards on 6 catches. Calvin Johnson (5-85) fell just short of the team lead.    The Lions ran the ball well early on, but Bell mustered only 10 yards after halftime. Bell finished with 43 yards on just 12 carries. Bush (8-37) scored once. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "
