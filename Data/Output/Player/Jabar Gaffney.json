   "comment":"Jabar Gaffney dropped an easy 20-yard catch on third down. And later on, Cassel overthrew a wide-open Randy Moss, who was streaking toward the end zone.    Despite that overthrow, Cassel had an incredible game. By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and 3 touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting 8 times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, Wes Welker (108 yards) and Jabar Gaffney (86 yards and a touchdown) each caught 7 balls. Randy Moss had just 3 receptions for 26 yards, but caught an amazing, game-tying touchdown with 1 second remaining, where he somehow tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of the field of play.

As you would imagine, Cassel's numbers were prolific - 20-of-36, 345 yards and 3 touchdowns - though most of that was off of short throws. Arizona just showed no interest in tackling.
