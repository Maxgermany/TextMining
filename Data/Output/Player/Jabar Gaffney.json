Despite that overthrow, Cassel had an incredible game. By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and 3 touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting 8 times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, Wes Welker (108 yards) and Jabar Gaffney (86 yards and a touchdown) each caught 7 balls. Randy Moss had just 3 receptions for 26 yards, but caught an amazing, game-tying touchdown with 1 second remaining, where he somehow tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of the field of play.

   "comment":"Gaffney (4-40) catching 2 passes to convert third downs. However, on the second 1. Trent Williams was nailed for a totally unnecessary smack in the back of Justin Smith for a 15-yard personal foul to force a punt following a pass to Helu. Now that I mention it, passing to him was a large part of the offense. He set a team mark with 14 receptions, putting Art Monk out of the record book in the process, for 105 yards. Following another exchange of punts, San Francisco took over at its own 45. Alex Smith scrambled for 8 yards on first down and Gore (19-107) had his longest run of the game chugging down field for a gain of 27. Two runs by Kendall Hunter set up the 2.minute warning for a third-and-one. Smith threw incomplete under a bit of pressure, missing a wide-open Gore in the flat. Harbaugh decided to go for it, putting Smith in the Pistol formation. However, backup tight end Justin Peelle moved prior to the snap to set up another field goal for a 6-0 lead. For some reason, Mike Shanahan was determined to get points prior to the half, even after a false start set them back to open the drive. Two plays later, a Helu reception ended in a fumble forced by Patrick Willis and recovered by Donte Whitner. Like a bolt of lightning, the 49ers immediately called a play and executed it, hitting fullback Bruce Miller down the sideline for a 30-yard touchdown for a 13-0 lead. The Redskins did scratch their way down the field in the final minute and get into field goal range. Graham Gano set a team record with a 59-yard effort to make it 13-3 at the break. In the second half, Washington really never had a chance to get back in the game. After an exchange of punts, San Francisco finally converted its first third down (having failed on their first 6) and made it to the 21-yard line before Brian Orakpo delivered a sack to force another field goal by Akers and a 16-3 lead. Trying to answer, the Redskins battled their way into scoring range, but had to go for it on 4.h down. Navorro Bowman came up with the play to end the threat and things looked grim as the game entered the final quarter. With the defense wearing down ,it was easy to mix in some passing plays. Vernon Davis picked up 22 yards and Braylon Edwards broke tackles turning a short gain into a big play for 24 more. The drive ended with another field goal for a 19-3 lead. Bowman, who of course had a great game, recovered a fumble but the 49ers gave it right back when Vernon Davis coughed it up. However, the subsequent drive ended on downs. After forcing a punt, they finally faced a soft prevent defense. It was too little, too late even though Gaffney caught a touchdown and rookie starting wide receiver Leonard Hankerson added the conversion to make it a 19-11 game with 1:05 to play."

   "comment":"Gaffney. Down 14-10, the Redskins pulled off a gadget play. On a reverse to wide receiver Brandon Banks, Santana Moss broke open running downfield. Banks launched a ball up and it fell into Moss for a 49-yard touchdown. New England then got 2 field goals, but Washington followed that by kicking 1 to make it 20-20 at halftime. In the third quarter, Brady and Gronkowski hooked up for a beautiful touchdown. After a big pressure, Brady lofted the ball over Gronkowski's shoulder. He caught the ball just past the line of scrimmage and shed a tackle from Ryan Kerrigan to break down the field for a 37-yard touchdown. The Redskins tied it up with a quality drive by Grossman and Helu. It ended in a 6.yard touchdown pass to David Anderson. The Patriots got the game-winning score on a 24-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wes Welker. In the 4.h quarter, each defense gave up more yards but caused timely turnovers to keep the offenses from scoring points. A touchdown pass from Grossman to Moss was called back on a push-off penalty by Moss. The veteran coughed up a pass that was intercepted by Jerod Mayo to seal the Patriots' win. Brady finished the game 22-of-37 for 357 yards and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. The interception by Josh Wilson came in the end zone and led to a huge shouting match on the sideline between Brady and coach Bill O'Brien. Welker (7-86) and Gronkowski (6-160) were too much for Washington's secondary to contain. Grossman was 19-of-32 for 252 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Helu (27-126), Stallworth (4-96), Moss (3-81) and Gaffney (6-92) all had good games against the New England defense. The Redskins' offensive line did well in run blocking, but their pass blocking needs to improve. Carter had another good game for New England. The Patriots' defense has to up their game down the stretch, or the team could make a quick postseason exit. The secondary stinks. When New England faces better teams in the playoffs, they could get killed through the air. If the Redskins' offense can roll up yards (463) and points, then the Patriots have to worry about taking on a balanced team like the Steelers, or if they somehow make it to the Super Bowl, a team like the Packers or the Saints.
