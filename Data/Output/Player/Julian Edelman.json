   "comment":"Julian Edelman touchdown later, and New England was suddenly up 35-0. The frustrated crowd continuously chanted Te-bow for the rest of the evening, but Rex Ryan didn't listen to his fans' wishes. He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field. I think Ryan is full of crap. </i>    Tom Brady, meanwhile, went 18-of-28 for 323 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). He missed a couple of deep throws in the third quarter that had him frustrated, but was otherwise flawless. He was totally dialed in, as he was on a mission to prove that his offense could score without Rob Gronkowski.    Outside of "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman deep for what would've been an early 56-yard touchdown. Manning audibled to an early draw on third-and-long, and his running back converted. Brady tried a screen early on a third-and-long that went nowhere. Manning bobbled a shotgun snap and still managed to convert a first down in the opening quarter. Brady took the only sack of the first half in field goal range. Manning's receivers got away with blatant offensive pass interferences. Brady's target was called for interference (referred to as a pillow fight by Phil Simms), negating a field goal. Manning got to play without Aqib Talib covering his receivers. Brady had to deal with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie after the corner got hurt. Manning converted second-and-20 deep in his own territory. Brady was sacked on third-and-10 deep in Denver territory. Manning got points in the 2-minute drill with an impressive drive at the end of the first half. Brady couldn't hit an open Austin Collie down the sideline for a big gain just before halftime. Manning was 18-of-25 for 214 yards and a touchdown in the first half. Brady was just 9-of-15 for 144 yards in the first half. Manning helped the Broncos accumulate 270 net yards in the opening half. Brady restricted the Patriots to 119 net yards in the opening half. Manning achieved 6 first downs in the opening touchdown drive of the third quarter. Brady managed just 6 first downs in the entire opening half. Manning had a stretch in which he converted 19 of 20 passes. Brady didn't get the Patriots inside the Denver 18-yard line until there were 10 minutes remaining in the game. Manning went 32-of-43 for 400 yards (third-most in AFC Championship history) and 2 touchdowns. Brady finished 24-of-38 for 277 yards and only 1 touchdown. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    Two things absolutely killed the Patriots' chances of winning this game, and I alluded to both already. The first was Brady's inaccuracy. He overthrew several of his targets. Had he hit them, New England may have been victorious. He was sharp in the 4.h quarter, but only because he had the luxury of battling a prevent defense. The second was Talib's injury. Talib got hurt in last year's AFC Championship, which completely ruined Bill Belichick's defensive game plan. The same thing happened in this contest. The Patriots actually played Denver's offense pretty well until Talib went down. After that, New England couldn't get the Broncos off the field, as Manning continuously hit Demaryius Thomas, who led all receivers with 134 yards and a touchdown on 7 catches. Julius Thomas (8-85) also had a big game, though he dropped a touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Eric Decker (5-73) and Wes Welker (4-38) came up with some clutch receptions as well.    The Broncos sustained some injuries as well, but most of the players who were banged up eventually came back onto the field. This, however, does not apply to Knowshon Moreno and cornerback Tony Carter, both of whom got hurt in the 4.h quarter. Carter left with a concussion, while Moreno injured his chest. Moreno did run well, gaining 59 yards on 14 carries. Montee Ball (12-43) also pounded the ball effectively.    While Denver maintained a strong rushing attack, the Patriots couldn't do anything on the ground. "

As a result, New England won the time of possession by more than 15 minutes.    The Colts need to bolster their pass rush, which is what I have happening in my . They got no heat on Brady at all, registering just 1 sack. Brady, as a result, finished 23-of-35 for 226 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, which was his only poor decision of the evening because he forced a ball to "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for LeGarrette Blount fantasy owners like myself was turned into a huge disappointment as he totaled minus-3 yards on 3 carries.    Gronkowski led New England through the air with 11 receptions for 108 yards and a score. He really hurt the Jets' defense. It was Gronkowski's 18th career 100-yard game. Danny Amendola (8-86-1) and Julian Edelman (5-54) chipped in some critical receptions. "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman, sucked big time. This includes his offensive line, which couldn't block whatsoever. Brady was constantly under siege, as the 4 sacks he took weren't nearly indicative of the amount of pressure he faced. Brady had to throw numerous passes away, and it's astonishing that he wasn't flagged for intentional grounding on a couple of occasions. Von Miller terrorized him, logging 2.5 sacks and an interception. Meanwhile, Manning opened the game by throwing the ball into the dirt, which made me question what the hell I was betting on. However, Manning rebounded with some solid throws on a pair of third downs, and the opening drive culminated with a touchdown to Owen Daniels. Manning continued to play well throughout, abusing a secondary that hadn't been tested much all year because of a ridiculously easy schedule. Manning, for the first time all season, didn't throw an interception in a game that he started, though he did technically commit a turnover on a pass in which he threw backward. Bill Belichick successfully challenged, and it turned into New England's sole touchdown of the afternoon until the very end. The Broncos controlled the game throughout, never trailing, but there was some concern as the game progressed. Denver lost numerous key defenders to injury, including T.J. Ward, who was Denver's best solution against Rob Gronkowski. Derek Wolfe and Brandon Marshall also got banged up, but were able to return to the field. With Ward gone, Brady hit Gronkowski on a pair of miracle 4.h-down throws on the final drive. The first was a big gain on a 4.h-and-10 to reach the red zone, and then the second was a touchdown to bring the margin to 20-18. However, because of Stephen Gostkowski's missed extra point earlier in the afternoon, New England had to go for 2. The attempt failed, and Denver was able to hang on to a victory. Let's take a moment to congratulate Roger Goodell for installing a new rule that allowed a conference championship to be decided by an extra point. I doubt Goodell is upset though, as he finally got his revenge on the Patriots for failing to penalize them for Deflategate. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The stats say that Brady outplayed Manning, but that was hardly the case. Brady went 27-of-56 for 310 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, while Manning finished 17-of-32 for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brady's 310 yards were a byproduct of garbage time; by halftime, he was just 9-of-20 for 87 yards and the 2 picks. The first interception was telegraphed, and it could've been returned for 6 had Miller not slipped. The second was the result of a Malik Jackson hit. Brady was nearly picked on a couple of other occassions, all of which was the result of Denver's incredible pressure. Manning, meanwhile, barely completed half of his passes, but he didn't really turn the ball over. He was better than Brady, but didn't play great. He missed some throws he could've made in his sleep 5 years ago, overthrowing a couple of his targets in the end zone for easy touchdowns. However, Manning did some nifty things, including a scramble for a first down when he somehow picked up 12 yards on a third-and-10 early in the second half.    Manning's touchdowns both went to Daniels, whose only catches were in the end zone. Daniels was just 1 of 2 Broncos to accumulate more than 20 receiving yards, with the other being Emmanuel Sanders (5-62), who made a ridiculous 34-yard reception over Malcolm Butler that brought Ward off the bench in celebration. Demaryius Thomas, meanwhile, made just 2 catches for 12 yards. He dropped a pass, of course.    It continues to be a mystery why the Broncos continue to waste downs giving Ronnie Hillman the ball. Hillman (11-16) was outgained by C.J. Anderson (16-72) by a wide margin once again. Hillman also lazily didn't try to pick up the ball on Manning's apparent backward pass.    As bad as Hillman was, I'm sure Belichick would've killed to have him on his roster, given how incompetent his running backs were. It was so bad that Brady was the Patriots' leading rusher with 13 yards on 3 scrambles. James White (5-11) caught 5 passes for 45 receiving yards, but was very inefficient, being targeted 16 times. Steven Jackson scored, but gained just 8 yards on 4 carries.    As for Brady's aerial targets, Gronkowski predictably led the way with 8 catches for 144 yards and a touchdown. However, most of his production came after Ward left the game, as he caught just 2 balls in the opening half. Julian Edelman (7-53) was next on the receiving list.    One final note: I think Belichick screwed up big time in the 4.h quarter. He eschewed 2 field goals, opting to go for it on a pair of 4.h downs. His offense failed on both occasions. Had he kicked the ball, the score would've been 20-18 when Gronkowski caught his initial 4.h-down pass on the final drive. A short field goal would have won the game, 21-20. The Patriots had 6 minutes and 3 timeouts remaining when Belichick eschewed his first kick, so there was still plenty of time. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Edelman had the drop, but did a lot of good things that didn't show up in the stat box. He happened to draw a pass interference flag and opened some opportunities with some key blocks, including 1 on a 41-yard touchdown run. What was disappointing, however, is that Edelman didn't play quarterback at all. There was talk that Edelman, as a former signal-caller at Kent State, would see some snaps under center in trick plays, but that never transpired. He did happen to rush for 14 yards, however.    Only 3 Patriots caught multiple passes. Besides Edelman, there was "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman. He then connected with Rob Gronkowski for a 19-yard gain, as Gronkowski looked healthy for the first time all year. Following a 13-yard LeGarrette Blount run, Gronkowski snared a 34-yard reception and rumbled down to the Cleveland 2-yard line, breaking 5 tackles in the process. Two plays later, Blount skipped into the end zone, and just like that, the game was over. If a football fan were asleep for 4 weeks and woke up without any idea as to what was going on, they would've never suspected that Brady missed any practice time whatsoever. Brady was incredibly sharp, and having Gronkowski at 100 percent didn't hurt. With these 2 in full gear, the Patriots look like the best team in the AFC. OK, maybe it's a bit presumptive to read that much into a victory against the Browns, but Brady was incredibly sharp. He went 28-of-40 for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns. Had the Browns been able to keep up on the scoreboard, Brady may have had a shot at 500-plus yards; he was up to 271 yards at halftime, putting him on track for 542 on the afternoon (thank you, Windows calculator). He threw numerous beautiful passes, including a perfect 43-yarder down the field to Chris Hogan to move into the red zone on 1 occasion. On an ensuing drive, Brady hit Hogan for 63 yards in stride, as the new Patriot receiver beat Joe Haden.    All 3 of Brady's touchdowns went to Martellus Bennett, which is remarkable considering that Bennett left the game early on with an injury. He returned and didn't looked like he was hobbled at all, catching 6 passes for 67 yards. He did this despite Gronkowski being healthy, but Gronkowski still produced; he caught 5 balls for 109 yards.    Brady's other big stat-producers were Hogan (4-114) and James White (4-63). Hogan left temporarily to be checked for a concussion, but he returned to action shortly afterward. Julian Edelman, meanwhile, snatched 5 balls for only 35 yards.    LeGarrette Blount helped his fantasy owners with a touchdown, but didn't do much otherwise, mustering only 37 yards on 18 attempts. He had 3 other chances to score, but Cleveland did a good job of stuffing him near the goal line.    As for the Browns, they never really had a chance, but they might have covered had "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman was, by far, the lead target for Brady this week, as he saw 10 and caught 9 for 60 yards, but he did drop yet another pass and has yet to have that breakout game we expect from him. The good news is that Edelman is still a big part of this offense and should come around for all you fantasy footballers.    Landry Jones was outmatched in this game, but not many quarterbacks would have been a match for Brady. The good news for the Steelers is that Jones probably would have beaten a lesser team, and there's a chance they will need him to come up big this season if they want to make some noise this postseason. The Patriots, on the other hand, are getting healthier by the day it seems, and at 6-1 after missing Brady for the first 4 games, they couldn't be in a better position.   "

   "comment":"Julian Edelman wide open on 1 side of the field. No defender was within 10 yards of either of them. Edelman would have had the touchdown had it not been for the penalty. Later, the Bills made the mistake of somehow putting Nickell Robey-Coleman on Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long. Of all the corners on the field on Sunday, the worst may have been Stephon Gilmore. He was terrible in this game. Something must be wrong with him. Gilmore was torched repeatedly by the Patriots, and he allowed a 53-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    "
