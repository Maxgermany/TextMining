I know his receivers suck, but Kerry Collins was able to manage more than half the passing yardage Young had in 20 less throws. I'm being facetious here, as most of Collins' yardage came after the catch, but the fact remains that Young was once again struggling.    The 1 bright spot for the Jaguars was "

You can point to the ground attack and the defense (the latter in years past obviously), but Young is now 1-0 with this team. Kerry Collins is 0-6. There is something to that, though the Young doubters will never admit this. Young was 15-of-18 for 125 yards and a touchdown. He seldom threw deep, but did a great job moving the chains. Young also had 30 rushing yards on 12 carries, as he made some very athletic plays to get first downs. It's no coincidence that the Titans were 8-of-15 on third downs. It was refreshing to watch Young after getting to see Collins stumble around for 6 weeks.    Young's ability to scramble really opened up huge running lanes for "

You can point to the ground attack and the defense (the latter in years past obviously), but Young is now 1-0 with this team. Kerry Collins is 0-6.

   "comment":"Young interception (late along the sidelines) led to a Colts touchdown. And third, the Titans screwed up twice in the red zone. They had a 1st-and-goal on Indianapolis' 1-yard line and a 1st-and-10 on Indianapolis' 19, and managed a grand total of ZERO points on those 2 sequences. They went for it on 4.h down both times and failed. Had Jeff Fisher opted for field goals, his team would have been down only 4 points with possession and 1:21 on the clock. Fisher and Raheem Morris should create a Facebook group called the I Senselessly Go for It Instead of Kicking Obvious Field Goals Club.    But the big story is that the Colts are now 12-0. Four of the past 5 teams to start 12-0 have gone to the Super Bowl. This victory is also Indianapolis' 21st consecutive win in the regular season, matching the 2006-08 New England Patriots' record. Congratulations to Peyton Manning for kicking a**.    Manning went 24-of-37 for 270 yards and a touchdown. While Reggie Wayne (4 catches, 48 yards) and Dallas Clark (3-25) didn't do much, Pierre Garcon dominated the contest with 6 grabs for 136 yards. Austin Collie (4-18) had Manning's touchdown.    Joseph Addai annoyed Manning owners with multiple scores. Addai had 79 yards and 2 touchdowns on 21 attempts.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, topped the 100-yard rushing barrier for the 7.h consecutive contest. Johnson had 113 yards on 27 carries. He's now on pace to rush for 2,012 yards on the year.    Young, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre for a change. He threw for 241 yards and 2 touchdowns, but as mentioned, he had that horrible interception. He was also wildly inaccurate (24-of-43) and rushed for only 16 yards.    Young's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Young lobbed a pick to give the Redskins a red zone opportunity, but Grossman returned the favor by heaving an interception toward Fred Davis. Much-maligned safety Kurt Coleman easily picked it off. The 4.h pick, which ultimately led to Grossman's benching, was a pass thrown late across his body, which was also intercepted by Coleman. Grossman finished 9-of-22 for 143 yards and the quartet of picks. Beck was much better in relief, going 8-of-15 for 117 yards and a rushing touchdown. The BYU alumnus definitely needs to start next week. Grossman has gotten worse every single week this year.    It was really surprising that the Redskins weren't able to run the ball against the Eagles. Ryan Torain rushed 10 times for just 22 yards. Tim Hightower didn't play because of a shoulder injury.    As mentioned earlier, QBDK (18-31, 237 yards, TD, INT; 7 carries, 54 rush yards) had many things go his way. One thing that didn't was a head injury in the third quarter. He had to leave the game, and Vince Young was in on 2 plays. QBDK came back on the next drive, however.    "

   "comment":"Young beat the Giants. Andy Reid always wins when the chips are down, especially when he has to start a backup quarterback and utilize guys like Chad Hall and Riley Cooper.)    In this NFC East grudge match both defenses started well. Giants rookie cornerback Prince Amukamara was playing in his first ever game regular season, and he got off to a fortunate start by intercepting a deep pass intended for DeSean Jackson. Amukamara got lucky because he was beat by Jackson running downfield, but Vince Young threw a horribly underthrown ball that let Amukamara recover to get the interception. "

   "comment":"Young versus Tom Brady? No chance. Brady put on a clinic. He went 24-of-34 for 361 yards and 3 touchdowns, as he was seldom pressured. He converted 6-of-11 third downs, and he led his team to points on 7 of his first 9 possessions, if you count 1 drive where Stephen Gostkowski missed a chip-shot field goal.    Brady notched 24 completions, but only 4 Patriots had a reception. As you may guess, they were Wes Welker (8-115, 2 TDs), Deion Branch (6-125), Aaron Hernandez (6-62) and Rob Gronkowski (4-59, TD).    Both New England rookie running backs saw action in this contest, but neither did anything meaningful. Shane Vereen (7-18) and Stevan Ridley (4-4) struggled, while BenJarvus Green-Ellis (14-44, 2 TDs) once again led the Patriots in attempts.    As for Young, he actually threw for 400 yards on 26-of-48 passing with 1 touchdown and an interception, but most of that came in garbage time. Still, Young did an OK job considering how many drops his receivers were guilty of.    Speaking of which, Jackson had 4 receptions for 73 yards. Even better were "
