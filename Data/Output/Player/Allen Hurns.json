   "comment":"Allen Hurns. However, Henne struggled to do anything in the second half, as his mediocrity was greatly exposed. It's no guarantee that Bortles would have enjoyed better results, but it's likely that he would have. Bortles is the superior talent by a wide margin, and he probably would have actually been able to complete routine passes, whereas Henne had issues doing so. Henne was 12-of-17 for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half, but was just 12-of-26 for 99 yards following intermission. Credit the Eagles for making the proper adjustments, but this was more about Henne's ineptitude more than anything. He had players open, but simply missed them. He naturally capped it off with a strip-sack returned for a touchdown that allowed the Eagles to cover the spread. That was absolutely brutal because it seemed as though Jacksonville would cover the entire afternoon. The Jaguars maintained a 17-0 lead as 10.5-point underdogs for most of this contest, so they were the right side.    At any rate, there were a couple of reasons why the Jaguars controlled this game for most of regulation, but the primary factor was Nick Foles' poor play. Foles was anemic early on, going just 12-of-24 for 139 yards and an interception in the opening half. He missed open receivers at an alarming rate. He overthrew his tight ends down the seam on numerous occasions. He sailed a pass miles over Jeremy Maclin's head. He also had an open Maclin downfield, but he didn't see him and consequently got sacked. Philadelphia's offensive line had major issues with Jacksonville's pass rush; Jason Peters even surrendered 2 sacks in the opening half, while All-Pro guard Evan Mathis exited with a knee injury. Foles played better as the game went on, however, finishing 27-of-45 for 322 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. His scores went to Maclin (4-97) and Ertz (3-77). Maclin led the team in targets with 10. Riley Cooper, meanwhile, barely did anything, hauling in 4 balls for 29 yards.    LeSean McCoy had a nice outing - 21 carries, 74 rush yards, 6 catches, 41 rec. yards - but he wasn't the Philadelphia running back who found the end zone. That was Darren Sproles, who gained 71 yards on 11 carries. His touchdown scamper was a 49-yarder, which was actually the longest touchdown carry of his career.    Getting back to the Jaguars, undrafted rookie Allen Hurns made some noise early. He caught 4 balls for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half, but had zero receptions afterward. I briefly had Hurns on my list, but took him off when Cecil Shorts seemed to return to health. Hurns will get all of the attention, but I'd rather have "

   "comment":"Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as Lamar Miller was held to 14 yards on 10 carries. Miami's rushing attack was putrid, though it should be noted that Miller was hindered by an ankle injury. Miller is expected to bounce back, so you can buy him low from a disappointed fantasy owner.    Rishard Matthews led the Dolphins' receivers with 6 catches for 115 yards. A fluky performance? Perhaps, but with Jordan Cameron getting hurt, Greg Jennings doing nothing and DeVante Parker being too raw, Ryan Tannehill will have to throw to someone else besides Jarvis Landry.    Jarvis Landry had 8 receptions for 110 yards. It's almost a lock at this point that he'll catch 5 passes each week. He's 1 of the most consistent fantasy receivers.    Jordan Cameron hauled in 3 for 62. He sustained a groin injury and didn't return. Cameron is talented, but it's not a good idea to rely on him, given his injury history.    Blake Bortles completed 18-of-33 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played better than the numbers illustrate, as his offensive line allowed a lot of pressure in the pocket. He's not much of a fantasy option, however.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 70 yards on 25 carries to lead Jacksonville. The Dolphins have a stout front, so those numbers are more impressive than they might appear at first glance.    Allen Robinson was the offensive star for the Jaguars with 6 receptions for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. Robinson struggled in the opener, but he bounced back and played to his talent level. He can be started each week. Allen Hurns (4-68) and Marqise Lee (2-27) contributed as well."

   "comment":"Allen Hurns for 26 yards. Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting T.Y. Hilton involved. The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking. Donte Moncrief (6-75) also contributed and continued to play ahead of Andre Johnson.    Frank Gore ran for 53 yards on 17 carries. He caught 5 passes for 34 yards. He also had a key fumble to ruin a potential touchdown.    Blake Bortles completed 28-of-50 passes for 298 yards with a touchdown. Allen Hurns led the Jaguars with 11 receptions for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson (4-80) was limited by "

DeAndre Hopkins was the fantasy star of the game with 10 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. For some strange reason, the Jaguars resisted sending double coverage to Hopkins, who ate up man coverage.    Brian Hoyer completed 24-for-36 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns. He played an efficient game for the Texans and was more steady than what they had received under Ryan Mallett.    Arian Foster finished with 53 yards on 18 carries. He did more damage through the air with 59 yards on 5 receptions and a touchdown. Foster had a fumble that Houston recovered.    Bortles was 30-of-53 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Texans' pass rush rattled Bortles into a number of misguided throws.    With T.J. Yeldon out, the Jaguars' rushing attack was nonexistent. They were led by Toby Gerhart (9-26) and Denard Robinson (7-19).    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 86 yards and a score. His injury is worth monitoring for fantasy rosters. Allen Hurns (2-30) and Julius Thomas (7-78) each caught touchdowns.    The Texans' defense played their best game of the season. "

After starting with good field position, Bortles converted 1 third down with his feet and another with a screen to Yeldon for 21 yards. That led to a field goal for Jacksonville. New York got an excellent kick return from Antonio Cromartie to midfield. A screen to Zac Stacy converted a third-and-long and a back-shoulder throw to Eric Decker went for about 25 yards. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick found Decker wide open in the end zone to give New York a 7-3 lead. Promptly, Bortles had a deflected pass intercepted by Marcus Williams to set up the Jets at the 32-yard line. A 4.h-and-3 was converted by Fitzpatrick to Decker, and Chris Ivory scored on a third-and-1. The Jaguars moved the ball into Jets territory in the final seconds and Bortles made a beautiful throw to Allen Hurns for a 30-yard touchdown after beating Antonio Cromartie.

Robinson caught 5 balls for 113 yards, including an impressive, leaping reception in between 2 defenders in the 4.h quarter. Hurns, on the other hand, logged 3 receptions for 19 yards. I have to wonder if his injury hindered him at all in this contest.    "

   "comment":"Allen Hurns and ended by adding another field goal. On the final play of the first quarter, Rivers connected with Antonio Gates for a gain of 27 yards. A run by Melvin Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.    Neither team received a good game from its defense, but Chargers rookie linebacker "

   "comment":"Allen Hurns (5-64), but Jason Myers missed a 54-yard field goal. The Chargers got Benjamin matched up on Paul Posluszny, and that led to a 43-yard completion for San Diego. The Jaguars jumped offsides on a 4.h-and-1 at the 4-yard line, and a play, later Rivers hit Antonio Gates (3-15) for a 2-yard score. With San Diego up 21-0, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.    Blake Bortles was 31-of-50 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His accuracy was off in the first half. Allen Robinson (3-54) and Allen Hurns (5-64) were held in check as the Chargers cornerbacks of Jason Verrett, Casey Hayward and Brandon Flowers really played well."

Baltimore averaged a ghastly 0.7 yards per play in the opening half. Bortles' final numbers were 20-of-31 for 244 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also a drew deep pass interference on a shot to Lee, so his numbers could've been even better. The people of London must think that Bortles is the greatest quarterback of all time.    Three of Bortles' scores went to Lewis, who hauled in 4 grabs for 62 yards. Hurns (3-20) had the other. Lee, meanwhile, led the Jaguars in receiving (4-65).    "
