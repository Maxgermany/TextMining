   "comment":"Allen Hurns. However, Henne struggled to do anything in the second half, as his mediocrity was greatly exposed. It's no guarantee that Bortles would have enjoyed better results, but it's likely that he would have. Bortles is the superior talent by a wide margin, and he probably would have actually been able to complete routine passes, whereas Henne had issues doing so. Henne was 12-of-17 for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half, but was just 12-of-26 for 99 yards following intermission. Credit the Eagles for making the proper adjustments, but this was more about Henne's ineptitude more than anything. He had players open, but simply missed them. He naturally capped it off with a strip-sack returned for a touchdown that allowed the Eagles to cover the spread. That was absolutely brutal because it seemed as though Jacksonville would cover the entire afternoon. The Jaguars maintained a 17-0 lead as 10.5-point underdogs for most of this contest, so they were the right side.    At any rate, there were a couple of reasons why the Jaguars controlled this game for most of regulation, but the primary factor was Nick Foles' poor play. Foles was anemic early on, going just 12-of-24 for 139 yards and an interception in the opening half. He missed open receivers at an alarming rate. He overthrew his tight ends down the seam on numerous occasions. He sailed a pass miles over Jeremy Maclin's head. He also had an open Maclin downfield, but he didn't see him and consequently got sacked. Philadelphia's offensive line had major issues with Jacksonville's pass rush; Jason Peters even surrendered 2 sacks in the opening half, while All-Pro guard Evan Mathis exited with a knee injury. Foles played better as the game went on, however, finishing 27-of-45 for 322 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. His scores went to Maclin (4-97) and Ertz (3-77). Maclin led the team in targets with 10. Riley Cooper, meanwhile, barely did anything, hauling in 4 balls for 29 yards.    LeSean McCoy had a nice outing - 21 carries, 74 rush yards, 6 catches, 41 rec. yards - but he wasn't the Philadelphia running back who found the end zone. That was Darren Sproles, who gained 71 yards on 11 carries. His touchdown scamper was a 49-yarder, which was actually the longest touchdown carry of his career.    Getting back to the Jaguars, undrafted rookie Allen Hurns made some noise early. He caught 4 balls for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half, but had zero receptions afterward. I briefly had Hurns on my list, but took him off when Cecil Shorts seemed to return to health. Hurns will get all of the attention, but I'd rather have Hurns.

   "comment":"Allen Hurns on the opening drive, but it wouldn't have mattered because he showed absolutely zero awareness when it came to reading blitzes, and thus couldn't consistently move the chains. The Redskins managed to dominate the line of scrimmage - especially Hurns on the opening drive, but it wouldn't have mattered because he showed absolutely zero awareness when it came to reading blitzes, and thus couldn't consistently move the chains. The Redskins managed to dominate the line of scrimmage - especially Jason Hatcher and Ryan Kerrigan - but many of the franchise-record 10 sacks Henne took were his fault because he often held on to the ball too long. The offensive line stinks, but a capable quarterback would have taken at least half of those sacks. Henne is pure garbage and should not start another game going forward. Bradley needs to be fired if he doesn't give Bortles the nod in Week 3.    Perhaps the general manager should be axed as well for signing Toby Gerhart. It's no surprise that the plodder couldn't do anything in this contest. He mustered only 8 yards on 7 carries. It's embarrassing that the Jaguars are starting him, but they don't have anyone better.    Jacksonville's top wideout was Allen Robinson (4-75), but most of what he did came in garbage time. Hurns (2-13), as mentioned, killed his team with that awful drop. He was wide open, and he would've easily run into the end zone for a 76-yard score. Adding injury to insult, he left the game on crutches after twisting his ankle. "

   "comment":"Allen Hurns actually caught passes. And yet the Jaguars still lost by double digits. On the bright side, they actually covered the spread!    The Bengals were ripe for a letdown after a big win over Baltimore last week and with a game against division rival Cleveland this coming Thursday. However, Cincinnati drew Jacksonville, and the Jaguars just don't have the talent to go on the road and beat a playoff-caliber team like the Bengals. Jeremy Hill and Mohamed Sanu came up with huge performances to lead an injury-depleted Cincinnati squad to the win.    The Jaguars were fortunate to get on the board first as Bengals cornerback Terence Newman dropped interception deep in Jacksonville territory. Denard Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to A.J. Green, a clutch reception by Cedric Peerman, a chunk run by Hill, and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanu. Cincinnati's next score was set up by Rex Burkhead, getting a piece of a punt to shorten the field. Dalton dropped in a rainbow to Sanu, who made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 32-yard gain to the 10-yard line. On the next play, Sanu recovered a fumble by A.J. Green to maintain the scoring opportunity that ended with a field goal by Andy Dalton. The Jaguars went 3.and-out, thanks to a sack by Carlos Dunlap and Jaguars punter Bryan Anger had his second consecutive punt blocked, which Taylor Mays turned into a safety. Cincinnati could have broken the game open as Bortles had another interception dropped; this time by linebacker Emmanuel Lamur before the half. In the third quarter, Dalton went right back to Sanu for a 36-yard reception to the 11-yard line. Sanu (4-95) ran a great route and beat safety Josh Evans for the ball. Hill finished the drive with a short touchdown run. The Jaguars answered with Bortles throwing a 40-yard touchdown to Allen Hurns. Hurns had a step on Hurns actually caught passes.

If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting T.Y. Hilton involved. The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking. Donte Moncrief (6-75) also contributed and continued to play ahead of Andre Johnson.    Frank Gore ran for 53 yards on 17 carries. He caught 5 passes for 34 yards. He also had a key fumble to ruin a potential touchdown.    Blake Bortles completed 28-of-50 passes for 298 yards with a touchdown. Allen Hurns led the Jaguars with 11 receptions for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson (4-80) was limited by Hurns for 26 yards.

A run by Melvin Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.

Brees came right back to rip the ball through the porous Jacksonville defense and connect with Travaris Cadet for a 44-yard touchdown. That extended the Saints' lead to 31-13. Bortles answered by torching Brandon Browner with Robinson down the sideline for a 90-yard touchdown. Kenny Vaccaro intercepted the 2.point conversion to keep the lead at 31-19 for the Saints. The Jaguars' defense was incapable of restraining New Orleans' offense as they moved down the field before Hightower plunged into the end zone from a few yards out. New Orleans extended its lead to 38-19 early in the 4.h quarter. Late in the game, Bortles hooked up with Hurns for another touchdown and hit a 2.pointer to conclude the scoring.    Brees completed 25-of-36 for 412 yards with 3 touchdowns. It was vintage Brees as Jacksonville's defense was completely inept at defending him. Cooks had 5 catches for 123 yards and a score to lead the Saints receivers.    Hightower ran over the Jaguars with 122 yards on 27 carries and 2 touchdowns.    Bortles was 27-of-35 for 368 yards with 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Generally, he played well, but the Jacksonville defense gave the offense zero support.    The Jaguars' dynamic receiving tandem of Robinson and Hurns continued to pad their stats. Robinson caught 6 passes for 151 yards and a score. Hurns had 8 catches for 106 yards and 2 scores.    There wasn't much defense in this game, and each team illustrated the need to upgrade its stop unit significantly to be any better in 2016.   "

Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay.

Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. Brian Hoyer was 30-of-49 for 302 yards, but Chicago really struggled in the red zone, and that ended up being the difference in this game.
