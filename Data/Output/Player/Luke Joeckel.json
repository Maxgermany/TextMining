The Jaguars would settle for a field goal, but they took the points off the board after a Rams' penalty. On the very next play, Gabbert tossed an interception in the end zone.

   "comment":"Luke Joeckel took away a touchdown pass to Cecil Shorts, so the Jaguars settled for a field goal before intermission.    The Giants melted down in the second half. It started when Manning was sacked by Geno Hayes. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Jennings tried to get up and run with the ball around the leg of a teammate, but J.T. Thomas was able to dive on the ball for a touchdown. Jennings should have just accepted a safety. New York moved the ball into Jacksonville territory before Josh Brown had a costly missed a field goal. The Jaguars took advantage with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Marqise Lee (6-75). It was a pretty pass by Bortles to pull Jacksonville within 5 points (the 2.point conversion attempt was batted by Jason Pierre-Paul). Early in the 4.h quarter, Donnell caught a pass in the flat, but fumbled the ball on a hard hit by Dwayne Gratz. Aaron Colvin picked up the ball and raced down the sideline for a 41-yard touchdown for Jacksonville. With about 6 minutes remaining, Manning hit Beckham (7-90) for 23 yards and Reuben Randle (3-52) for 17 yards. The Jaguars buckled down to force the Giants into a field goal. Down 24-22, Bortles put together the game-winning drive. He threw a short slant to Lee and he ran for 22 yards to get it started. A 10-yard pass to Shorts and zone-read runs of 11 and 20 yards by Bortles got the ball in field goal range for Josh Scobee to hit a game-winning 43-yarder with 28 seconds left. The Giants promptly allowed a strip-sack to Sen'Derrick Marks to clinch the win for Jacksonville.    Bortles completed 21-of-35 passes for 194 yards with 1 score. The Jaguars' 2 defensive scores were the reason the team made the comeback. Denard Robinson (11-44) never got going on the ground.    Manning was 24-of-34 for 247 yards with a touchdown. He played well, but his offensive line gave him no help. Jennings (26-91) left the game with an ankle injury.    Both teams featured terrible offensive line play. The Jaguars allowed Bortles to be sacked 7 times, while New York allowed 4 sacks of Manning. Jameel McClain (9 tackles, 1 sack), Devon Kennard (2 sacks) and Jason Pierre-Paul (1.5 sacks) played well for the Giants. Sen'Derrick Marks (2 sacks, 1 TFL) and Telvin Smith (10 tackles) stood out for the Jaguars.    Jacksonville left tackle Luke Joeckel really struggled against the Giants. He was burned by Pierre-Paul for a sack, had a holding take away a touchdown and was guilty of another holding penalty on the game-winning drive that could have been costly. Even though Joeckel is essentially a rookie, he is not playing up to his draft slot.   "
