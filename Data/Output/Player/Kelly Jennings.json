   "comment":"Jennings in which the Seattle corner contacted a Rams receiver downfield and never turned around. 5. Gave the Seahawks a very questionable first down that prompted Al Michaels to exclaim, They gave a first down on that play!?!?! <b> My Answer: E) All of the above. </b>    I'm not giving the Seahawks any credit because they're the worst team to ever qualify for the playoffs, both in terms of record and point differential. It's ridiculous that both the Giants and Buccaneers slaughtered Seattle, yet the Seahawks will be the team playing next weekend.   "
