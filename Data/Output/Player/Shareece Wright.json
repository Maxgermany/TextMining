   "comment":"Wright for a 76-yard touchdown. While he's struggled on some deep throws, Kaepernick threw that bomb perfectly. With the 49ers up 13-3, Flacco was picked off by forcing a pass to a covered receiver. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite cut in front of the ball, and that gave the 49ers another field goal. The Ravens answered with a field goal drive of their own. The 49ers took a 16-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Flacco threw an awful pass. It was late down the middle of the field, off his back foot, and up for grabs like a punt, and dropped in to San Francisco cornerback Kenneth Acker. A pop pass to Anquan Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal. Acker found that Flacco giveth and taketh away, as Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but Justin Tucker slipped on the field goal attempt and it hit off the upright no good. San Francisco took advantage again of the Ravens' weak secondary as Kaepernick laid out a pretty 51-yard bomb that Boldin made a superb catch to Baltimore's 25-yard line. A few plays later, Quinton Patton got wide open in the end zone after Shareece Wright fell down, and Kaepernick hit him for a 21-yard score. A missed 2.point attempt had the 49ers' lead at 25-13. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Ravens weren't quite done as they drove down the field. On 4.h-and-goal, "
