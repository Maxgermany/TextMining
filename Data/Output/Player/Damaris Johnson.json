   "comment":"Johnson on a big third-and-8 near midfield in the second quarter. However, Fitzpatrick was actually near-perfect in the second half; in fact, he didn't throw a post-halftime incompletion until there was 2:30 remaining in regulation. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-25 for 154 yards and the pick. He was nearly intercepted late in the end zone, and he couldn't get the team moving in overtime. The Texans, as you can imagine, ran their offense through Arian Foster, who looked much healthier this week. He gained 157 yards and 2 touchdowns on 23 carries. He dominated 1 drive single-handedly, bursting for a big gain and then making a nice cut, juking Barry Church, and running into the end zone.    DeAndre Hopkins (6-63) and Andre Johnson (5-58) both had marginal outings for their fantasy owners. Excluding Foster, they were the only players to see more than 2 targets.    It's a short trip, but I was impressed by the Texans' fans, who made the trip to Dallas. They made their presence known throughout the afternoon, as Bloooo was heard every time "

   "comment":"Johnson said afterward that there's something wrong with the NFL if J.J. Watt isn't voted MVP. Eh, I don't think so. Watt is incredible, and he's in the conversation, but how valuable can he be if he couldn't lead his team into the playoffs? He's not even the most valuable player in his own division. That would be Andrew Luck.    The Texans needed a win over the Jaguars - with Cleveland beating Baltimore and San Diego losing to Kansas City - to make the playoffs. The Texans and Chiefs did their part, but the Ravens' comeback win sent the Texans home for the winter. Still, Houston improved from 2 wins in 2013 to 9 wins this year while having a rash of injuries at quarterback and dealing with poor play at times from the signal-caller. Bill O'Brien and his coaching staff did a tremendous job and have the Texans going in the right direction.    Houston got the scoring started on its first possession. The Texans had a beautiful drive that started with Case Keenum hitting Andre Johnson on a slant for a gain of 29 yards. "
