Meredith led the Bears in receiving with 6 catches for 72 yards and a touchdown, followed by Joshua Bellamy (3-45). Meredith would've had a line of 7-99, but the aforementioned hold wiped that out. Had Meredith's play been allowed to stand, the Bears would've been in field-goal range to force overtime.   Braverman of 27 and 17 yards, respectively, were negated by holds.

   "comment":"Daniel Braverman screwed up by quitting on the route. A few plays later, Christine Michael (4-45-1) broke down the field for a 42-yard touchdown run. Down 27-10, the Bears got back into the game, as Barkley started connecting with Alshon Jeffery (6-89-1) with 3 completions for 58 yards, including an 8-yard strike for 6. Barkley and Jeffery connected some more to set up a 9-yard touchdown run by Jordan Howard. Late in the 4.h quarter, Barkley made another drive deep into Green Bay territory, but on third-and-goal, Hyde made a tremendous diving breakup to force a game-tying field goal. With under a minute remaining on a third-and-long, Rodgers hit a 60-yard bomb to Jordy Nelson, who somehow got behind the Bears' coverage. On the final play of the game, Mason Crosby was true on a 32-yard field goal to give the Packers a tough road win.    Rodgers completed 19-of-31 passes for 252 yards, but he had a lot of dropped passes from Nelson and Adams that took points away from Green Bay's offense. Nelson led the Packers with 7 receptions for 124 yards. He had some bad drops on deep balls downfield, but redeemed himself in the clutch.    On the ground, wide receiver-turned-running back Montgomery had 16 carries for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Barkley was 30-of-43 for 362 yards with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He played much better than the numbers illustrate, as 1 pick was a Hail Mary and the other was the fault of Daniel Braverman.    Howard had 17 carries for 90 yards with a touchdown.
