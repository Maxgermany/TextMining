He also was a big factor on the ground, running 8 times for 100 yards. With games remaining against the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Panthers have a chance to become only the third team in modern history to finish a regular season undefeated. For the Giants, their playoff hopes took a major hit. The Giants fell to 6-8 and are a game behind in the race for the NFC East championship.    Beyond the Panthers staying unbeaten, the other big story of the day was the matchup between New York wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Carolina cornerback "

   "comment":"Gano went wide left from 50 yards.    The big story to come out of this game will be Trevor Siemian, who was not intimidated whatsoever to be going up against Luke Kuechly and Carolina's Super Bowl defense despite never attempting a pass in the regular season before. Siemian was very competent, making smart decisions (for the most part) and tossing precise passes, all while mixing in timely runs. He kind of looked like Alex Smith, if I had to make a comparison. Granted, he was battling a secondary that really looks like it's missing Josh Norman, but Siemian still had to deal with Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Kawann Short and the rest of Carolina's prolific front 7. Siemian finished 18-of-26 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and he also jogged for 20 rushing yards on 5 carries. Both picks occurred inside the Carolina 30-yard line - 2 of Denver's 3 give-aways took place there - as 1 was tipped at the line of scrimmage, while the other 1 transpired as Siemian was under pressure and threw off his back foot. I won't blame Siemian for the first pick, but the second 1 was inexcusable. That was 3 easy points off the board, which would've made a huge difference had Gano nailed that field goal. Siemian also got lucky on 1 occasion, when he had an open Virgil Green in the end zone, but underthrew him with a pass that was nearly picked off. It's too bad that Siemian is just a bridge to Paxton Lynch, because I think there's something there. Siemian is a smart, gritty quarterback who, at the very least, proved that he can be a viable backup quarterback in this league.    "
