   "comment":"Sammie Coates (1-11) took his spot in the lineup.    CBS really needs to think about replacing Phil Simms as the lead color analyst. Simms, who is usually very bland, was mumbling incoherent and strange thoughts all evening. He pretended to read Tomlin's lips at the end, incorrectly telling the audience that Tomlin said my bad instead of what he really said, which was, He made it. Simms also complained about the Steelers not trying a 50-yard field goal in overtime when Scobee had already missed 2 in the 40-49 range. And if that wasn't bad enough, Simms said that QBDK had never played in an offense with lots of weapons. So, DeSean Jackson, "

   "comment":"Sammie Coates still dealing with an injured hand, the Steelers had lost their deep threat, but Green filled that role today. He had receptions of 37, 33 and 20 yards, which was for his touchdown. The receptions and yards were both highs for Green, who had been on injured reserve for much of the season. He's slowly been getting up to speed, and you could see glimpses of his speed and ability to run by linebackers over the last 2 games, but now we're seeing him get a larger share of snaps, which is paying off for the Steelers. If they can get Sammie Coates back and healthy, this offense could be difficult to slow.    "
