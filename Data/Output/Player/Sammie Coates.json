   "comment":"Sammie Coates (1-11) took his spot in the lineup.    CBS really needs to think about replacing Phil Simms as the lead color analyst. Simms, who is usually very bland, was mumbling incoherent and strange thoughts all evening. He pretended to read Tomlin's lips at the end, incorrectly telling the audience that Tomlin said my bad instead of what he really said, which was, He made it. Simms also complained about the Steelers not trying a 50-yard field goal in overtime when Scobee had already missed 2 in the 40-49 range. And if that wasn't bad enough, Simms said that QBDK had never played in an offense with lots of weapons. So, DeSean Jackson, "

This was an up-and-down game for Coates, as he had a couple of bad drops, including a gimme 5-yard touchdown. But the Steelers realize his big-play ability is worth more in their offense than the drops.    On the other side, the Ryan Fitzpatrick didn't amass huge interception numbers like he has over the last 2 weeks, but he had little chance to keep up with the Steelers' offense this week. He did a good job of targeting Brandon Marshall, who ended up with the biggest share of New York's 316 total yards, catching 8-of-15 targets for 114 yards and a touchdown. But, Marshall had a couple of bad drops, and in this game, every inch of offense was needed by the Jets.    After the Steelers scored quickly with the deep touchdown to Coates, the Jets did their best to take away the deep pass, which they did successfully, but that's when Le'Veon Bell came into play. Bell would slip past the line, and with nobody getting to Roethlisberger and no linebacker able to cover Bell; the Steelers had a 10-yard reception anytime they wanted. Bell ended the day having rushed 20 times for just 66 yards, but he caught 9-of-11 targets for 88 yards. Bell truly does make this offense unstoppable at times like this. If he is stopped on the ground, he'll get his through the air or vice-versa or both, which makes things extremely tough for defenses trying to cover Antonio Brown, Sammie Coates and company.    The Jets' pass defense really was the weak link in this game, as they had no answer for Roethlisberger. And even though the defensive line held Bell to 66 yards, New York only got to Roethlisberger 1 time, which makes it even tougher on the secondary. Anyway you look at it, the Jets are giving up chunk yardage through the air and don't have the offense to match their opponents.    The worst coaching decision of the day goes to Todd Bowles, who, with 7:36 left in the game and his team down by 2 scores on a 4.h-and-two at midfield, elected to punt. This against a team that had no trouble moving the ball on his defense for most of the day. Predictably, the Steelers took that possession and went 79 yards in 12 plays, ending the Jets' chances with Sammie Coates' second touchdown of the day.    The Steelers have now blown out their last 2 opponents at home after being blown out themselves in Philadelphia 3 weeks ago, while the Jets have now lost their last 3 by a total score of 82-33.
