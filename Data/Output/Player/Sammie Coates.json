Simms, who is usually very bland, was mumbling incoherent and strange thoughts all evening. He pretended to read Tomlin's lips at the end, incorrectly telling the audience that Tomlin said my bad instead of what he really said, which was, He made it. Simms also complained about the Steelers not trying a 50-yard field goal in overtime when Scobee had already missed 2 in the 40-49 range. And if that wasn't bad enough, Simms said that QBDK had never played in an offense with lots of weapons. So, DeSean Jackson, "

Bryant was actually the Steelers' leading rusher. Toussaint had no room to do anything, though he did score a touchdown. He finished with 39 yards on 12 carries, but was guilty of that horrible fumble that gave Denver the victory.    The Steelers need to upgrade their punter, who struggled mightily. The secondary is a more pressing issue, so I have them addressing that area in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

He's slowly been getting up to speed, and you could see glimpses of his speed and ability to run by linebackers over the last 2 games, but now we're seeing him get a larger share of snaps, which is paying off for the Steelers.

   "comment":"Coates, Cobi Hamilton, Darrius Heyward-Bey - far too often. The end result happened to be tons of dropped passes and missed opportunities. New England's offense, meanwhile, did enough to get the victory. Thirty-6 points isn't indicative of their overall performance, as they scored a free, quick touchdown following an Eli Rogers lost fumble, and they were very fortunate to retain possession following a Tom Brady lost fumble that should've been rewarded to Pittsburgh. However, the Steelers struggled to stop the Patriots on too many drives, and they probably would've lost to the Patriots regardless. This game would've been a lot closer with Bell on the field, though.    Tom Brady finished 32-of-42 for 384 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also fumbled, but despite the Steelers getting a clear recovery, incompetent officiating ruled New England possession without any sort of explanation. That was Brady's sole mistake of the afternoon, and his numbers would've been better if it weren't for a couple of drops. It really helped that Brady was seldom hit this evening. He took a sack early, but was barely touched after that. Brady will be heading to his seventh Super Bowl, and if he gets the win, he'll have the most championships of any quarterback in NFL history, breaking the current tie he has with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw.    Despite Brady's high yardage total, only 3 Patriots accumulated more han 13 receiving yards. They were Chris Hogan (9-180), Julian Edelman (8-118) and Martellus Bennett (5-32). Hogan secured 2 of Brady's 3 touchdowns, while Edelman snatched the other. Both made big plays in this game, obviously, but Edelman really sparked the team with a 12-yard conversion on a third-and-10 between 2 defenders, ultimately leading to a score.    The Patriots tried to run with LeGarrette Blount in the early going, but weren't very successful; his 5 first-half carries went for just 4 yards. However, the flu-stricken Steelers wore down in the second half, and Blount finished with 47 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. His best run was when he managed to carry what appeared to be the entire Pittsburgh defense down to the 1-yard line.    Back to the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 31-of-47 for 314 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. While Roethlisberger accumulated a bulk of his numbers in garbage time, it's still amazing that he was competent when factoring in the utter trash he was throwing to. With Bell injured and Brown constantly double teamed, he had to resort to working with the aforementioned Coates, Hamilton and Heyward-Bey.

Coates then did the same thing right after halftime. Heyward-Bey was responsible for Roethlisberger's interception, as he wasn't even aware the ball was heading in his direction. The Steelers could have Martavis Bryant back next year, but he needs to be reinstated. It's difficult for the Steelers to trust him, so they may target 1 of the 2017 NFL Draft Wide Receiver Prospect Rankings in the early rounds.
