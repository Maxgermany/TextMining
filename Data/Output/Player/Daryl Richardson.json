   "comment":"Richardson in Falcons' territory, but the ball bounced off the running back's hands and into Osi Umenyiora's arms. The former Giant defensive end then galloped 68 yards to go into the end zone. The Rams looked like they would make the contest interesting - it would be 14-3, at the very worst - but the Falcons went up 21-0 instead.    Two of Bradford's touchdowns went to Tavon Austin, who had 6 catches for 47 yards. Austin also had a 7-yard rush in which he was given the ball like a running back. I thought it was Isaiah Pead at first glance, but it was Austin instead. The third Bradford score went to Austin Pettis (8-78), who had a big game. Chris Givens (5-105) led the team in receiving, while Jared Cook (1-10) didn't do much following a huge debut. Cook missed out on a long catch because he tripped as the ball was sailing toward him.    Richardson, meanwhile, couldn't find any running lanes. He managed 35 yards on 10 carries. The Rams' coaching staff seemed to shy away from him a bit after the aforementioned pick-six gaffe; he had just 5 touches after halftime.    The Rams suffered an injury to an important player themselves in this contest. "
