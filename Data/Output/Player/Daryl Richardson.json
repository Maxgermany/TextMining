He looked good until he fumbled when trying to ice the game, giving the Redskins 1 last opportunity that they threw away because of the aforementioned stupidity. Jackson, by the way, finished with 58 yards on 9 carries.    Robert Griffin also had a great performance. He went 20-of-29 for 206 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick, but he did most of his damage on the ground, scrambling 11 times for 82 yards and 2 scores. Griffin's touchdown was a 68-yard bomb to "
