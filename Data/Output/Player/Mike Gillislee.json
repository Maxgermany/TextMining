For example, Gillislee broke free for a 50-yard touchdown. Suddenly, the score was 16-6, allowing Buffalo to cover the 6.5-point spread in horrific fashion. Also, my condolences if you were forced to watch the entirety of this contest. It was absolutely brutal, featuring horrible passes and tons of offensive gaffes. It was like spending 3 hours in a dentist's chair. The Bills outgained the Cowboys by 100 yards and averaged 1.2 more yards per play. They just were guilty of too many mistakes. For example, Tyrod Taylor completely missed an open Chris Hogan for a touchdown early on. Taylor, for whatever reason, threw it deep on a 4.h-and-3. A bit later, Hogan was uncovered deep, yet Taylor somehow didn't see him. Taylor's struggles continued after that when he hurled an underthrown pass in the end zone that was intercepted. Things didn't get much better for Tayor in the second half, as he got banged up and had to be checked out on the sideline. He turned out to be OK, but he just couldn't get anything going on offense, at least when passing. Taylor's aerial numbers were 13-of-18 for 179 yards and the pick, but he did some good work on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 67 rushing yards.    Taylor wasn't the only Buffalo player making mistakes on offense. Karlos Williams fumbled the ball near the red zone in the second half. He had a solid game otherwise, gaining 76 rushing yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries. He also chipped in with 2 catches for 21 receiving yards. Gillislee actually led the Bills in rushing, but only because of that 50-yard score at the end. Gillislee gained 93 yards and the touchdown on 9 tries. He nearly had a second score, but replay review saw him down at the 1-yard line, and Williams plunged into the end zone on the next play.    "

   "comment":"Mike Gillislee's fumble inside the red zone. McCown once again did his thing, hitting Gillislee's fumble inside the red zone. McCown once again did his thing, hitting Jermaine Kearse for 16 yards on a third-and-5, and then following that up with a 31-yard bomb to Kerley. It looked like the Jets were going to upset the Patriots, but that's when Tom Brady happened. Brady caught fire, aside from an interception on a poor deep shot into double coverage. The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by Brandin Cooks, who still managed to lead the team with 6 catches for 93 yards. Brady spent most of the afternoon hurling deep balls to Cooks and some of his other receivers, and they had success doing so as the game progressed following some early struggles.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were thrown to Rob Gronkowski, who caught 6 balls for 83 yards. He nearly had a third touchdown, as he drew a pass interference penalty in the end zone. Meanwhile, Danny Amendola (3-40) and Chris Hogan (1-19) didn't do much. Hogan hurt his ribs on a fierce hit, but missed only 1 drive.    With Gillislee fumbling, Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him."

He was able to make men miss at the line of scrimmage and turn gains that should have been gone nowhere into 4.to-five-yard gains. Lewis took 15 carries for 44 yards and also handled most of the goal-line work, a trend that has continued since Gillislee fumbled a couple of weeks ago. Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit Gillislee.
