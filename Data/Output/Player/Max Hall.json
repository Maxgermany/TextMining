   "comment":"Max Hall, who finished 8-of-14 for 82 yards. All indications are that Hall will start going forward. Arizona's coaching staff is smitten with the 24-year-old rookie out of BYU. He was sharp in the preseason, so it'll be interesting to see how the rest of the Cardinals' season unfolds. Arizona's offense was a mess; the team took 9 sacks compared to just 10 first downs. But despite the struggles of Anderson and Hall, "

However, Hall made smart passes afterward. In fact, his best play came in the 4.h quarter when he threw the ball out of bounds in the red zone when no 1 was open.
