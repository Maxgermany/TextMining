Flacco actually did a good job of moving the chains, hooking up with Gillmore on a big completion and drawing a pass interference going to him once more, but after Smith let a touchdown fall through his hands in the end zone, Flacco was intercepted on another attempt toward Gillmore. Flacco finished 18-of-32 for 117 yards and 2 picks. The first interception matched Manning's pick-six. Gillmore as his primary option on a potential game-winning drive at the end of regulation.
