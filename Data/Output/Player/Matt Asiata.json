   "comment":"Asiata, starting in place of Adrian Peterson and Toby Gerhart, lost a fumble that set up a quick Detroit score much later in the game.    I'm not going to spend much time on this contest. Here were some key stats/notes: - Matthew Stafford struggled once again without Calvin Johnson. He went 22-of-33 for 217 yards and a touchdown, but much of that came after intermission; he was just 8-of-12 for 43 yards after 1 half of action. - With Johnson out, Detroit's leaders in receptions were Kevin Ogletree (5-75), Nate Burleson (5-64) and Reggie Bush (5-33). Bush, who scored on a reception, couldn't get much on the ground, gaining just 32 yards on 14 carries. - Cassel finished 20-of-33 for 189 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. He could've had a second touchdown, but actually missed Jared Allen in the end zone. - Cordarrelle Patterson scored twice, once on a 50-yard fake sweep and a second time for an 8-yard score that ended up being the game-winning touchdown. Greg Jennings, meanwhile, led the team in receiving with 5 catches for 44 yards. - The Vikings still had a solid ground attack despite Peterson's absence. Asiata tallied 115 yards on just 14 carries.   "

   "comment":"Asiata's 25-yard reception from Matt Cassel, who opened 4-for-4. The Vikings didn't score a single point after that. In fact, they were outgained, 292-137, the rest of the way. Matt Cassel had major issues in this contest, as Bill Belichick seemed to know exactly how to game plan for his former quarterback. Cassel went 19-of-36 for 202 yards, 1 touchdown a whopping 4 interceptions. Cassel's first pick was a dying duck heaved at Devin McCourty, who nearly brought it back for 6. but was tackled at the 1-yard line. The second was just great coverage by Darrelle Revis, so I wouldn't put that 1 on Cassel. His third was a forced throw, while the 4.h occurred in garbage time. Cassel made some poor throws outside of the picks as well. For instance, he had an open receiver in the red zone during the second quarter, but led his target out of bounds. This forced the Vikings to attempt a field goal, which was blocked and returned for a touchdown. Of course, it didn't help that the Vikings couldn't pass protect at all. Cassel took a whopping 6 sacks, as Matt Kalil had major problems blocking Chandler Jones. Kalil had an awful game against Robert Quinn last week as well.    As for Peterson's replacement, Asiata proved to be the plodder he was projected to be. He pounded for 36 yards on 13 carries, but made a positive contribution in the passing attack, snagging 5 balls for 48 receiving yards and the aforementioned touchdown.    Those who didn't see this game might be surprised that "

He didn't face much of a challenge against Atlanta's pathetic front, but McKinnon still needs to get more touches going forward.    Moving back to the Falcons, Ryan was sharp early on, but as mentioned, his offensive line issues prevented him from doing anything late. Ryan finished 25-of-41 for 298 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 meaningless picks. He was terrific on third downs, converting 10-of-15 opportunities.    The Vikings didn't seem to have an answer for any of the 3 primary receivers, as Julio Jones (6-82), Roddy White (4-73, TD) and Hester (5-70, TD) all had big outings. White scored on a complete breakdown in coverage.    The Falcons continued to have their running backs split carries. Steven Jackson barely did anything with his opportunities (13 carries, 49 yards), while Antone Smith burst for a 48-yard touchdown at the end of the third quarter.    I mentioned an announcing blunder earlier. There was a minor amusing 1 in this game when the FOX play-by-play guy incoherently shouted, Matt Asiata up the middle and gets an Atlanta first down! Wow, it's amazing the Falcons lost this game when 1 member of the Vikings was so traitorous.   "

He mad a great adjustment on 1 of Bridgewater's throws, but it appeared as though he had 1 foot out of bounds. Jim Caldwell challenged, but he strangely did not win the review.    Though Asiata had a nice performance as a pass-catcher, he did very little as a runner, as he struggled to find room against Detroit's ferocious front line. He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds. That ended up costing Minnesota precious seconds.    As for the Lions, they were really fortunate to get those turnovers from Bridgewater because they did nothing offensively all afternoon. They converted just 2-of-11 third downs, as "

   "comment":"Asiata had nice gains in this contest, tallying 91 yards on 19 carries. However, he was stuffed on consecutive plays inside the 5-yard line with 3 minutes remaining. Had he converted, the Bears wouldn't have had 1 final opportunity to take the lead. Of course, that implies that the Bears could've mustered anything offensively without a fluke play. Chicago once again looked dysfunctional when it had the ball, especially early on. Cutler, starting this game for the concussed Jimmy Clausen, had to waste an early timeout on a third-and-1. Following a false start, the Bears were guilty of a delay of game. This happened again later on, disrupting what looked like a promising drive. Cutler should really be happy that he avoided turning the ball over. He was lucky to get away with a pick on a third down at the end of the opening quarter. He finished 23-of-36 for only 172 yards, as he once again threw nothing but checkdowns and screens. The Vikings' pass rush overwhelmed Chicago's decrepit offensive front, so Cutler didn't have time to look downfield.    Cutler appeared to throw a touchdown to "

   "comment":"Asiata was stuffed twice on third-and-1. Minnesota had been throwing the ball so well, yet new coordinator Pat Shurmur continued to call ineffective runs on crucial downs, disrupting what appeared to be promising Minnesota drives. It's also worth noting that the Vikings, down 14-0, were able to take the lead via impressive Sam Bradford throws in the second quarter, yet Shurmur came out and ran the ball thrice on the opening drive following intermission, resulting in a 3.and-out. Bradford played on a high level for most of this contest. The numbers prove it, as he finished 31-of-40 for 307 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. However, things came apart for him in the latter half of the 4.h quarter. It began when the Vikings, down 23-20, crossed into Washington territory. Bradford hurled a poor throw, and Preston Smith made a very athletic play to bat the pass and haul in the interception while reaching back across his body. Bradford then reached the Washington 30-yard line on the final drive, but held on to the ball way too long on a second down. He took a sack, and the next play resulted in a hold and a Jake Long injury. Long had to be carted off with what turned out to be a torn Achilles. Bradford was then sacked by Smith to end the game.    Bradford killed the Redskins with crossing routes most of the afternoon, and the recipient of most of those was Stefon Diggs, who reeled in 13 of his 15 targets for 164 yards. Bradford's touchdowns, meanwhile, went to Kyle Rudolph (5-69) and Adam Thielen (3-21).    As hinted earlier, the Vikings couldn't run the ball whatsoever. Jerick McKinnon led the team with 16 yards on 6 carries, while Asiata (9-13) was stuffed on almost every try, save for a goal-line plunge in the second quarter.   "
