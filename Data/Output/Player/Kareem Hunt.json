   "comment":"Hunt and Tyreek Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns. What's crazy is that "

   "comment":"Hunt rushed for 172 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries because of this. A 69-yard score came near the end of the game, but he had multiple bursts of 8 and 10 yards throughout the contest because the Chiefs couldn't wrap him up.    Alex Smith misfired on just 5 occasions, going 16-of-21 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. Smith actually saw lots of pressure from the edge, as Melvin Ingram recorded 3 sacks. Joey Bosa chipped in with a half sack as well.    Tyreek Hill (5-77) and Albert Wilson (3-18) caught Smith's touchdowns, as Hill's came via a horrible defensive scheme where he was somehow matched up on a linebacker. Hill seemed to suffer an injury late in the game when a deep shot sailed out of bounds, but the announcers speculated that it might just be cramps. Meanwhile, Travis Kelce had just 1 reception for a single yard. He saw just 1 target.    Before moving back to the Chargers, I need to mention a stupid decision by Andy Reid. For some reason, Reid called for a fake punt on a fourth-and-14 in his own territory in the second half. His defense was dominating, so to put them in a bad position was foolish. However, the stop unit forced a punt.    Melvin Gordon, who gained 79 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, played sparingly in the second half after getting knocked out with a knee injury. Gordon was bothered by his knee in practice, so this didn't come out of nowhere. The Chargers struggled enough to move the chains with Gordon, so they had no chance of doing so without him.    Travis Benjamin led the Chargers in receiving with 5 grabs for 105 yards, most of which actually occurred in meaningful action. Keenan Allen (5-61) was next in the box score. Meanwhile, Antonio Gates (2-30) dropped a pass on a third down, while Hunter Henry wasn't even targeted, which was perplexing.   "

   "comment":"Hunt. With a deficit and little offensive output for most of the game, Kansas City needed to pass the ball to try to make up ground, which usually means a bit more Charcandrick West than Hunt, but West suffered a possible concussion and wasn't available, so Hunt took over as the primary receiving back and caught 5-of-6 targets for 89 yards to help bring his team back. The rookie was stifled on the ground, but ran hard and should continue to be a strong performer moving forward. In the end, it was an untackle-able Bell and a heads-up play by Brown that led the scoring, but the Steelers' defense deserves a big chunk of the credit for this win. Roethlisberger was again not at his best, but was much better than last week and showed signs of his old self at times.    Smith played 1 of his worst games of the season, but still gave his team a chance to win. I don't think you can knock him and this team too far down the power rankings, as the Steelers have always played well at Arrowhead and were highly motivated after an embarrassing loss.    The Chiefs have a short turnaround, as they play the Raiders on Thursday night, which may make it tough for both "

   "comment":"Hunt looks like he has hit the rookie wall. The 6-4 Chiefs have to turn things around quickly to have any hopes of competing with the Steelers and Patriots in January. With the meaningless win, the 2-8 Giants could end up hurting their draft positioning, but as of right now, they remain in the third slot behind the Browns and 49ers.    With both offenses struggling, there were a few trick plays tried in this game. Giants converted a fake punt in the first half to pick up a first down near midfield. New York went to another gadget play near the end zone with Shane Vereen throwing a pass on a halfback option, but the ball was picked off by Kansas City safety Daniel Sorensen. The Chiefs gave it right back when they tried a shovel pass to Travis Kelce, which was deflected up in the air and then caught by Giants defensive tackle Snacks Harrison for an interception. That put New York at the Kansas City's 26. A pass interference on Marcus Peters in the end zone moved it to the 1-yard line and New York scored with Orleans Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a fourth-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, Tyreek Hill (7-68) made a leaping 38-yard catch over Janoris Jenkins to get the Chiefs into New York territory. Once again, the drive stalled, and Kansas City tied the game at 6 with another field goal. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Chiefs tried a trick play with Kelce throwing a deep ball for Demarcus Robinson, but the pass was easily intercepted by Landon Collins. Kansas City's defense bailed out the offense and got the ball back, but the Chiefs were put in a tough situation again as Smith overthrew Robinson and Jenkins intercepted the pass. Jenkins then returned the pick to the Chiefs' 23-yard line with just over 2 minutes remaining. New York hit a 26-yard field goal to go up 9-6 with 1:38 left. The Chiefs got into field-goal range with a 32-yard completion to Kelce that put them inside the New York 35-yard line. Smith threw some short passes and ran for a first down to get inside the 15, but shots at the end zone went incomplete, so Kansas City tied the game at 9 to force overtime. The Chiefs had a drive going in overtime, but ended up punting again. With less than 2 minutes remaining in the extra period, Roger Lewis (3-55) made an incredible catch on fourth down while sliding on the ground for 34 yards. That got the Giants to the Kansas City 2-yard line, and soon Aldrick Rosas drilled the 23-yard field goal for the win.    Smith was 27-of-40 for 230 yards with 2 interceptions. Hunt ran for 73 yards on 18 carries.    Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving with 8 catches for 109 yards. Surprisingly against Kelce, the Giants' defense ended their streak of 10 straight games of giving up a touchdown to a tight end.    "
