   "comment":"Norman is going to waste because they don't know how to use him. Good thing they didn't pay Kirk Cousins!    This game should absolutely have had a different outcome. Late in the 4.h quarter, the Redskins were driving in the red zone, and the team had a real chance to extend the lead. They were sporting a 23-20 advantage, and it looked like they were finally going to be able to put the game out of reach. Well, things changed pretty quickly. Kirk Cousins threw an absolutely horrific interception in the middle of the end zone that Barry Church grabbed. The Cowboys' penultimate drive began. They drove 80 yards over the course of 6 minutes and scored on a short Alfred Morris touchdown run. The Redskins could not strike back at the end of the game, as a Hail Mary sailed out of the end zone to finish the game.    For the Redskins, this game continued to raise questions about the ability of Kirk Cousins. Cousins' numbers do not look too bad. He went 28-of-46 on the day for 364 yards and a touchdown. However, he was guilty of many errors. Aside from the aforementioned interception he threw, Cousins was off on many passes. On 2 different occasions, he completely missed wide-open receivers for what would have been easy touchdowns. Both Jamison Crowder and DeSean Jackson had separated from the Dallas corners, but Cousins missed them each by a couple of yards. Cousins rectified the mistake later in the game on a long throw to Josh Doctson, but he still did not have his best throw on that ball either. He did not hit Doctson in stride, and that caused the rookie to slow down. Doctson, who is still recovering from an Achilles injury, was brought down by a defender later on the play, and the gain was a 57 yarder. However, a better throw could have resulted in a touchdown. The worst part is that this play came on the drive where Cousins threw the critical pick. A better throw really could have changed the outlook of the game. Cousins needs to improve in the future, or he may not get as big of a contract as he is hoping to get this offseason.    One bright spot in this game for the Redskins was their run game. After a tough opener against the Steelers, Matt Jones was able to get going. He carried the ball 13 times and totaled 61 yards during the contest. He looked explosive against the Cowboys' weak defensive line and had a couple of nice gains on the day. The team really needs him to improve as the roster does not really have any other viable ball-carriers.    In terms of the pass game, the Redskins were really able to spread the ball around. Ten different receivers caught passes for the team, and their 2 tight ends Jordan Reed (5-70) and Vernon Davis (5-51) were able to get going during the game. Reed looked particularly good for the team as he used his athleticism to constantly go up and catch balls over defenders. He should continue to be a TE1 in fantasy, and he could get even better as the season goes along.    The Cowboys' offense seemed to be operating in full swing in this game. Dak Prescott was razor sharp in just his second start of his career, going 22-of-30 on the day for the team. He threw for 292 yards, limited his mistakes, and was also able to use his mobility to his advantage. Prescott moved around the pocket a lot, finding spaces to complete passes. He also ran for a 6-yard touchdown early in the game. Prescott is definitely the quarterback of the future for the Cowboys, and the experience he is getting will help to accelerate his development.    The other notable rookie on the Dallas offense was Ezekiel Elliott. Elliott was good against the weak Washington run defense, registering 83 yards on 21 carries, but he had some issues with ball security. He lost a fumble early in the game, and on the team's final scoring drive, he fumbled again. Had Doug Free not been there to pounce on the ball, Elliott could have ended up in Jason Garrett's doghouse. Elliott needs to focus on improving this issue if he wants to develop into a top running back in this league.    Dez Bryant (7-102) led the Cowboys in receiving on the day. It was widely expected that Josh Norman would shadow Bryant after not doing so against Antonio Brown of the Steelers."

   "comment":"Norman dropped what appeared to be a pick-six. A field goal was missed prior to halftime, albeit from long range. The Redskins paid the price by allowing Cincinnati to hang around. The Bengals caught fire in the second half, and the difference proved to be Tyler Eifert. The talented tight end caught only 2 passes for 22 yards prior to intermission, but he came alive after the break, as Andy Dalton made it a point to throw to him on what seemed like every down. Eifert, who finally was 100 percent, provided the big boost that the Bengals' offense has desperately needed. Eifert caught 6 balls for 76 yards and a touchdown in the second half alone. With Eifert and A.J. Green dominating the Redskins' defense, it appeared as though the Bengals would pull away. They entered the red zone, up 3. but Dalton forced a poor throw while under pressure, and the ball sailed right to linebacker Will Compton. The Redskins were able to drive the field for a touchdown to take the lead, and the contest eventually went into overtime, the first extra session that British people have ever seen in person. Much like the last NFL overtime affair that everyone else witnessed on national TV, this contest came down to a short field goal, which was whiffed, as Dustin Hopkins was wide left from 34 yards. As a result, we've had a tie in consecutive weeks for the first time in nearly 2 decades.    It's pretty horrible to have to fly to London and just come away with a tie, but if there's a silver lining for the Bengals, it's that Eifert finally became a big part of the offense. Eifert caught 9 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. He's definitely back, and he'll help Cincinnati's offense immensely in the second half of the season.    Eifert's presence will undoubtedly be a boost for Dalton, who had a solid morning if some mistakes are ignored. Dalton finished 27-of-42 for 284 yards and a touchdown, but he was also guilty of a horrible interception that allowed the Redskins to crawl back into it. Dalton was lucky to get away with a couple of other picks, as Norman dropped a pair of passes. Dalton also lost a fumble on a third-down sneak late in overtime near midfield, negating a potential game-winning field goal for Cincinnati.    Only 3 Bengals caught more than 1 pass. In addition to Eifert, they were A.J. Green (9-121) and "

   "comment":"Norman, Zach Brown and Mason Foster were all off the field at various points. While 4 returned, the team could be in trouble if Kelley and Moses are hurt.    For the Rams, the result has to be disappointing. They came all the way back from 13 down to tie the game only to lose on Washington's final real offensive drive of the contest. Jared Goff had a fine performance that was certainly a regression from his Week 1 performance. Goff went 15-for-25 with 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. The pick was probably his worst throw of the game, and it came in the team's final drive of the contest. Goff looked directly at a short checkdown, allowing Mason Foster to jump the route. It essentially sealed the victory for the Redskins. Still, the California product looks a lot better in Sean McVay's offense than he did all of last season. Goff looked poised in the pocket and was confident in his arm. He was fairly accurate and his receivers when open. Goff did hold on to the ball too long at times, but he certainly has grown a lot since last year.    Goff's top receivers on Sunday were a couple of rookies. Cooper Kupp (3-33) saw the most targets with 6. and he was pretty good on the field. Kupp didn't put up big numbers, but he did well against Kendall Fuller, a tough slot corner. The other rookie was Gerald Everett (3-95). The tight end had a huge 69-yard reception that saw the Redskins got lost in coverage. Everett is worth monitoring thanks to his athleticism, but I wouldn't pick him up just yet. The other top receivers Sammy Watkins (2-30) and Tavon Austin (1-5) were largely non-factors. Watkins had to face Josh Norman though, so Watkins could bounce back next week.    "

His performance was very impressive, considering the blocking woes the Saints have endured, and he'll only get better once Terron Armstead and Zach Strief return.    Ginn may have missed out on the aforementioned potential touchdown, but he managed to score again later. Ginn (2-44), "

   "comment":"Norman to shadow Dallas' only viable receiver.    Morris, as mentioned, couldn't be stopped in the second half. It was tough sledding in the early going, as he gained just 38 yards on 12 carries, but his final stat line illustrated how much he dominated after intermission. Morris finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 27 attempts. Dallas' offensive line simply dominated as the game progressed, and the exhausted Redskins had no answers for Morris.    Washington's problems stopping the run was just 1 of many reasons the team suffered its season-ending loss. The team made what seemed like countless errors throughout the opening half to put itself in a 17-0 hole that it couldn't crawl out of. There were 4 crucial mistakes that crushed the Redskins. The first was an interception by Kirk Cousins that was on Jamison Crowder; the receiver had the ball bounce off his hands and into safety "
