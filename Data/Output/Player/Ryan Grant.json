   "comment":"Ryan Grant left the game with an ankle injury. Both Kolb and Grant are in danger of missing their Week 2 games.    Thanks in part to immense pressure in his face, Kolb was awful in the season opener, going just 5-of-10 for 24 yards before getting knocked out of the game. QB Dog Killer entered afterward, and caught an unprepared Packers defense off-guard by rushing for 103 yards on 11 carries. The Packers didn't prepare to defend QB Dog Killer going into the contest, so don't buy the deranged psychopath's performance.    With Kolb out or struggling, none of Philadelphia's receivers did much. DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin each had 4 catches for 30 and 38 yards, respectively, with Maclin scoring once. Brent Celek had 2 grabs for 32 yards.    With woeful downfield accuracy at his disposal, QB Dog Killer dumped off a bunch of passes to LeSean McCoy, who had 5 catches for 47 receiving yards. McCoy also had 35 rushing yards and a touchdown on 7 carries.    Aaron Rodgers went 19-of-31 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Rodgers was not his usual self; the Eagles did a great job of applying pressure on him, and it seldom looked like he was comfortable.    Greg Jennings (5-82) and Donald Driver (5-30) each caught a touchdown. Jermichael Finley had 4 grabs for 47 yards.    Ryan Grant ran really well early (8 carries, 45 yards), but as mentioned, he left the game with an ankle injury. "

Ser Stafford lobbed a touchdown to Young in the second quarter - only it wasn't ruled a score. The officials said that Young didn't get both feet inbounds when it was clear that he did. Jim Schwartz wanted to challenge, but didn't have any available. He was so enraged that he started throwing audio equipment. I can only imagine what the ref said when talking to Schwartz: Sorry Jim, I placed a large bet on Packers +6 this morning. I know it's a catch - I can see as much on the screen - but I need to buy my kids some late Christmas presents.    With the loss and Atlanta's win against the pathetic Buccaneers, the Lions will travel to the Superdome next week to battle the Saints. I'd say that we can only imagine what Brees will do to this Detroit secondary following Flynn's performance, but we've already seen that recently. Good luck, Detroit.   "

The throw was dropped, which gave Chicago a fumble recovery. Unfortunately for the Bears, they could do very little with it, mustering just a field goal.    Rodgers was great enough to overcome those errors. Though he blew a potential touchdown, he threw 3 more on 23-of-36 passing for 291 yards. He took 3 sacks despite the Bears missing top interior pass-rusher Henry Melton, so the offensive line continues to be a big concern.    All 3 of Rodgers' scores went to "

Cousins finished 25-of-43 for only 196 yards, which resulted in a 4.56 YPA that Brodie Croyle scoffed at while watching the game at home. Cousins also threw a touchdown and 2 interceptions. Both picks occurred late when Cousins finally began forcing the issue. The first was a late throw that Revis snatched, while the second was underthrown into double coverage. Don't blame Cousins for this loss, as he just didn't have a chance behind his anemic offensive line.    The Redskins once liked to run behind the left side of their offensive line. Considering everyone there is out, it's no surprise that "

   "comment":"Ryan Grant (4-61) will take his spot as a starter. Meanwhile, Crowder only caught 3 passes for 14 yards and wasn't able to get open much. He also fumbled a punt that led to Eagles points, so it was a forgettable day for him. If you can buy low on Crowder, now would be the time to do it.    The running game was not a strength for the Redskins. Rob Kelley totaled 30 yards on 10 carries. He looked a bit sluggish and not quite the bruiser that he was last year. Cousins totaled the same number of rushing yards on just 4 scrambles. "
