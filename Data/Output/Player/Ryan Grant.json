   "comment":"Ryan Grant fumble was returned for a score. In the second half, Rodgers suffered a shoulder injury. He sat out 2 drives, and was ineffective when he came back in. His replacement, rookie Grant fumble was returned for a score. In the second half, Rodgers suffered a shoulder injury. He sat out 2 drives, and was ineffective when he came back in. His replacement, rookie Matt Flynn, nearly threw a pick on his first throw. Flynn finished 2-of-5 for 6 yards.    With that in mind, we have to ask why the Packers didn't have a veteran backup quarterback in this situation. Flynn was completely shellshocked and unprepared to take the field. A veteran signal caller could have at least moved the chains and put Green Bay in favorable field position. Instead, the Packers were forced to punt after a 3.and-out, setting up Bryant's decisive kick.    Aaron Rodgers finished 14-of-27 for 165 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. One of the interceptions was the aforementioned Jackson gaff. Another came after Rodgers returned off his shoulder injury. Most of Rodgers' yardage went to Greg Jennings, who notched 6 catches, 109 yards and 2 scores.    Grant managed only 20 yards on 15 carries. He also fumbled and missed a wide-open cutback lane on a third-and-one on the opening drive of the third quarter. However, Grant actually looked healthy for the first time all year. I'd expect more from him against inferior defenses.    One guy who sucks against almost every defense is "

Ser Stafford lobbed a touchdown to Young in the second quarter - only it wasn't ruled a score. The officials said that Young didn't get both feet inbounds when it was clear that he did. Jim Schwartz wanted to challenge, but didn't have any available. He was so enraged that he started throwing audio equipment. I can only imagine what the ref said when talking to Schwartz: Sorry Jim, I placed a large bet on Packers +6 this morning. I know it's a catch - I can see as much on the screen - but I need to buy my kids some late Christmas presents.    With the loss and Atlanta's win against the pathetic Buccaneers, the Lions will travel to the Superdome next week to battle the Saints. I'd say that we can only imagine what Brees will do to this Detroit secondary following Flynn's performance, but we've already seen that recently. Good luck, Detroit.   "

   "comment":"Ryan Grant and Jordy Nelson.Grant and Jordy Nelson. Drops plagued the Packers in their loss to the Chiefs, and that issue festered once again. - Aaron Rodgers missed a wide-open Jennings for a touchdown on the opening drive. The Packers would have to settle for a field goal. - John Kuhn lost a fumble in Giants' territory during the second quarter. - Rodgers then lost a fumble of his own in New York territory on the opening drive of the third quarter. - Rodgers had a wide-open Finley on a third down with 13 minutes to go, but missed him. He was sacked on the following play, which turned the ball over on downs. - Grant fumbled the ball away down 10 in the 4.h quarter. Chase Blackburn returned it inside the Green Bay 5-yard line. Eli Manning threw the game-sealing touchdown on the very next play to give his team a 30-13 lead.    Another Packer gaffe was a Jennings' lost fumble on the second drive. It was initially ruled a fumble, but then the officials discussed it and said he was down by contact. Tom Coughlin challenged the play because it was pretty apparent that Jennings did in fact fumble. FOX announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were even speculating on where the ball would be spotted. However, official Bill Leavy ruled that Jennings was down and offered no explanation. The Packers maintained possession and would go on to score a touchdown on the drive. If you're not familiar with Leavy, he's the inept/crooked ref who botched/fixed the Steelers-Seahawks Super Bowl. I don't know how the hell he's still permitted to officiate playoff games. He needs to be fired because allowing him to work another game would be completely irresponsible. He's either bought or just completely awful at his job.    The Packers also screwed themselves defensively. They barely got any pressure on Manning, while their tackling efforts were atrocious. I don't have enough fingers to count how many tackles they missed. It really hurt them when Hakeem Nicks caught an intermediate pass and was able to elude several pitiful defenders to score a 66-yard touchdown. That wasn't even the craziest Nicks score. Manning launched a Hail Mary on the final play of the first half, and New York Nicks came down with it in the end zone. The Packers covered the Hail Mary very poorly - almost as if they had no idea it was coming. Nicks finished with 7 grabs for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns. Mario Manningham (3-31) also scored. Victor Cruz (5-74) was also a factor.    The quarterback throwing the ball to these guys was absolutely incredible. Manning went 21-of-33 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He had no pressure in his face, as mentioned, but what he did on third down was amazing. The Giants were 8-of-16 on third downs, thanks to his clutch throws.    On the other side, Rodgers had good numbers (26-of-46, 264 yards, 2 TDs, INT) despite all of those aforementioned drops. With a non-existent rushing attack, he picked up 66 yards on 7 scrambles, most of which came on third down.    One Packer who did not have any drops was "
