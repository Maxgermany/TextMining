   "comment":"Jackson. The rookie defensive back out of Alabama was a 4.h-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, but he has played much better than that status. Against the Panthers, he used his athletic ability to make a couple of nice returns on defense. He picked up a fumble and brought it to the house, and he also had a nice interception return. On that return, Jackson grabbed a tipped ball with a full head of steam, ran down the sideline, and juked Cam Newton for another touchdown."
