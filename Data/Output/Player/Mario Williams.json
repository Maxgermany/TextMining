   "comment":"Williams. The pass was a wounded duck and Texans cornerback Johnathan Joseph ran under the ball for the interception. That turnover produced the only touchdown of the first half.    Wide receiver Devon Bess led Miami with 2 catches for 42 yards. Brandon Marshall had 2 receptions for 39 yards.    In the third quarter, the Dolphins put a good drive together. Thomas was effective with some good runs. Miami capped the possession with Henne tossing a 12-yard touchdown to Marshall. With Miami grabbing the momentum in the third quarter, Thomas gave it back to the Texans when he fumbled the ball away at midfield. Even though the Texans didn't produce points on that possession, the fumble stalled the Miami offense that had Houston on its heels.    Miami was unable to produce any more points against Houston. The Texan defense finished the game well with a good pass rush and better run defense. For the game, Henne was 12-of-30 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Henne was inaccurate on his passing, and his blocking had issues keeping pressure off of him. Thomas had his first 100-yard rushing game of his career with 107 yards on 18 carries. Bush finished the game with just 18 yards on 6 carries. Marshall finished the game with 79 yards on 6 receptions and a score.    Texans quarterback Matt Schaub had a strong first half. He was 16-of-22 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown. Arian Foster was kept in check by the Miami defense with only 33 yards on 10 carries. Foster re-injured his hamstring and the Texans kept him on the sideline in the second half.    Houston moved the ball through the air with wide receiver Andre Johnson. He caught 5 passes for 63 yards in the first half. Owen Daniels had 3 receptions for 25 yards and a touchdown. Schaub connected with Daniels from 4 yards out for the only touchdown in the first half after Henne's interception. Schaub and the passing game helped move the ball to get 3 field goals in the first half.    Ben Tate had 4 carries for 21 yards in the first half, but with Foster sidelined, Tate had a big second half. He ran downhill and did a good job of picking up yards after contact. Tate totaled 103 yards on 23 carries. It was unclear when Foster could return to the lineup.    After dropping a potential touchdown pass, Johnson came back to catch a 23-yard touchdown strike from Schaub. The Texans established Tate in the second half, and Schaub's job was pretty easy. He only threw 7 passes after halftime. He finished the game with 21-of-29 passes for 230 yards and 2 scores.    Johnson paced Houston with 7 receptions for 93 yards and 1 touchdown. Daniels did not record a reception in the second half. Jacoby Jones was second on the team with 3 catches for 48 yards.    The Texan defense showcased some good rushes from Williams, rookie J."

It seems like Newton wants to be a pocket passer who rushes as a last resort, but Newton is just doing what opposing defensive coordinators want. If he doesn't use his legs, he's so much easier to defend. Newton finished 21-of-38 for 229 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception on a miscommunication. The numbers don't look that bad, but he missed a number of receivers downfield. He's just not the same quarterback who finished the 2012 campaign on a hot streak. He's struggling without former offensive coordinator, Rob Chudzinski. It wouldn't hurt if the Panthers found a No. 2 wideout for Newton. Ted Ginn caught a touchdown - a play that should've never happened because the Panthers were able to retain possession when Buffalo held on a 4th-and-18 - but he's not a reliable receiver. Steve Smith (5-52) is aging. Greg Olsen (7-84) is a quality intermediate option, but an upgrade is needed across from Smith.    Carolina also has to upgrade its offensive line. Mario Williams had a ridiculous afternoon in which he recorded an eye-popping 4.5 sacks. Middle linebacker "

This loss is potentially harmful for the Packers, but only if they don't win out (at Bucs, vs. Lions). Even if they maintain the No. 2 seed, they'll have to play the NFC Championship in Arizona, assuming the Cardinals even get there. The 1 issue is that Green Bay will have to battle the stronger winner of the wild-card round, assuming they handle their business at Tampa and against Detroit at Lambeau.    Rodgers' numbers, if you couldn't guess, were hideous. He went 17-of-42 for 185 yards and the 2 interceptions. Drops and miscues really hurt - especially Nelson's bobble on the potential 94-yard score, but Rodgers was inaccurate on many of his throws. He and the rest of his offense need a spark; being lazy in the second half Monday night really hurt the team.    "
