   "comment":"Mario Williams beat Bulaga's replacement on Green Bay's final drive, strip-sacking Rodgers in his own end zone for the game-ending safety. This loss is potentially harmful for the Packers, but only if they don't win out (at Bucs, vs. Lions). Even if they maintain the No. 2 seed, they'll have to play the NFC Championship in Arizona, assuming the Cardinals even get there. The 1 issue is that Green Bay will have to battle the stronger winner of the wild-card round, assuming they handle their business at Tampa and against Detroit at Lambeau.    Rodgers' numbers, if you couldn't guess, were hideous. He went 17-of-42 for 185 yards and the 2 interceptions. Drops and miscues really hurt - especially Nelson's bobble on the potential 94-yard score, but Rodgers was inaccurate on many of his throws. He and the rest of his offense need a spark; being lazy in the second half Monday night really hurt the team.    "
