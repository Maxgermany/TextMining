   "comment":"BenJarvus Green-Ellis as the clock was running out. This pissed me off immensely, since San Diego +7 was my biggest play of the weekend.    Excluding San Diego's miscues deep in New England territory, this game was played pretty evenly, with the Patriots barely outgaining the Chargers, 504-470. Both quarterbacks were unstoppable (aside from Rivers' interceptions, of course). Brady went 31-of-40 for 423 yards and 3 touchdowns, while Rivers was 29-of-40 for 378 yards, 2 scores and the picks.    Three Patriot players caught at least 7 passes. Deion Branch (129 yards) paced the team with 8 receptions, 2 of which came at the very end of the first half when Brady inexplicably led his team into scoring territory despite having less than 10 seconds to work with following 1 of Rivers' interceptions. The other 2 targets were Aaron Hernandez (7-62, TD) and Wes Welker (7-81). Hernandez was spotted limping after the game. His status is unknown. Meanwhile, Rob Gronkowski (4-86) caught 2 touchdowns. Chad Ochocinco (2-45) once again was silent.    I was happy to see impressive rookie running back Stevan Ridley get 2 carries; he gained 9 yards. BenJarvus Green-Ellis (17-70, TD) saw most of the workload though.    Speaking of running backs, it's time for "

   "comment":"BenJarvus Green-Ellis as the clock was running out. This pissed me off immensely, since San Diego +7 was my biggest play of the weekend.    Excluding San Diego's miscues deep in New England territory, this game was played pretty evenly, with the Patriots barely outgaining the Chargers, 504-470. Both quarterbacks were unstoppable (aside from Rivers' interceptions, of course). Brady went 31-of-40 for 423 yards and 3 touchdowns, while Rivers was 29-of-40 for 378 yards, 2 scores and the picks.    Three Patriot players caught at least 7 passes. Deion Branch (129 yards) paced the team with 8 receptions, 2 of which came at the very end of the first half when Brady inexplicably led his team into scoring territory despite having less than 10 seconds to work with following 1 of Rivers' interceptions. The other 2 targets were Aaron Hernandez (7-62, TD) and Wes Welker (7-81). Hernandez was spotted limping after the game. His status is unknown. Meanwhile, Rob Gronkowski (4-86) caught 2 touchdowns. Chad Ochocinco (2-45) once again was silent.    I was happy to see impressive rookie running back Stevan Ridley get 2 carries; he gained 9 yards. BenJarvus Green-Ellis (17-70, TD) saw most of the workload though.    Speaking of running backs, it's time for "

   "comment":"BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Bernard. The 2 backs had 16-62 and 10-45 lines, respectively. Bernard, who also had 4 catches for 41 receiving yards, aggravated his rib injury in the second quarter, but was able to gut it out.    The Browns, meanwhile, couldn't run very well, which really hurt them in the second-half monsoon conditions. Ogbonnaya broke a 43-yard run in the first quarter, but he finished with just 26 yards on his other 7 carries. "

I mentioned earlier that the Steelers outplayed the Bengals in every facet. This includes special teams. In the first quarter, the Bengals botched a punt as the wind blew away a snap heading toward Huber, who picked up the ball and was tackled at his own 1-yard line. Later on, Brown returned a punt for a touchdown. Huber suffered a crushing hit after that, so he had to leave the game with a jaw injury. Kicker "
