   "comment":"Green-Ellis runs, including a 1-yard plunge for a touchdown, changed that in a hurry to make it 14-10 New England. The Black Hole was not in panic mode though. Darrius Heyward-Bey picked up 28 yards on a reception, and the return of Jacoby Ford was felt with a trick play run good for 30 yards. The drive ended on an interception I can't even describe. Announcer Solomon Wilcots assumed Campbell was trying to throw the ball away with no Raiders in the vicinity at the New England 6-yard line on second down and goal. I surmised he just delivered it directly to Patrick Chung, who caught it easily even with a hand in a cast. The Patriots drove for a field goal to make it 17-10 at the halftime gun. Wasted yardage, 75 on that drive, was a theme for the Raiders, who piled up 504 while never realistically having a shot to win down the stretch. If it feels like I am jumping ahead ,it is because the Patriots moved the ball at will in this game when they needed to. Welker's receiving and the hard running of rookie Stevan Ridley were unstoppable. Ridley capped the first drive of the second half with a touchdown run from 33 yards out. Oakland did answer with a drive for a field goal, but it took 7:34 to get it done. An offense built to wear teams down running the ball is not going to beat an offense run by Tom Brady with long marches for 3 points. Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the 4.h quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown. The 31-19 final was secured when Campbell failed to find Chaz Schilens on the 2.point attempt.    The summary here is that New England got enough protection for Brady, thanks to the running of Ridley and Green-Ellis, who combined for 172 yards on 26 carries. Welker was the only receiver targeted, but it didn't matter because the defense couldn't stop him. As expected, Bill Belichick did not allow McFadden to beat him. He did total 123 yards on 18 touches, but 67 of that came on 2 plays and he failed to score. This is a good, not great Raider team ,and to no 1.s surprise, the Patriots were not excited about losing consecutive games.   "

   "comment":"Green-Ellis burst - a sure sign that a defense has thrown in the towel. Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage. It also must be mentioned that Dalton was able to convert 9-of-15 third downs.    Two of Dalton's scores went to "

He ripped off big gains and broke numerous tackles. In fact, his numbers would have been much better had a long run of his wasn't negated by a hold. There were 4 reasons why San Diego lost its 8. game of the year. Being unable to tackle Green-Ellis was 1. The poor passing game was the second. "

Green Bay, meanwhile, saw Rodgers toss 2 picks in addition to the pair of aforementioned fumbles.    Each squad had 4 give-aways, but the Packers were better overall. They outgained Cincinnati, 399-297. The Bengals were helpless to stop the Green Bay ground attack - which makes it ironic that 1 of the Packer running backs was mostly responsible for this defeat.    Rodgers had a rough afternoon - 26-of-43, 244 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks - as the Bengals' defensive line was in his face the entire contest. Cincinnati also batted down what seemed like 100 passes. Rodgers was so frustrated that he and Mike McCarthy had an angry exchange of words on the sideline following a botched red-zone attempt. It seemed as though Rodgers was pissed because McCarthy opted to kick a field goal on a 4.h-and-goal opportunity inside the 1-yard line.    Rodgers' lone score went to James Jones (4-34). He produced fewer yardage than the other 2 receivers; Randall Cobb (5-54) was OK, but Jordy Nelson (8-93) made a spectacular, acrobatic catch where he tip-toed the sideline. This prompted the play-by-play announcer to exclaim, He catches everything! As for Jermichael Finley, he didn't catch a single pass because he was was knocked out in the first quarter because of a concussion.    Dalton had just 8 incompletions, going 20-of-28 for 235 yards, a pair of touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned turnovers. It helped his cause that Clay Matthews was knocked out of the game with an injury. Fortunately for the Packers, Matthews is expected to play next week. Dalton's scores went to A.J. Green (4-46) and Marvin Jones (3-38). Green's production all came after intermission, as he didn't do anything in the first half. Mohamed Sanu (4-68) led the team in receiving.    Marvin Lewis needs to start making Giovani Bernard his featured back. The good news is that Bernard an Green-Ellis had an equal amount of carries (10). Bernard outgained Green-Ellis, 50-29. Both scored. As mentioned, Green-Ellis was guilty of a fumble returned for a touchdown, while Bernard made 4 catches for 49 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Green-Ellis was strip-sixed. Cincinnati lost 3 fumbles, including the Law Firm's cough-up. Andy Dalton, who was guilty of 1 of those lost balls, was also intercepted on a bad decision. Green Bay, meanwhile, saw Rodgers toss 2 picks in addition to the pair of aforementioned fumbles.    Each squad had 4 give-aways, but the Packers were better overall. They outgained Cincinnati, 399-297. The Bengals were helpless to stop the Green Bay ground attack - which makes it ironic that 1 of the Packer running backs was mostly responsible for this defeat.    Rodgers had a rough afternoon - 26-of-43, 244 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks - as the Bengals' defensive line was in his face the entire contest. Cincinnati also batted down what seemed like 100 passes. Rodgers was so frustrated that he and Mike McCarthy had an angry exchange of words on the sideline following a botched red-zone attempt. It seemed as though Rodgers was pissed because McCarthy opted to kick a field goal on a 4.h-and-goal opportunity inside the 1-yard line.    Rodgers' lone score went to James Jones (4-34). He produced fewer yardage than the other 2 receivers; Randall Cobb (5-54) was OK, but Jordy Nelson (8-93) made a spectacular, acrobatic catch where he tip-toed the sideline. This prompted the play-by-play announcer to exclaim, He catches everything! As for Jermichael Finley, he didn't catch a single pass because he was was knocked out in the first quarter because of a concussion.    Dalton had just 8 incompletions, going 20-of-28 for 235 yards, a pair of touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned turnovers. It helped his cause that Clay Matthews was knocked out of the game with an injury. Fortunately for the Packers, Matthews is expected to play next week. Dalton's scores went to A.J. Green (4-46) and Marvin Jones (3-38). Green's production all came after intermission, as he didn't do anything in the first half. Mohamed Sanu (4-68) led the team in receiving.    Marvin Lewis needs to start making Giovani Bernard his featured back. The good news is that Bernard an Green-Ellis had an equal amount of carries (10). Bernard outgained Green-Ellis, 50-29. Both scored. As mentioned, Green-Ellis was guilty of a fumble returned for a touchdown, while Bernard made 4 catches for 49 receiving yards.   "

However, the Jets were down big at that point and Smith was just truing to make something happen. I'm not trying to imply that he played well, but he wasn't awful either. Smith finished 20-of-30 for 159 yards and the 2 interceptions. Oddly enough, Smith had fewer rushing yards (8 yards on 2 scrambles) than backup "

This includes special teams. In the first quarter, the Bengals botched a punt as the wind blew away a snap heading toward Huber, who picked up the ball and was tackled at his own 1-yard line. Later on, Brown returned a punt for a touchdown. Huber suffered a crushing hit after that, so he had to leave the game with a jaw injury. Kicker "

He followed that up with an attempted deep shot that just died in the air and was consequently picked off. While the Vikings were screwing up offensively, the Bengals were doing whatever they wanted to whenever they had the ball. Minnesota's awful secondary offered no resistance, allowing Andy Dalton to complete 27-of-38 attempts for 366 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Vikings looked completely helpless trying to cover A.J. Green, who scored twice while snatching 7 balls for 97 yards. Dalton's other scores went to Mohamed Sanu (4-35) and Jermaine Gresham (3-49), who lost a fumble at midfield in the opening quarter. Marvin Jones also had a big game with 6 catches for 85 yards.    As mentioned, Green-Ellis scored, but he didn't have a successful outing otherwise, mustering only 24 yards on 12 carries. "
