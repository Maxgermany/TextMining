All kidding aside, Orton began the game 6-of-6 for 62 yards, which probably had Bears fans excited that they finally found a franchise quarterback. Well, since accumulating those initial figures, Orton finished 13-of-26 and 87 yards. Orton was responsible for an intentional-grounding penalty late in the contest, which forced the Bears into a punt.    "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning a short, 20-yard field to work with. After Manning's decisive score to Reggie Wayne, Rosenchoker threw a pick in Indianapolis territory, icing the game for the 4.leaf-clover-carrying Colts. I've been picking games on this Web site since 1999. Rosenchoker's choke job has to be 1 of the top 5 worst beats I've had this past decade. Like I said... roof, razor, noose or crappy FOX reality show. I'm not sure which is least painful.    Andre Johnson had a great game, considering how much of a loser Rosenchoker is. Johnson caught 9 balls for 131 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Steve Slaton ran all over the Bob Sanders-less Colts, gaining 93 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries. I have to wonder why Slaton didn't get the ball late in the 4.h quarter. Calling for multiple Rosenchoker carries is 1 of many gaffs Gary Kubiak has been guilty of this season.    So, did I mention the Colts were lucky? Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne put up solid stats, though most of that came once Rosenchoker went into meltdown mode. Manning was 25-of-34, 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Reggie Wayne had 7 receptions, 97 yards and the winning score.    Indianapolis' defense couldn't stop the Texans in the first 56 minutes of the game. I already gave you Slaton and Johnson's numbers; the Colts also were guilty of holding on a third-and-17, which gave Houston a first down. This was pre-Rosenchoker meltdown; otherwise, Rosenchoker would have just handed the ball to Brackett again.   "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning. I told him that I didn't know and noted that Manning was playing like a drunk. It didn't even look like Manning knew what happened either. During the post-game press conference, Manning scratched his head and said that his team really struggled on third downs. Indianapolis was 8-of-19 on third downs, so maybe Manning was drunk after all. The really odd thing is that despite the 18 points, Manning was 31-of-48 for 347 yards. It's almost as if there was some sort of black hole vortex in the middle of the field that prevented the Colts from moving the chains past the 50.    Manning didn't throw a touchdown because "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning. Matt Schaub tossed a first-quarter interception into triple coverage. Ryan Moats lost a fumble on Indianapolis' 1-yard line. And of course, there was the missed kick. Houston is now 0-8 at Indianapolis, but they could have easily won this game. The players shouldn't hang their heads at all.    Aside from that bad pick, Schaub played pretty well, finishing 32-of-43 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (the second pick wasn't his fault).    Schaub found Andre Johnson 10 times. The athletic receiver turned those receptions into 103 yards.    Without Owen Daniels, Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, "

I'll never forget that Sage Rosencopter game last year where Houston blew a huge lead with 5 minutes to go. The Texans always choke, and Manning always pulls through. I had to resort to praying that Houston would hold on and cover to preserve my half unit. My prayers were not answered.    Schaub was really hot at the beginning of the game, but fizzled out, finishing 31-of-42 for 284 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions and a big lost fumble. His second score and some of his yardage came in junk time when the Texans fell behind 35-20.    "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning can't score on a long field. Haley attempted another ballsy move later in the first quarter. He went for it on 4th-and-2 inside Indianapolis' 5-yard line, but didn't get it. This move would really prove to be costly later; had the Chiefs kicked the field goal there, they could have went for it at the end of the game instead of asking Succop to try a 51-yarder.    You have to admire Kansas City's effort, so it's a shame that the team is really limited by Matt Cassel. Cassel went 16-of-29 for 156 yards. That doesn't look too bad, but he was awful in the red zone and had 7 straight incompletions in the second half. To be fair, Dwayne Bowe dropped a touchdown.    The Chiefs ran the ball well, which shouldn't be a surprise when you notice that Jamaal Charles had double the carries (16) compared to Thomas Jones. Charles had 87 rushing yards; Jones had just 19. Peyton Manning looked bored on sidelines as Chiefs ate up the clock on an 8-minute drive in the first quarter, but Kansas City couldn't convert in the red zone because of Cassel's struggles.    The Colts racked up 341 total yards of offense, but had just 19 points because they uncharacteristically struggled in the red zone.    Manning went 26-of-44 for 244 yards and an interception. Four Colts had at least 5 receptions: "

The Patriots won this game because they didn't make any mistakes. They took only 1 sack, and committed no turnovers and only 1 penalty. Indianapolis, meanwhile, had 3 give-aways (3 Manning interceptions) and were whistled for 6 infractions.    Brady went 19-of-25 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns. Box score analysts will assume that he wasn't all that great, but Brady was terrific. The Colts had no answer for him, as Brady dissected their defense to near perfection.

   "comment":"Peyton Manning tossing interceptions against the Chargers. He's never fared well against them throughout his career. But to heave 4 picks against the Cowboys, including a game-clinching interception in overtime? I watched this game, and I still can't believe it. Manning, who went 36-of-48 for 365 yards, 2 touchdowns and 4 picks, now has 11 interceptions (included 4 pick-sixes) the past 3 weeks. It's hard to blame Manning though. His supporting cast is pretty abysmal right now. The offensive line stinks. Dallas Clark, Joseph Addai and Austin Collie are all out. "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning is back. Not the predicted shell of his former self, but the real Peyton. He was out of football for about 600 days, but he looked as sharp as ever against the Steelers, particularly in the second half. Manning went 19-of-26 for 253 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was simply average on his first 3 drives when he was getting in calls from the sideline, but the Broncos opted to go with a no-huddle approach beginning on the 4.h drive. It was at that point that Manning became absolutely lethal. Here's the disparity: First 3 drives: 4-of-7, 44 yards, 0 touchdowns, 2 sacks. Fourth drive and on: 15-of-19, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns, 0 sacks. The scary thing about Manning's no-huddle approach is that opposing defenders will be sucking for air in Denver's thin atmosphere. The Steelers looked winded in the second half.    Manning's scores went to "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning didn't cover as a home underdog since his rookie year. Hmm... </i>    This was the second straight week the Broncos didn't play a complete game. They had another comeback come up short after struggling for 3 quarters. Houston built up a big lead and Denver ran out of time after getting hot in the 4.h quarter. The Texans' offense and defense completely outexecuted the Broncos for the majority of 3 quarters. Houston mixed in some good runs and big plays through the air with a stifling defense that did a good job of getting off the field.    Denver struck first in the opening minutes with a safety on a sack by Elvis Dumervil. The Broncos then added a field goal before the Texans dominated until the 4.h. Houston took the lead with a long 60-yard touchdown pass to Andre Johnson after he torched Tracy Porter. Arian Foster then finished off a 97-yard drive with a 3.yard touchdown reception. He ran well, totaling 105 yards on 25 carries to go with his touchdown catch. Schaub lit up the Broncos a bit later for a 52-yard touchdown by dropping in a ball to Kevin Walter (3-73) on a deep post. The signal-caller also burned Porter on the route.    Schaub had to leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting nuked by 2 defenders. The helmet-to-helmet hit from Joe Mays will probably result in a fine. Schaub had a good gain to Lestar Jean of 46 yards after he made a leaping catch and exploded down the sideline. That set up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Schaub to Owen Daniels. Johnson (2-72) made a huge 12-yard reception late in the 4.h quarter to get a first down on a critical third down with the Broncos attempting a comeback. Schaub finished the game 17-of-30 for 290 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception.    The Denver offense would flash a nice gain or 2 during the first 3 quarters, but couldn't sustain drives or put the ball in the end zone. The Texans' defense was playing really well, led by J.J. Watt, who was having another great game with 2.5 sacks.    The Broncos' scoring unit finally came to life in the 4.h quarter, but it was the defense that lit the fire under the team. The Houston offense was driving to put the game away, but Ben Tate (8-26) fumbled the ball away after a hit by Denver defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson. Peyton Manning made them pay 2 plays later with a 38-yard touchdown toss to Brandon Stokley, who got open running down the middle seam."

   "comment":"Peyton Manning didn't cover as a home underdog since his rookie year. Hmm... </i>    This was the second straight week the Broncos didn't play a complete game. They had another comeback come up short after struggling for 3 quarters. Houston built up a big lead and Denver ran out of time after getting hot in the 4.h quarter. The Texans' offense and defense completely outexecuted the Broncos for the majority of 3 quarters. Houston mixed in some good runs and big plays through the air with a stifling defense that did a good job of getting off the field.    Denver struck first in the opening minutes with a safety on a sack by Elvis Dumervil. The Broncos then added a field goal before the Texans dominated until the 4.h. Houston took the lead with a long 60-yard touchdown pass to Andre Johnson after he torched Tracy Porter. Arian Foster then finished off a 97-yard drive with a 3.yard touchdown reception. He ran well, totaling 105 yards on 25 carries to go with his touchdown catch. Schaub lit up the Broncos a bit later for a 52-yard touchdown by dropping in a ball to Kevin Walter (3-73) on a deep post. The signal-caller also burned Porter on the route.    Schaub had to leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting nuked by 2 defenders. The helmet-to-helmet hit from Joe Mays will probably result in a fine. Schaub had a good gain to Lestar Jean of 46 yards after he made a leaping catch and exploded down the sideline. That set up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Schaub to Owen Daniels. Johnson (2-72) made a huge 12-yard reception late in the 4.h quarter to get a first down on a critical third down with the Broncos attempting a comeback. Schaub finished the game 17-of-30 for 290 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception.    The Denver offense would flash a nice gain or 2 during the first 3 quarters, but couldn't sustain drives or put the ball in the end zone. The Texans' defense was playing really well, led by J.J. Watt, who was having another great game with 2.5 sacks.    The Broncos' scoring unit finally came to life in the 4.h quarter, but it was the defense that lit the fire under the team. The Houston offense was driving to put the game away, but Ben Tate (8-26) fumbled the ball away after a hit by Denver defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson. Peyton Manning made them pay 2 plays later with a 38-yard touchdown toss to Brandon Stokley, who got open running down the middle seam."

The Bengals were apparently dead wrong. Manning was pretty much flawless, going 27-of-35 for 291 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The picks were his first since the opening half of Week 6.

   "comment":"Peyton Manning shaved points because he was the only 1 in his family pool to take Jacksonville +26.5. How else do you explain the Jaguars losing to the Rams and Broncos by about the same margin?    The Jaguars dropped to 0-6, but at least they played the Broncos tough and didn't get embarrassed. Denver didn't have its best game; the team played like it was looking past Jacksonville to the Colts next week. Still, the talent gap between these 2 teams is so great that Denver (6-0) won while sleepwalking at times. Knowshon Moreno (15-42 rushing, 7-62 receiving) ran for 3 touchdowns to lead the Broncos' offense. The Jaguars attemped a fake punt early in the game, but it was stuffed for no gain. That gave Denver great field position, and some nice gains by Moreno set up a short touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Julius Thomas (4-22)."

   "comment":"Peyton Manning to do the same thing to his former team, especially in the wake of Jim Irsay's questionable comments during the week. However, the Indianapolis crowd was much more respectful for Manning, giving him a standing ovation for a solid minute. Perhaps that quelled Manning's anger a bit because he was a huge disappointment in his failed revenge attempt. Manning's numbers don't show it - 29-of-49 for 386 yards, 3 touchdown, 1 interception - but he sucked in this contest. His arm strength had been questioned throughout the start of this season, but the ball really fluttered out of his hand on many occasions. When the game was 36-17, Manning's numbers were a meager 16-of-28 for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he easily could've had several passes intercepted. He finally did throw a pick, as his arm was hit as he threw a pass in the middle of the 4.h quarter. He similarly had a lost fumble for a safety much earlier. Manning eventually got into a groove and compiled junk yardage (and 16 points) against a prevent Indianapolis defense, but still had issues dealing with the Colts' pressure. He was sacked 4 times (twice by "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning took a hit to the knee near the end of this game. He was limping, but managed to stay on the field to perform some kneel-downs. However, he'll have an MRI on his knee Monday. I would find it amusing if Manning misses next week's game, only because it would add Brock Osweiler to the list of crappy quarterbacks the Chiefs have played this season.    The Chargers are significantly improved this season, but they aren't ready to knock off 1 of the big boys of the AFC West. Denver held on for a road win to set up a huge game with homefield playoff implications next week with the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs. In full disclosure, the first 13 minutes of the first quarter wasn't available because of the Cincinnati-Baltimore game going to overtime. In that stretch, Peyton Manning threw a short pass to Julius Thomas (3-96), who exploded down the sideline for a 74-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Peyton Manning XIV had so many crazy twists and turns, I don't even know where to begin. I don't think anyone even expected for this to have such a thrilling finish considering how terrible New England looked in the first half. The team trailed 24-0 at intermission, and it appeared as though Denver would easily run away with a victory. The Patriots didn't look like themselves in the first half. They killed themselves with so many mistakes. Here's the rundown: - Stevan Ridley lost a fumble in the first quarter that was returned for a touchdown. Ridley (4-14), who has chronic fumbling woes, wasn't seen or heard from ever again. - Tom Brady lost a fumble when Von Miller beat Nate Solder and forced a strip-sack. Miller had 2 sacks and that forced fumble. Brady bobbled the ball a bit again later, but was lucky enough to have it bounce right back into his hands. - LeGarrette Blount, getting first crack at the running back duties after Ridley was benched, also lost a fumble. He gained 13 yards on his 2 carries. Brandon Bolden (13-58, TD) took over permanently after that. - Danny Amendola (3-17) fell down on a third-and-5 to ruin a potential first-down conversion at the end of the first quarter. - Shane Vereen (8 catches, 60 yards) dropped a catch on what would've been a 25-yard gain. - Neither the play clock nor the game clock were working at 1 point in the opening half. This didn't have anything to do with the Patriots, obviously, but that's what sort of contest this was. Nothing was going right, and the Broncos were doing a great job of capitalizing. They were running the ball so well with Knowshon Moreno (37 carries, 224 yards, touchdown) that it seemed like the Broncos would win this matchup in a blowout. However, the game completely flipped after the break, and Denver began making all of the mistakes. This includes... - A number of injuries. The Broncos lost Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and some other defenders. Rodgers-Cromartie, who got hurt on a Hail Mary attempt at the end of the first half, was really missed on the field. Consider Brady's numbers prior to DRC's injury (10-of-17, 81 yards) to what he posted afterward (24-of-33, 263 yards, 3 TDs). - Montee Ball (7-40) lost a fumble. As with Ridley, he disappeared. The Broncos used undrafted rookie C.J. Anderson instead. Anderson (3-16) looked good until bobbling a handoff in overtime. - Like Brady, Peyton Manning lost the ball but had it ricochet off the ground and back into his hands. However, Manning was also intercepted. Both quarterbacks actually got away with picks. Manning's potential second interception was wiped out because of a defensive hold, while Brady's was dropped by "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning proved that he can play in freezing weather. Manning, entering this contest with a 3-7 record in games in which the temperature is 34 degrees or colder, seemed determined to silence all doubters. He apparently succeeded, going 39-of-59 for 397 yards and 4 touchdowns. Throughout the game, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms offered snobbish remarks, berating those who doubted Manning's ability win in frigid conditions. This will go against public opinion, but Manning didn't prove anything, as far as I'm concerned. The Titans are a poor team playing their third-consecutive game on the road. They looked extremely fatigued in the second half, as they were gasping for air in Denver's high-altitude environment. Plus, Manning, despite the impressive stats, lobbed up some ugly ducks in this contest. He was also nearly intercepted by "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning seemed to prove that he could win in cold weather when he was victorious last week, but a win over a horrible Tennessee team playing its third-consecutive road game in altitude was hardly impressive. The temperature was near-freezing in this contest, and yet Manning was much worse. His final numbers don't look bad - I'll get to those in a bit - but he was just 11-of-19 for only 137 yards with a couple of minutes remaining in the third quarter. Those are his true stats; everything he did after that could be considered garbage time, as San Diego suddenly went into a prevent. It must be noted that Manning didn't have Wes Welker at his disposal, but that's no excuse. He was still able to throw to "

I never thought I'd be typing that after his brilliant first half - 16-of-22, 199 yards, 3 touchdowns - but he struggled to complete routine passes after the break. Manning was just 6-of-14 for 70 yards in the second half. He did endure a couple of drops, but he had receivers open and couldn't hit them. This includes a pair of major overthrows to his targets when he was trying to run out the clock near the end of regulation. I have no explanation for what happened. Manning was battling a defense mostly devoid of talent. He was so sharp prior to intermission, so I don't know why he looked like "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning. However, a few back-breaking mistakes did them in. A holding penalty negated a big gain in the third quarter. Another infraction in the red zone and a missed field goal by Cairo Santos (nice job cutting Ryan Succop) turned a 10-minute third-quarter drive into nothing. Meanwhile, allowing Montee Ball to gain 23 yards on a second-and-30 in the second half robbed the team from another possession. Smith was also strip-sacked near the end of the game, but the officials made a curious call by ruling it an incompletion.    Excluding Davis, 3 Chiefs tied for the team lead with 6 targets. They were Travis Kelce (4-81), Donnie Avery (3-14) and Dwayne Bowe (3-40), who didn't do much in his 2014 debut.    The Broncos are 2-0, but there's something off with their offense. They just can't put teams away. It looked like the Broncos would when Peyton Manning hurled a 48-yard bomb to Emmanuel Sanders early on, but they just couldn't convert third downs, moving the sticks on just 3 of 8 tries."

   "comment":"Peyton Manning was never intercepted, but he was. Eric Weddle impressively snatched the ball in the end zone with 1 hand, thwarting a Denver drive. However, a flag came out after the pick, and McAulay announced that prior to the pass there was holding. Once again, Nantz, Simms and Carey were all miffed by the call. There was barely any contact, and it was within 5 yards anyway, so there shouldn't have been any sort of infraction. And if the penalty occurred prior to the pass, why was the flag thrown after the actual interception? Once again, the Broncos took advantage, scoring a touchdown. 3. Emmanuel Sanders, who had a brilliant game, committed his sole blunder when he fumbled in his own territory. The Chargers appeared to have recovered the ball, but it bounced around and fell into Wes Welker's arms. That was a chance for San Diego to get back into the game, down 14 at that point, but the Broncos maintained possession, bled the clock and pulled through with the spread-covering victory.    The Broncos were very lucky in this game, but they didn't need all of that great fortune to prevail. They were the better team on the field, outgaining San Diego by 119 net yards and averaging 1.2 more yards per play. The Chargers were competitive for a while, but Denver ultimately ran away with this victory in the second half. San Diego simply couldn't do anything about Peyton Manning. The NFL's career touchdown record-holder was an unstoppable force, going 25-of-35 for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had that 1 interception that should've stood, but was otherwise flawless. He simply took advantage of a secondary that was missing its top 2 cornerbacks. Brandon Flowers was out with a concussion, while "

Then again, maybe I'd keep making the same error, given that the Chiefs just cost me 7 units and my first Pick of the Month loss in 2 years. Three things allowed Denver to prevail: 1.

   "comment":"Peyton Manning had yet another epic playoff choke job, as he spent the entire contest overthrowing players and heaving weak-armed throws. No 1 in the media wanted to mention it because they feared offending Manning, but the future Hall of Fame quarterback had a decaying arm down the stretch, beginning with the second half of the Kansas City contest. There was talk that Manning was healthier during the week, but that didn't appear to be the case at all.    I'd like to focus on Luck though, as he is the more significant quarterback in the NFL at this point. Luck, unlike Manning, has proven to be extremely clutch in his young career. He has made so many 4.h-quarter comebacks early on, and that type of play has transitioned to the playoffs. He was so sharp in this contest, beating the quarterback he displaced as the starter of the Colts. Luck finished 27-of-43 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The picks were both like punts on third-and-long situations where Luck just tried desperately to make something happen. He also had a 20-yard scramble. Some of Luck's best passes came on third downs. He fired a ball to Donte Moncrief on a third-and-6 through a tight window, and then floated a perfect pass to Coby Fleener for a gain of 32 on a third-and-16. Another key conversion was when Luck hit T.Y. Hilton on 1 of the few plays in which he had pressure in his face on a third-and-9.    Luck's leading receiver was Hilton (4-72), the only Colt with more than 50 receiving yards. Luck spread the ball around, as Fleener (3-49), Moncrief (2-32), Dan Herron (8-32), Dwayne Allen (4-30, TD) and Hakeem Nicks (2-24, TD) all contributed.    The Colts, who didn't even activate Trent Richardson, barely ran in the first half. Luck had 24 attempts compared to 11 rushes by Dan Herron (23-63, TD) by intermission. However, Indianapolis was able to move the chains on the ground when it absolutely needed to. The team controlled the clock for 8 minutes on a 4.h-quarter drive, setting up a field goal that put the team up 2 possessions, effectively sealing the victory.    It's not like Manning could even score once, so the final field goal may have been irrelevant. Manning's numbers were 26-of-46 for only 211 yards and a touchdown. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack. Manning's stats don't look terrible, but some of his completions occurred in garbage time, so that enhanced his yardage and already-hideous YPA (4.59). He was also nearly picked a couple of times, as the crowd frequently booed him throughout the second half. Perhaps Manning will get healthy next year, but he looked done as an elite quarterback late in the season, though I'm sure he would've found some way to lose in the playoffs even if he were 100 percent.    Manning wasn't the only Bronco who struggled. "

   "comment":"Peyton Manning will, of course, be in the Hall of Fame 5 years after he retires. It's now very fair to wonder if that will be in 2020. Manning looks done, so this could very well be his final year in the NFL. It was almost painful to watch Manning in this game. He had zero zip on his passes, and he resembled a wounded animal that needed to be put out of its misery. In fact, Manning was extremely close to having 1 of the worst starts of his career. That may sound strange to anyone who didn't watch this game, given that he went 26-of-45 for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but those numbers are very deceiving. Manning's pick, which was returned for a score, was an inaccurate throw. That would've been fine if that was his only blemish, as the box score indicates, but he was so much worse than that. Manning nearly tossed a pick-six on the ensuing drive on a dead-armed throw. Right after that, he underthrew what seemed like a potential touchdown to "

Manning made several great throws in this contest, but he still looked like a shell of his former self despite battling a defense that had been inept in the first 2 weeks of the season. Manning once again barely had any zip on his passes, and he looked slower and more sluggish than he has in the past. His receivers came up with some clutch receptions to bail him out, most of which came over poor "

The media was quick to jump back on the Manning bandwagon after he finally put together a quality outing last week, ignoring his interceptions and many dead ducks. It was more of the same from Manning in this contest, as he struggled to move the chains for most of the afternoon. He put together some strong drives in the second half, but it wasn't nearly enough, as Indianapolis' mastery over Denver continued. Manning finished 21-of-36 for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The first half was very ugly, as the Broncos were shut out, save for an inexplicable punt return as time expired. Manning was just 9-of-22 for 80 yards and an ugly interception on a high pass prior to intermission, as he constantly sailed horrible passes wide of the mark. He was sharp at times afterward, thanks in part to safety "
