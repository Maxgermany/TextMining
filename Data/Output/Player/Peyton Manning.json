Earlier in the day, Matt Hasselbeck and Derek Anderson, both of whom were idle for most of the preseason, performed poorly. The exhibition needs to be at least 3 games long - if not longer.    If Manning's struggles weren't bad enough, Joseph Addai left the game early with a head injury."

Well, since accumulating those initial figures, Orton finished 13-of-26 and 87 yards. Orton was responsible for an intentional-grounding penalty late in the contest, which forced the Bears into a punt.    "

   "comment":"Manning. Matt Schaub tossed a first-quarter interception into triple coverage. Ryan Moats lost a fumble on Indianapolis' 1-yard line. And of course, there was the missed kick. Houston is now 0-8 at Indianapolis, but they could have easily won this game. The players shouldn't hang their heads at all.    Aside from that bad pick, Schaub played pretty well, finishing 32-of-43 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (the second pick wasn't his fault).    Schaub found Andre Johnson 10 times. The athletic receiver turned those receptions into 103 yards.    Without Owen Daniels, Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, "

Second, Ray Rice had a 20-yard run down to the Colts 28 at the beginning of the 4.h quarter, but fumbled it away. - All of Baltimore's penalties were costly, either negating a turnover, a crucial first down, or a possession deep in Indianapolis territory. The officiating was seemed 1.sided, and I can only hope that the refs will donate some of their Colts winnings to Haiti relief.    I may have lost 5 units on this game, but I wouldn't say I had the wrong side. Of course, you have ignorant announcers like Dan Dierdorf saying, Hwa hwa hwa hwa, looks like the Colts knew what they were doing when they rested their starters, hwa hwa hwa hwa. Well, this was the first time Indianapolis had ever won - let alone covered - when coming off rest in Weeks 17 and 18. And I don't think the Colts played all that well; outside of 2 offensive drives in the second quarter, they mustered just 136 total yards of offense, and for the entire game, they only outgained the Ravens by 5 yards (275-270). If Baltimore didn't commit all of those dumb, careless errors, they could have easily won this matchup.    Peyton Manning completed 30-of-44 passes, but for only 246 yards. That YPA (5.6) is very telling, as Manning just dinked and dunked on most of his throws. He attempted some deep balls, but missed his targets. Manning threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, though only 1 pick counted because of a questionable pass interference call on an uncatchable ball.    The Colts struggled to run the ball. "

Bradshaw, meanwhile, finished the game with 89 yards on 17 attempts. Brandon Jacobs had just 4 carries for 8 yards. He threw his helmet into the crowd in the second half, and never took the field afterward.    Hakeem Nicks had a really disappointing performance. He salvaged a late 31-yard touchdown in junk time, but had just 2 grabs for 38 yards. He clearly was hobbled by his ankle injury, and probably should have just sit this 1 out.    As for Eli's other receivers, Mario Manningham had 4 receptions for 75 yards and a score. "

   "comment":"Manning can't score on a long field. Haley attempted another ballsy move later in the first quarter. He went for it on 4th-and-2 inside Indianapolis' 5-yard line, but didn't get it. This move would really prove to be costly later; had the Chiefs kicked the field goal there, they could have went for it at the end of the game instead of asking Succop to try a 51-yarder.    You have to admire Kansas City's effort, so it's a shame that the team is really limited by Matt Cassel. Cassel went 16-of-29 for 156 yards. That doesn't look too bad, but he was awful in the red zone and had 7 straight incompletions in the second half. To be fair, Dwayne Bowe dropped a touchdown.    The Chiefs ran the ball well, which shouldn't be a surprise when you notice that Jamaal Charles had double the carries (16) compared to Thomas Jones. Charles had 87 rushing yards; Jones had just 19. Peyton Manning looked bored on sidelines as Chiefs ate up the clock on an 8-minute drive in the first quarter, but Kansas City couldn't convert in the red zone because of Cassel's struggles.    The Colts racked up 341 total yards of offense, but had just 19 points because they uncharacteristically struggled in the red zone.    Manning went 26-of-44 for 244 yards and an interception.

But after drawing to within 31-28, Manning had the opportunity to either tie or win on the final drive. He drove the Colts into field goal position, but tossed an interception as his arm was hit.    The Patriots won this game because they didn't make any mistakes. They took only 1 sack, and committed no turnovers and only 1 penalty. Indianapolis, meanwhile, had 3 give-aways (3 Manning interceptions) and were whistled for 6 infractions.    Brady went 19-of-25 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns. Box score analysts will assume that he wasn't all that great, but Brady was terrific. The Colts had no answer for him, as Brady dissected their defense to near perfection.

   "comment":"Manning, while Mark Sanchez orchestrated a brilliant game-winning drive, culminating with Nick Folk's decisive 32-yard field goal. Sanchez (18-of-31, 189 yards, INT) was brutal in the first half. He was sailing his throws, missing a wide-open receiver in the end zone for a touchdown. Later on the same possession, Sanchez tossed an interception when he overthrew his target. However, Sanchez calmed down after intermission. He was suddenly way more accurate. And on the team's final drive, he called the play himself that resulted in an 18-yard completion to Braylon Edwards, giving Folk an easy kick.    LaDainian Tomlinson looked great. He was exceptional at the beginning of the year, but appeared to wear down as the season went on. But he looked like the old LT at Indianapolis, rushing for 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries. Shonn Greene (19-70) was also effective.    Ryan's defense did a great job limiting Peyton Manning and his offense to 312 total yards. The Colts had just 1 big play, a 56-yard bomb to "

   "comment":"Manning is back. Not the predicted shell of his former self, but the real Peyton. He was out of football for about 600 days, but he looked as sharp as ever against the Steelers, particularly in the second half. Manning went 19-of-26 for 253 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was simply average on his first 3 drives when he was getting in calls from the sideline, but the Broncos opted to go with a no-huddle approach beginning on the 4.h drive. It was at that point that Manning became absolutely lethal. Here's the disparity: First 3 drives: 4-of-7, 44 yards, 0 touchdowns, 2 sacks. Fourth drive and on: 15-of-19, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns, 0 sacks. The scary thing about Manning's no-huddle approach is that opposing defenders will be sucking for air in Denver's thin atmosphere. The Steelers looked winded in the second half.    Manning's scores went to "

   "comment":"Manning didn't cover as a home underdog since his rookie year. Hmm...    This was the second straight week the Broncos didn't play a complete game. They had another comeback come up short after struggling for 3 quarters. Houston built up a big lead and Denver ran out of time after getting hot in the 4.h quarter. The Texans' offense and defense completely outexecuted the Broncos for the majority of 3 quarters. Houston mixed in some good runs and big plays through the air with a stifling defense that did a good job of getting off the field.    Denver struck first in the opening minutes with a safety on a sack by Elvis Dumervil. The Broncos then added a field goal before the Texans dominated until the 4.h. Houston took the lead with a long 60-yard touchdown pass to Andre Johnson after he torched Tracy Porter. Arian Foster then finished off a 97-yard drive with a 3.yard touchdown reception. He ran well, totaling 105 yards on 25 carries to go with his touchdown catch. Schaub lit up the Broncos a bit later for a 52-yard touchdown by dropping in a ball to Kevin Walter (3-73) on a deep post. The signal-caller also burned Porter on the route.    Schaub had to leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting nuked by 2 defenders. The helmet-to-helmet hit from Joe Mays will probably result in a fine. Schaub had a good gain to Lestar Jean of 46 yards after he made a leaping catch and exploded down the sideline. That set up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Schaub to Owen Daniels. Johnson (2-72) made a huge 12-yard reception late in the 4.h quarter to get a first down on a critical third down with the Broncos attempting a comeback. Schaub finished the game 17-of-30 for 290 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception.    The Denver offense would flash a nice gain or 2 during the first 3 quarters, but couldn't sustain drives or put the ball in the end zone. The Texans' defense was playing really well, led by J.J. Watt, who was having another great game with 2.5 sacks.    The Broncos' scoring unit finally came to life in the 4.h quarter, but it was the defense that lit the fire under the team. The Houston offense was driving to put the game away, but Ben Tate (8-26) fumbled the ball away after a hit by Denver defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson. Peyton Manning made them pay 2 plays later with a 38-yard touchdown toss to Brandon Stokley, who got open running down the middle seam."

   "comment":"Manning didn't cover as a home underdog since his rookie year. Hmm...    This was the second straight week the Broncos didn't play a complete game. They had another comeback come up short after struggling for 3 quarters. Houston built up a big lead and Denver ran out of time after getting hot in the 4.h quarter. The Texans' offense and defense completely outexecuted the Broncos for the majority of 3 quarters. Houston mixed in some good runs and big plays through the air with a stifling defense that did a good job of getting off the field.    Denver struck first in the opening minutes with a safety on a sack by Elvis Dumervil. The Broncos then added a field goal before the Texans dominated until the 4.h. Houston took the lead with a long 60-yard touchdown pass to Andre Johnson after he torched Tracy Porter. Arian Foster then finished off a 97-yard drive with a 3.yard touchdown reception. He ran well, totaling 105 yards on 25 carries to go with his touchdown catch. Schaub lit up the Broncos a bit later for a 52-yard touchdown by dropping in a ball to Kevin Walter (3-73) on a deep post. The signal-caller also burned Porter on the route.    Schaub had to leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting nuked by 2 defenders. The helmet-to-helmet hit from Joe Mays will probably result in a fine. Schaub had a good gain to Lestar Jean of 46 yards after he made a leaping catch and exploded down the sideline. That set up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Schaub to Owen Daniels. Johnson (2-72) made a huge 12-yard reception late in the 4.h quarter to get a first down on a critical third down with the Broncos attempting a comeback. Schaub finished the game 17-of-30 for 290 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception.    The Denver offense would flash a nice gain or 2 during the first 3 quarters, but couldn't sustain drives or put the ball in the end zone. The Texans' defense was playing really well, led by J.J. Watt, who was having another great game with 2.5 sacks.    The Broncos' scoring unit finally came to life in the 4.h quarter, but it was the defense that lit the fire under the team. The Houston offense was driving to put the game away, but Ben Tate (8-26) fumbled the ball away after a hit by Denver defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson. Peyton Manning made them pay 2 plays later with a 38-yard touchdown toss to Brandon Stokley, who got open running down the middle seam."

   "comment":"Manning versus Tom Brady XIII turned out to be a familiar refrain for the 2012 Denver Broncos: another 4.h-quarter comeback that fell short after the defense dug too big a hole to climb out of. New England moved the ball at will on Denver and set a team record with 35 first downs, while running for 251 yards. Brady was firing bullets through the Broncos secondary early on with Wes Welker being his go-to receiver. So much for Welker (13-104) getting phased out by the Patriots; he had 9 catches in the first half and helped build New England's lead with a short touchdown catch. Brady finished 23-of-31 for 223 yards, that score, a rushing touchdown and zero interceptions.    All of the Patriots running backs contributed to the win. New England got the ground game going late in the first half with Steven Ridley and Brandon Bolden (14-54). That extended into the third quarter with Danny Woodhead (7-47) converting a third-and-17 with a run that caught Denver by surprise, and Shane Vereen's 1 carry was a touchdown plunge. The Broncos had no answer for Ridley, and he ripped up Denver's defense on runs to the outside and inside. Ridley (28-151) was having a flawless day until he fumbled the ball away with 5 minutes left on the clock. Von Miller ripped the ball out. Miller had a great game with a couple of sacks as well.    Manning moved the ball well from start to finish, but was let down by pass-protection issues and mistakes from his receivers. "

   "comment":"Manning just have scored on an ensuing drive without the help of Holliday? Absolutely - he was on fire the entire afternoon - but the fact that something so shady went down makes me believe that Carolina never had a chance anyway. Why was this so important? Well, even though the final score was 36-14, it was the difference in the game. With a double-digit lead, the Broncos were able to tee off on Cam Newton. They pressured him relentlessly, recording 7 sacks - a ridiculous number considering Elvis Dumervil's shoulder injury (he left in the second quarter). Denver even stripped Newton once - a recurring problem this year - and intercepted him twice. One of the picks, which was returned for a touchdown, was an extremely dumb throw. Newton was under heavy pressure and forced a pass to prevent a sack. It was taken back 40 yards by Tony Carter. Newton went 21-of-36 for 241 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 in garbage time) and the aforementioned 2 picks. What's puzzling is that he had just 4 scrambles for 7 rushing yards. Newton needs to stop trying to become a passing quarterback. His best trait is running the ball. If he doesn't take advantage of that, he's only making things easier for the opposition.    Both of Newton's touchdowns went to Greg Olsen (9-102). Meanwhile, Steve Smith predictably was erased by Champ Bailey. The only thing Smith managed to do was catch a 19-yard pass.    The Panthers once again failed to run the ball. Jonathan Stewart (8-31) led the team in rushing, while DeAngelo Williams had 6 spectacular carries for 6 yards. I hope no 1 is wondering why no 1 traded for him at the deadline.    As mentioned, Manning was hot throughout. He opened the game completing 13 out of his first 14 passes and ultimately finished 27-of-38 for 301 yards and a score on a nifty screen to "

   "comment":"Manning on the sidelines. Romo was great throughout - until he heaved an interception deep in his own territory with 2 minutes remaining. Many will blame Romo for choking, but linebacker Danny Trevathan made a great, diving catch to force the turnover. The big mistake by Dallas occurred soon after when the defense didn't have enough awareness to allow Denver to score a touchdown when the Broncos marched down to the 1-yard line. This was a typical poor-coaching maneuever that Jason Garrett has been guilty of over the years. Following 3 Manning kneels/awkward dives, the Broncos drilled the decisive chip-shot field goal as time expired.    Aside from the 2 strange dives to kill the clock, Manning had a near-flawless afternoon. He went 33-of-42 for 414 yards, 4 passing touchdowns and an interception on an underthrow that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. Manning also had a rushing score - his first in 5 years - on a play-action naked bootleg that even fooled the cameraman.    Half of Manning's aerial acores went to "

   "comment":"Manning shaved points because he was the only 1 in his family pool to take Jacksonville +26.5. How else do you explain the Jaguars losing to the Rams and Broncos by about the same margin?    The Jaguars dropped to 0-6, but at least they played the Broncos tough and didn't get embarrassed. Denver didn't have its best game; the team played like it was looking past Jacksonville to the Colts next week. Still, the talent gap between these 2 teams is so great that Denver (6-0) won while sleepwalking at times. Knowshon Moreno (15-42 rushing, 7-62 receiving) ran for 3 touchdowns to lead the Broncos' offense. The Jaguars attemped a fake punt early in the game, but it was stuffed for no gain. That gave Denver great field position, and some nice gains by Moreno set up a short touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Julius Thomas (4-22)."

   "comment":"Manning to do the same thing to his former team, especially in the wake of Jim Irsay's questionable comments during the week. However, the Indianapolis crowd was much more respectful for Manning, giving him a standing ovation for a solid minute. Perhaps that quelled Manning's anger a bit because he was a huge disappointment in his failed revenge attempt. Manning's numbers don't show it - 29-of-49 for 386 yards, 3 touchdown, 1 interception - but he sucked in this contest. His arm strength had been questioned throughout the start of this season, but the ball really fluttered out of his hand on many occasions. When the game was 36-17, Manning's numbers were a meager 16-of-28 for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he easily could've had several passes intercepted. He finally did throw a pick, as his arm was hit as he threw a pass in the middle of the 4.h quarter. He similarly had a lost fumble for a safety much earlier. Manning eventually got into a groove and compiled junk yardage (and 16 points) against a prevent Indianapolis defense, but still had issues dealing with the Colts' pressure. He was sacked 4 times (twice by "

The Broncos went into beast mode and dominated the Redskins with 38 unanswered points. The first half was mostly a defensive strugle. The Broncos' first drive carved up the Redskins to move the ball down the field and Manning threw a short touchdown pass to Wes Welker (6-81)."

I would find it amusing if Manning misses next week's game, only because it would add Brock Osweiler to the list of crappy quarterbacks the Chiefs have played this season.    The Chargers are significantly improved this season, but they aren't ready to knock off 1 of the big boys of the AFC West. Denver held on for a road win to set up a huge game with homefield playoff implications next week with the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs. In full disclosure, the first 13 minutes of the first quarter wasn't available because of the Cincinnati-Baltimore game going to overtime. In that stretch, Peyton Manning threw a short pass to "

   "comment":"Manning XIV had so many crazy twists and turns, I don't even know where to begin. I don't think anyone even expected for this to have such a thrilling finish considering how terrible New England looked in the first half. The team trailed 24-0 at intermission, and it appeared as though Denver would easily run away with a victory. The Patriots didn't look like themselves in the first half. They killed themselves with so many mistakes. Here's the rundown: - Stevan Ridley lost a fumble in the first quarter that was returned for a touchdown. Ridley (4-14), who has chronic fumbling woes, wasn't seen or heard from ever again. - Tom Brady lost a fumble when Von Miller beat Nate Solder and forced a strip-sack. Miller had 2 sacks and that forced fumble. Brady bobbled the ball a bit again later, but was lucky enough to have it bounce right back into his hands. - LeGarrette Blount, getting first crack at the running back duties after Ridley was benched, also lost a fumble. He gained 13 yards on his 2 carries. Brandon Bolden (13-58, TD) took over permanently after that. - Danny Amendola (3-17) fell down on a third-and-5 to ruin a potential first-down conversion at the end of the first quarter. - Shane Vereen (8 catches, 60 yards) dropped a catch on what would've been a 25-yard gain. - Neither the play clock nor the game clock were working at 1 point in the opening half. This didn't have anything to do with the Patriots, obviously, but that's what sort of contest this was. Nothing was going right, and the Broncos were doing a great job of capitalizing. They were running the ball so well with Knowshon Moreno (37 carries, 224 yards, touchdown) that it seemed like the Broncos would win this matchup in a blowout. However, the game completely flipped after the break, and Denver began making all of the mistakes. This includes... - A number of injuries. The Broncos lost Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and some other defenders. Rodgers-Cromartie, who got hurt on a Hail Mary attempt at the end of the first half, was really missed on the field. Consider Brady's numbers prior to DRC's injury (10-of-17, 81 yards) to what he posted afterward (24-of-33, 263 yards, 3 TDs). - Montee Ball (7-40) lost a fumble. As with Ridley, he disappeared. The Broncos used undrafted rookie C.J. Anderson instead. Anderson (3-16) looked good until bobbling a handoff in overtime. - Like Brady, Peyton Manning lost the ball but had it ricochet off the ground and back into his hands. However, Manning was also intercepted. Both quarterbacks actually got away with picks. Manning's potential second interception was wiped out because of a defensive hold, while Brady's was dropped by "

Manning, entering this contest with a 3-7 record in games in which the temperature is 34 degrees or colder, seemed determined to silence all doubters. He apparently succeeded, going 39-of-59 for 397 yards and 4 touchdowns. Throughout the game, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms offered snobbish remarks, berating those who doubted Manning's ability win in frigid conditions. This will go against public opinion, but Manning didn't prove anything, as far as I'm concerned. The Titans are a poor team playing their third-consecutive game on the road. They looked extremely fatigued in the second half, as they were gasping for air in Denver's high-altitude environment. Plus, Manning, despite the impressive stats, lobbed up some ugly ducks in this contest. He was also nearly intercepted by "

The temperature was near-freezing in this contest, and yet Manning was much worse. His final numbers don't look bad - I'll get to those in a bit - but he was just 11-of-19 for only 137 yards with a couple of minutes remaining in the third quarter. Those are his true stats; everything he did after that could be considered garbage time, as San Diego suddenly went into a prevent. It must be noted that Manning didn't have Wes Welker at his disposal, but that's no excuse. He was still able to throw to "

That certainly turned out to be the case, as Manning didn't just outplay Brady; he made his arch rival look like a mere second-stringer by comparison. The differences between Manning and Brady were paramount throughout the entire afternoon. Let's take a look at many of them: Manning hit a deep, early pass to "

   "comment":"Manning battling each other earlier in the day, I can't help but draw parallels between them and this quarterbacking matchup. Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson will clash on countless occasions over the next 10-15 years, and as with the Brady-Manning dynamic, the flashier quarterback hasn't been able to defeat the clutch upstart, instead choking in big moments. Manning couldn't defeat Brady early in his career. He also came up small in the clutch prior to the AFC Championship following the 2006 season. The same can be said for Kaepernick, who is now 1-3 straight up and 0-4 against the spread versus Wilson. Kaepernick struggled at times in last year's Super Bowl, and he once again disappointed in this year's conference title game. This wasn't the case early on. Kaepernick was running all over Seattle's vaunted defense, scrambling 8 times for 98 rushing yards in the opening half, which includes a career-long 58-yard scamper that helped set up an "

Manning was just 6-of-14 for 70 yards in the second half. He did endure a couple of drops, but he had receivers open and couldn't hit them. This includes a pair of major overthrows to his targets when he was trying to run out the clock near the end of regulation. I have no explanation for what happened.

Another infraction in the red zone and a missed field goal by Cairo Santos (nice job cutting Ryan Succop) turned a 10-minute third-quarter drive into nothing. Meanwhile, allowing Montee Ball to gain 23 yards on a second-and-30 in the second half robbed the team from another possession. Smith was also strip-sacked near the end of the game, but the officials made a curious call by ruling it an incompletion.    Excluding Davis, 3 Chiefs tied for the team lead with 6 targets. They were Travis Kelce (4-81), Donnie Avery (3-14) and Dwayne Bowe (3-40), who didn't do much in his 2014 debut.    The Broncos are 2-0, but there's something off with their offense.

   "comment":"Manning was never intercepted, but he was. Eric Weddle impressively snatched the ball in the end zone with 1 hand, thwarting a Denver drive. However, a flag came out after the pick, and McAulay announced that prior to the pass there was holding. Once again, Nantz, Simms and Carey were all miffed by the call. There was barely any contact, and it was within 5 yards anyway, so there shouldn't have been any sort of infraction. And if the penalty occurred prior to the pass, why was the flag thrown after the actual interception? Once again, the Broncos took advantage, scoring a touchdown. 3. Emmanuel Sanders, who had a brilliant game, committed his sole blunder when he fumbled in his own territory. The Chargers appeared to have recovered the ball, but it bounced around and fell into Wes Welker's arms. That was a chance for San Diego to get back into the game, down 14 at that point, but the Broncos maintained possession, bled the clock and pulled through with the spread-covering victory.    The Broncos were very lucky in this game, but they didn't need all of that great fortune to prevail. They were the better team on the field, outgaining San Diego by 119 net yards and averaging 1.2 more yards per play. The Chargers were competitive for a while, but Denver ultimately ran away with this victory in the second half. San Diego simply couldn't do anything about Peyton Manning. The NFL's career touchdown record-holder was an unstoppable force, going 25-of-35 for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had that 1 interception that should've stood, but was otherwise flawless. He simply took advantage of a secondary that was missing its top 2 cornerbacks. Brandon Flowers was out with a concussion, while "

   "comment":"Manning lost to Shaun Hill. Maybe this result explain the second polar vortex. In all seriousness, I thought the Rams would cover this spread because it was absurdly high, but I never envisioned them actually beating the Broncos, considering all of the late-game meltdowns they've had this season. Give them credit though, as they bounced back from last week's gut-wrenching loss to the Cardinals. Having said that, it's fair to wonder if the end result would've been any different had the Broncos not lost some key personnel throughout the contest. Both Montee Ball and Julius Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were "

   "comment":"Manning hasn't played well in the past 6 quarters. He was just 4-of-14 for 43 yards in the second half of the Kansas City game. He had a higher completion percentage in this contest - 14-of-20 - but was responsible for 2 interceptions. Both picks were poorly thrown balls. The first fluttered, allowing Corey Graham to snatch a nice-looking interception. The second was another weak-armed floater. No 1.s saying anything about it in the media because they're afraid to offend Lord Peyton - Michael Irvin even admitted that he was hesitant - but his arm seems to be sapped. Denver had an early bye - back in Week 4 - so it's possible that Manning could just be fatigued. Manning ultimately generated 173 yards. He was battling a tough defense and tried to get rid of the ball as quickly as a consequence, but that doesn't excuse the weak throws.    Because Manning didn't try to go deep very often - and struggled when he did - both "

No 1 in the media wanted to mention it because they feared offending Manning, but the future Hall of Fame quarterback had a decaying arm down the stretch, beginning with the second half of the Kansas City contest. There was talk that Manning was healthier during the week, but that didn't appear to be the case at all.    I'd like to focus on Luck though, as he is the more significant quarterback in the NFL at this point. Luck, unlike Manning, has proven to be extremely clutch in his young career. He has made so many 4.h-quarter comebacks early on, and that type of play has transitioned to the playoffs. He was so sharp in this contest, beating the quarterback he displaced as the starter of the Colts. Luck finished 27-of-43 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The picks were both like punts on third-and-long situations where Luck just tried desperately to make something happen. He also had a 20-yard scramble. Some of Luck's best passes came on third downs. He fired a ball to "

Manning looked awful, and based on the way he performed in this contest, it doesn't appear as though he'll be in the NFL much longer. Manning went 24-of-40 for 175 yards and an interception. Yes, that's good (bad?) for a 4.38 YPA. He was horrible. It should be noted that the Ravens basically lived in his backfield, as the offensive line couldn't block whatsoever, but when Manning had time, he often couldn't hit his receivers, especially when he threw deep. Manning showed zero zip on his passes, which fluttered carelessly over the heads of his wideouts. I don't know if he was serious, but Rodney Harrison said Manning had too much power on his throws, but that was hardly the case. A complete lack of power resulted in those inaccurate floaters. I don't want to keep harping about this - OK, I actually kind of do - but the amount of points Manning left off the board was unreal. He missed "

   "comment":"Manning will, of course, be in the Hall of Fame 5 years after he retires. It's now very fair to wonder if that will be in 2020. Manning looks done, so this could very well be his final year in the NFL. It was almost painful to watch Manning in this game. He had zero zip on his passes, and he resembled a wounded animal that needed to be put out of its misery. In fact, Manning was extremely close to having 1 of the worst starts of his career. That may sound strange to anyone who didn't watch this game, given that he went 26-of-45 for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but those numbers are very deceiving. Manning's pick, which was returned for a score, was an inaccurate throw. That would've been fine if that was his only blemish, as the box score indicates, but he was so much worse than that. Manning nearly tossed a pick-six on the ensuing drive on a dead-armed throw. Right after that, he underthrew what seemed like a potential touchdown to "

The media was quick to jump back on the Manning bandwagon after he finally put together a quality outing last week, ignoring his interceptions and many dead ducks. It was more of the same from Manning in this contest, as he struggled to move the chains for most of the afternoon. He put together some strong drives in the second half, but it wasn't nearly enough, as Indianapolis' mastery over Denver continued. Manning finished 21-of-36 for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The first half was very ugly, as the Broncos were shut out, save for an inexplicable punt return as time expired. Manning was just 9-of-22 for 80 yards and an ugly interception on a high pass prior to intermission, as he constantly sailed horrible passes wide of the mark. He was sharp at times afterward, thanks in part to safety "

   "comment":"Manning had a chance to take the lead, but threw a pass right to Steelers' corner William Gay - not that there's anything wrong with that - but Gay dropped the ball, though Emmanuel Sanders helped by grazing it. An interception there in Denver territory would've all but sealed the victory for Pittsburgh, but the Broncos were given second life. They took advantage of it and drove down the field. They scored a touchdown, converted the 2.point conversion, and then stopped the Steelers, who called a couple of dumb plays that went no where. A front-door covering field goal and a back-door pushing kick later, and the Broncos walked away with a 7.point victory. I say the Broncos were fortunate to prevail because Manning and his receivers struggled immensely. Manning had a couple of nice passes, but most of his attempts were wobblers that either sailed out of bounds or bounced in front of his targets. Meanwhile, his supporting cast was guilty of a whopping 5 drops. Also, Manning's longest pass, a 34-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders, should've never happened. Manning, who was about to be sacked, gave himself up to avoid a hit, like he usually does. However, he realized he wasn't touched, so he got up and fired a shot to an open Sanders despite the fact that some Steelers stopped playing. An irate Mike Tomlin tried to challenge the call, but it was ruled unreviewable for some reason. Manning's final numbers weren't terrible, but they resembled his other playoff choke-job performances. He went 21-of-37 for 222 yards and no touchdowns. Again, Manning was extremely lucky to get away with a victory and no turnovers, and a big chunk of his yardage was a complete fluke. If the Steelers hadn't fumbled deep in Denver territory, he would've been 1.and-done once again.    Of the 5 drops, "
