Pryor went on to finish 18-of-23 for 221 yards and the pair of scores to go along with 11 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. He also should've thrown a third touchdown, but Moore stepped out of bounds prior to catching the ball. Pryor's only real blemish was when he fumbled the ball trying to desperately do something while wrapped up in a sack. He's fortunate that 1 of his teammates recovered the ball.    As mentioned, Moore (5-84) and Streater (3-56) caught the touchdowns. "
