   "comment":"Brice Butler for a potential touchdown in the second quarter.    Ezekiel Ellott was dominant, as usual. He trampled the Redskins, gaining 97 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. He also caught 2 passes for 23 receiving yards. The Redskins managed to stuff him in the backfield on some instances, but Elliott's tough running sparked many of Dallas' successful drives.    I mentioned earlier that Bryant was guilty of a drop. He still managed to lead the Cowboys in receiving, hauling in 5 balls for 72 yards. However, he was kept out of the end zone, thanks to Butler for a potential touchdown in the second quarter.    Ezekiel Ellott was dominant, as usual.
