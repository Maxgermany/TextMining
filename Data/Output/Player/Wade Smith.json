Matt Schaub was 20-of-31 for 266 yards and a score. He moved the ball better in the third quarter, especially with Owen Daniels, who had 87 yards on 4 catches.    The Dolphins started rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who didn't actually play as bad as his numbers indicate. He was 20-of-36 for 219 yards with 3 interceptions. Tannehill had some bad luck as 2 of his 3 picks came on tipped passes. He got little help from his teammates as he was pressured consistently.    It is painfully obvious that Miami has crap at wide receiver. None of the team's wideouts were getting separation and working themselves open. The Dolphins' leading wideouts were Devon Bess (5-45) and Brian Hartline (3-50). It was ugly.    Miami's best offensive player was running back Reggie Bush. He ran for 69 yards on 14 carries and caught 6 passes for 46 yards. Bush and teammate Daniel Thomas each had a fumble.    Dolphins defensive tackle Randy Starks really played well in the first half with 2 sacks. His second came when he beat Wade Smith with a nice shed and speed rush. Starks also had some nice plays in run defense.    The highlight of the day for Miami was a punt return from "
