   "comment":"Kendrick Bourne (2-39) for 25 yards and Goodwin for 13 yards. The drive finished with Beathard, taking a short read-option run into the end zone. Twice in the 4.h quarter, Arizona got field goal on a drives led by Peterson and Fitzgerald to take a 20-10 lead. The Cardinals were in position to salt the game away midway through the 4.h quarter, but Peterson fumbled the ball away. After a hit going to the head of Beathard, a big fight erupted between the 2 teams with punches thrown. "
