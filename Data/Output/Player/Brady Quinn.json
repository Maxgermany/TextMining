   "comment":"Quinn (23-of-35, 239 yards, 2 touchdowns) was sharp. The ground attack was working really well (Jamal Lewis and Jerome Harrison combined for 108 yards on 24 carries). Denver had no answer for Kellen Winslow Jr. (10 catches, 111 yards and a pair of scores). The defense, while surrendering some yardage, was able to get off the field when it mattered most. The secondary even came up with an interception. And it seemed like everyone on the Broncos was leaving the game with injuries, including Ryan Torain (12 carries, 68 yards, 1 touchdown), who is out for the year with a knee. So, what happened? The Browns played like the Browns. A foolish Winslow pass-interference penalty eliminated a beautiful Quinn-to-Braylon Edwards first-down conversion on third-and-12."

Quinn was very mediocre in this contest. He seldom went deep, and when he did, he was picked off. Quinn also lost a fumble that set up a Vikings field goal on a very strange play that will be featured on NFL blooper reels for years. The Browns have a better shot with Derek Anderson, who was the better quarterback this preseason.    So much for playing for a new contract. "

For more detail, forum member JoeyPotter: Quinn throws the ball into double coverage and gets it intercepted. When he throws the ball long he doesn't look where he is throwing the ball. Quinn actually turns his head as he throws and ends up looking at the ground by the time he lets it go. Does the QB Coach not see this? That is why he is so atrocious with his downfield accuracy; he doesn't look where he's throwing.    Conversely, "

The coaching staff showed no confidence in Cassel anyway, opting to run a draw play on a 3rd-and-8 in Baltimore territory in the opening quarter.    The Chiefs ran the ball extremely well against the Ravens, who surrendered triple-digit rushing yards in a half for the first time since 1998. "

They completely mailed this game in and played pathetic football. They featured an inept offense that was completely incapable of producing points and a disinterested defense that repeatedly gave up big plays.    Brady Quinn got the start and was incapable of making any plays against a Bucs secondary playing without suspended corner Aqib Talib. Kansas City's play calling was terrible as the team took zero shots downfield. Quinn had some bad luck with a deflected interception to "

This is the worst thing that could have happened to the Chiefs, as they had no chance of winning any games with Quinn at the helm. Cassel is more functional and has a better chance of ruining draft position. Cassel entered the game to an ovation and went on to go 20-of-30 for 218 yards, a touchdown (in garbage time) and an interception. He also showed some scrambling ability, picking up 35 yards on the ground on 7 carries. Cassel was infinitely better than Quinn could have been, but it didn't matter either way; the Chiefs continued to kill themselves with mistakes and poor play-calling. The errors were all costly. "

   "comment":"Quinn was terrible. He finished 10-of-21 for 159 yards and an interception. He was almost picked in a first-quarter trip to the end zone, and he went just 5-of-11 for 58 yards and an interception after intermission, as he looked lost without Bowe. He should not be allowed to start another NFL game ever again, but Romeo Crennel is going to keep sticking with him for some reason.    Charles finished with 165 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. The only skill-position player of note was Bowe (2-70); as mentioned, he left the game in the first quarter with a rib injury.    As for the Browns, Brandon Weeden was an economical 17-of-30 for 217 yards. His leading receiver was Josh Gordon (8-86), who just keeps getting better and better.    Trent Richardson scored both offensive touchdowns for the Browns, but he managed just 42 yards on 18 carries - a disappointing outing considering that the Chiefs were ranked 26th against the rush heading into this contest. It's worth noting that Richardson negated a score with an offensive pass interference.    This game was miserable to watch, so the most amusing aspect of it was that the Cleveland fans continuously chanted a**hole whenever Peyton Hillis touched the ball. Hillis, of course, was 1 of many former Browns on Kansas City, including Quinn, Crennel and offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. Considering how many former failed team members they were facing, Cleveland almost had to win this game.   "

   "comment":"Quinn at that point, but you can't really blame him. Quinn was anemic, going just 10-of-22 for 162 yards and 2 picks. One of the interceptions, which was taken back for a touchdown, occurred because the receiver wasn't looking. However, Quinn actually tossed a third interception, but the official called the Colts for an awful pass interference. The NFL will be better off if Quinn never plays a single snap ever again. Unfortunately, Crennel doesn't have any incentive to try out Ricky Stanzi, so Kansas City fans will probably have to deal with Quinn for 1 more week.   "
