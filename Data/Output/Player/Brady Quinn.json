   "comment":"Brady Quinn finished the game 21-of-35 for 205 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. However, most of Quinn's yardage and his score came late against Minnesota's backups. Quinn was very mediocre in this contest. He seldom went deep, and when he did, he was picked off. Quinn also lost a fumble that set up a Vikings field goal on a very strange play that will be featured on NFL blooper reels for years. The Browns have a better shot with Derek Anderson, who was the better quarterback this preseason.    So much for playing for a new contract. "

   "comment":"Brady Quinn torched an uninterested and battered San Diego stop unit in the 4.h quarter to beat the number. Fantastic job costing tons of people hundreds of dollars, Mr. Quinn! You can't take away anything from Quinn's 25-of-45 for 271 yards and 3 touchdowns. None of that was real. Quinn pieced together a nice opening drive to start this contest, but had only 2 possessions that went longer than 14 yards until this game was well in hand. All but a few of his passes were his trademark short junk. However, 1 big positive was definitely gained for Cleveland. Rookie tight end "

For more detail, forum member JoeyPotter: <i> Quinn throws the ball into double coverage and gets it intercepted. When he throws the ball long he doesn't look where he is throwing the ball. Quinn actually turns his head as he throws and ends up looking at the ground by the time he lets it go. Does the QB Coach not see this? That is why he is so atrocious with his downfield accuracy; he doesn't look where he's throwing. </i>    Conversely, "

They completely mailed this game in and played pathetic football. They featured an inept offense that was completely incapable of producing points and a disinterested defense that repeatedly gave up big plays.    Brady Quinn got the start and was incapable of making any plays against a Bucs secondary playing without suspended corner Aqib Talib. Kansas City's play calling was terrible as the team took zero shots downfield. Quinn had some bad luck with a deflected interception to "

   "comment":"Brady Quinn to cheer for Cassel's return. Quinn, who completed 2 of his 4 passes for a whopping 1 yard (and an interception, to boot), was knocked out with a possible concussion. This is the worst thing that could have happened to the Chiefs, as they had no chance of winning any games with Quinn at the helm. Cassel is more functional and has a better chance of ruining draft position. Cassel entered the game to an ovation and went on to go 20-of-30 for 218 yards, a touchdown (in garbage time) and an interception. He also showed some scrambling ability, picking up 35 yards on the ground on 7 carries. Cassel was infinitely better than Quinn could have been, but it didn't matter either way; the Chiefs continued to kill themselves with mistakes and poor play-calling. The errors were all costly. "

   "comment":"Brady Quinn was terrible. He finished 10-of-21 for 159 yards and an interception. He was almost picked in a first-quarter trip to the end zone, and he went just 5-of-11 for 58 yards and an interception after intermission, as he looked lost without Bowe. He should not be allowed to start another NFL game ever again, but Romeo Crennel is going to keep sticking with him for some reason.    Charles finished with 165 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. The only skill-position player of note was Bowe (2-70); as mentioned, he left the game in the first quarter with a rib injury.    As for the Browns, "

   "comment":"Brady Quinn at that point, but you can't really blame him. Quinn was anemic, going just 10-of-22 for 162 yards and 2 picks. One of the interceptions, which was taken back for a touchdown, occurred because the receiver wasn't looking. However, Quinn actually tossed a third interception, but the official called the Colts for an awful pass interference. The NFL will be better off if Quinn never plays a single snap ever again. Unfortunately, Crennel doesn't have any incentive to try out Ricky Stanzi, so Kansas City fans will probably have to deal with Quinn for 1 more week.   "
