Quinn was very mediocre in this contest. He seldom went deep, and when he did, he was picked off. Quinn also lost a fumble that set up a Vikings field goal on a very strange play that will be featured on NFL blooper reels for years. The Browns have a better shot with Derek Anderson, who was the better quarterback this preseason.    So much for playing for a new contract. "

   "comment":"Brady Quinn took over and was just as ineffective, going 9-of-14 for 95 yards. It's strange that the Chiefs aren't even giving Ricky Stanzi an opportunity. Both Cassel and Quinn are proven bums, but Stanzi deserves a chance, especially considering that the Chiefs will almost certainly be picking Geno Smith in the 2013 NFL Draft. They at least have to make sure that Stanzi isn't terrible.    "
