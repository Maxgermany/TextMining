   "comment":"Webb for holding. Webb, upon inspection, didn't even touch the receiver he was covering; neither player even had anything to do with the play, and the 2 announcers were puzzled by the call. The first down gave the Raiders new life, and 2 plays later, they scored the decisive touchdown. Tennessee still had a chance at the end, but Mariota heaved a desperation interception. Not that Triplette was going to let them win anyway. It's hard to take this game seriously, but I'll try my best. "

   "comment":"Webb for a touchdown. Goff then capitalized on Brees' strip-sack with a touchdown to Britt. Goff was 12-of-20 for 167 yards and 3 touchdowns in the first half alone. Unfortunately for Goff, the wheels fell off after intermission, as he went 8-of-12 for only 47 yards and an interception in the second half. Goff was strip-sacked after holding on to the ball forever, and his pick was a poor throw into double coverage. He took some bad sacks as well, though it needs to be noted that he lost left tackle "
