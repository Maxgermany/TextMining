   "comment":"Doug Baldwin. Speaking of Baldwin, the undrafted rookie hauled in 4 grabs for 83 yards and a touchdown, though most of his yardage came on a somewhat fluky 55-yard, 4.h-quarter score. Ignore him in fantasy leagues.    I found it hilarious that Seahawk fans on GameCenter posted comments at halftime like, T-Jack needs to step up, we can't rely on Marshawn! At that time, Lynch had just 6 yards on 7 carries. Ladies and gentlemen, Seattle's 2011 offense! Lynch finished with 33 yards on 13 attempts, by the way.   "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin for an early 7-0 lead. Unfortunately, Jackson (15-of-28, 163 yards, TD) would throw for just 89 yards the rest of the afternoon, completing fewer than half his throws. San Francisco answered as it had most of the season, with a steady, methodical drive. Just 2 plays went for more than 4 yards, a 7-yard scramble to open the drive by Alex Smith and a 12-yard pass to Michael Crabtree, but the 49ers worked to field goal range. One of their many MVPs this season, kicker David Akers, couldn't make good from 52 yards out though. Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back Justin Forsett. Speaking of Forsett, did anyone else notice how many players on Seattle's offense have a Bay Area connection? Lynch and Forsett both were running backs for UC-Berkeley where backup tight end Cameron Moorah and reserve lineman Mike Gibson also went. Fullback Michael Robinson played for the 49ers, while starting left tackle Pat McQuistan, left guard Robert Gallery and tight end Zach Miller were drafted by the Raiders. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Doug Baldwin went to Stanford. Kind of ridiculous isn't it? In the third quarter, it looked like San Francisco was going to ice this game. The first possession went 74 yards on 8 plays, highlighted by a 27-yard pass to Michael Crabtree (5-85) on the first play of the half and a 17-yard pickup to "

Pereira came back and then angrily said, That's not true. Just because the clock was stopped, doesn't mean there's no charged timeout. Some of the replacement officials did well this weekend, but these guys, as well as the 1. in the Green Bay-San Francisco game, were particularly atrocious.    The Cardinals moved the ball pretty well in the first half. Their offensive line held up shockingly well after being unable to block whatsoever in the preseason. However, the Seahawks seemed to figure things out after intermission. The Cardinals didn't achieve a single first down until "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin dropped the pass. Payton also may have been responsible for Colston's desperation bone-headed forward lateral on the last play from scrimmage. Colston should have just stepped out of bounds following a reception to give Brees a Hail Mary try, but perhaps he was told to attempt a backward pass.    As for the winners, the big story for the Seahawks heading into this contest was Percy Harvin's return to the field. Harvin had a 9.yard rush on a sweep and made a 16-yard leaping catch, but his first game back turned out to be a flop because he was knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter on a fierce hit by Malcolm Jenkins. The Saints made it a point to hit him hard; safety Rafael Bush drew a flag for a shoulder shot to the helmet, yet the coaches high-fived him on the sideline. Roger Goodell can't be happy about that. Harvin finished with just 3 grabs for 21 yards.    Marshawn Lynch couldn't muster anything in the early going, as the Saints did a great job of bottling him up. However, he broke free for some big gains as the game developed, finishing with a franchise playoff-record 140 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 carries. Lynch appeared like he wore down at the end of the season, but he was in full Beast Mode in this contest. That obviously bodes well going forward.    Russell Wilson had some issues with his accuracy; he completed only half of his passes (9-of-18 for 103 yards), as some of his attempts were behind his intended targets. However, there are 2 things to keep in mind. First, the Saints have an outstanding aerial defense, as stud cornerback Keenan Lewis broke up several passes. Second, Wilson made a clutch, third-down conversion to Baldwin (2-30) on the team's final possession, setting up Lynch's second touchdown. Baldwin, by the way, led the Seahawks in receiving yardage. Harvin, meanwhile, was the only Seahawk with more than 2 receptions. Wilson almost definitely would've enjoyed a better performance had Harvin remained on the field. Fortunately for Seattle, he'll have an extra day to get cleared. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Chris Mortensen reported that this will be Marshawn Lynch's final season with the Seahawks, but that Lynch would not be traded. Had Lynch been on the block, he would've lost some value based on this performance. He was responsible for Wilson's interception, negating at least 3 points. He also rushed for 62 yards on 14 carries, but didn't do much on the ground until a late, 25-yard burst. He was at the 3.yard-average mark for most of the afternoon.    As for the Panthers, Cam Newton had a miserable second half. He did a good job of moving the chains prior to intermission, but he had a complete meltdown after the break, going 4-of-12 for 81 yards and an interception to finish the game. The pick was terrible, as it was an ugly shovel pass. His only long completion following halftime was an amazing 51-yard reception by "

On third-and-goal just after the 2-minute warning, Carr connected with Rivera (8-38) for another touchdown off a play-action bootleg. It was close, but Seattle recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.    Wilson finished completing 17-of-35 passes for 179 yards. Marshawn Lynch had a huge day as Seattle's leading rusher with 21 carries for 67 yards and was the leading receiver with 5 receptions for 76 yards.

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin had the most balls thrown to him (6), but his 4-31 line was very underwhelming.    The Giants blew this 1 late, but they can at least be encouraged by Beckham's performance. The No. 12 overall pick continued to show flashes of greatness, snagging 7 of his 9 targets for 108 yards. He made several great catches at Seattle, including 2 on a single drive.    Eli Manning went 28-of-43 for 279 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He had a solid afternoon until that game-turning pick. Curiously, Tom Coughlin didn't attempt a pass with Manning at the end of the first half. The Giants had the ball in the red zone with 10 seconds remaining, but he called a run for "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin with a dart on third-and-13 after eluding a sack, and then converted with another pass on third-and-15 after dancing around in the pocket. Wilson, who went 22-of-37 for 263 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) to go along with 48 rushing yards on 10 scrambles, did a great job of keeping drives alive. The Seahawks held the ball for 42 minutes and never gave the Eagles a chance to get going. Their only offensive mistakes were 2 sacks that took them out of a field goal range on a pair of separate drives, and a lost fumble from Marshawn Lynch. Wilson also nearly threw a pick-six very late, but Seattle still would have led by 3.    Speaking of Lynch, he had a tough time finding running room against a ferocious Philadelphia ground defense. Lynch gained 86 yards on 23 carries, but those numbers were inflated by a 21-yard burst that he managed late in the game against the exhausted Eagles. Lynch helped his fantasy owners as a receiver, catching 5 balls for 27 extra yards and a touchdown.    Despite holding the ball the entire game, only 1 Seattle player had more than 37 receiving yards. That was Doug Baldwin (5-97), who secured Wilson's other touchdown. He also drew a pass interference on "

I feel like I've barely talked about them, but that's because the Seahawks, as Super Bowl contenders, are the bigger story. But it was nice to see St. Louis prevail in an opener after suffering countless injuries to Sam Bradford over the years. Foles proved to be an obvious upgrade over all of Bradford's replacements, going 18-of-27 for 297 yards and a touchdown. I already mentioned 1 of his best throws, a perfect ball to set up the game-winning field goal. He had another great 1 where he somehow flipped the ball complete to "

He's now had 2 huge games in his last 3. Wilson and Baldwin can look like this 1 game and then do very little the next game, but we know they have it in them. It will be interesting to see if they open up this passing game more as the season closes.    One problem with going more pass heavy is the season-ending injury Jimmy Graham suffered. He tore his right patellar 10.on after putting together a nice game, with 4 receptions for 75 yards. This injury is a tough 1 to recover from, and it has taken some players completely out of the NFL. Graham had not put up the numbers he had in New Orleans, but still had been an integral part of the Seattle offense, averaging 4.4 receptions for 55 yards per game. "

Seattle cruised over Cleveland to keep building momentum for another January run, and this win over the hapless Browns clinched a playoff berth for the Seahawks.    The Browns had an impressive opening drive to take a 7-0 lead. They mixed up some good runs and passes before Manziel scrambled and then threw a dart to Gary Barnidge for a score. Seattle answered by moving the ball down the field with some tough runs. A pass interference by Cleveland in the end zone put the Seahawks on the goal line. On third-and-goal, Wilson lofted in a pass to Doug Baldwin for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for Cleveland, Wilson kept moving the ball using his legs, and "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin and Tyler Lockett have been amazing, but Wilson has proven, much like Cam Newton has, that he doesn't need the best receivers in the league to be able to dominate at his position.    Carson Palmer sat early in this matchup, but he was not on his game this week, completing just 12-of-25 passes for 129 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. His receivers made a few bad drops, but Palmer and this team as a group were not prepared for the intensity the Seahawks brought.    Besides Wilson's accuracy and poise, Tyler Lockett was a 1.man wrecking crew as a punt returner, reeling off returns of 66, 49 and 42 yards and finishing with a franchise record 139 punt-return yards in a single game.    Lockett's presence on special teams, along with his skills as a receiver, coupled with Doug Baldwin's great route running in the slot and even Christine Michael, who looked strong on Sunday, rushing for 102 yards against Arizona's good run defense, and of course, Wilson's ability to run heaped on top of his his aerial attack of late, and you have yourself a Super Bowl contender raging against the dying of the light, just at the right time."

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin went for a touchdown. Overall, this was a great day for Wilson, and he is certainly returning to his peak performance level.    Because of the improved play of Wilson, Seattle's receivers were able to find some success. Doug Baldwin (4-104) was the top target of the quarterback during the game. He was constantly getting open downfield, and he was able to get some serious yards after the catch as well. On 1 short completion, Baldwin managed to turn upfield and avoid tacklers to get a big gain. He should be a low-end WR1 so long as Wilson is healthy.    "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin down the right sideline on a perfect strike to kick the offense into gear. To that point, the Seahawks had only 1 first down, but that throw really snapped them out of their funk. Wilson later scrambled for a 29-yard gain on that same drive and worked the team into field goal range. It was a nice drive by the veteran, and 1 that only he would be able to orchestrate. In the second half, Wilson continued to show a strong arm and threw his receivers open on many occasions. Wilson also knew exactly where to throw the ball to let his receivers go and get it. On 1 throw in the 4.h quarter, Wilson lofted a pass to Paul Richardson that hung up just long enough in the perfect place for the receiver to haul it in. Overall, Wilson ended up going 14-for-27 with 158 yards and a fumble. It wasn't the best stat line but again, it wasn't his fault. Seattle needs to get him some offensive line help, or it is not going to be able to compete in the postseason.    The Seahawks got a pretty nice performance from their receivers in this contest. Doug Baldwin (4-63) and Paul Richardson (4-59) both looked good on the field. Baldwin was an efficient player as always and ran crisp routes for the team. However, he will be limited in fantasy because of the lack of time Wilson has in the pocket. For that reason, Baldwin is capped as a WR2 most weeks. Meanwhile, Richardson keeps improving with each game he plays. He is worth monitoring for now, but Wilson seems to like throwing to him. "

   "comment":"Doug Baldwin for what would have been a wide-open touchdown. That said, the positives far outweighed the negatives. Wilson made some beautiful touch passes and was able to have great ball placement on almost all of his accurate throws. On 1 of his touchdowns, he found Baldwin over the middle of the field and lofted a perfect touch pass to him for the 22-yard score. The ball lofted over the linebackers and was 1 of his best throws on the day. In fact, all his touch passes were near perfect today, and that was his biggest strength. Wilson will continue to perform well, but the Seahawks need to get him help so he doesn't have to carry the team.    Wilson's top receivers on the day were Doug Baldwin (9-92, 1 TD) and Jimmy Graham (3-51, 1 TD)."

Wilson was under pressure more than he anticipated because of Brown's injury. Brown was supposed to provide some stability up front for the Seahawks, but once he left the game, the Seahawks reverted to their previous state where Wilson is constantly hounded and needs to make some amazing plays to give his team a chance to win.
