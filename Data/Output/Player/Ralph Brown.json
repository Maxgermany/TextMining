   "comment":"Ralph Brown. That basically epitomized how Ryan would play the entire afternoon. He had 3 spectacular drives, including 1 where he converted a third-and-10 and a pair of third-and-sixes, but other than that, he performed as if he were merely a rookie. Ryan was 26-of-40 for 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 picks, looking early and often toward Roddy White (11 catches, 84 yards, TD). But for whatever reason, Ryan struggled coming out of the locker room; his combined stats in the first and third quarters were 4-of-11, 28 yards and a pair of interceptions.    But this game was more about Arizona proving itself to the rest of the league. After all, the franchise hadn't hosted a playoff game since 1947! Though the Cardinals were at home, they were underdogs until Saturday morning. That's because of how poorly they finished the year. Well, the way they played, you wouldn't have known that they tanked against the Vikings and Patriots. Arizona was actually running the ball well and playing solid defense, prompting Cris Collinsworth to suggest that the Cardinals and Falcons switched jerseys before kickoff. Though Ryan would eventually throw for 200 yards and 2 scores, Arizona was able to restrict Michael Turner to 42 yards on 18 carries. Turner scored a touchdown, but also had a fumble taken back for 6.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals were able to establish Edgerrin James and Brown.
