   "comment":"Ringer received the first carry, but Johnson then just took the next attempt for 20 yards. He had a 21-yard reception later on the drive, which culminated in a Tennessee field goal. It appeared as though everything was back to normal, and that the Titans were perhaps going to salvage this season and perhaps become a threat to Houston. Yeah, not so much. The first drive proved to be a fluke, because Johnson's other 13 carries went for 44 yards. He also had 3 other receptions for only 25 yards. CJ20 still looked 10.ative and sluggish whenever he had the ball.    I'm amazed the Titans blew this though. They looked well in control, maintaining a 17-7 lead at the break. Tennessee was outgaining Cincinnati at that point, 233-139. The Titans had just 86 yards after halftime, however, while the Bengals mustered 189. "
