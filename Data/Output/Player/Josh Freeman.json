Freeman finished 17-of-28 for 182 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, and also ran twice for 34 more yards. All in all, Freeman played well considering he was coming off a broken thumb.    Rookie receiver Mike Williams had 5 grabs for 30 yards and a score. As noted earlier, Freeman missed him for another potential touchdown. Williams' numbers can only get better as Freeman's thumb continues to heal.    Cadillac Williams had a decent game. He had 98 total yards (75 rushing, 23 receiving), but was going against a pretty solid Browns front.   "

Dallas' offense really struggled because the players were getting destroyed up front. Gerald McCoy and defensive end Michael Bennett dominated the Cowboys' line. The Tampa Bay defenders produced sacks at clutch times to negate potential points. McCoy had a sack-fumble on Tony Romo to bail out Tampa Bay from allowing at least a field goal.

He had another catch down to the 1.yard line, but Tampa Bay put together a goal-line stand with a 4.h-and-goal stop just before halftime. New Orleans was up 13-7 and knocking on the door for more points, when Brees made a terrible pass that was thrown to Mason Foster like he was the intended receiver. Foster rumbled down the sideline for an 85-yard touchdown return. That gave the Buccaneers a 14-13 lead with 12 minutes remaining. They had a drive to drain the clock, but Rian Lindell missed a 48-yard field goal. That gave Brees 1 more shot with a minute remaining. He connected with Graham for 15 yards and a strike to Marques Colston (4-63) for 31 yards inside the Tampa Bay's 10-yard line. On the final play of the game, Garrett Hartley hit a 27-yard field goal for the win. Brees finished 26-of-46 for 322 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions. He definitely left points on the field.    The Buccaneers' offense was incapable of producing points on its own. Doug Martin was excellent for Tampa Bay as he ran for 144 yards on 29 carries. Martin picked up a lot of yards after contact while coming close to breaking off a long scoring run. The Bucs just couldn't consistently pass the ball to sustain drives.

   "comment":"Freeman sucked. It's time to consider slotting a quarterback to the Buccaneers in my . </i>    The AFC be warned, the Patriots are 3-0 and are getting better. It's scary for the AFC to think that New England is winning when the team isn't playing its best football. The Buccaneers had their opportunities to build a lead on the Patriots early in this game, but Tampa Bay couldn't finish drives, and New England eventually took control. Tom Brady started slowly, but eventually got into a groove to move the chains. His young receivers stepped up and played much better against the Bucs. Aaron Dobson (7-52) had 2 big catches on a second-quarter drive. The posession ended when Brady hit Kenbrell Thompkins (3-41) on the run, and he darted into the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Just before halftime, the duo hooked up for their second touchdown. They beat Johnthan Banks beat for the score and a 26-yard penalty on the drive. In the third quarter, Brandon Bolden (3-51) burst through the line for a 46-yard run. The drive fizzled when Brady missed a wide-open Dobson in the end zone and then threw a bad pass that was intercepted by Mark Barron. Brady completed 25-of-36 passes for 225 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception in this contest. He missed some wide open receivers in the deep part of the field, which says that while New England's offense was better, it was far from flawless and could have scored more.    Former Buc LeGarrette Blount (14-65) led the Patriots on the ground. A bunch of players contributed yards for New England, including Steven Ridley (11-35), Julian Edelman (7-44) and Michael Hoomanawanui (2-31).    Josh Freeman and Tampa Bay moved the ball well early in the game, but couldn't finish drives. Rian Lindel missed a 38-yard field goal and tight end "

   "comment":"Freemans?) He was also very fortunate that Carolina dropped 3 potential interceptions, though all of those instances came in the second half when Glennon was trying to mount a comeback. All in all, Glennon played OK, but I'm still not convinced that he can be a solid NFL starter. Perhaps I'll change my mind as the season progresses. Glennon's late touchdown went to rookie tight end "
