Freeman didn't make any big errors in this contest; he was 12-of-24 for 178 yards and 2 touchdowns, and also rushed for 43 yards on 4 scampers. Freeman played better than those stats indicate, and he did so despite still being hampered by a thumb injury. The Panthers' quarterback, meanwhile, was the 1 to commit the costly blunders this time.

   "comment":"Josh Freeman broke free for a 25-yard scamper on a third-and-long during the opening drive. He tried to do the same thing on the next play, but lost a fumble. The Cowboys quickly scored off the turnover, finding the end zone on 4 of 5 of their possessions in the first half. Game, set, match. This result isn't indicative of how lopsided this contest was. The Cowboys led 28-0 at halftime. At the time, they had 19 first downs compared to just 1 by Tampa (the Freeman run). The Buccaneers' second first down didn't come until there was 4:50 remaining in the third quarter. At that point, Freeman was a miserable 2-of-4 for 14 yards; the low number of attempts because he kept taking sacks behind his anemic offensive line. "

   "comment":"Josh Freeman for playing like absolute trash for 58 minutes and then spending the last 2 engineering 1 of the more epic back-door drives this decade. <i> </i>    The biggest take-away from this game is that the Cowboys' offensive line is horrible and could be the Achilles' heel that ends up sinking the team's season. Dallas' offense really struggled because the players were getting destroyed up front. Gerald McCoy and defensive end Michael Bennett dominated the Cowboys' line. The Tampa Bay defenders produced sacks at clutch times to negate potential points. McCoy had a sack-fumble on Tony Romo to bail out Tampa Bay from allowing at least a field goal. McCoy rocked Romo again in the 4.h quarter, and Dallas was lucky that its quarterback held onto the ball. Doug Free was getting whipped by Bennett for pressures, hits and holding calls. He had a sack-fumble of Romo in the third quarter to set up the Bucs at the Cowboys 31-yard line, but the Dallas defense forced a punt.    The Cowboys' first score was set up by a Josh Freeman interception. The ball was deflected into the air by running back D.J. Ware and was snatched by "

   "comment":"Josh Freeman sucked. It's time to consider slotting a quarterback to the Buccaneers in my . </i>    The AFC be warned, the Patriots are 3-0 and are getting better. It's scary for the AFC to think that New England is winning when the team isn't playing its best football. The Buccaneers had their opportunities to build a lead on the Patriots early in this game, but Tampa Bay couldn't finish drives, and New England eventually took control. Tom Brady started slowly, but eventually got into a groove to move the chains. His young receivers stepped up and played much better against the Bucs. Aaron Dobson (7-52) had 2 big catches on a second-quarter drive. The posession ended when Brady hit Kenbrell Thompkins (3-41) on the run, and he darted into the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Just before halftime, the duo hooked up for their second touchdown. They beat Johnthan Banks beat for the score and a 26-yard penalty on the drive. In the third quarter, Brandon Bolden (3-51) burst through the line for a 46-yard run. The drive fizzled when Brady missed a wide-open Dobson in the end zone and then threw a bad pass that was intercepted by Mark Barron. Brady completed 25-of-36 passes for 225 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception in this contest. He missed some wide open receivers in the deep part of the field, which says that while New England's offense was better, it was far from flawless and could have scored more.    Former Buc LeGarrette Blount (14-65) led the Patriots on the ground. A bunch of players contributed yards for New England, including Steven Ridley (11-35), Julian Edelman (7-44) and Michael Hoomanawanui (2-31).    Josh Freeman and Tampa Bay moved the ball well early in the game, but couldn't finish drives. Rian Lindel missed a 38-yard field goal and tight end "
