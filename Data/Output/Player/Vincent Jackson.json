   "comment":"Jackson (7 catches, 120 yards) and Malcom Floyd (3-40) where I just said wow out loud. The 2 wideouts continuously made really impressive receptions.    LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for 50 yards on 21 carries. He also scored his 10th touchdown of the year. He had a nice 10-yard run from his own goal line, but was otherwise ineffective outside of the red zone. He just doesn't have the blocking, and Dallas' defense was geared up to stop the rush in this contest.    Unlike the Cowboys, the Chargers had some creative play-calling. On 1 play, they came out in a Wildcat formation with Tomlinson in the shotgun. They ran a double reverse, giving Rivers the ball. Rivers launched a deep throw downfield toward Jackson. The pass fell incomplete, but drew a 38-yard pass-interference flag.    Two last notes: First, the officials were terrible in this contest. They screwed up on multiple pass interference calls on both sides, including an obvious infraction where Floyd was blatantly tackled by Dallas defensive backs. The refs didn't see it, which really cost the Chargers because Rivers tossed a pick on the next play. And second, "

In the second quarter, the Dolphins were set up with great field position, but had to settle for a field goal. The reason is because the Miami offensive line stinks, specifically left guard "

   "comment":"Jackson still thinks that Carson Palmer deal was 1 of the best trades in NFL history. Not that Palmer was the problem in this collapse, but Oakland won't be able to improve at all without any draft picks. And how are they going to fix this ridiculous penalty problem? Good God, the Raiders are a disaster.)    The wild, wild AFC West went down to the wire and, in the end, looked a lot like the NFC West of 2010. Even though the Chargers and Chiefs had nothing to play for, both came to play in Oakland and Denver respectively. In the early games, the Raiders got no wild-card help, meaning they would need to win and get a Kansas City victory for a playoff berth and AFC West title. Only half the equation worked out though, and Raider Nation finished at 8-8 again. On a random side note, while the other divisional game featured 17 punts with the Colquitts getting plenty of work, this 1 featured just a single punt. Oakland would wind up setting single-season records for penalties and penalty yards, so it was no surprise to see them flag Matt Giordano for a helmet-to-helmet hit on the fifth snap of San Diego's first drive of the game, before the Chargers even got to midfield. To make up for the error, Giordano intercepted Philip Rivers (19-of-26, 310 yards, 3 TDs, INT) on the next play, and that set the Black Hole rocking. The Raiders went on a serious march from their own 5-yard line. Twelve plays later, highlighted by a 27-yard reverse by Louis Murphy, they cashed in a short touchdown pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for an early 7-0 lead. San Diego replied with a long touchdown drive of its own, mixing passes to Malcom Floyd with runs by Curtis Brinkley and Mike Tolbert to put the team in plus territory. From there, Rivers hit Antonio Gates for a 38-yard touchdown, tying the game at 7. As the first quarter ended, a rare failed drive followed. Palmer threw short to Kevin Boss and Oakland punted into the end zone. The Chargers quickly got into the Raiders' territory with a 37-yard pass to Gates, and Tolbert finished the drive with a 1-yard plunge, putting the visitors up 14-7. They would never relinquish the lead. Oakland got another big play from Heyward-Bey (9-130, TD) who finished just short of 1,000 yards on the season at 975. After a 19-yard reception from Murphy, the drive looked promising, but stalled. After a long field goal by Sebastian Janikowski (52 yards) made it 14-10, there was reason for optimism as Kansas City led Denver 7-0 a couple hours to the east. However, Richard Goodman returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to provide San Diego with a 21-10 cushion. The Raiders, of course, turned to Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. Palmer found him down the middle for 22 yards, and after some short gains, another Janikowski field goal trimmed the lead to 21-13. The Chargers' offense never let off the pedal (463 total yards) in this 1 though. In 5 plays, they were at the Oakland 33-yard line. The defense held, forcing 3 straight San Diego incompletions, but Nova's long field goal put the Chargers ahead 24-13. Typically, the Raiders would answer in a 2.minute drill, having done so all year. This looked like no exception when Heyward-Bey caught a pass for a gain of 23 followed by a 9-yard pass to Bush, but with 11 seconds left and no timeouts to stop the clock, Palmer inexplicably completed a short pass to Murphy for a gain of 6. Instead of a long, but certainly makeable 55-yard field goal attempt, Oakland entered the locker room for halftime to a chorus of boos from the home fans. The offenses kept piling up stats in the second half, but field goals never beat touchdowns. Palmer dropped a bomb to Denarius Moore who went 78 yards but needed to go a few more. A short Bush run and 2 completions put Janikowski back on the field to slice the San Diego lead to 24-16. The response was a touchdown drive. The Chargers' big receivers used their height advantage all afternoon to school the small defensive backs trying to cover them. After a nice kickoff return set them up at the 34-yard line, Rivers completed all 5 passes he attempted for 51 yards including the 13-yard score to Vincent Jackson (2-29, TD), who played sidekick to Floyd (7-127, TD) and Gates (5-106 yards, TD) most of the game. Midway through the third quarter, it was looking bleak in the Black Hole. The Raiders got another big play, a 28-yard pass to Murphy, but again failed to finish with a touchdown. Janikowski's 4.h field goal closed them to within 31-19 as the third quarter wound down. Again, Oakland's defense couldn't really hold, but caught a break when Norv Turner started running the clock with Brinkley, who was given 4 consecutive carries. Rivers' first pass of the drive came on third-and-two and fell incomplete. Then, "

   "comment":"Jackson. Doug Martin added another touchdown to make it 21 unanswered for the home team and a 21-10 lead. Late in the 4.h quarter, Foles turned into Brett Favre with 2 jaw-dropping touchdown drives to get a walk-off winner. The rookie quarterback dominated Tampa Bay's anemic secondary. To get the comeback started, Foles had a superb possession that ended with a touchdown toss to Clay Harbor (6-52). The 2-point attempt went incomplete and left Philadelphia needing another touchdown. Foles' final drive was legendary as he ripped the ball down the field. On 4.h-and-5, the rookie drilled a 22-yard bullet to Avant to the 1-yard line. The Eagles managed to spike the ball fast enough to leave 2 seconds on the clock and time for 1 more play. Foles rolled out and threw a fastball to Jeremy Maclin (9-104) for a touchdown.    Foles finished 32-of-51 for 381 yards with 2 scores throwing, 1 rushing and zero interceptions. He was utterly amazing in crunch time. If Foles has a good NFL career ,this will be the game that is remembered as the start of it all.    Freeman was hot garbage in the first half and the Bucs were shut out. He was 5-of-16 for 61 yards. Martin had only 34 yards on 9 carries as the Eagles' defense was owning the line of scrimmage. Mychal Kendricks, Fletcher Cox, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Cullen Jenkins all had good games for Philadelphia.    Martin (28-128) and Jackson (6-131) were phenomenal in the second half, but Freeman continued his spotty play. His throws were off the mark all day with pathetic accuracy. He finished 14-of-34 for 189 yards with 2 scores, but was lucky he didn't throw multiple interceptions.    "

Bradford tossed a short touchdown pass to Austin Pettis. Those 21 points off of turnovers were the difference in the game.    Offensively, St. Louis got what it needed on the first play of the third quarter when Tampa Bay was caught in busted coverage. Tight end Lance Kendricks (4-119) was wide open and was hit in stride by Bradford. Danny Amendola (2-5) got 2 great blocks downfield to spring Kendricks for an 80-yard touchdown. Other than that play, the Bucs' defense shut down Bradford and the Rams' offense in the final 2 quarters. Bradford finished 13-of-27 for 196 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.    Freeman hit a 61-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams after some missed tackles and angles from the St. Louis secondary. That play got Freeman back on track as he had a good drive with Williams (7-132) to move the ball to the 5-yard line. On 4.h-and-1, down 28-13 late in the third, the Bucs went for it and were stuffed short by Michael Brockers. A 50-yard pass to Vincent Jackson (7-108) set up the Bucs inside the Rams' 5-yard line, but once again the defense made a stop on 4.h-and-goal to take away points from Tampa Bay. Freeman's 4.h interception came after Brockers batted a pass and "

   "comment":"Jackson (5-77) that was intercepted by Malcolm Jenkins. A 31-yard return by Jenkins set up the Saints at Tampa Bay's 39-yard line, but New Orleans ended up punting. Another Bucs drive into Saints territory fizzled when Cam Jordan strip-sacked Freeman with New Orleans advancing the fumble to Tampa Bay's 40-yard line.    Mike Williams had only 2 catches for 9 yards. The Saints' defense struggled against the run, but the secondary and pass rush combined to shut down the Bucs' passing offense.    For the second straight week, Tampa Bay continued to have problems with penalties. The team had 3 unnecessary-roughness infractions courtesy of Adrian Clayborn, Dashon Goldson and Ahmad Black. The Buccaneers also had a bad delay of game and an illegal formation that took away a third-down conversion. Perhaps the worst flag was an illegal formation penalty on right tackle Demar Dotson that canceled out a touchdown pass of over 70 yards to Jackson. Aside from the penalties, Tampa Bay's defense played extremely well. "

Kevin Ogletree dropped a pass for a 4.h-down conversion, and the Bucs were stopped short on multiple 4.h downs. With 11 seconds left before halftime, Freeman was picked off by Aqib Talib on a horribly thrown ball. That spotted New England a 53-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski, who later hit 2 more from 40+ yards. While the dropped passes hurt, Freeman had his normal accuracy problems. He completed just 19-of-41 passes for 236 yards. If Freeman doesn't make a big improvement next week against the Cardinals, the Bucs will probably be starting Mike Glennon against the Eagles after the bye.    Doug Martin (20-88) ran well for Tampa Bay as the team enjoyed Carl Nicks making his season debut. Jackson (3-34) left the game with a rib issue while Mike Williams (5-65) was gimpy with a leg injury."

A Bucs source told me that Chip Kelly was Tampa Bay's head coach for 6 hours or so before changing his mind. Instead of landing Kelly, the organization hired Greg Schiano. The Bucs are now 7-14 under Schiano and 24-45 under Dominik with an 0-5 start to 2013. With the NFC East wide open, the Eagles showed they are just as dangerous, if not more so, with Nick Foles at quarterback. The first drive of the game was a clinic as Philadelphia moved the ball at will. It started with a 44-yard screen pass to LeSean McCoy. Foles hit big completions to Cooper and Jackson before keeping it himself for a 5-yard score. On the next possession, McCoy had a good run going before he fumbled the ball while in air. "

   "comment":"Jackson in the end zone during the 4.h quarter (before Jackson's actual score a bit later). There were also some mental errors, including an untimely delay of game and a false start. However, Glennon proved to be a major upgrade over Josh McCown, and he'll at least keep the Buccaneers competitive in the near future.    Jackson, who secured the decisive touchdown, caught just 3 of his 10 targets for 32 yards otherwise. As mentioned, Glennon missed him, so the inefficiency wasn't all his fault, though he did drop a pass. Evans (4-65) hauled in Glennon's other score, but he injured his groin in the third quarter. "

Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims. Both turnovers led to touchdowns. Thanks to a Vincent Jackson fumble (a terrible call by Walt Coleman, who failed to overturn it via replay because he was too senile to remember where he was) and several awful sacks by McCown allowed Chicago to clinch this win and cover.    McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. His play made Jay Cutler look like a quarterback god even though he struggled as well. Cutler, who went 17-of-27 for 130 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, was booed heavily throughout the entire afternoon, particularly when Tampa dropped a potential interception of his on third down. He had some bad incompletions that weren't even close, and he was only able to generate 204 net yards of offense on just 3.6 yards per play. Chicago would have lost this game had its opponent not self-destructed.    With Cutler struggling, "

Another was a fumble on a strip-sack in the 4.h quarter. Nevertheless, he played well. Winston threw the ball just 9 times after intermission because the Buccaneers were way ahead at that point. It's a shame from a statistical standpoint; Winston could've enjoyed a huge game, as the Saints couldn't get any pressure on him; he had all day to throw on many occasions. The secondary sucked as well; Winston's yardage doesn't include a long pass interference on Brandon Browner.    While Jackson snatched the touchdown, he actually trailed Louis Murphy in yardage."

The Bucs had lost 11-straight home games, while the Jaguars had lost 11-straight road games. Led by another big day from running back Doug Martin and an efficient game from rookie quarterback Jameis Winston, the Bucs won at home for the first time since December of 2013. A victory against Jacksonville might not seem like a big deal, but snapping the home losing streak was important for the Bucs. The victory marked the first time coach Lovie Smith has won a home game. Smith has his share of detractors, but the win (as the Bucs head into a bye week) should silence the doubters for a while.    Martin's 2-year slump appears to be over. He's running the way he did as a rookie in 2012. Martin had his second-straight 100-yard rushing game. He finished with 123 yards on 24 carries and had 3 catches for 35 yards. Martin had 2 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown. The most impressive part might have been that Martin was running behind a make-shift offensive line. Center Evan Smith and left guard Logan Mankins missed the game because of injuries. But replacements Joe Hawley and "

Martin, as mentioned, had 2 long runs that were called back. Thus, he should've eclipsed the century mark. Instead, Martin gained 95 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. His only blemish on the afternoon was a lost fumble near midfield that set up an Atlanta score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. The errors began early when a face mask gave Tampa a first-and-goal, leading to a touchdown. Later, there was 1 sequence in which Atlanta was penalized on 3 of 4 plays, which set up an easy Buccaneer field goal. The Falcons also continued to screw up in the red zone. They once again resorted to kicking too many field goals.    Ryan went 30-of-45 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and the game-ending interception in which he inexplicably didn't see Tampa's best linebacker. He struggled with pressure, especially in the red zone, which is ridiculous considering that the Buccaneers were missing their 2 top pass-rushers, including All-Pro Gerald McCoy. That's how bad Atlanta's offensive line is.    Ryan's inconsistency and lack of protection prevented him from hooking up with "

A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field.

The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.

   "comment":"Jacksonville and Miami had 1 p.m. home games in September). By the time the delay ended, there was practically nobody left in the stands. Roger Goodell and company absolutely have to re-think their plans for East Coast games in the future.    In terms of the actual game, this was dominated by the Broncos. The team had a very solid performance in the passing game, despite what could be a big injury to Trevor Siemian. Siemian was off to a good start in the contest, going 5-of-7 for 68 yards and a touchdown. He was looking like a solid all-around starter before he hurt his shoulder. On a sack, Siemian was driven into the ground and hurt his left shoulder in the process. He did not return to the game and was replaced by rookie Paxton Lynch. Considering that it was his first NFL action, Lynch looked good on the field. He ended up going 14-of-24 for 170 yards and a touchdown in this contest. He was very comfortable in the pocket, and his throws were picturesque. He has a perfect spiral, and the ball just looks natural coming out of his hand. Lynch's accuracy was only decent, but it is clear that he has the skill set to be a top-level NFL starter. If Siemian misses any time with his injury, Lynch should not be much of a drop-off. He would be a potential QB2 with upside in fantasy.    Of course, Lynch did get some help from his stellar receiving corps. Demaryius Thomas (6-94) and Emmanuel Sanders (8-88) were able to absolutely torch the Buccaneers' weak secondary. Thomas was very strong during the day, making many nice catches, including a couple where he rose up to perfectly catch the ball at its high point. Sanders was every bit as good as Thomas, though he saw 13 targets and appears to be a favorite of the Broncos' quarterbacks. Both receivers were able to score a touchdown and should continue to be great plays in fantasy.    Denver's running game was surprisingly ineffective against the Buccaneers. C.J. Anderson was bottled up repeatedly in the first half of the game, and he only finished the day with 49 yards on 19 carries. However as the afternoon went on, Anderson got better and was able to keep his legs churning and move the pile. He did add a touchdown to his stat line as well. Aside from Anderson, Devonte Booker and Kapri Bibbs got some carries. Booker posted 30 yards on 7 carries, while Bibbs put up 14 yards on 3 totes. They will continue to only spell Anderson in short bursts.    Defensively, the Broncos were once again stellar. Their defense has been the strength of their team for the past couple of years, but they were on a different level against the Buccaneers. Aqib Talib set the tone for the team early with 2 picks of Jameis Winston. One came on the first possession for the Buccaneers and seemed to discourage the young quarterback. Talib ultimately helped to shut down Mike Evans. which was huge for the Broncos. Elsewhere, Denver was able to sack Winston on a whopping 5 occasions. Derek Wolfe led the way, getting to Winston 2.5 times. Wolfe is a force to be reckoned with, and he may now be the best 3-4 end in all of the NFL. Shaq Barrett and Sylvester Williams each contributed 1 sack, while Von Miller was able to record a half sack on the day.    For Tampa Bay, the offense was just abysmal. The Bucs battled 1 of the league's top defensive units and lost miserably. As mentioned earlier, Jameis Winston was constantly under pressure and just could not get anything done in the passing game. He finished the day a lowly 17-of-35 for 179 yards and threw the 2 picks. On the bright side, Winston did manage to scramble for the team's lone touchdown. Though he made some poor throws, the entire performance was hardly his fault. Every single time Winston dropped back, a Broncos player immediately broke through the line. The Buccaneers have to do something about this issue, or Winston's confidence may get rattled again in the future. Or worse, he could get hurt. Because of the problems on the offensive line, Tampa Bay's receiving corps did not do much outside of garbage time. The team was led in receiving by tight end Cameron Brate (5-67). Brate is establishing himself as a decent starter, and he can be considered a good TE2 in fantasy. Meanwhile, Mike Evans recorded 5 catches for 59 yards. The Broncos did a good job of keeping Evans in check early in the afternoon. About half of his yards came after the game was out of reach. Vincent Jackson (3-38) was relatively quiet as well.    The run game was also a struggle for the Buccaneers. "
