   "comment":"Dan Orlovsky. I can't blame Rod Marnelli for putting Kitna on the sidelines - he was just 8-of-16 for 74 yards - but replacing him with Orlovsky, who wouldn't even be in the NFL if it wasn't for some crappy GM who used to run the Lions? Orlovsky predictably struggled, going 13-of-23 for 97 yards and a pick-six. Because of Kitna's struggles and Orlovsky's ineptness, "

  "comment":"Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.    ",
