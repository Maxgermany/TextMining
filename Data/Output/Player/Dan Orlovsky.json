Orlovsky predictably struggled, going 13-of-23 for 97 yards and a pick-six. Because of Kitna's struggles and Orlovsky's ineptness, "

   "comment":"Dan Orlovsky beat the spread - doing so on the final play of the game. Unlike the Patriots, the Ravens didn't decide to leave receivers wide open. They wanted to keep the Colts out of the end zone at all cost. In fact, the crowd was going nuts when their defense made a red-zone stand in the middle of the 4.h quarter.    "

   "comment":"Dan Orlovsky was able to overcome this with key interceptions. In the wake of this win, Indianapolis has secured the first-overall pick in the <b> </b>. Great job by the players, coaching staff and owners for ensuring that this franchise will have at least another decade of outstanding quarterback play.    Speaking outstanding quarterback play, Blaine Gabbert went 11-of-19 for 92 yards and a touchdown. I'm not saying that facetiously as I am with everything else; Gabbert performed exceptionally compared to how he's looked all year. Don't be too excited, however. Gabbert went 5-of-6 for 44 yards and a score in the first quarter, which means he was just 6-of-13 for 48 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble afterward. He once again wilted under pressure in the pocket, taking 3 sacks.    The Jaguars may have lost this contest (goodbye, Justin Blackmon?) but at least Maurice Jones-Drew secured the rushing title. Jones-Drew tallied 169 yards on 25 carries, giving him 1,606 on the year. Not bad for a guy coming into the seasons with knee concerns (it should be noted that he was the 1 who was concerned).    Speaking of Jones-Drew, I want to bring up a great tackle by Indianapolis safety Antoine Bethea. Jones-Drew looked like he would be able to score a rushing touchdown in the first half, but Bethea smothered him at the 1-yard line and took down the big back.    As for Dan Orlovsky, I picked the Colts to cover because he was doing a good job of taking care of the football. Oops. He tossed 2 picks and fumbled twice, going 27-of-40 for 264 yards and a touchdown otherwise. The score was to "

   "comment":"Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.    "
