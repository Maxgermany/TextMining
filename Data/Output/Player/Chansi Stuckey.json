   "comment":"Chansi Stuckey caught the ball with a foot out of bounds and then slipped a few plays later.    The Jets' skill-position players had equal touches. Leon Washington and Thomas Jones had 14 carries each for 58 and 54 yards, respectively. Washington will continue to take more of Jones' work. Meanwhile, both Jerricho Cotchery and Chansi Stuckey caught 4 balls for 87 and 37 yards.   "
