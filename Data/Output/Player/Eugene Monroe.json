   "comment":"Eugene Monroe penalty. However, Gabbert's pocket presence was a big problem; he struggled with pressure and even took a safety. Most of his yardage came on screen passes to Jones-Drew.    Speaking of Jones-Drew, there's no doubt now that he's healthy; the Pro Bowl running back gained 122 yards on 24 carries to go along with 3 catches for 45 receiving yards.    The rain cleared up as the game progressed, and the Panthers were able to finally take the lead in the 4.h quarter when Cam Newton hit "

He finished 21-of-50 for 195 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Most of his passes were way off the mark.
