   "comment":"Terrell Owens scored a touchdown (his 130th, tying Cris Carter for second all-time) in the first half, he kneeled down in a sprinter's stance, which looked like an homage to the Olympics. One of the officials consequently whistled Owens for an unsportsmanlike penalty. The NFL really stands for No Fun League. Let the damn players be creative with their celebrations, just as long as they're not showing the other team up.    One of the most curious decisions in this contest was a Romeo Crennel attempted field goal when his team was down 28-7 with 10 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. While this was clearly the wrong decision, I can't fault Crennel for guaranteeing that this game wouldn't go into overtime. The man was clearly hungry and he had a box of Chips Ahoy cookies waiting for him in his office. An overtime would have just delayed Crennel's snack.    On his first carry alone, "

Fitzpatrick was 10-of-25 for 116 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He doesn't have much of an arm, but seemed more willing than Edwards to take a shot downfield. There's really not much of a difference between Edwards and Fitzpatrick at this point.    Marshawn Lynch once again received more touches (21) than Fred Jackson (15). Lynch's 19 carries went for 61 yards, while Jackson turned 15 rushes into 52 yards.    With Fitzpatrick under center, Lee Evans had a solid performance, catching 4 balls for 68 yards and a touchdown. Terrell Owens, meanwhile, grabbed just 3 balls for 13 yards. Owens couldn't get away from "

The Bills may have lost, but you know that Owens is thrilled with the result.    Fitzpatrick was pretty solid; he was 18-of-31 for 297 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (1 was late in the contest on a desperation 4.h down). Unlike Trent Edwards, Fitzpatrick didn't check it down every play. Still, we've seen that Fitzpatrick isn't the answer, so the Bills will be looking for a quarterback this offseason, no matter what happens the rest of the year.   "

Palmer was able to show nice touch on a couple of fades to Owens, as he seemed to realize that Owens is in fact his better receiver; not Chad Ochocinco. As for Ochocinco, he had 3 grabs for 59 yards. He committed an offensive pass-interference penalty on Cincinnati's final drive. He's just not the same guy he was last year, and I'd like to blame his lack of focus during the offseason. Next time, don't film multiple crap $10 reality TV shows.    I have to wonder why "

It's just amazing how he can keep doing this every single week. Brees finished 24-of-29 for 313 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The Saints probably could have ran away with a victory - they led 20-6 at 1 point - but they killed themselves with a with a whopping 11 penalties.    The Saints may not care when Pierre Thomas comes back. "
