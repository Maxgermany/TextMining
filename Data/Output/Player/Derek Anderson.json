Every time the Cardinals punted, I thought, Well, at least there was no turnover. - Arizona's only points in the first 29 minutes came off a Anderson interception. Every time the Cardinals punted, I thought, Well, at least there was no turnover. - Arizona's only points in the first 29 minutes came off a LaRod Stephens-Howling kickoff return for a touchdown. On that play, Ryan Longwell made the most pathetic attempt at a tackle that I've ever seen. He seemed to trip over his own legs and dive into the ground. It was a horrifying display, and I'll be very disappointed if it's not featured on <i> C'mon Man</i>. - The Cardinals had their way with the Vikings for the next 2 quarters. The turning point was a converted 3rd-and-19 on the Arizona 10-yard line in the final minutes of the first half. Before the play, I joked in the live in-games thread, The Cardinals will easily convert this. After the inexplicable 30-yard pass to Larry Fitzgerald, I added, Nah' mean? - Anderson (15-of-26, 179, TD) entered Sober Mode and did a good job of moving the chains until the 4.h quarter, particularly on throws to Fitzgerald (7-107). The Metro Dome crowd constantly booed the Vikings. - Beginning at the 12:40 mark of the 4.h quarter, Arizona possessed the ball for about only 5 of the next 17 minutes. When the Cardinals had the ball, Anderson weakly crumbled under Minnesota's heavy pressure (6 sacks). "

   "comment":"Derek Anderson possibly be victorious, on the road, with a depleted offensive line and receiving corps, against a team that was a rebound candidate this season? Well, it turned out that Anderson would actually be the superior quarterback in this game, and it wasn't even close. Josh McCown was atrocious. It's crazy because the Buccaneers brought in McCown to be a veteran presence at the signal-caller position, yet McCown played like some clueless rookie. He repeatedly threw the ball when he was getting hit. Like, literally when he was going down and taking a sack. This worked out once when he successfully flipped a reception to 1 of his targets, but it hurt him more than it helped him; 1 of McCown's 2 picks occurred as he was going down. Mccown finished 22-of-35 for just 183 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Extremely poor pass protection really hurt him all afternoon - Logan Mankins left the game in the second quarter with a knee injury - but McCown deserves a large amount of the blame for either holding on to the ball too long or doing stupid things like lofting careless passes while falling to the ground. McCown did have a nifty 13-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter to put his team in the red zone, but he also lost a fumble due to poor pocket awareness.    Tampa's inability to run the ball hurt McCown. Doug Martin managed just 9 yards on 9 carries, as he was constantly in and out of the game with a leg injury. He also dropped a pass. Losing Mankins in the second quarter was a huge blow. Martin's replacement, Bobby Rainey, cost his team a victory by fumbling on the team's real final offensive drive.    As you can imagine, Vincent Jackson was hurt by McCown's ineptitude. Jackson hauled in 4 balls for just 36 yards. Mike Evans outgained him by the minimal amount (5-37), though he had a touchdown wiped out because the officials ruled that he stepped out of the back of the end zone.    As mentioned, Derek Anderson was infinitely superior to McCown. A sober Anderson went 24-of-34 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Cam Newton watched from the sideline while he wasn't running into the huddle during TV timeouts. Anderson made just 2 mistakes in this contest. The first was missing Anderson possibly be victorious, on the road, with a depleted offensive line and receiving corps, against a team that was a rebound candidate this season? Well, it turned out that Anderson would actually be the superior quarterback in this game, and it wasn't even close. "

He could've had a second touchdown, but he overthrew Jason Avant in the end zone. Meanwhile, Kelvin Benjamin led the team in both catches (8) and receiving yards (115). He caught a late touchdown from Derek Anderson, which was a pretty, over-the-shoulder reception.

   "comment":"Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, Cam Newton completed 14-of-25 passes for 165 yards with a touchdown. Newton's footwork and accuracy were off all game. Derek Anderson was 17-of-23 for 172 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions.    Greg Olsen (6-76-1), Kelvin Benjamin (3-39-1) and Corey Brown (5-48-1) chipped in touchdowns for Carolina.    Atlanta's defense got a good game from "
