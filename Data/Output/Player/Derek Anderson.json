   "comment":"Derek Anderson would have defeated Palmer, that would have meant that an Oregon State alumnus would have knocked off a USC product as an underdog. The symmetry would have been awesome - though the Browns weren't a 25-point underdog that lost to crappy Stanford and was blowed out at Penn State.    Anyway, where did this Palmer injury come from? There was nothing during the week. He wasn't limited in practice. If it wasn't for Chris Mortensen, we wouldn't have found out Palmer was a scratch until kickoff.    Speaking of kickoff, I turned on CBS, expecting to see a good game. Unfortunately, the 2 announcers were previewing the Browns-Bengals. Seriously, whose brilliant idea was it to broadcast the Toilet Bowl, a battle between 2 0-3 squads? Someone needs to be fired for this.    I was also shocked that Romeo Crennel didn't bench Anderson after he tossed a pick in the red zone on the opening drive of the third quarter. Crennel didn't even trust Anderson enough to throw the ball on the opening possession of the game, which culminated in a field goal. Seven runs, no passes. If the Browns weren't playing the sorry Bungles, they would be 0-4 right now.    Anderson finished 15-of-24, 138 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He went to "

   "comment":"Derek Anderson drank from his magic flask. That's definitely a possibility. Here's another: Jamaal Charles had ZERO touches in the first quarter. By the time it was 21-3, Charles had 10 touches for 104 total yards (60 rushing, 44 receiving). You really have to wonder what's going through Todd Haley's mind sometimes. Charles finished with 126 total yards (88 rush, 38 rec.) Thomas Jones, however, wasn't a slouch, rushing for 71 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 attempts.    Matt Cassel's numbers weren't pretty (15-24, 193 yards, 2 TDs), but he made enough plays to carry the Chiefs to victory, including a 38-yard touchdown to Dwayne Bowe. Bowe hauled in 6 grabs for 109 yards and a pair of scores.    The Cardinals did an OK job to move the chains in their own territory, but seemed to bog down whenever they crossed midfield. They struggled to convert third downs (4-of-15) and committed way too many penalties (11).    Derek Anderson went 25-of-46 for 295 yards and a touchdown, though most of his yardage (and touchdown) came in junk time. Fitzgerald (6-90) caught the score, which actually happened on the last play of the game. Coincidentally, the touchdown put the game over the total.   "

   "comment":"Derek Anderson possibly be victorious, on the road, with a depleted offensive line and receiving corps, against a team that was a rebound candidate this season? Well, it turned out that Anderson would actually be the superior quarterback in this game, and it wasn't even close. Josh McCown was atrocious. It's crazy because the Buccaneers brought in McCown to be a veteran presence at the signal-caller position, yet McCown played like some clueless rookie. He repeatedly threw the ball when he was getting hit. Like, literally when he was going down and taking a sack. This worked out once when he successfully flipped a reception to 1 of his targets, but it hurt him more than it helped him; 1 of McCown's 2 picks occurred as he was going down. Mccown finished 22-of-35 for just 183 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Extremely poor pass protection really hurt him all afternoon - Logan Mankins left the game in the second quarter with a knee injury - but McCown deserves a large amount of the blame for either holding on to the ball too long or doing stupid things like lofting careless passes while falling to the ground. McCown did have a nifty 13-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter to put his team in the red zone, but he also lost a fumble due to poor pocket awareness.    Tampa's inability to run the ball hurt McCown. Doug Martin managed just 9 yards on 9 carries, as he was constantly in and out of the game with a leg injury. He also dropped a pass. Losing Mankins in the second quarter was a huge blow. Martin's replacement, Bobby Rainey, cost his team a victory by fumbling on the team's real final offensive drive.    As you can imagine, Vincent Jackson was hurt by McCown's ineptitude. Jackson hauled in 4 balls for just 36 yards. Mike Evans outgained him by the minimal amount (5-37), though he had a touchdown wiped out because the officials ruled that he stepped out of the back of the end zone.    As mentioned, Derek Anderson was infinitely superior to McCown. A sober Anderson went 24-of-34 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Cam Newton watched from the sideline while he wasn't running into the huddle during TV timeouts. Anderson made just 2 mistakes in this contest. The first was missing "

   "comment":"Derek Anderson eventually replaced him in the 4.h quarter, though the game was out of hand at that point. Newton's sole score went to Greg Olsen, who had 5 catches for 69 yards. He could've had a second touchdown, but he overthrew Jason Avant in the end zone. Meanwhile, Kelvin Benjamin led the team in both catches (8) and receiving yards (115). He caught a late touchdown from Derek Anderson, which was a pretty, over-the-shoulder reception.    Ron Rivera repeatedly said that DeAngelo Williams would play in this contest, but that didn't turn out to be the case. "

   "comment":"Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, Cam Newton completed 14-of-25 passes for 165 yards with a touchdown. Newton's footwork and accuracy were off all game. Derek Anderson was 17-of-23 for 172 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions.    Greg Olsen (6-76-1), Kelvin Benjamin (3-39-1) and Corey Brown (5-48-1) chipped in touchdowns for Carolina.    Atlanta's defense got a good game from "
