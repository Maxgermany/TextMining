The symmetry would have been awesome - though the Browns weren't a 25-point underdog that lost to crappy Stanford and was blowed out at Penn State.    Anyway, where did this Palmer injury come from? There was nothing during the week. He wasn't limited in practice. If it wasn't for Chris Mortensen, we wouldn't have found out Palmer was a scratch until kickoff.    Speaking of kickoff, I turned on CBS, expecting to see a good game. Unfortunately, the 2 announcers were previewing the Browns-Bengals. Seriously, whose brilliant idea was it to broadcast the Toilet Bowl, a battle between 2 0-3 squads? Someone needs to be fired for this.    I was also shocked that Romeo Crennel didn't bench Anderson after he tossed a pick in the red zone on the opening drive of the third quarter. Crennel didn't even trust Anderson enough to throw the ball on the opening possession of the game, which culminated in a field goal. Seven runs, no passes. If the Browns weren't playing the sorry Bungles, they would be 0-4 right now.    Anderson finished 15-of-24, 138 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He went to "

As time was expiring, Cleveland lined up for an improbable 54-yard field goal. If Cleveland tried the aforementioned kick, Phil Dawson's long attempt would have been a potential game-winner; not a tying try. Apparently, Romeo Crennel didn't want to go into overtime; I guess he was late for his Cookie Break.    Anyway, it should be no surprise that Anderson's pass failed.

Every time the Cardinals punted, I thought, Well, at least there was no turnover. - Arizona's only points in the first 29 minutes came off a LaRod Stephens-Howling kickoff return for a touchdown. On that play, Ryan Longwell made the most pathetic attempt at a tackle that I've ever seen. He seemed to trip over his own legs and dive into the ground. It was a horrifying display, and I'll be very disappointed if it's not featured on C'mon Man. - The Cardinals had their way with the Vikings for the next 2 quarters. The turning point was a converted 3rd-and-19 on the Arizona 10-yard line in the final minutes of the first half. Before the play, I joked in the live in-games thread, The Cardinals will easily convert this. After the inexplicable 30-yard pass to Larry Fitzgerald, I added, Nah' mean? - Anderson (15-of-26, 179, TD) entered Sober Mode and did a good job of moving the chains until the fourth quarter, particularly on throws to Fitzgerald (7-107). The Metro Dome crowd constantly booed the Vikings. - Beginning at the 12:40 mark of the fourth quarter, Arizona possessed the ball for about only 5 of the next 17 minutes. When the Cardinals had the ball, Anderson weakly crumbled under Minnesota's heavy pressure (6 sacks). "

   "comment":"Anderson drank from his magic flask. That's definitely a possibility. Here's another: Jamaal Charles had ZERO touches in the first quarter. By the time it was 21-3, Charles had 10 touches for 104 total yards (60 rushing, 44 receiving). You really have to wonder what's going through Todd Haley's mind sometimes. Charles finished with 126 total yards (88 rush, 38 rec.) Thomas Jones, however, wasn't a slouch, rushing for 71 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 attempts.    Matt Cassel's numbers weren't pretty (15-24, 193 yards, 2 TDs), but he made enough plays to carry the Chiefs to victory, including a 38-yard touchdown to Dwayne Bowe. Bowe hauled in 6 grabs for 109 yards and a pair of scores.    The Cardinals did an OK job to move the chains in their own territory, but seemed to bog down whenever they crossed midfield. They struggled to convert third downs (4-of-15) and committed way too many penalties (11).    Derek Anderson went 25-of-46 for 295 yards and a touchdown, though most of his yardage (and touchdown) came in junk time. Fitzgerald (6-90) caught the score, which actually happened on the last play of the game. Coincidentally, the touchdown put the game over the total.   "

   "comment":"Anderson took the first snap instead of Cam Newton. Ron Rivera said Newton was benched for the opening play because of a wardrobe violation, whatever that means.
