   "comment":"Fletcher. A few plays later, Foles rainbowed in a bomb to the end zone for a 47-yard touchdown pass to Cooper (4-120), who beat Johnthan Banks running down the sideline. After the Tampa Bay managed a field goal, Foles hit Cooper on a quick throw. Cooper then broke a tackle from Banks to race down the field for 44 yards. The next play saw Foles loft in a 36-yard touchdown pass after DeSean Jackson (6-64) beat Dashon Goldson and Mark Barron in zone coverage. The running of McCoy (25-116 rushing, 2-55 receiving) set up a field goal to ice the win for the Eagles.    Foles completed 22-of-31 passes for 296 yards with 3 touchdowns and a running score. He was superb, so Philadelphia has no reason to rush the other signal-caller back to the field.    Glennon didn't play poorly for Tampa Bay and was improved in his second start. He completed 26-of-43 passes for 273 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. The breakout star for the Buccaneers was tight end Tim Wright, who hauled in 91 yards on 7 receptions. Once again, the Bucs hurt themselves with penalties. They had 4 holdings and a critical offsides.    Defensively, Lavonte David was awesome for Tampa Bay with 9 tackles and a sack. Mason Foster and Gerald McCoy also played well for the Bucs.    The Eagles' defense got a great game from DeMeco Ryans (12 tackles). Fletcher Cox was very disruptive as he drew a hold and almost caused an interception on a hit of Glennon. "

This helped Dallas score a touchdown in the first quarter.    Only 2 other Cowboys had more than a couple of receptions: Jason Witten (7-69) and Cole Beasley (4-42).    DeMarco Murray has been dominant all year, but he's had trouble against Fletcher Cox and Philadelphia's strong defensive front in 2 performances. Murray had a nice 21-yard gain, but struggled for yardage otherwise, gaining 81 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 31 carries.    The Eagles have benefited from great special-teams plays all year, but that unit hurt them in this contest. The Cowboys started with a short opening kickoff that bounced in front of "
