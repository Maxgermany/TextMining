   "comment":"Paxton Lynch. Considering that it was his first NFL action, Lynch looked good on the field. He ended up going 14-of-24 for 170 yards and a touchdown in this contest. He was very comfortable in the pocket, and his throws were picturesque. He has a perfect spiral, and the ball just looks natural coming out of his hand. Lynch's accuracy was only decent, but it is clear that he has the skill set to be a top-level NFL starter. If Siemian misses any time with his injury, Lynch should not be much of a drop-off. He would be a potential QB2 with upside in fantasy.    Of course, Lynch did get some help from his stellar receiving corps. "

  "comment":"Paxton Lynch made his second career start for the Broncos, and many didn't think he'd be able to succeed, even against a bottom-five team like the Jaguars. Denver was favored by about 6 points prior to Trevor Siemian's announced injury, but the line dropped to 3.5 when it was clear that Lynch would start. The Broncos ended up winning, as Lynch prevailed against 1 of the league's worst teams, but it wasn't exactly the most convincing result. In fact, the Broncos won in spite of Lynch, as Denver's defense made Blake Bortles look even worse than he already is. Thanks to the performance of the Broncos' stop unit, any quarterback could've started for the Broncos and prevailed.    Paxton Lynch completed half of his passes, going 12-of-24 for only 104 yards. Lynch was inaccurate throughout the afternoon, beginning right away when he was way wide of "
