   "comment":"Lynch. Considering that it was his first NFL action, Lynch looked good on the field. He ended up going 14-of-24 for 170 yards and a touchdown in this contest. He was very comfortable in the pocket, and his throws were picturesque. He has a perfect spiral, and the ball just looks natural coming out of his hand. Lynch's accuracy was only decent, but it is clear that he has the skill set to be a top-level NFL starter. If Siemian misses any time with his injury, Lynch should not be much of a drop-off. He would be a potential QB2 with upside in fantasy.    Of course, Lynch did get some help from his stellar receiving corps. "

   "comment":"Lynch took 6 sacks. Vic Beasley was an absolute monster, registering 3.5 sacks and a forced fumble, as he had his way with right tackle Ty Sambrailo, who, according to the announcers, wasn't healthy. Still, Beasley was dominant, and it made Lynch's first start extremely miserable. Lynch finished 23-of-35 for 223 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also fumbled once, but managed to recover it. The stat line doesn't look bad, but that's because Lynch generated a bunch of his yards in garbage time. He had accuracy issues, as a number of his early throws were all over the place. He also should've been picked a second time, but "

   "comment":"Lynch made his second career start for the Broncos, and many didn't think he'd be able to succeed, even against a bottom-five team like the Jaguars. Denver was favored by about 6 points prior to Trevor Siemian's announced injury, but the line dropped to 3.5 when it was clear that Lynch would start. The Broncos ended up winning, as Lynch prevailed against 1 of the league's worst teams, but it wasn't exactly the most convincing result. In fact, the Broncos won in spite of Lynch, as Denver's defense made "
