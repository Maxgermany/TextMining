I want to make a note here that Mathieu had an outstanding performance, save for that penalty.    Both of Bradford's scores went to Cook, who had a monstrous outing. He caught 7 balls for 141 yards. As mentioned, he was so close to a third score. Austin also had a solid debut for the Rams. He snagged 6 receptions for 41 yards and also had that pass interference that he drew 38 yards downfield on Mathieu. "

   "comment":"Mathieu all missed time in this contest with what appeared to be serious injuries at first glance. Johnson was the first to get hurt. He left the field early right before halftime, but he was on the field to begin the third quarter. Palmer then banged his hand on Connor Barwin. His finger was dislocated, but the training staff was able to pop it into place, allowing Palmer to re-take the field after being out for several plays. Mathieu sustained an injury after an interception late in regulation, but he walked off under his own power. His status, however, is still up in the air. I don't understand why Mathieu was even on the field when the score was 40-17 with just 2 minutes remaining. I appreciate Arizona going hard at the end of the year to maintain momentum, but pressing the gas pedal too hard can definitely backfire.    Outside of the injuries, Johnson is certainly the lead story. The rookie supplanted an injured and ineffective Chris Johnson and has proven to be an incredible replacement. David Johnson gained 187 yards and 3 touchdowns on 29 carries to go along with 4 catches for 42 receiving yards, and those numbers don't even tell the entire story. Johnson broke numerous tackles, as the Eagles had major problems tackling him. He was so great on 1 of his touchdown runs that Cris Collinsworth exclaimed, That's worth of Beast Mode! Johnson is also terrific as a pass-catcher in the receiving game. It's remarkable that he's such a complete back this early in his career, and beyond his tackle-breaking ability, his patience is incredible.    Carson Palmer went 20-of-32 for 274 yards and a touchdown. The only reason he didn't post sterling fantasy numbers is because Johnson hogged all the scores. Palmer nearly had a deep touchdown early, but "

Those aren't horrible numbers, but keep in mind that he had a big chunk of his yardage in overtime. Wilson definitely did get better as the evening progressed, as he was 5-of-14 for 34 yards in the opening half. Maybe he doesn't have a new, undisclosed injury, but the offensive line is definitely a big problem. I was thinking Seattle's coaching staff would be able to remedy this issue during the bye as it has been able to in previous years, but apparently, that was not the case.    Wilson's targets didn't have quality numbers as a result of his struggles. Baldwin caught 6 balls for 69 yards, with 27 of those yards coming in overtime.
