   "comment":"Jaelen Strong scored twice. Pay no attention to that from a fantasy perspective. Those were Strong's only 2 receptions of the game, and 1 came on a fluky Hail Mary at the end of the first half. There was no 1 within 10 yards of Strong on the second score, thanks to a blown coverage.    The Texans appeared to be coached poorly in this game. They were extremely sloppy and were guilty of horrible penalties. There was a roughing-the-passer infraction on third-and-22, though that was a shaky call. Hopkins was whistled for taunting at 1 point. The worst sequence came on 1 drive when Houston was flagged for a face mask, a defensive hold that negated an interception, and 1 of the most obvious pass interferences you'll ever see. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
