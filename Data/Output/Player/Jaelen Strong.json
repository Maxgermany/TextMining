   "comment":"Strong scored twice. Pay no attention to that from a fantasy perspective. Those were Strong's only 2 receptions of the game, and 1 came on a fluky Hail Mary at the end of the first half. There was no 1 within 10 yards of Strong on the second score, thanks to a blown coverage.    The Texans appeared to be coached poorly in this game. They were extremely sloppy and were guilty of horrible penalties. There was a roughing-the-passer infraction on third-and-22, though that was a shaky call. Hopkins was whistled for taunting at 1 point. The worst sequence came on 1 drive when Houston was flagged for a face mask, a defensive hold that negated an interception, and 1 of the most obvious pass interferences you'll ever see. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Strong. On their next drive, they moved methodically down the field before Hoyer connected with Jonathan Grimes for a 14-yard touchdown. The Jaguars answered as blown coverage by Brian Cushing let Allen Robinson get open and take off down the field for a gain of 36 yards. That led to a Jacksonville field goal. Denard Robinson soon fumbled the ball away, and Watt recovered it in Jacksonville territory. A 25-yard run by Akeem Hunt set up a first-and-goal before Grimes scored his second touchdown on a short run to give the Texans a 17-3 lead. Just before the half, Andre Hal intercepted Blake Bortles with a great diving catch, and that set up a 51-yard field goal from Nick Novak and the Texans took a 20-3 lead into the half. Late in the third quarter, Hoyer had a bad pass off the mark that was deflected to Davon House for an interception. That set up the Jaguars inside the Texans' 20-yard line. On third down though, Watt beat Joeckel for a sack to force Jacksonville's other field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Jaguars tight end Marcedes Lewis took a screen pass for 45 yards to get into Houston territory. However, Watt beat Joeckel for a strip-sack and Mercilus caught the fumble in air to keep the Jaguars from getting back into the game. Alfred Blue ran the ball well to set up another Novak field goal from 50 yards out. Kareem Jackson then jumped a route to get a 27-yard pick-six to pad Houston's victory.    Brian Hoyer returned to the field after missing 2 games with a concussion and completed 25-of-40 passes for 249 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He had a decent outing.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 89 yards. Strong (6-56) is showing progress for the Texans.    Blue rushed for 102 yards on 21 carries. He had a run of 65 yards called back by a holding. Akeem Hunt looked good for the Texans with 3 carries for 28 yards and a catch for 27 yards. Hunt also had a 50-yard pass reception taken back by an incorrectly called penalty.    Bortles completed 17-of-32 for for 239 yards with 2 interceptions. He had no chance with the awful performance of his offensive line. The Jaguars had zero running game as "
