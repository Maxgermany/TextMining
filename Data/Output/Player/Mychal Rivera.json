The Seahawks responded with a 39-yard pass play to Lynch, who rumbled down the field, but the drive stalled, and Seattle had to settle for a field goal. Doug Baldwin then returned a punt 38 yards. Wilson scampered for 19 to convert a third down to set up another field goal. The Raiders got a drive going thanks to a face mask on Michael Bennett and a pass to Maurice Jones-Drew inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal just after the 2-minute warning, Carr connected with Rivera (8-38) for another touchdown off a play-action bootleg. It was close, but Seattle recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.    Wilson finished completing 17-of-35 passes for 179 yards. Marshawn Lynch had a huge day as Seattle's leading rusher with 21 carries for 67 yards and was the leading receiver with 5 receptions for 76 yards.

   "comment":"Rivera catching a 19-yard pass. On third-and-goal, Oakland went to a tackle-eligible play with a touchdown pass to Donald Penn. It was actually a nice catch by Penn, as the big lineman went low to make the reception. Late before the half, the 49ers got going with 2 passes to Anquan Boldin (4-54) for 36 yards. Kaepernick ran for 16 yards to set up a 52-yard field goal from Phil Dawson to tie the score at 10 entering the half. The 49ers put together a drive in the third quarter, but couldn't get a touchdown on a goal-to-go and had to settle for a field goal. Carr answered as he got red hot and carved up the San Francisco defense. He hit Andre Holmes (2-38) for 16 and Rivera for 27 yards. On third-and-1, Carr drilled Marcel Reese (7-64) for a 9-yard touchdown. After getting the ball back, Carr continued to be red hot as he ripped the ball through the 49ers' secondary, mainly using Reese and Rivera. Carr made another clutch throw on third and goal with a laser to Rivera, who caught the ball over a defensive back to put Oakland up 24-13. Kaepernick moved the ball into field goal range before "

By halftime, Carr was just 4-of-10 for 34 yards. He put together a nice drive in the third quarter, but didn't do anything positive otherwise. Carr completed just half of his passes, finishing 18-of-36 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception that was floated weakly toward the sideline. Carr needs help, perhaps with Amari Cooper in the 2015 NFL Draft.    The Raiders may want to add another running back as well, though perhaps just someone to complement Latavius Murray, who had a strong finish this season. Murray mustered just 37 yards on 10 carries in this contest, but made up for it by leading the team in receiving, catching 4 balls for 60 yards.    Save for Murray and Marcel Reece, Rivera was the Raiders' leader in receiving yardage, hauling in just 2 of his 8 targets for only 26 yards.   "
