   "comment":"Mychal Rivera early on hit a Denver defender in the back; it would've been an interception had the Bronco turned around. Carr then took a sack because held the ball too long. By halftime, Carr was just 4-of-10 for 34 yards. He put together a nice drive in the third quarter, but didn't do anything positive otherwise. Carr completed just half of his passes, finishing 18-of-36 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception that was floated weakly toward the sideline. Carr needs help, perhaps with Amari Cooper in the 2015 NFL Draft.    The Raiders may want to add another running back as well, though perhaps just someone to complement "
