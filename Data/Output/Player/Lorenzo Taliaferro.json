  "comment":"Lorenzo Taliaferro than his owners would have liked. Forsett gained 71 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries, while Taliaferro managed 35 yards on 7 attempts. Taliaferro actually got the offense going when it was sputtering with some nice runs, so Forsett's fantasy owners can't complain too much, especially considering his questionable tag heading into this contest.    Baltimore's defense needs to be given credit for this victory, as it surrendered just 3 points in the final 3 quarters without Ngata on the field. Rookie linebacker ",
