He had zero pressure in his face throughout despite Eugene Monroe's absence, allowing him to go 22-of-31 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, 2 of the scores went to Steve Smith.

Taliaferro actually got the offense going when it was sputtering with some nice runs, so Forsett's fantasy owners can't complain too much, especially considering his questionable tag heading into this contest.    Baltimore's defense needs to be given credit for this victory, as it surrendered just 3 points in the final 3 quarters without Ngata on the field. Rookie linebacker "
