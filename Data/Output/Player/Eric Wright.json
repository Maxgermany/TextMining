  "comment":"Eric Wright.    Kaepernick finished 15-of-29 for 175 yards with a score and an interception. He ran for 31 yards on 9 carries. Seattle's defense did a nice job of forcing field goals to keep the game close in the first half.    Wilson was 15-of-25 for 199 yards with a score and an interception. The 49ers allowed some yards, but came up with some clutch stops to get off the field. ",
