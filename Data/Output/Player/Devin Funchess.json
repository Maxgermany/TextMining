Newton looked as strong as ever and was able to bounce off defenders and find open space. He needs to continue to do that to succeed.    In the run game, Jonathan Stewart led the way for the Panthers. He saw 14 carries and was able to turn them into 68 yards. Stewart found holes in the defense, and his offensive line did a good job of blocking the Patriots' weak defensive line. Rookie Christian McCaffrey only got 16 yards on 6 carries. He struggled to fight through stronger defenders close to the line of scrimmage, but showed promise in the passing game (4 catches, 33 yards).    Newton's top receiver in this contest was Funchess. The former second-round pick saw a team-high 9 targets and turned them into 7 catches for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns. Funchess displayed much better route-running skills than he has demonstrated in the past and was able to make catches over the Patriots' defensive backs thanks to his size. Funchess is a player who should be added in fantasy, as he will be the team's No. 2 receiver and receive a lot of targets. He could end up being a WR3 if he continues to improve. "
