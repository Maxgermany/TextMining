   "comment":"Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.
