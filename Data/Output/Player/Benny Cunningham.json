The Rams were able to upset the defending Super Bowl champions last week because of some dynamic special-teams plays. The script completely flipped just a week later, as their special teams betrayed them in this blowout. It began innocently enough early when they missed a field goal from just 38 yards. The Chiefs then hit a longer field goal. What changed this entire game though was a kickoff return to begin the second half. This was a tight, 10-7 affair until "

One was a botched snap near midfield, while the other was the aforementioned Seattle touchdown that appeared to give the Seahawks a victory. I'm interested to see how Foles plays going forward. A 34-point showing versus Seattle is impressive on the surface, but the Seahawks played terribly defensively. They couldn't generate a pass rush for the most part, and they inexplicably gave up big gains after short throws, primarily to Cunningham. That would explain how Cunningham generated 77 receiving yards on 4 catches (to go along with his 45 rushing yards on 16 carries). On 1 instance, Cunningham picked up a third-and-15 on a screen. The Seahawks from 2014 and before would never have allowed something like that. It's not like they allowed this to Todd Gurley. Cunningham won't even be on the field in a few weeks.

This may go down as 1 of the worst challenges of all time, as Fox inexplicably took away a scoring opportunity from his team.    Mitchell Trubisky went 21-of-35 for 297 yards and a score. He opened the game well, making a nice third-down conversion to "
