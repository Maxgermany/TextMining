He beat Gonzalez twice, as well as right guard Peter Konz and left tackle Lamarr Holmes to total 4 sacks. Hardy was an animal. Carolina has to pull out all the stops to re-sign the 2010 6.h-round pick. The Panthers also got sacks from Frank Alexander, Star Lotulelei, Mike Mitchell and Charles Johnson (2 sacks).Mitchell.
