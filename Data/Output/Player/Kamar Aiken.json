The good news is that Mallett should've had another score, but the ball barely hit the ground when Butler appeared to catch it. The bad news is that Mallett's 2.pick performance could've been way worse. The Bengals dropped 2 routine interceptions. Only 1 of his turnovers was consequential, however, as the first pick was a lazy toss on a screen play. The second came in desperation time, and the Ravens stupidly tackled the Cincinnati defender to end the game. Overall though, Mallett looked good. There are reports that he has turned his life around, so he deserves a chance to be Joe Flacco's backup. However, I don't trust Mallett to stay clean. We'll see if he has a positive offseason, but I'm not optimistic.    Mallett spread the ball around, as 5 players saw at least as many targets. Those were: Aiken (5-76), Butler (6-57), Maxx Williams (6-53), Chris Matthews (4-51) and Buck Allen (6-32)."
