   "comment":"Smith had absolutely no running lanes to work with. He had just 22 yards on 12 carries.    Jeff Fisher challenged a 20-yard Johnson reception when his team was up 47-10 in the fourth quarter. The play stood, but Fisher was booed by the 20 people still left in the crowd. Hey Jeff, the Jerk Store called...    Ever since the Lions jumped out to a 17-0 lead against the Buccaneers, they've been outscored, 85-13. That's in a 7-quarter span!    With this loss, the Lions have clinched last place in the NFC North. No word yet on when the parade will take place.   "

Though they lost, I have to congratulate the Browns, who discovered the forward pass on Sunday. Despite scoring just 5 offensive touchdowns in the past 15 games, the Browns posted 24 points in the first quarter alone. That output was a franchise record for Cleveland (including the old Browns) for most points in a first quarter. Brian Sipe and Jim Brown have nothing on "

   "comment":"Smith scored a late backdoor touchdown to cover the spread for Detroit.    The Lions simply couldn't sustain drives. They had only 14 first downs and were just 2-of-11 on third downs. They lost the time-of-possession battle by more than 19 minutes. Of course, Matthew Stafford's interceptions didn't help. Along with his 11-of-26 for 143 yards, he tossed 2 picks. He also took 3 sacks. The good news is Stafford connected on a beautiful 54-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson in the first quarter. Megatron, meanwhile, finished with 6 grabs for 123 yards and a score. The bad news is that Stafford re-aggravated his shoulder injury. There's a good chance he'll miss next week's game at Baltimore.    Smith, who scored the awesome backdoor touchdown, rushed for 75 yards on 16 attempts. He also had 2 catches for 29 more yards.    As for Smith's counterpart, "

The Raiders were ready to seize on the change of field position as a 13-yard gain to Kevin Boss putting them in plus territory. Heyward-Bey caught a pass over the middle and looked like he would shake tackles and possibly score until Justin Durant forced a fumble that Alphonso Smith recovered. Once again a scoring opportunity went by the boards. After forcing a punt, the Oakland offense chipped away with a feisty drive featuring a handful of short Bush runs and 2 modest pass plays to get Janikowski close enough for a 51-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter for a 20-14 lead. Backed up and trailing, Detroit was in passing mode. Stafford threw incomplete twice and then lost a fumble when Kelly got to him. "

   "comment":"Smith. Just before halftime, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 14-yard score. The first half ended with the Detroit up 24-0. It was utter domination on both sides of the ball by the Lions. The Chargers' offense couldn't get into any rhythm. The line was allowing some pressure while the receivers weren't getting open for Philip Rivers. San Diego's pass rush stank, and Stafford had good time to throw all afternoon. The Chargers' secondary was pitiful with receivers running wide open constantly. Apparently, Norv Turner turned over a table or 2 in the locker room, because the Chargers played with better execution and a sense of urgency in the third quarter. Their offense was finally able to move down the field. A beautiful 1-handed catch by Antonio Gates was called back by a penalty, but Rivers kept advancing the ball. He finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. San Diego then caught the Lions' special teams napping with an onside kick that was recovered by Eric Weddle. Rivers hit Floyd for a gain of 30 to the Detroit 3-yard line after he beat Chris Houston running downfield. Houston bounced back to break up a pass in the end zone on third-and-goal so the Chargers had to settle for a field goal. The Lions answered by moving the ball down the field and Smith running into the end zone from 6 yards out. Detroit was up 31-10 entering the fourth quarter. San Diego followed up with another promising drive, moving the ball down the field. However, Houston had another good pass breakup in the end zone. The Lions' stand forced a fourth-and-goal from the 3 that fell incomplete. Houston would kill another drive by intercepting a jump ball at the goal line. He returned it 43 yards and the pick sealed the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished the afternoon 29-of-36 for 373 yards and 3 touchdowns. Pettigrew (9-80), Johnson (4-102) and Nate Burleson (6-83) all had good games. For San Diego, Rivers completed 28-of-53 passes for 299 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Floyd (6-95) led the Chargers in receiving with Gates (4-40) contributing. He became the franchise's all-time receptions leader in this loss, passing Charlie Joiner.    It was a huge win for the Lions as they clinched their first playoff appearance since 1999. Congratulations to the long-suffering Lions fans who finally get to see their team play in the postseason after a long drought.   "
