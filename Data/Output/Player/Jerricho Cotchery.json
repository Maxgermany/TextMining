To wrap things up, I want to talk about the NFL overtime system. While it's much better than the ridiculous crap in college football, I think it sucks that a team can win on a simple field goal. I think they should play an unlimited amount of time, where the game ends when either squad scores at least 5 points. That can be 2 field goals. That can be a safety and a field goal. And that can obviously be a touchdown. This isn't sour grapes because the Jets probably would have reach the end zone anyway, but I firmly believe that the NFL should repair its overtime system.   "

   "comment":"Jerricho Cotchery and then missed a wide-open Cotchery for a touchdown following intermission. He was guilty of a horrible error late when throwing an interception on a pass fired behind his receiver while running the clock out with 3 minutes remaining. It was a lazy pass, and it was especially bad because it occurred on a first down. I have no idea what Carolina was doing even throwing the ball on that play. Newton finished 15-of-30 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick to go along with his rushing total. He completed 5 passes longer than 20 yards against Green Bay's depleted secondary. He could've put together an even better day had he not missed "

   "comment":"Jerricho Cotchery with a dart to move the sticks on a third-and-17. On the same drive, which culminated in a touchdown, thanks to a Dallas unsportsmanlike penalty on a made field goal, Newton found Cotchery again on a third-and-10. Cotchery avoided a tackle to pick up the first down. Newton plunged into the end zone a couple of plays later.    Only 2 Panthers accumulated at least 70 receiving yards. Those were Cotchery (5-73) and Olsen (5-70). The latter could've had a better fantasy outing, but he dropped a touchdown.    "
