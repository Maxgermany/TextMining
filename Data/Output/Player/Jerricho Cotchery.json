To wrap things up, I want to talk about the NFL overtime system. While it's much better than the ridiculous crap in college football, I think it sucks that a team can win on a simple field goal. I think they should play an unlimited amount of time, where the game ends when either squad scores at least 5 points. That can be 2 field goals. That can be a safety and a field goal. And that can obviously be a touchdown. This isn't sour grapes because the Jets probably would have reach the end zone anyway, but I firmly believe that the NFL should repair its overtime system.   "

Rashard Mendenhall got the drive going with a 26-yard catch after getting wide open. Wallace ran another good end around, and a pass to Heath Miller put the Steelers on the door step of the end zone. Mendenhall scored from 2 yards out. Down 14-0, Andy Dalton answered. He moved to his left and aired the ball out into the end zone. A.J. Green was in double coverage, but the big rookie jumped over the 2 defenders to make a great 36-yard touchdown catch. Green was injured on the play and that was his only reception of the game. He was on the field on the next Cincinnati possession and ran the ball for 7 yards, but was favoring his knee. Pittsburgh's next possession saw the Bengals get opportunistic when cornerback Leon Hall intercepted a bobbled ball. That set up Cincinnati at the Steelers' 41-yard line. The Bengals had to settle for a 43-yard field goal from Mike Nugent. Just before halftime, the Steelers put together a good drive with Roethlisberger moving the ball through the air. He hit some big throws to Antonio Brown to move the ball into Cincinnati territory. A second touchdown pass to Cotchery was called back due to an offensive pass interference penalty on Miller. The Bengals' defensive line came through with their third sack of the first half on third down to force a field goal. Pittsburgh was up 17-10 at halftime. Unfortunately, Hall suffered a ruptured Achilles' tendon against the Steelers and will miss the rest of the season. It is a devastating injury for the Bengals. He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with "

Jonathan Stewart had a disappointing performance after his awesome display at New Orleans last week. Stewart mustered 73 yards on 22 carries, but really hurt his team - and those who bet on the Panthers - with a lost fumble inside the Tampa Bay 5-yard line.    Speaking of fumbling, Josh McCown let 2 balls slip out of his hands in what was the worst showing for a quarterback on Sunday afternoon if it wasn't for Johnny Manziel. One of the fumbles came in the third quarter and led to Anderson's touchdown to Cotchery. McCown finished 13-of-28 for 154 yards, 1 passing touchdown and an interception. He also scored on a 16-yard rush for a back-door cover late in the game. However, McCown was otherwise hideous in the second half, going just 7-of-18 for 86 yards after intermission.    The Buccaneers didn't have many offensive plays worth noting, though 2 came on 1 drive. "

This continued until the Panthers actually moved into field goal position to make this a 2-score affair. Of course, Carolina's defense is primarily responsible for this victory.
