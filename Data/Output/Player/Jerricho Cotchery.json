To wrap things up, I want to talk about the NFL overtime system. While it's much better than the ridiculous crap in college football, I think it sucks that a team can win on a simple field goal. I think they should play an unlimited amount of time, where the game ends when either squad scores at least 5 points. That can be 2 field goals. That can be a safety and a field goal. And that can obviously be a touchdown. This isn't sour grapes because the Jets probably would have reach the end zone anyway, but I firmly believe that the NFL should repair its overtime system.   "

After that, the Panthers took over deep in their own territory in the 4.h quarter, yet managed to convert third down after third down to keep the ball away from Jacksonville. Newton completed a pass to Cotchery (4-45, TD), who fought to get beyond the marker. Newton then scrambled for a first down. This continued until the Panthers actually moved into field goal position to make this a 2.score affair. Of course, Carolina's defense is primarily responsible for this victory. It didn't look good when "
