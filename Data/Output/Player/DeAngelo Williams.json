Tampa Bay was ready to play and the Panthers were sleep walking through the first half. The Buccaneers' defense played tough for 4 quarters and carried the team to a win. The Bucs' defensive line deserves a lot of the credit, especially defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He had a superb game, blowing up runs and rushing the quarterback. On the flip side, the Panthers' offensive line was atrocious. It didn't protect Newton well and was God-awful in run blocking. Carolina's offense couldn't extend drives, and as result, Tampa Bay dominated the time of possession. The Panthers had minus-1 yard rushing at halftime and finished with only 10 yards total on the ground. DeAngelo Williams had minus-1 yards on 6 carries. If Carolina's line doesn't pick up its play, it is going to be a painful season for the running game. The Bucs produced timely turnovers with interceptions by "

   "comment":"DeAngelo Williams has a more productive afternoon than his counterpart, but that was the case in this contest. Williams mustered 76 yards on 16 carries. Unfortunately, Williams was the Panther most responsible for this loss. He fumbled the ball on the Seattle 8-yard line with about 5 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. It's obviously unclear if the Panthers would've found the end zone, but they would have had a great chance with a first-and-goal inside the 10-yard line. Instead, Seattle took over and never relinquished possession.    "

The team was whistled for 9 infractions, most of which came at crucial moments. Once again, the Panthers were expected to play better coming off a bye. The fact that they struggled like this is an indication that they're poorly coached.    Carson Palmer outplayed Newton, but only by default. Whereas Newton was guilty of 4 turnovers, Palmer gave the ball away just 3 times. He similarly threw a pick at the goal line, coincidentally on the drive following Newton's aforementioned first interception. Another pick happened because Palmer didn't see "

There's little doubt this Steelers team wouldn't even have an inkling of a chance this season without the play of 31-year old backup Williams, and they can probably thank Le'Veon Bell's pot suspension for them going after Williams last offseason.    So, the Steelers had no trouble putting up big yardage on the Raiders, but the Raiders also had a pretty easy time of it themselves. "

He nearly had a fifth score midway through the final quarter, but Martavis Bryant dropped a pass that was only slightly high.    Having a strong running game to support Roethlisberger was huge. DeAngelo Williams was fantastic, trampling the Colts for 134 yards on 26 carries. Cris Collinsworth gushed all night at how incredible Williams' vision and cutting ability were. He's not even close to the same running back we saw in Carolina. Williams told the media that he finally figured things out; he's now apparently running with his feet instead of his head. It works, apparently, as Williams ripped off quality run after quality run.    The Colts eventually figured out that they couldn't double team "

   "comment":"DeAngelo Williams went in from 1 yard out to make it 13-10 Baltimore, but Roethlisberger was intercepted again early in the 4.h quarter, which set up a short field for Mallett, who hit St. Louis castoff Chris Givens for a 39-yard gain and then Kyle Juszczyk for a 34-yard gain, which set Javorius Allen up for a 3-yard touchdown run and a 20-10 lead.    Allen was the workhorse for the Baltimore offense, rushing 18 times for 79 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 35 yards. The Steelers hadn't allowed an opposing running back to total 100 or more yards against them since Week 7 and had allowed only 3 rushing touchdowns to running backs all season. The Ravens imposed their will on even the best part of the Steelers' defense.    DeAngelo Williams was easily the best offensive player for the Steelers, as he carried the ball 17 times for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also caught all 6 of his targets for 53 yards. Both of his touchdowns were set up by pass interference calls, which were Pittsburgh's main mode of offense.    Roethlisberger was sacked 3 times and called what should have been unnecessary timeouts, while completing 24-of-34 passes for 215 yards, no touchdowns and 2 interceptions. It was a poor performance by him and the offense as a whole.    The Steelers are still in the playoff hunt, but they no longer control if they get in or not. After the Jets upset the Patriots on Sunday, the Steelers now need to beat the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland (which seemed like a given just last week), and they'll need Rex Ryan to exact some revenge on his old team as his Buffalo Bills will host the New York Jets in what could be a win and they're in game.

Jones had a good statistical day, completing 24-of-37 targets for 277 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, but the Browns' mistakes are what gave the Steelers a chance to win.

The Browns then had a chance to win the game with a minute in regulation, when Isaiah Crowell fumbled the ball away, sending the game into overtime. At this point, you wouldn't think the Browns could mess up anymore than that, but overtime brought some more miscues.
