Those weren't any ordinary 5 carries; Fox gave Goodson the touches inside Tampa Bay's 5-yard line. Goodson failed to get in, which could have brought the game to within 1 score with about 5 minutes remaining. I really don't understand this. Why shy away from Stewart (or Williams) on the goal line? Did Stewart score too many touchdowns last year?    Steve Smith had 3 catches for 66 yards and a score."

Tampa Bay was ready to play and the Panthers were sleep walking through the first half. The Buccaneers' defense played tough for 4 quarters and carried the team to a win. The Bucs' defensive line deserves a lot of the credit, especially defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He had a superb game, blowing up runs and rushing the quarterback. On the flip side, the Panthers' offensive line was atrocious. It didn't protect Newton well and was God-awful in run blocking. Carolina's offense couldn't extend drives, and as result, Tampa Bay dominated the time of possession. The Panthers had minus-1 yard rushing at halftime and finished with only 10 yards total on the ground. DeAngelo Williams had minus-1 yards on 6 carries. If Carolina's line doesn't pick up its play, it is going to be a painful season for the running game.

Unfortunately, Williams was the Panther most responsible for this loss. He fumbled the ball on the Seattle 8-yard line with about 5 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. It's obviously unclear if the Panthers would've found the end zone, but they would have had a great chance with a first-and-goal inside the 10-yard line. Instead, Seattle took over and never relinquished possession.    Williams bomb was dropped. Wilson also scrambled 5 times, but for only 7 yards.    Wilson's favorite target was Doug Baldwin, who caught 7 balls for 91 yards. That's a nice stat line, but Baldwin isn't talented enough to maintain this type of production. Golden Tate (4-51) and Sidney Rice (2-31) will lead their team in receiving yards on a week-to-week basis.    Carolina's vaunted front 7 will stymie effective ground attacks all season. That's what the team did to Marshawn Lynch, who managed just 43 yards on 17 carries.

   "comment":"DeAngelo Williams did to New England's stop unit in the season opener. McCoy gained 89 yards on 15 carries and caught all 3 of his targets for 27 receiving yards. McCoy had a great opening drive, but did nothing afterward, as the Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and Charles Clay (3-19). The former isn't worth rostering in 12-team leagues. Clay is an OK tight end, but you can usually do better.    LeSean McCoy had a decent outing overall, but it was disappointing after what DeAngelo Williams did to New England's stop unit in the season opener. McCoy gained 89 yards on 15 carries and caught all 3 of his targets for 27 receiving yards. McCoy had a great opening drive, but did nothing afterward, as the "

   "comment":"DeAngelo Williams after a 59-yard reception by Antonio Brown.Williams after a 59-yard reception by Antonio Brown. Williams ended up with a whopping 3 touchdowns, all within 2 yards of the goal line.    Roethlisberger completed 77.8 percent of his passes and averaged 13.7 yards per attempt while taking no sacks. It was a masterful display helped out by the 49ers' defensive line's ineptitude at putting much pressure on him.    Roethlisberger's No. 1 target was, surprise, surprise, Antonio Brown. He caught big passes all day long and piled up 9 receptions on 11 targets for 195 yards and a touchdown. This of course, is nothing new, but 195 yards is nothing to sneeze at. It was Brown's second-best career total; his first was 196 yards against Chicago in 2013. Brown now hasn't caught fewer than 5 receptions in a game since 2012.    The 49ers took too long to get their offense moving, but they did put up plenty of yardage when trying to make up the 27-point deficit. Kaepernick was the biggest beneficiary as he threw the ball 46 times, completing 33 for 335 yards and 2 touchdowns, while leading the team in rushing with 8 carries for 51 yards. He also had 1 touchdown run overturned by review.    Kaepernick's 71.7 completion percentage on 46 pass attempts makes for a nice stat and also shows you just how bad the Steelers' pass defense is. His completions were pretty spread out with "

In the third quarter, Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun picked off Jones and wended his way all the way back for a touchdown, or what appeared to be a touchdown, until review showed he fumbled into the end zone and out of bounds before crossing the goal line, causing a touchback. The Steelers then went 80 yards down the field and scored on a 1.yard touchdown run by DeAngelo Williams. The Browns went from what should have been a 2.touchdown lead to a tie game. The Browns then had a chance to win the game with a minute in regulation, when Isaiah Crowell fumbled the ball away, sending the game into overtime. At this point, you wouldn't think the Browns could mess up anymore than that, but overtime brought some more miscues.
