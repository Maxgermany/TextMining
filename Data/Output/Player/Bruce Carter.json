   "comment":"Bruce Carter.    Romo finished completing 20-of-27 for 246 yards with 3 touchdowns. He was off on a few throws in his return to the lineup, but playing a last-place team is good for shaking the rust off.    Bortles completed 22-of-37 for 290 yards with an interception. He had another pick taken away by a penalty. That being said, Bortles did make a number of good reads and throws. He looked improved over other performances in recent weeks.    The Cowboys controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. The Jaguars' offensive line was awful. "
