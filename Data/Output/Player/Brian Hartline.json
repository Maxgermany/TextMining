   "comment":"Hartline, setting up Ricky Williams for a 4-yard touchdown. With Miami up 34-24 and taking 6.5, I thought my bet was safe. Nope. In a span of 5 minutes, Brees led the Saints on 2 touchdown drives. Fortunately, John Carney missed an extra point, so a later field goal made it a 6-point game. With 3:23 remaining, my +6.5 5-unit play was still safe. Down 6. Henne drove the Dolphins to their 41. After a penalty and 2 incomplete passes (1 via a Ricky Williams drop), Henne tossed a desperation heave, allowing Tracy Porter to intercept it and returned the ball 54 yards for a pick-six. You've gotta be kidding me. Not only did the Dolphins blow a 24-3 lead, they also allowed a pick-six to lose the cover. But it gets worse... Miami somehow put together a drive to get down to the Saints 26. Henne lofted a beautiful pass to Ted Ginn Jr. in the end zone, but Ginn dropped it (more on this later). On the next play, Henne connected with Hartline for an 18-yard pass down to the Saints 8-yard line. With time ticking down, Henne spiked the ball with 1 second on the clock. The Dolphins seemed to have 1 more play, but Parry, who wanted to ensure that New Orleans would cover, suddenly stopped Miami when the team walked up to the line of scrimmage and announced that 1 of the Dolphins wideouts was not lined up properly on the previous spike, meaning the game was over. Congrats, Parry, you crook. I hope you won a ton of money.    With a game like this, a lot of people deserve a ton of blame. Here's my top 5. 5. Chad Henne - Thanks for the 2 pick-sixes. Henne is low on this list because he played well early, but he sure took his jolly good time in the final few minutes when Miami was trying to get a backdoor score. 4. Tony Sparano - If you're a coach on any level reading this, take note: DO NOT CALL A TIMEOUT WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING AT THE END OF A HALF ON THE 1-YARD LINE WHEN THE OTHER TEAM HAS ITS FIELD GOAL TEAM OUT THERE. As soon as Sparano called his timeout, I yelled, F*** you at the TV because I knew what was coming. 3. God - Players thank God for a win. I'm blaming God for this loss and blown cover. It was that bad. Actually, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't blame God. So... 3. "

   "comment":"Hartline on the sidelines. Henne took Miami inside the Cleveland 10-yard line just before halftime, but Miami had to settle for a field goal and a 10-7 halftime lead. In the second half, Henne generally moved the ball well against Cleveland, which is a credit to him because his pass protection was lacking. He made some plays with his legs and distributed the ball pretty well. Miami and Henne did not finish drives and had too many possessions fizzle out or settle for easy field goals rather than getting in the end zone. On the last drive of the game Henne got to midfield when he overthrew his receiver on 4.h-and-10 and was intercepted by safety Mike Adams. Henne completed 19-of-29 passes for 255 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was an incomplete game from Henne, but not a horrible performance especially when you consider the Dolphins struggles in pass protection.    Miami got a good game out of Thomas as he ran for 95 yards on 23 carries. Thomas also caught 3 passes for 27 yards. Even though he wasn't shorted carries, Miami probably should have gotten the ball to Thomas more as he was running well in the second half. Bush ran for 24 yards on 11 carries and was ineffective. He caught 1 pass for 12 yards.    Hartline led Miami in receiving with 4 catches for 87 yards. "

Well, I guess I should congratulate the Dolphins on a valiant effort. The Cardinals were missing stud defensive lineman Darnell Dockett, but Tannehill's stat line of 26-of-41 for 431 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions was impressive nonetheless. Tannehill, who misfired on numerous long attempts against the Jets last week, connected on multiple long bombs to Hartline. However, he made what would be the game-losing pick in overtime, heaving the ball carelessly as he was hit. It's worth noting that Tannehill was actually intercepted on a third occasion just after halftime, but the turnover was wiped away because of a shaky call on "

   "comment":"Hartline (4-60) for a few completions just before halftime. The second-year signal-caller then tossed a nice back-shoulder touchdown to Charles Clay. Clay (3-52) had a nice game with a 45-yard reception that set up a field goal in the second half. In the third quarter, Torrey Smith (6-121) drew a pass interfence on Ben Grimes in the end zone. Rice (27-74 rushing, 6-28 receiving) plunged into the end zone on the next play. That gave the Ravens a 16-13 lead. He added to it with his second short touchdown run. With Baltimore up 23-16 midway through the 4.h quarter, Flacco had a pass deflected by Dion Jordan. Dolphins' safety Reshad Jones tracked it down like a punt and raced 25 yards into the end zone to tie the game. Rice started getting better gains on the ground late in the game and Smith made a leaping 14-yard catch to set up Justin Tucker for the game-winning field goal from 44 yards out. Down by 3 with 2 minutes remaining, Miami had 1 more shot. On a 4.h-and-10 deep in his own territory, Tannehill dodged a sack and rolled out to loft in a beautiful 46-yard pass to Brandon Gibson (4-74). Tyson Clabo was beaten by Elvis Dumervil for a critical sack that made the final field goal attempt about 5 yards longer and Caleb Sturgis missed the 57-yarder.    Flacco finished 19-of-32 for 269 yards with zero touchdowns and a pick-six. Bernard Pierce (11-46) and Tandon Doss (3-58) contributed.    Tannehill was 21-of-40 for 307 yards with a score. Wallace, Clay and Hartline all had costly dropped passes. However, the offensive line was the biggest liability for the Dolphins as the team had only 22 yards rushing on the ground. "

The second was a non-defensive pass interference in which Hartline was mugged. As this happened, I posted the following in the live in-game thread: Haha holy ****, and that Hartline offensive pass interference warranted a flag? The third set up Miami in field-goal range for the game-tying kick at the end of regulation. Hartline made a great, 21-yard diving catch along the sideline, but replay seemed to show that his second foot never landed inbounds. The play was never reviewed.    I mentioned that both teams tried to blow this game. Miami's mistakes were Miller's lost fumble and an errant chip-shot, 34-yard field goal by kicker "

The Dolphins actually trailed going into the second quarter, but then reality set in. Tannehill caught fire against Oakland's putrid defense and was close to perfect for the remainder of the first half. He misfired just once until intermission, going 17-of-19 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've had a huge statistical day had the Raiders been remotely competitive, but the Dolphins took the air out of the ball with such a big lead. Tannehill ended up finishing 23-of-31 for 278 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Consistency has always been an issue for him, so maintaining this success will be a challenge. It should, however, quiet all discussion of "

   "comment":"Hartline. The next 2 were fumbles. The initial 1 occurred when he was running around like an idiot and stripped as a consequence. The second happened on a blind-side strip-sack. The trio of turnovers were transformed into 14 points from Jets, meaning the score would've been 17-10, had Manziel not been careless. Perhaps the Browns could've mounted a comeback in a 1.score affair, but Manziel gave them no chance.    Having said that, I don't want to completely ignore what the Jets accomplished because they do deserve some credit for this victory. They had key contributions from their prominent players, including "

He took a sack on a 4.h-and-11 in the opening half, though I'm not sure why Pettine had his team go for it in the first place. Davis also botched a later 4.h-and-1, though 2 Cleveland players collided with each other. Davis then heaved an interception, targeting no 1 in particular, and he followed that up by completely botching the 2-minute drill. Repeating what he did Monday night, Davis wasted time, prompting the crowd to boo mercilessly. Despite this, Pettine didn't make the change to Johnny Manziel. Davis finished 25-of-38 for 230 yards and the pick. Much of those positive numbers came in garbage time. The Browns didn't seem to show any interest in playing hard for Davis, and it appears as though Pettine has lost the locker room.
