In the second half, Henne generally moved the ball well against Cleveland, which is a credit to him because his pass protection was lacking. He made some plays with his legs and distributed the ball pretty well. Miami and Henne did not finish drives and had too many possessions fizzle out or settle for easy field goals rather than getting in the end zone. On the last drive of the game Henne got to midfield when he overthrew his receiver on 4.h-and-10 and was intercepted by safety "

The second was a non-defensive pass interference in which Hartline was mugged. As this happened, I posted the following in the live in-game thread: Haha holy ****, and that Hartline offensive pass interference warranted a flag? The third set up Miami in field-goal range for the game-tying kick at the end of regulation. Hartline made a great, 21-yard diving catch along the sideline, but replay seemed to show that his second foot never landed inbounds. The play was never reviewed.    I mentioned that both teams tried to blow this game. Miami's mistakes were Miller's lost fumble and an errant chip-shot, 34-yard field goal by kicker "

Tannehill caught fire against Oakland's putrid defense and was close to perfect for the remainder of the first half. He misfired just once until intermission, going 17-of-19 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've had a huge statistical day had the Raiders been remotely competitive, but the Dolphins took the air out of the ball with such a big lead. Tannehill ended up finishing 23-of-31 for 278 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Consistency has always been an issue for him, so maintaining this success will be a challenge.

He took a sack on a 4.h-and-11 in the opening half, though I'm not sure why Pettine had his team go for it in the first place. Davis also botched a later 4.h-and-1, though 2 Cleveland players collided with each other. Davis then heaved an interception, targeting no 1 in particular, and he followed that up by completely botching the 2-minute drill. Repeating what he did Monday night, Davis wasted time, prompting the crowd to boo mercilessly. Despite this, Pettine didn't make the change to Johnny Manziel. Davis finished 25-of-38 for 230 yards and the pick. Much of those positive numbers came in garbage time. The Browns didn't seem to show any interest in playing hard for Davis, and it appears as though Pettine has lost the locker room.
