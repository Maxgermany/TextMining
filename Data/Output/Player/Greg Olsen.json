   "comment":"Greg Olsen, the Bears receivers couldn't catch anything. In fact, Olsen, the Bears receivers couldn't catch anything. In fact, Rashied Davis dropped a pass that deflected into the arms of a Saints defensive back. Orton was also horrific, going 24-of-40 for 172 yards, including a telegraphed pass to New Orleans linebacker Scott Fujita. Worst of all, the Bears couldn't get the running game going. It didn't even look like they wanted to. I know Matt Forte left the game in the first quarter with a toe injury, which must have scared all of his fantasy owners half to death, but he came back in the beginning of the second quarter. At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

Newton dropped in a bomb for 51 yards to Louis Murphy after he beat Talib down the field with 5 minutes in the 4.h quarter. The drive stalled inside the 5.yard line and Carolina settled for a field goal.    Tampa Bay ran out the clock with Martin to seal the win for new head coach Greg Schiano.

That made the score 21-14 for Chicago heading into halftime. In the third quarter, the Panthers drove down the field whil being aided by some terrible penalties that went against the Bears, and Chris Ogbonnaya (8-24) ran in the score from a yard out to tie the game. Immediately, Chicago retook the lead with a field goal drive. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Cutler committed a bad overthrow in the middle of the field and was intercepted by Thomas DeCoud. The return set up Carolina at the Bears' 32. Benjamin (3-38) dropped a first-down pass, but Graham Gano tied it from 44 yards out. Two plays later, Forte was stripped of the ball by Antoine Cason, and Carolina recovered at the Bears' 23-yard line. Newton hit then Olsen for 2 big throws, including a short touchdown to take the lead. "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen with a late touchdown pass to seal a 27-23 victory. Count that as Newton's coming-out party. Newton and the Panthers entered the game 0-4 against the Seahawks (2-4) in the last 3 years, including a playoff game last season. But the Panthers went across the continent and got a win against a team that has been very good the last few years. You now can list Carolina among the Super Bowl favorites. Newton had struggled in the last 4 meetings with the Seahawks, but he got the job done this time.    Newton can be streaky, but he came through in the clutch this time. His scoring pass to Olsen was perfect. Newton completed 20-of-36 passes for 269 yards with 2 interceptions. Newton, however, made up for the turnovers with a passing touchdown and a run for a score. He remains a player you have to start in any fantasy league.    Speaking of players who must start in fantasy leagues, you have to begin with Olsen. Even though he's getting heavy coverage, Olsen had 7 catches for 131 yards and the touchdown.    Carolina had some nice balance in its offense. Olsen with a late touchdown pass to seal a 27-23 victory. Count that as Newton's coming-out party. Newton and the Panthers entered the game 0-4 against the Seahawks (2-4) in the last 3 years, including a playoff game last season. But the Panthers went across the continent and got a win against a team that has been very good the last few years. You now can list Carolina among the Super Bowl favorites.

   "comment":"Greg Olsen. Newton threw a bullet on the next play to Philly Brown at the Eagles' 1-yard line. Mike Tolbert pounded the ball into the end zone from there to give the Panthers a quick lead. Philadelphia promptly set up another score as Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Olsen. Newton threw a bullet on the next play to Philly Brown at the Eagles' 1-yard line. Mike Tolbert pounded the ball into the end zone from there to give the Panthers a quick lead.

Right after halftime, Newton was blasted by Michael Mauti on the goal line, and it appeared as though he sustained a concussion. Newton actually went into the locker room for a bit, but returned to the field shortly afterward; he didn't miss a snap. However, Newton caught fire after that, as he was 15-of-22 for 224 yards and 4 touchdowns in the second half. He missed Olsen for a first down at 1 point, but was able to engineer a game-winning touchdown drive at the very end to achieve the team's 12th victory.    Newton actually could've enjoyed a much better day had Ted Ginn not disappointed him. That may sound strange after looking at Ginn's stat line - 5 catches, 80 yards, 2 scores - but Ginn dropped 2 long passes, both of which would've gone for touchdowns. They were long bombs, but both balls fell right into Ginn's lap. Any quality receiver would've reeled them in.    Ginn wasn't the only productive Panther play-maker who made mistakes. Olsen caught 9 passes for 129 yards, but lost a fumble in the red zone. As mentioned, he could've had a greater performance had Newton not missed him a couple of times.

Wide receiver Olsen.    For the Panthers, Newton clearly had the biggest game from a fantasy perspective. But he wasn't the only Carolina player to deliver big fantasy numbers. Wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. had his third straight game with 2 touchdown catches. If Ginn isn't in your fantasy lineup, he should be.    With running back Jonathan Stewart sitting due injury, the Panthers didn't have a true feature back. Newton made up for a lot of that. Rookie Cameron Artis-Payne got the most work of Carolina's running backs with 14 carries for 59 yards. Artis-Payne might be a good pickup for your fantasy team over the next 2 weeks because the Panthers are likely to take a conservative approach with Stewart.    Olsen remains a guy you should be using in DFS each week. He had 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown.    Carolina rookie wide receiver "

Olsen drew 1 of those interference flags in the end zone, while Benjamin appeared to make a great reception in the first half. He secured a terrific, diving catch along the sideline and got 1 knee inbounds. However, Sean Payton challenged, and the call was overturned because Benjamin bobbled the ball while falling out of bounds. Payton actually had another terrific challenge late in the contest to overturn an incompletion, which was ruled a touchdown following the review. Watching the game live, I wouldn't have challenged either play, so credit the Saints for having some sharp people watching these replays for their coach.    "

Olsen drew 1 of those interference flags in the end zone, while Benjamin appeared to make a great reception in the first half. He secured a terrific, diving catch along the sideline and got 1 knee inbounds. However, Sean Payton challenged, and the call was overturned because Benjamin bobbled the ball while falling out of bounds. Payton actually had another terrific challenge late in the contest to overturn an incompletion, which was ruled a touchdown following the review. Watching the game live, I wouldn't have challenged either play, so credit the Saints for having some sharp people watching these replays for their coach.    "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen, but Keith Tandy came up with the turnover.Olsen, but Keith Tandy came up with the turnover. Newton finished 18-of-32 for 237 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could've been far worse for him, however, as he nearly had a couple of other picks. One potential interception was actually overturned by replay review. It's clear that Newton isn't healthy at all, as he's been bothered by a shoulder injury for quite some time now.    Kelvin Benjamin abused Tampa's secondary, catching 6 passes for 93 yards and a touchdown at the end of regulation. He had a 47-yard reception to get the Panthers into Tampa territory on the final drive of the game. Ginn (4-69) was next on the stat sheet, while Olsen (3-22) was a major disappointment. Olsen is not 100 percent, so I'm sure he's looking forward to having some time off to heal.    "

Meanwhile, Newton's throws were all over the place in the opener, and that was the case again in this contest. Newton was 20-of-32 for 228 yards.
