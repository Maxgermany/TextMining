My reaction on the forum as this happened? <i> ohmygodtouchdownpanthersholy**** </i> Like I said, Newton was awesome. He did make a crucial mistake in the first quarter when he tossed a pick-six into double coverage, but was outstanding otherwise. He went 27-of-46 for 374 yards, 1 passing touchdown, 2 rushing touchdowns and that interception.    Even with that late score bringing the deficit down from 34-23 to 34-29, the Panthers should have won this game. They outgained the Bears, 543-317. They had 9 more first downs. But like any young team, they continuously shot themselves in the foot. Here are some examples: - "

Safety Dashon Goldson inexplicably had the ball sail through his hands. Had he caught it, there was a great chance he would've run the ball back for 6. The Buccaneers did force a punt, but Rainey fumbled on the ensuing possession, effectively ending the game. It helped Anderson's cause that he had a superior receiver to throw to. Kelvin Benjamin had an excellent debut, hauling in 6 of his 8 targets for 92 yards and a touchdown. The Buccaneers had no answer for him. Benjamin looks like he's going to be a stud. Meanwhile, Greg Olsen paced the team with 11 targets, snagging 8 of them for 83 yards and a score.    The Panthers ran the ball extremely well, registering 72 yards on 14 carries. "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen predictably led the Panthers in targets with 14. He caught 6 of them for 70 yards, and he would've posted a much better stat line had Newton not been so inaccurate. He didn't score, so you might be able to acquire him from a frustrated fantasy owner for a low price. Olsen is 1 of the top fantasy tight ends this year.    While Carolina's offense struggled at times, it looked much better than Houston's scoring attack. The Texans failed to move the ball most of the afternoon, thanks to "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen? That's what the Carolina Panthers found out on Sunday. Olsen had 8 catches for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns. The victory marked the first time the Panthers have started a season with 3 straight victories since they went to the Super Bowl in the 2003 season. The undefeated Panthers are tied with the Atlanta Falcons for first place in the NFC South.    With Kelvin Benjamin out for the season and Jerricho Cotchery missing Sunday's game with an injury, it's clear that Olsen is the No. 1 option in the passing game. He might be the best tight end in the league right now outside of New England. "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen with a late touchdown pass to seal a 27-23 victory. Count that as Newton's coming-out party. Newton and the Panthers entered the game 0-4 against the Seahawks (2-4) in the last 3 years, including a playoff game last season. But the Panthers went across the continent and got a win against a team that has been very good the last few years. You now can list Carolina among the Super Bowl favorites. Newton had struggled in the last 4 meetings with the Seahawks, but he got the job done this time.    Newton can be streaky, but he came through in the clutch this time. His scoring pass to Olsen was perfect. Newton completed 20-of-36 passes for 269 yards with 2 interceptions. Newton, however, made up for the turnovers with a passing touchdown and a run for a score. He remains a player you have to start in any fantasy league.    Speaking of players who must start in fantasy leagues, you have to begin with Olsen. Even though he's getting heavy coverage, Olsen had 7 catches for 131 yards and the touchdown.    Carolina had some nice balance in its offense. "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen. Newton threw a bullet on the next play to Philly Brown at the Eagles' 1-yard line. Mike Tolbert pounded the ball into the end zone from there to give the Panthers a quick lead. Philadelphia promptly set up another score as Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing "

   "comment":"Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, Cam Newton completed 14-of-25 passes for 165 yards with a touchdown. Newton's footwork and accuracy were off all game. Derek Anderson was 17-of-23 for 172 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions.    Greg Olsen (6-76-1), Kelvin Benjamin (3-39-1) and Corey Brown (5-48-1) chipped in touchdowns for Carolina.    Atlanta's defense got a good game from "
