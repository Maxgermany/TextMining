   "comment":"Jones, meanwhile, didn't get a single touch because he blew a blitz pick-up. It makes you wonder why the Steelers cut Jonathan Dwyer, who was their most talented running back.    As mentioned, Jake Locker didn't have to do anything. He completed just 11-of-20 attempts for 125 yards. I wanted to see if he could put together a strong performance in hostile conditions, but we'll have to wait for that.    Only 3 Titans caught passes, with Nate Washington predictably leading the way with 4 grabs for 46 yards. Delanie Walker (3-40) and Kendall Wright (2-11) also had multiple catches, while Kenny Britt (1-15) barely did anything.    Chris Johnson had a tough matchup, which would explain his low YPC. He gained just 70 yards on 25 carries. Rookie rush linebacker Jarvis Jones blew him up on 1 play.    Speaking of Tennessee running backs, goal-line specialist "

   "comment":"Jones and DeAngelo Williams. The team then went on a tear, scoring 39 unanswered points. Ben Roethlisberger was out of his mind, going 24-of-39 for 364 yards and 4 touchdowns. He nearly had a fifth score midway through the final quarter, but Martavis Bryant dropped a pass that was only slightly high.    Having a strong running game to support Roethlisberger was huge. DeAngelo Williams was fantastic, trampling the Colts for 134 yards on 26 carries. Cris Collinsworth gushed all night at how incredible Williams' vision and cutting ability were. He's not even close to the same running back we saw in Carolina. Williams told the media that he finally figured things out; he's now apparently running with his feet instead of his head. It works, apparently, as Williams ripped off quality run after quality run.    The Colts eventually figured out that they couldn't double team Antonio Brown because they had to dedicate more defenders to stop Williams. Brown went off, snatching 8 of his 11 targets for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brown, who also scored on a punt return, had an amusing celebration after that sequence, when he jumped into the goal post and appeared to injure himself for a split second, but he turned out to be fine. Brown became the 7.h player in league history since the merger to score 2 receiving touchdowns and a punt return since the merger.    Roethlisberger's other touchdowns went to Bryant (4-114) and Markus Wheaton (3-50). Bryant just missed out on a career night; he dropped 2 touchdowns, which was especially painful for me because I had him paired with Roethlisberger in FanDuel. Wheaton, meanwhile, had all of his production in the first half. His score came right after Bryant's first drop.    A bit on the Colts: They didn't stand much of a chance to compete with the Steelers in a shootout. Matt Hasselbeck has beaten some mediocre opponents like the Buccaneers and Falcons, but Pittsburgh was just a different animal. Hasselbeck was exposed, going 16-of-26 for 169 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. One pick occurred because he didn't see Jarvis Jones dropping in coverage in the red zone. The second was a telegraphed throw. Hasselbeck wasn't terrible, but he just gave his team no chance against an elite foe because he's no longer good enough. Fortunately for the Colts, Andrew Luck is due back in Week 15.    Another silver lining for Indianapolis is that "
