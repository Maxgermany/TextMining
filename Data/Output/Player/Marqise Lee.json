Bortles lucked out with an easy interception dropped by Ron Parker in the end zone, and on the next play, Bortles threw a 1.yard strike to Robinson, who had managed to separate from Parker. The Chiefs took a 10-7 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, T.J.Yeldon fumbled the ball away to Kansas City and Cairo Santos drilled a 51-yard field goal. Bortles continued to struggle as Stephen Nelson dropped an interception, and Bortles also missed Robinson running wide open for a would-have-been 60-yard touchdown. A 37-yard punt return from Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and a penalty on the Jaguars started the Chiefs' offense at the 30-yard line, but Foles' struggles once again led to Kansas City settling for a field goal. Jacksonville put of a bit together in response, but Jason Myers missed on a 54-yard field goal attempt. The Chiefs got moving on a third-down completion to Travis Kelce to move deep into Jaguars territory. But a few plays later after getting interfered with in the end zone, Kelce lost his cool at the officials, who hadn't thrown any flags, and his temper tantrum landed him 2 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and ejection. The 30-yard loss killed the drive, but Santos hit a field goal to produce a 19-7 lead. The Jaguars got close to the end zone with a long pass to Marqise Lee (4-84) for 51 yards. However, 2 plays later, "
