Early in the 4.h quarter, Donnell caught a pass in the flat, but fumbled the ball on a hard hit by Dwayne Gratz. Aaron Colvin picked up the ball and raced down the sideline for a 41-yard touchdown for Jacksonville. With about 6 minutes remaining, Manning hit Beckham (7-90) for 23 yards and Reuben Randle (3-52) for 17 yards. The Jaguars buckled down to force the Giants into a field goal. Down 24-22, Bortles put together the game-winning drive. He threw a short slant to Lee and he ran for 22 yards to get it started. A 10-yard pass to Shorts and zone-read runs of 11 and 20 yards by Bortles got the ball in field goal range for "

Bortles lucked out with an easy interception dropped by Ron Parker in the end zone, and on the next play, Bortles threw a 1.yard strike to Robinson, who had managed to separate from Parker. The Chiefs took a 10-7 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, T.J.Yeldon fumbled the ball away to Kansas City and Cairo Santos drilled a 51-yard field goal. Bortles continued to struggle as Stephen Nelson dropped an interception, and Bortles also missed Robinson running wide open for a would-have-been 60-yard touchdown. A 37-yard punt return from Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and a penalty on the Jaguars started the Chiefs' offense at the 30-yard line, but Foles' struggles once again led to Kansas City settling for a field goal. Jacksonville put of a bit together in response, but Jason Myers missed on a 54-yard field goal attempt. The Chiefs got moving on a third-down completion to Travis Kelce to move deep into Jaguars territory. But a few plays later after getting interfered with in the end zone, Kelce lost his cool at the officials, who hadn't thrown any flags, and his temper tantrum landed him 2 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and ejection. The 30-yard loss killed the drive, but Santos hit a field goal to produce a 19-7 lead. The Jaguars got close to the end zone with a long pass to Marqise Lee (4-84) for 51 yards.

   "comment":"Lee, and a tipped pass sailed into the arms of Rafael Bush, who ran into the end zone. The Jaguars were able to re-claim the lead after that, but ultimately lost by a touchdown. Their defense limited the Lions to 12 offensive points, but the rest of the team surrendered 14 points. If Jacksonville had been more careful with the football, it may have prevailed. However, the Jaguars have been incredibly sloppy ever since foolishly firing Greg Olson, and that once again proved to be the case in this game.    I don't want to take much away from Matthew Stafford, however. Stafford didn't post the best fantasy numbers - he went 24-of-33 for 278 yards - but he played well considering how well Jacksonville's defense has been performing recently. Stafford struggled a bit in the early going, overshooting an open Anquan Boldin for a big gain, but he was once again very effective at the end each half. He led the team into field goal range prior to intermission, and he engineered an 8-minute drive to maintain possession at the very end, killing any chance the Jaguars had of prevailing.    The Lions scored just 1 offensive touchdown, which was an Eric Ebron rush on a jet sweep, of all things. Ebron caught 3 passes for 70 yards overall, most of which came on a 61-yard completion on a completely busted coverage by a linebacker. Ebron tied Theo Riddick (8 catches, 70 yards) for the team lead in receiving yardage.    It's hardly a surprise that the 2 prominent Detroit wideouts struggled against Jacksonville's elite secondary. Golden Tate caught only 3 balls for 27 yards, while Marvin Jones secured just 1 reception for 15 yards.    It was also predictable that the Lions couldn't run very well. Dwayne Washington handled most of the workload, but his 13 carries went for only 6 yards. Riddick, meanwhile, gained 13 yards on just 4 tries.    As for the Jaguars, I alluded to Bortles' struggles by mentioning his pick-six. That wasn't the only error he made, as he was nearly strip-sacked in the opening half because he held on to the ball too long. The play was ruled incomplete. There were also numerous occasions in which Bortles had receivers open for significant gains, but didn't see them. Bortles has seemingly regressed ever since Olson was let go, which is not surprising in the slightest, given that Bortles simply doesn't care enough to improve the mental part of his game, preferring to party frequently instead. Bortles finished 22-of-35 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. It was a disappointing showing, considering how poor Detroit's defense has been recently. Bortles was checked for a shoulder injury throughout the first half, but didn't miss any action, aside from a kneel-down right before intermission, which Chad Henne handled and then laughed afterward, for some reason.    It's unclear why the Jaguars insist on giving Ivory plenty of touches. Ivory wasted 17 carries, which he turned into 39 yards, whereas T.J. Yeldon was more effective on his tries (4-16). Ivory did catch 6 balls for 75 receiving yards, but as mentioned, he lost a fumble in Detroit territory.    Ivory led the Jaguars in receiving yardage. In fact, aside from him and Lee (4-52), no other Jacksonville player accumulated more than 18 yards through the air. "

   "comment":"Lee on a trick play. Everyone was well aware of the struggles of Tennessee's secondary, but this is a new low. Being incapable of stopping Bortles, new coach or not, is absolutely inexcusable, and it's clear that the Titans need to address their defensive backfield this offseason. Here are that Tennessee will consider.    A major reason why Bortles was so successful in this game was Allen Robinson's effort. Robinson had been dogging it all year, but finally appeared as though he was trying. Robinson caught 9 passes for 147 yards, including an amazing, 1.handed, back-shoulder catch while falling out of bounds. The only thing that was missing was a touchdown, which he almost snared, but the ball just barely hit the ground. Lee (3-37) snatched Bortles' sole score.    "

Bortles found the end zone later in the opening quarter, lofting another nice touch pass to Marcedes Lewis for a touchdown, marking the first time the Ravens allowed an opponent to convert in the red zone all year. Bortles continued the onslaught in the second quarter, scrambling for a first down to convert a third-and-7. A few plays later, Bortles fired a strike to Allen Hurns into the end zone, giving the Jaguars an insurmountable 20-0 lead. By halftime, the Jaguars were up 23-0, and they were outgaining the Ravens, 261-15. Baltimore averaged a ghastly 0.7 yards per play in the opening half. Bortles' final numbers were 20-of-31 for 244 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also a drew deep pass interference on a shot to Lee, so his numbers could've been even better. The people of London must think that Bortles is the greatest quarterback of all time.    Three of Bortles' scores went to Lewis, who hauled in 4 grabs for 62 yards. Hurns (3-20) had the other. Lee, meanwhile, led the Jaguars in receiving (4-65).    "
