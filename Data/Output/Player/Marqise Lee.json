   "comment":"Marqise Lee then moved the Jaguars to inside the 10-yard line. Bortles lucked out with an easy interception dropped by Ron Parker in the end zone, and on the next play, Bortles threw a 1.yard strike to Robinson, who had managed to separate from Parker. The Chiefs took a 10-7 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, T.J.Yeldon fumbled the ball away to Kansas City and Cairo Santos drilled a 51-yard field goal. Bortles continued to struggle as Stephen Nelson dropped an interception, and Bortles also missed Robinson running wide open for a would-have-been 60-yard touchdown. A 37-yard punt return from Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and a penalty on the Jaguars started the Chiefs' offense at the 30-yard line, but Foles' struggles once again led to Kansas City settling for a field goal. Jacksonville put of a bit together in response, but Jason Myers missed on a 54-yard field goal attempt. The Chiefs got moving on a third-down completion to Travis Kelce to move deep into Jaguars territory. But a few plays later after getting interfered with in the end zone, Kelce lost his cool at the officials, who hadn't thrown any flags, and his temper tantrum landed him 2 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and ejection. The 30-yard loss killed the drive, but Santos hit a field goal to produce a 19-7 lead. The Jaguars got close to the end zone with a long pass to Marqise Lee (4-84) for 51 yards. However, 2 plays later, "

   "comment":"Marqise Lee, Bortles threw a bullet that Lee nabbed to get the big score. One thing that Bortles actually did well was running the ball. He posted a career-high 81 rushing yards on 8 carries. He was able to scramble out of the pocket as the Bills had issues containing him. If Bortles can continue to make those kinds of plays, then defenses will respect his running a bit more. That would open things up for the passing game.    Bortles spent most of the afternoon targeting a trio of third-year receivers. Marqise Lee (4-37, 1 TD), Allen Robinson (2-24) and Allen Hurns (1-12, TD) all saw a great deal of attention from their quarterback."
