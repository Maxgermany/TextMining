  "comment":"Sam Baker ruined a drive in the first half with 2 penalties (holding, face mask). He would leave the game with an injury a little bit later. - The Falcons went for it on a 4.h-and-2 inside the red zone in the middle of the second quarter. A field goal would've made a huge difference later on, though it's always difficult to know what would've happened. - ",
