Brown picked up the free ball for New York to produce another field goal that was a critical score. The Cowboys drove the ball through the air later in the fourth, primarily with "

   "comment":"Phillips. Allen's resurgence continues following a poor sophomore campaign. Green, meanwhile, had a big catch on the final drive, but that should've been negated by offensive pass interference. Green will take a back seat to Antonio Gates next week, so I wouldn't blame you if you decided to drop him.    Stevie Johnson led San Diego in targets (8), but caught just 4 balls for 32 yards. His hamstring injury could keep him out, however, so "
