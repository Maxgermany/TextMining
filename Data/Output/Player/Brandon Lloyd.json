Afterward, NFL Red Zone host Scott Hanson joked, I'm sure some expert said, 'Tim Tebow held the ball too low when he hit Brandon Lloyd for that touchdown.' The Broncos didn't ask Tebow to do much aerially though, as you can tell by those 16 attempts. Tebow ran numerous quarterback draws, churning out 78 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground. Interim head coach Eric Studesville should feel more confident with Tebow going forward, so hopefully the Broncos don't baby him much longer.    Elsewhere on Denver's offense, "

   "comment":"Brandon Lloyd on a number of throws to force incompletions. Gilmore helped set up Gronkowski's fumble by holding him up for Byrd. Gronkowski got open running deep down the field during the third quarter, but Gilmore blasted him as he crossed into the end zone to force an incompletion. It wasn't a complete game as Gilmore couldn't hold on for an acrobatic interception and was trucked over on a play in run defense. Still, it was an impressive performance for the rookie.    Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 350 yards with 4 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Stevie Johnson (2-23) saw double coverage, and Fitzpatrick missed him for an easy touchdown. "

He had a run of 47 yards, 5 receptions for 58 yards with a score, and his punt return for a touchdown.    Even though Talib had an uneven game, the Patriots have some real potential at cornerback with him and Dennard. They both have some man-to-man ability with ball skills. The duo has the capacity to be coached up and form a nice tandem come January when New England is attempting to get back to the Super Bowl.    The Colts clearly need a lot of work on defense. The front 7 had zero sacks, while the secondary was incapable of stopping anything. The defense definitely needs a lot of work before Indianapolis will be a team that is dangerous in January.   "

   "comment":"Brandon Lloyd for a long score. That said, I was disappointed that he scrambled just 3 times (18 rushing yards). His legs are his best weapons, so he should use them more.    Kaepernick's sole touchdown went to Stevie Johnson, who actually led the team with 79 receiving yards off 5 catches. Boldin (7-50) was solid outside of the dropped score, but Crabtree (4-27) and Davis (2-21) both had awful outings.    The Broncos did a great job of shutting down the run. "
