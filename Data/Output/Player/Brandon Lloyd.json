Afterward, NFL Red Zone host Scott Hanson joked, I'm sure some expert said, 'Tim Tebow held the ball too low when he hit Brandon Lloyd for that touchdown.' The Broncos didn't ask Tebow to do much aerially though, as you can tell by those 16 attempts. Tebow ran numerous quarterback draws, churning out 78 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground. Interim head coach Eric Studesville should feel more confident with Tebow going forward, so hopefully the Broncos don't baby him much longer.    Elsewhere on Denver's offense, "

   "comment":"Lloyd dropped a 2.point conversion attempt, making the game 26-24 with a couple of minutes remaining. San Diego had the ball on Denver's 40-yard line as the clock was ticking down. However, a phantom personal-foul penalty on Denver moved the Chargers into field goal range. With 20 seconds remaining, Nick Novak, who might just be the best kicker of all time the way he's drilling field goals against me, converted a chip-shot attempt. The personal-foul penalty was the major issue. It was completely bogus. The official didn't even mention who committed the infraction. There was no number announced, and the replay showed nothing. Even the CBS announcers were befuddled. The refs, who actually did this twice in this contest, made sure San Diego covered at all cost. There's no doubt in my mind about this. It may sound like I have sand in my vag, but seriously, no ref should ever be able to go, Personal foul on the defense. That's a 15-yard penalty. First down. Personal foul on whom!? Give us a f***ing number! Don't leave the announcers saying, I'm not sure what that's all about. And it's not like the refs did it just that 1 time. They did it twice in this game! Unbelievable.    Of course, if Lloyd just caught the 2.point conversion, it all wouldn't have mattered. Lloyd, who snagged only 1 pass for 20 yards (on the final drive), couldn't get 2 feet inbounds on another possible completion. Keep that in mind when I talk about Tim Tebow. "

Gronkowski got open running deep down the field during the third quarter, but Gilmore blasted him as he crossed into the end zone to force an incompletion. It wasn't a complete game as Gilmore couldn't hold on for an acrobatic interception and was trucked over on a play in run defense. Still, it was an impressive performance for the rookie.    Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 350 yards with 4 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Stevie Johnson (2-23) saw double coverage, and Fitzpatrick missed him for an easy touchdown. Fred Jackson (13-29) never got going either.    Brady was 22-of-36 for 340 yards with 3 scores and no picks. Wes Welker caught 9 passes for 129 yards. Lloyd caught 3 for 50 with a garbage-time touchdown.    If you need a running back for your fantasy team, think of picking up Bolden. Ridley (22-106) and Bolden (16-137) were phenomenal against Buffalo. They both ran hard and dominated the Bills' linebackers.   "

   "comment":"Lloyd (4-45) had a modest contribution. Edelman, meanwhile, was the play-maker for New England. He had a run of 47 yards, 5 receptions for 58 yards with a score, and his punt return for a touchdown.    Even though Talib had an uneven game, the Patriots have some real potential at cornerback with him and Dennard. They both have some man-to-man ability with ball skills. The duo has the capacity to be coached up and form a nice tandem come January when New England is attempting to get back to the Super Bowl.    The Colts clearly need a lot of work on defense. The front 7 had zero sacks, while the secondary was incapable of stopping anything. The defense definitely needs a lot of work before Indianapolis will be a team that is dangerous in January.   "

   "comment":"Lloyd for a long score. That said, I was disappointed that he scrambled just 3 times (18 rushing yards). His legs are his best weapons, so he should use them more.    Kaepernick's sole touchdown went to Stevie Johnson, who actually led the team with 79 receiving yards off 5 catches. Boldin (7-50) was solid outside of the dropped score, but Crabtree (4-27) and Davis (2-21) both had awful outings.    The Broncos did a great job of shutting down the run. "
