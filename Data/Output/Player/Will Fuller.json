The Texans transformed their offense this offseason by signing Brock Osweiler at quarterback and Lamar Miller at running back, and drafting Will Fuller in the first round. Those 3 players came up huge for Houston's offense to lead the team to the victory. Bears quarterback "

   "comment":"Will Fuller on a third down. I thought there was a chance Bill O'Brien could pull Savage in favor of Brock Osweiler, given that Savage was just 2-of-7 for only 13 yards at halftime. However, the Texans were able to generate offense following the break. Savage was 16-of-22 for 163 yards in the second half. He was suddenly accurate, delivering strikes on the money. His numbers could've been even better, but DeAndre Hopkins dropped a pass. Savage's only blemish after intermission was a near-interception by Karlos Dansby. Savage finished 18-of-29 for 176 yards. Credit O'Brien for sticking with his young quarterback, as moving back to Osweiler might have been crushing for the team. Still, Savage needs to improve for the Texans not to get blown out of the water in their opening-round playoff matchup.    Hopkins had a rough evening. He led his team with 43 receiving yards, but he dropped a pass and was flagged twice for offensive pass interference. C.J. Fiedorowicz (4-42) and Will Fuller (3-39) were next on the stat sheet. The former dropped a pass in the first half, while Fuller drew a pass-interference flag.    With Lamar Miller out, "

   "comment":"Will Fuller) and an ugly interception, which is the blunder I hinted at earlier. It was a poor decision, as he forced a pass while rolling left despite being up multiple scores. Watson's late pick was a rookie mistake - 1 that Watson surely won't be making in a year or 2. For now, the Texans will have to continue to live with Watson's growing pains, though he continues to mature before their very eyes. Watson has experienced unprecedented success. This was the third-consecutive 3.touchdown game for him, which is the first time a rookie signal-caller has done that in NFL history.    Watson continued to take advantage of Fuller's speed. Fuller caught another deep pass, this time a 39-yarder, for a touchdown. As a result, he led the Texans in receiving with 2 grabs for 62 yards, but would've had way more had he not dropped a deep touchdown late in the game. "
