   "comment":"Zach Zenner on Monday night. I don't understand what their problem is because they made the same exact error in this contest. Zenner had 16 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown by halftime, but received just 4 attempts following the break. He was such a big part of the offense early on, so it made no sense for them to shy away from him later in the game. Zenner (16-69, TD) was a big part of the passing attack, at least, catching 4 balls for 41 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "
