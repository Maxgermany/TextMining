Forsett may not be on the roster very long.    Speaking of running backs, Todd Gurley didn't have the sort of performance that his owners were expecting prior to this matchup. Gurley gained just 58 yards on 14 carries, though he did catch 4 balls for 39 yards. Gurley was blown up in the backfield on a fourth-and-1 try in the second quarter. Gurley's low workload may have been a byproduct of him walking off the field gingerly at 1 point in the opening half. He missed some action, but managed to return to the field. It's unclear if he was 100 percent.    I mentioned that Keenum missed on just 5 throws earlier. Take a look at his stat line: 27-of-32, 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, which was a horrible throw at the end to ruin the Rams' chances. But how does an overall stat line like that even happen? Detroit's banged-up defense got Ziggy Ansah back this week, and he managed to draw a false start at 1 point, but the back 7 continued to be brutal. DeAndre Levy needs to return for the Lions to play well defensively.    "

   "comment":"Zenner lost fumble inside the New York 5-yard line; and a complete lack of a running game. The latter was not expected, but then again, it was pretty surprising that the Giants were able to rush it so well themselves. New York's ground attack has been dormant all year, and Detroit's run defense has held up well throughout 2016 for the most part, so it was so surprising that Rashad Jennings and Paul Perkins moved the ball so well throughout the afternoon. This allowed Eli Manning to operate in short-yardage situations to avoid Detroit pass-rushers Ziggy Ansah and Kerry Hyder, who had great matchups versus a pair of weak New York offensive tackles. So what happened? Well, the return of stud guard Justin Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive. That happened to clinch the spread victory; Manning took advantage of Slay's absence by connecting to Odell Beckham Jr. on a third-and-10, moving the chains and ultimately setting up the covering touchdown with a 1-handed Beckham grab. Manning finished 20-of-28 for 201 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was just 6-of-12 for 74 yards and a score following intermission, but as mentioned, Manning was able to put together a successful drive to put the game out of reach. The improved protection and the absence of Slay proved to be the difference.    Beckham caught 6 of his 8 targets for 64 yards and a touchdown. His score was awesome, as it was a 1-handed extended grab. Slay had been matched up on Beckham on most plays when he was in the game, but that didn't end up lasting very long, as Slay hurt his hamstring. Sterling shepard (4-56) also caught a touchdown.    As for Stafford, I mentioned earlier that his finger wasn't that much of a factor. I only saw 1 poor throw affected by the finger, as he tossed the ball into the ground when he had Eric Ebron open in the flat. Stafford also underthrew Golden Tate in the end zone by a bit in the first quarter, allowing Eli Apple to recover and break up the pass, though I don't think Stafford's finger was a factor on that pass. Stafford finished 24-of-39 for 273 yards and a late, desperation interception. His longest pass was a 67-yard bomb, as Golden Tate beat Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie with a double move. Rodgers-Cromartie would end up having the last laugh because he was the 1 who picked off Stafford. I'd say Stafford has to be disappointed with his performance. His finger didn't hinder his passes, and he's going to be regretting missing Tate in the end zone. Stafford also couldn't take advantage of Janoris Jenkins' absence, as Jenkins also got hurt in the first half. Stafford could've posted a better stat line - Golden Tate ran a bad route to negate a completion of 25 yards, and Eric Ebron dropped a pass in the red zone - but he didn't play his best game.    Perhaps the most important play of this contest occurred at the end of a seemingly successful Detroit drive. Following Tate's long catch, the Lions fed the ball to Zenner, who rushed inside the New York 5-yard line. However, he fumbled, and the Giants recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. Zenner didn't get much work on the ground (3-12), though he did catch 4 passes for 52 yards. "

Zenner had 16 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown by halftime, but received just 4 attempts following the break. He was such a big part of the offense early on, so it made no sense for them to shy away from him later in the game.
