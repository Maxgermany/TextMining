   "comment":"Owens just 14 carries. Owens turned those touches into 91 yards and a touchdown.    I don't know why Jacksonville felt that Henne had to air it out nearly 50 times, but the results weren't very good. Henne went 21-of-43 for just 185 yards and 2 interceptions. One of the picks was a miscommunication at the very end, while the other took place in the red zone because he held on to the ball too long in the pocket and didn't feel the pressure from his blind side. Henne was especially brutal in the second half, going just 9-of-24 for 95 yards and an interception after the break, though he did endure some drops. He's gotten worse and worse each week, and it's gotten to the point that the front office can't go into the 2013 season with him as their starter. The Jaguars will have to draft or sign a quarterback this offseason.    There were only 2 Jaguar receivers of note: "
