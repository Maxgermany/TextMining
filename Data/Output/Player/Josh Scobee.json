The Texans took a 14-10 lead into the half. Todman (7-52 rushing, 5-46) got the Jaguars moving in the third quarter with a 34-yard run into Houston territory, but Scobee missed a 51-yard field goal. Keenum and the Texans' offensive line started breaking down as the fill-in signal-caller turned the ball over on a coverage strip-sack by Brian Davis.

Oh, and speaking of Scobee, had he missed the extra point at the very end of the game, that would have been the gambling moment of the year. I think Al Michaels would've had an aneurysm on the air. Going forward, these teams project as good fades. My Supercontest partner Matvei texted me, I'm underwhelmed by both of these teams tonight, and I couldn't agree more. The Steelers appear to be horribly coached, while the Patriots have major defensive issues of their own. Plus, it's very fair to still be skeptical about Brady. Any quarterback could've thrown checkdowns and looked great against this abomination of a Pittsburgh defense.   "

Justin Tucker, 1 of the most-clutch kickers in the league, drilled a pair of attempts late - 1 to send the game to overtime, and the other to ice the victory from 52. It's unfortunate for the Steelers, who had an inspired effort in the wake of Ben Roethlisberger's injury. Scobee, who was also brutal in the season opener, was so bad in this contest that Mike Tomlin eschewed a pair of kicking attempts in overtime because he had no faith in him. The Steelers failed twice on those tries, and Baltimore took advantage on the second occasion. John Harbaugh, of course, had no reservations about trusting Tucker from 52. Tucker is easily 1 of the NFL's top kickers.    Pittsburgh's kicking and fourth-down woes bailed out "
