   "comment":"Kolby Smith started in his place, and compiled just 20 yards on 10 rushes.    Every year, I like to honor (or rather, make fun of) the first defense to surrender 1,000 rushing yards on the season. Thanks to their inability to stop White and Johnson, the award belongs to the Chiefs, who now give up 6.1 yards per carry! Seriously, all you need to do is run against this team. You don't even need a quarterback!   "
