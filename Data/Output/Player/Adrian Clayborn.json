   "comment":"Clayborn. Ryan put the ball on the ground and it was recovered by Bucs defensive end Michael Bennett. When Ryan started to throw more to Jones in the second half, good things happened for Atlanta. Jones beat Talib to the end zone on a pass that was overthrown by Ryan. Later in the fourth quarter, Jones beat Talib and the safety in zone coverage for a 49-yard pass to the Bucs' 10-yard line. Jones had to stop and wait for the ball, and a better pass would have been a score. Ryan finished the drive on the next play with a 10-yard touchdown to Gonzalez. Ryan later had White for a potential touchdown, but his No. 1 wideout dropped the ball. Atlanta had to settle for a field goal and never got the ball back because Tampa Bay was able to run out the clock.    Each team featured a young defensive tackle that was a disruptive force in the game. For Atlanta, third-year pro Peria Jerry was routinely getting the best of Pro Bowl guard Davin Joseph. Meanwhile, Bucs second-year tackle Brian Price was hitting Ryan and busting up runs by jetting into the backfield. Price got a sack late in the fourth quarter at a critical time to help force the Falcons to settle for 3 rather than going in for a go ahead touchdown.    A weakness early in the 2011 season for Atlanta has been its offensive line. Left tackle Sam Baker hasn't played great, although they didn't help him at all in the first game by giving him no assistance against Bears defensive end Julius Peppers. Still, Baker did not have a very good game against Clayborn. New starter "
