Down 14-13 with 9 minutes remaining, the Bears had a 4.h-and-goal at Detroit's 1-yard line. Sure, the exciting call was to go for the touchdown, but it wasn't the smart 1 because a field goal actually would have given Chicago the lead. Forte got the carry, but was stuffed at the 1-yard line. The Bears scored a touchdown later on, but lucked out when the refs screwed up on Calvin Johnson's touchdown.   "
