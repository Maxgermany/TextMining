   "comment":"Roberts on a last-gasp fourth down. Kolb then put his team into field-goal range following Tannehill's overtime pick. It was amazing how great Kolb was at the end of the game considering how much he struggled throughout the afternoon. Kolb finished 29-of-48 for 324 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks, but couldn't get anything going early on because he was constantly harassed by the Miami pass rush. His offensive line had no chance against the Dolphins, particularly Cameron Wake, who tallied an eye-popping 4.5 sacks. Kolb was sacked 8 times in total.    Two of Kolb's scores went to Roberts (6-118). The other was thrown to Fitzgerald (8-64). "

   "comment":"Roberts drop on a crucial third down at the end of the third quarter in Buffalo territory. Meanwhile, the Bills made the mistake of not running the clock out when they had the lead late in regulation. Instead of giving the ball to Jackson (16-53, TD), who ran well, or C.J. Spiller (12-88, TD), who was even better, Buffalo opted to have Brad Smith throw a deep ball into the end zone. It was picked off, giving the Cardinals new life.    Kolb went 14-of-26 for 128 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. He was constantly under siege by a Buffalo defensive front that showed signs of life for the first time in weeks. The Cardinals surrendered 4 sacks - including a pair to Mario Williams - and it would have been way more if Kolb didn't do a good job of running out of the pocket. Attempting his best QBDK impression, Kolb picked up 66 rushing yards on 5 scrambles.    Kolb's lone score went to Larry Fitzgerald (6-93). Roberts, who had that aforementioned drop, disappointed with just 2 catches for 18 yards.    I really liked what I saw out of "

   "comment":"Roberts in the fourth quarter - his second of the game - setting up an Arizona touchdown. The Lions had 5 penalties in the second half.    Bush, who had the aforementioned fumble - though it was officially credited to Matthew Stafford - suffered what looked to be a serious injury in the first half. He grabbed the back of his knee, but eventually reentered the game. Bush rushed for just 25 yards on 9 carries, though he made up for it with 3 catches for 44 receiving yards. Joique Bell actually outgained him (8-31; 5-41).    As for Stafford, he went 24-of-36 for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns. He came out on fire, but the Cardinals made the proper adjustments and shut him down after intermission. He was just 8-of-16 for 68 yards in the final couple of quarters.    Both of Stafford's scores went to Calvin Johnson, which had to make his fantasy owners happy after they barely missed out on a couple of touchdowns last week. Megatron logged 6 catches for 116 yards despite Patrick Peterson's coverage.    Speaking of Peterson, he was used on offense on a few snaps in this contest. Peterson caught a 17-yard pass along the sideline and even tossed a 17-yard dart on a trick play to Kerry Taylor.    Carson Palmer had a pretty decent outing considering that Larry Fitzgerald wasn't 100 percent. Fitzgerald, who caught just 2 passes for 33 yards, wasn't even on the field during the final drive. Palmer went 22-of-39 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly interception that was made off his back foot and taken back 66 yards by DeAndre Levy for a pick-6. Not included in Palmer's numbers were 2 long pass interferences on Bentley and an incompletion that should have been ruled a catch. It was obvious that Michael Floyd hauled a deep pass in, but the officials inexplicably said it was incomplete.    Palmer's lone score went to rookie running back Andre Ellington, who had 6 touches for 62 yards. Floyd (3-22) and Andre Roberts (3-36) disappointed their fantasy owners.    "
