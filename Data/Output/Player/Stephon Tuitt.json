  "comment":"Stephon Tuitt's injury is a major 1. Losing him would be huge.    The Steelers came into Cleveland favored by 8.5 points (closed at 10), but we know when the AFC North matches up, anything can happen. And once again, it almost did. The Steelers got out to a quick lead off a blocked punt recovered for a touchdown, but the Browns' young defense didn't let the game get away from them, as rookie DeShone Kizer ran in a touchdown from 1 yard out to tie up the game 7-7 going into the second quarter. He and the defense kept the game close throughout, but the young quarterback often held the ball too long, helping a swarming Pittsburgh defense to 7 sacks and an interception. "
