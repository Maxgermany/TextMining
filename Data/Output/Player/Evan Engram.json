Beathard hit Garrett Celek (4-67-1) on the run, and he broke a tackle from Janoris Jenkins to get into end zone for a 47-yard score. That gave the 49ers a 17-13 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Giants had a drive end with a missed 34-yard field goal. The 49ers soon moved inside the 30-yard line, but Olivier Vernon intercepted a screen pass to snatch the scoring opportunity away. San Francisco got the ball back and continued to move the chains on New York. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Beathard kept a bootleg to run into the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown. A few minutes later, the 49ers put the game away with Matt Breida (9-55-1) running up the middle untouched for a 33-yard touchdown as Landon Collins took a bad angle to let Breida cut upfield for pay dirt.    Beathard completed 19-of-25 passes for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Carlos Hyde led the 49ers on the ground with 17 carries for 98 yards.    Manning was 28-of-37 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. Shepard caught 11 passes for 142 yards. Engram hauled in 6 passes for 31 yards and a touchdown.    "
