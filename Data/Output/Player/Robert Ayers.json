   "comment":"Ayers felt the need to shove a hand into the face of a New England lineman, which gave the Patriots a free first down instead of a short field for Denver's offense.    And if Denver didn't commit all of those errors? Well, I'm sure it would have come down to which team had the ball last. The Patriots had no answer for the run, which the Broncos had to abandon because they fell into a huge hole. Denver's defense, meanwhile, looked completely helpless trying to stop Tom Brady. Brady went 23-of-34 for 320 yards and 2 touchdowns. Unlike last week in which he looked really lackadaisical, Brady played with a ton of a fire that we often see when he's an underdog. Perhaps someone didn't notify him that he was favored by a touchdown. Brady's scores went to "

   "comment":"Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and Rashad Jennings (9-12) were held in check on the ground for New York. As mentioned last week, the Giants' running back situation is 1 to avoid unless you have Vereen in a PPR format. Neither Jennings nor Williams is very good, and the Giants have injuries on the offensive line that will keep them from opening up big running lanes.    Rookie Vic Beasley had a sack and forced fumble for the Falcons. Cullen Jenkins and Robert Ayers recorded sacks for the Giants. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
