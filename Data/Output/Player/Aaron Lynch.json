   "comment":"Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. Ryan Clark added a 15-yard penalty on the play with his helmet-to-helmet hit. That moved ball inside the Redskins' 20-yard line. A pass to Boldin (9-137) moved it to the 4-yard line before Hyde (7-16) darted into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. The Redskins got 2 more possessions, but the 49ers' defense slammed the door as Lynch came up with a clutch sack on the first possession and Justin Smith beat Morgan Moses for a strip-sack that was recovered by Ahmad Brooks to end the game."
