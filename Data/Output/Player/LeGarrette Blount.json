   "comment":"Blount couldn't get going in the first half with 13 yards on 4 carries. All of Tampa Bay's running backs struggled to find running room against the Lions front 7. The Bucs' inability to control the ball prevented them from getting Blount more carries in the first half. In the final 2 quarters, Tampa Bay was forced to throw the ball and play their 2.minute offense package that has Earnest Graham in the game instead of Blount. The second-year Blount finished with 15 yards on 5 carries. In order for Blount to be featured more, the Bucs have to be competitive throughout the game.    Tampa Bay struggled to get their top receivers involved. Tight end Kellen Winslow had 6 catches for 66 yards while Mike Williams finished with 4 receptions for 50 yards and a score. Many of the passes thrown to Winslow and Williams were off the mark, and the 1. that were catchable rarely hit them when they had room to run.   "

He connected on a few passes to rookie tight end Luke Stocker and Williams. Freeman dived into the end zone from a yard out to give Tampa Bay 10-3 lead. A turnover set Tampa Bay up for 3 more points just before halftime and a lead of 16-3. To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off the hands of wide receiver Arrelious Benn and into the hands of safety William Moore, who returned the interception to midfield. Freeman finished the game 22-of-32 for 180 yards and 2 interceptions. Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.    The Falcon defensive line got some pressure on Freeman but never sacked him. Defensive end "

Running back Pierre Thomas charged through a few defenders to score a 9-yard touchdown run. Freeman later tried to mount a comeback for the Buccaneers. He led a field goal drive to start the 4.h quarter, and after getting the ball back, he engineered a 77-yard drive for a touchdown. Freeman made a clutch third-down play to wide receiver Mike Williams and tossed a 5-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow in the back of the end zone to cap the drive. That cut the Saints' lead to 24-16 with 5.and-half minutes left. New Orleans put the game away on their next possession when they drove down the field and kicked a field goal. Brees finished the afternoon 27-of-36 for 258 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Jimmy Graham led the Saints with 6 receptions for 78 yards. Sproles had 89 yards rushing and receiving with a touchdown reception. Freeman finished the game 27-of-37 for 267 yards and 1 touchdown. Blount ran for 72 yards on 13 carries. Williams paced Tampa Bay in receiving with 6 catches for 46 yards. The Buccaneers killed themselves with terrible gap integrity in run defense and horrible tackling. They also played very undisciplined football with a number of stupid, critical penalties.   "

   "comment":"Blount had a remarkable run where he ran through 7 defenders. He chugged downfield for a 54-yard score. Another Tampa Bay drive led to a field goal cut into Green Bay's 14-10 lead. The Buccaneers got aggressive and had that backfire on them with a surprise onsides kick. The Packers got the ball at Tampa Bay's 38-yard line and that led to a short touchdown catch for Jordy Nelson. In the third quarter, the Buccaneers got a field goal while the Packers' offense had a few drives stall. Green Bay's defense was playing like garbage entering the 4.h quarter. Their pass rush wasn't getting to Freeman and their pass coverage was too soft as he moved the ball down the field. Early in the 4.h, Freeman hit Mike Williams on a 9.yard slant to make the score 21-19. Then Tampa Bay went for 2 and had a wide open Kellen Winslow drop an easy pass for a failed conversion. The Packers' offense woke up and started to attack the Buccaneers' vulnerable run defense. Green Bay was aided by some penalties by Tampa Bay, and fullback John Kuhn dove into the end zone from 2 yards out. After a Rodgers' interception, the Buccaneers got a big play downfield with a long pass from Freeman to Arrelious Benn. That set up a short touchdown pass to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe. Tampa Bay trailed 28-26 with 4 and half minutes left. The Buccaneers made a terrible decision to do an onside kick rather than to kick it deep. The Packers recovered the attempt and were set up at midfield in prime position to get a game-clinching score. Rodgers made the Tampa Bay pay with a perfect pass he dropped into Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown. . After a terrible game last week, the Buccaneers dug deep and played the Packers really tough. Rodgers' accuracy was off frequently in the game and he didn't look like his normal self against Tampa Bay. Green Bay's defense is showing some weakness with the amount of yards they are giving up. That could come back to bite them in the postseason. Freeman was 28-of-38 for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Winslow caught 9 passes for 132 yards, while Blount ran for 107 yards on 18 carries. Rodgers was 23-of-34 for 299 yards with 3 scores and an interception. Nelson led Green Bay with 6 receptions for 123 yards and 2 touchdowns.   "

   "comment":"Blount and Josh Freeman. Buccaneers punt returner Preston Parker kept the Jaguars in the game with 2 fumbled punts, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown. Finally, Gabbert made a play in the second quarter. Mercedes Lewis burned safety Sean Jones downfield for a 62-yard pass. Lewis' big catch set up a short touchdown run from Maurice Jones-Drew. After the score, a holding penalty on Parker pushed Tampa Bay back to its own 11-yard line. Jacksonville defensive end Jeremy Mincy and outside linebacker Daryl Smith put on a great tandem rush that produced a sack-fumble at the goal line. Defensive tackle Nate Collins recovered the fumble in the end zone to give the Jaguars a 21-14 lead. Mincy had a phenomenal game against Buccaneer left tackle Donald Penn. With a minute remaining before halftime, Freeman threw a terrible interception to former Tampa Bay cornerback Ashton Youboty. That set up a short touchdown pass from Gabbert to Jones-Drew with only a few ticks left until the half. In the third quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off a defensive lineman's helmet and it was intercepted by Paul Posluszny. Gabbert made a couple good plays, but then blew an opportunity to break the game open by throwing a stupid interception in triple coverage in the end zone to linebacker Mason Foster. The Buccaneers gave it right back. An amazing run by Blount ended with him fumbling the ball away. Early in the 4.h quarter, the Jaguars put a good drive together and Gabbert capped it with another touchdown pass to Jones-Drew. Later on, Jones-Drew scored his 4.h all-purpose touchdown of the afternoon with a short run. He rushed for 85 yards on 27 carries and caught 6 passes for 51 yards and the 4 scores. Gabbert had the best game of his rookie season, completing 19-of-33 for 217 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions. The Jacksonville defense played excellent football for the final 3 quarters, totaling 5 turnovers, and the Jaguars' special teams caused 2 turnovers for a total of 7 takeaways. Tampa Bay had a meltdown performance, making 1 of the worst quarterbacks and worst offenses in the NFL look good. The Buccaneers have lost back-to-back games in convincing fashion to 3.win teams. Tampa Bay's 7.game losing streak is proof they lack the talent to compete on a weekly basis. They entered Sunday having spent more time playing from behind than any team in the NFL, and their defense struggles to stop anyone. It looks like Tampa Bay is making a run at a top-five pick. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Blount to run out the clock when Doug Martin was just 54 rushing yards away from breaking Adrian Peterson's all-time single-game record. You really fooled the Raiders with that move, Greg. </i>    The meager playoff aspirations for the Oakland Raiders took a massive hit after being dropped at home by Tampa Bay. It was the Bucs' first win in Oakland in franchise history and helps Tampa Bay stay in the wild-card chase. Doug Martin (25-251) dominated to open up a big lead, but the pass defense almost blew an 18-point second-half lead.    This game was extremely sloppy in the early going. Oakland helped Tampa Bay move the ball with a series of penalties, but the Raiders' defense came up big with Lamarr Houston blocking a 35-yard field goal. He picked up the ball and returned it 33 yards. A roughing-the-punter penalty on the Bucs gave Oakland a first down. Carson Palmer burned Mark Barron for a 50-yard touchdown pass to Derek Hagan a few plays later, but a holding call brought the score off the board. A fake punt by Oakland was easily snuffed out by Ronde Barber, and Bucs kicker Connor Barth missed a 54-yard field goal before halftime.    Josh Freeman had a good day throwing against a pathetic secondary. He threw a 64-yard pass to Vincent Jackson and then finished the drive a few plays later with a touchdown pass to Jackson (2-84). The Buccaneers dominated the third quarter. Martin had a 45-yard touchdown run up the middle of the Raiders' defense. Tampa Bay expanded its lead with a short touchdown pass to Mike Williams (4-68). Palmer ended a promising drive with a pass off the back foot that was intercepted by Leonard Johnson. Martin took off on a 67-yard touchdown run a few plays later. Oakland found the endzone again in the 4.h quarter, but Martin ran up the middle for a 70-yard touchdown sprint in response. LeGarrette Blount fumbled the ball away to aid the Raiders' comeback effort. Martin had his 4.h score in the final 2 minutes. Freeman was 18-of-30 for 247 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions.    Darius Heyward-Bey (5-74) made a brilliant 46-yard 1.handed catch going against "

   "comment":"Blount run (he was stuffed), an inexplicable pass to left tackle-eligible Nate Solder and toss to Julian Edelman, who dropped the ball (albeit Jones made another good play). The Patriots probably would've scored on a Brady sneak attempt (or 2), so the thought process didn't make much sense. Brady finished 18-of-38 for 197 yards and the aforementioned pick. This game marked the first time in 52 occasions that Brady failed to fire a touchdown. This result was surprising because Cincinnati was missing a couple of defensive starters, while Danny Amendola returned to the lineup for the first time since Week 1. Amendola led the team with 55 receiving yards off 4 receptions. He nearly scored a touchdown, but rolled to the 1-inch line to begin that aforementioned dubious sequence.    New England's other receivers disappointed: Edelman (2-35) and Thompkins (3-16) did nothing but drop passes. In fact, running back Brandon Bolden led the team in receptions (6 for 40 yards). Bolden saw 5 carries for 24 yards, while Blount gained 51 yards on 12 tries. He lost a fumble in Cincinnati territory in the first half.    As the Patriots endured with Blount, the Bengals had their own red-zone turnover. "

The Patriots took a 17-0 lead into the half. The Ravens' offense was completely inept and New England was putting a lot of heat on Flacco. In the third quarter, the Patriots were set up inside the Ravens' territory after Ryan grabbed his second interception on a deflection off Dennis Pitta. That set up another field goal. Baltimore finally got going with a pass to Smith for a gain of 42, but Rob Ninkovich stuffed Ray Rice (11-40) for no gain on a 4.h-and-1 inside the 5.yard line. Everything was going against the Ravens as Justin Tucker missed a field goal. They got into the end zone in the 4.h quarter as Flacco dove into the end zone from a yard out. The Patriots answered with a dominating drive on the ground with their stable of backs, and Blount finished off Baltimore with his second touchdown run.

   "comment":"Blount, Shane Vereen and Julian Edelman (muffed punt) all dropped the ball, but didn't cost their team. Stevan Ridley also appeared to lose possession, but it was ruled that he was down by contact. The 4.h fumble was a botched snap, also pounced on by New England. Meanwhile, a Vereen drop bounced into the arms of a Buffalo player, which will officially go down as a Tom Brady interception. The Bills, meanwhile, didn't commit as many blunders, but they were more costly. T.J. Graham lost a fumble and also had a big drop on a 4.h-and-2. This was just 1 of 3 instances in which Buffalo failed to convert on 4.h down. It was a bit odd because Thad Lewis was able to complete some impressive throws on third-and-long situations. This obviously does not include a Fred Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a 4.h-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though "

   "comment":"Blount was trampling the defense for long bursts on most of his carries. The Patriots were an unreal 12-of-18 on third downs, and some of those failures came late in the game when they stopped trying. As a result, New England won the time of possession by more than 15 minutes.    The Colts need to bolster their pass rush, which is what I have happening in my . They got no heat on Brady at all, registering just 1 sack. Brady, as a result, finished 23-of-35 for 226 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, which was his only poor decision of the evening because he forced a ball to Rob Gronkowski when Edelman was briefly out of the lineup with a minor injury. Brady was fantastic. The completion percentage doesn't look good at first glance, but keep in mind that he endured 4 drops, all by different players. He could've enjoyed a much better statistical performance, but he was able to hand the ball off to Blount, who did most of the work for him.    Speaking of Blount, the monstrous back abused the Colts once again, gashing them for 148 yards and 3 touchdowns on 30 carries. Blount ran like a truck on most plays, but showed some shiftiness and made some juke moves a man his size shouldn't be able to do. Blount abused a poor defense that needs to improve this offseason.    The Patriots ran some trick plays with previously ineligible players once again. Some didn't work, but 1 produced a touchdown when Brady found left tackle "

   "comment":"Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and "

However, he was such a big part of the passing attack, seeing 11 targets - more than double compared to anyone else on the team. He ended up catching 8 balls for 59 receiving yards and the score.    Brady's second touchdown was a 59-yarder in the 4.h quarter, which completely blew the game open. It should've never happened, however, as the Patriots got away with a blatant pick play, per usual. It ultimately didn't matter because New England was winning in a blowout no matter what, but if this were a close contest, it would've been a shame if the game had been decided because the officials weren't paying attention.

They had fewer than 100 net yards prior to intermission and failed to cross midfield until the third quarter. Tannehill went 28-of-44 for 300 yards and 2 interceptions. Again, Tannehill's 300 yards are a mirage, as he had just 85 at halftime. He also took a safety when the ball was snapped before he was prepared.

Even with a sub-par game from Dalton, the Bengals found a way to win in Pittsburgh to stay undefeated. That's the mark of a good team and 1 that could become a great team if they build on this divisional win.   "

He tallied 129 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. With Lewis injured, Blount figures to be a strong producer going forward. Lewis, meanwhile, had 53 net yards in 2.and-a-half quarters of action. As mentioned, he screwed his fantasy owners out of a receiving touchdown.    The Redskins, meanwhile, had an error-filled afternoon. "

Easley's seemed like the worst, as he was down for a while and had to be helped off with an apparent knee malady. McCourty (ankle) was the best player who got knocked out; he's a stellar safety, though Brian Hoyer was too inept to take advantage of his absence. Freeny (wrist) played extremely well before leaving, while Blount (hip) wasn't missed very much.    Tom Brady misfired on just 8 occasions, going 22-of-30 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well when he had time to throw, but he was hit quite often. As a consequence, the Patriots were limited to just 20 points until very late. Brady took 3 sacks, but that number isn't very indicative of the pressure he faced. "

   "comment":"Blount, this was his worst performance of the year. He was supposed to carry the load for the Patriots in this game, but he only received 13 carries. Though Blount turned those carries into 54 yards, the Bills did a very good job of containing the bruising back. Because of his early struggles, the Patriots gave some carries to James White, who was not very effective. White ran the ball 4 times for 12 yards.    This game was a huge, signature win for Rex Ryan and the Bills. The team really needed to get a big victory this year to help ensure that Ryan's job was safe. This definitely qualifies. After beating the Cardinals in the previous week, the team went on the road to play a divisional rival and shut them out. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the play of "

Two plays later, Blount skipped into the end zone, and just like that, the game was over. If a football fan were asleep for 4 weeks and woke up without any idea as to what was going on, they would've never suspected that Brady missed any practice time whatsoever. Brady was incredibly sharp, and having Gronkowski at 100 percent didn't hurt. With these 2 in full gear, the Patriots look like the best team in the AFC. OK, maybe it's a bit presumptive to read that much into a victory against the Browns, but Brady was incredibly sharp. He went 28-of-40 for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns. Had the Browns been able to keep up on the scoreboard, Brady may have had a shot at 500-plus yards; he was up to 271 yards at halftime, putting him on track for 542 on the afternoon (thank you, Windows calculator).

Jones, who had a poor pass intercepted in the end zone to start this game, never lost his cool, which we've seen happen in the past as poor decisions accumulate. His best drive of the game came midway through the second quarter when he hit Antonio Brown with a beautiful pass for 51 yards, and then, 4 plays later, hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown on yet another nice throw. I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1.point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 36-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Blount were stuffed for a total of 3 occasions, while 4.h down was a throw toward Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to Julian Edelman to set up a score.    Brady's top receiver wasn't Julian Edelman or Rob Gronkowski; it was Martellus Bennett, who reeled in all 7 of his targets for 102 yards. Edelman had a strong evening (7-99) until the very end when he lost a fumble. Chancellor stripped the ball away, and it set up Seattle's game-winning touchdown. Gronkowski, meanwhile, also appeared to fumble, but replay review showed that his bionic commando arm was down. Gronkowski missed a bit of action with what appeared to be a concussion, but he was able to return to action and was ultimately targeted on the final real play of the game.    Brady's fantasy owners weren't pleased because their quarterback didn't throw any touchdowns. LeGarrette Blount had all the scores, plunging into the end zone 3 times. He finished with 69 yards on 21 carries, while "

   "comment":"Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5.yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the 4.h quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.    The Patriots' defense had a good team effort with 4 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.   "

   "comment":"Blount ran down to the 1-yard line.    It seemed like the Jets had the advantage for most of this game. They were restricting the Patriots and were doing a great job of limiting mistakes on offense. Unfortunately for the Jets, they were unable to do enough to beat their opponents because of the efforts on the Patriots' penultimate offensive drive. On that possession, Tom Brady was nearly spotless. The team had to make lot of plays to get down the field, but Brady was able to pick apart the defense. The Jets had several coverage busts, and Brady delivered balls on the money that allowed the Patriots to move down the field. They scored a touchdown on a throw to Malcolm Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much. The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2.point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the 4.h quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. That can be chalked up to Brady's knee injury though. He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, Julian Edelman (8-83) led the way. Brady targeted him 11 times, and he was a beast over the middle of the field. He beat Darrelle Revis a couple of times and should get a boost if Gronkowski misses time. Martellus Bennett (3-22) left for some time with an injury as well, but he returned. He had a minimal impact on the outcome.    Elsewhere, Chris Hogan (4-70) looked solid and Malcolm Mitchell (5-42, 2 TD) looked like a star in the making. The rookie had been getting more involved in New England's attack in the previous weeks, but it now looks like he is becoming 1 of Brady's favorite targets. If Mitchell is available in your league, add him as soon as possible.    LeGarrette Blount put up some good numbers. However, going into the final drive, he had only 8 carries for 36 yards. He had a 23-yard burst on the last run of the game to pad his stats at 11 carries for 67 yards. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Blount and Dion Lewis nearly split the workload evenly. Blount ended up with more carries than Lewis, 20-16, but only because the Patriots fed Blount while running out the clock. Lewis had more attempts in the opening half, 9-7. Lewis also outgained Blount, 52-50, but Blount scored twice.    As for the pathetic Jets, Petty was knocked out without completing a pass; he was 0-of-3 with a pick. As mentioned, the interception wasn't his fault, but it was still disappointing that the Jets couldn't use Christian Hackenberg once Petty left the game. Hackenberg was inactive for some strange reason, though perhaps it had to do with Todd Bowles' hospitalization. Bowles clearly didn't have all of his mental faculties intact when he made the decision to deactivate Hackenberg. Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way and was his usual, pedestrian self. Fitzpatrick's numbers were awful - 8-of-21 for 136 yards, 2 interceptions - but he should've thrown a touchdown, as Seferian-Jenkins had the aforementioned drop. If Petty can't play in Week 17, Hackenberg needs to start. There's absolutely no reason to keep trotting out a woeful, bearded quarterback with no future within the organization.    The Jets wanted to establish "

Blount managed 51 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Lewis gained 48 yards on 11 attempts, all but 2 of which came in the opening half.    As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore didn't have a bad game, going 24-of-34 for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick really hurt, as it occurred when he hurled an underthrown pass while scrambling left. With the Patriots limiting Miami's possessions, every drive was going to be crucial, so the Dolphins couldn't afford that mistake. The same goes for the aforementioned Damien Williams fumble.    Moore's touchdowns went to "

However, the flu-stricken Steelers wore down in the second half, and Blount finished with 47 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. His best run was when he managed to carry what appeared to be the entire Pittsburgh defense down to the 1-yard line. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    Back to the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 31-of-47 for 314 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. While Roethlisberger accumulated a bulk of his numbers in garbage time, it's still amazing that he was competent when factoring in the utter trash he was throwing to. With Bell injured and Brown constantly double teamed, he had to resort to working with the aforementioned Coates, Hamilton and Heyward-Bey. The first drive saw Roethlisberger curiously take a deep shot to Coates on a third-and-1, which fell incomplete. Hamilton dropped a touchdown in the second quarter. Coates then did the same thing right after halftime. Heyward-Bey was responsible for Roethlisberger's interception, as he wasn't even aware the ball was heading in his direction. The Steelers could have Martavis Bryant back next year, but he needs to be reinstated. It's difficult for the Steelers to trust him, so they may target 1 of the in the early rounds. Roethlisberger desperately needs someone reliable to throw to outside of Brown.    Pittsburgh's 2 leading receivers were predictably Brown (7-77)and Rogers (7-66). However, Brown didn't do much when this game was in doubt, while Rogers was responsible for a lost fumble that gave the Patriots a quick touchdown, putting this game completely out of reach.    With Bell limited to just 6 carries (20 yards), "

   "comment":"Blount did a good job of moving the pile and getting yards after contact. He mustered 67 yards on 14 carries. He also found the end zone on a 2.point conversion.    As for the Panthers, Newton struggled with the 3 turnovers, as his offensive line couldn't hold up against Philadelphia's elite defensive front. Cox's return had a major impact, and Newton frequently found himself under duress even though the Eagles seldom blitzed. Newton went 28-of-52 for only 239 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, Newton was able to scramble 11 times for 71 yards and a touchdown on the ground.    "

The Eagles, despite Jason Peters' injury, have 1 of the top fronts in the NFL, so Ajayi should be able to replicate what he was able to accomplish with Miami in 2016.    Wentz, meanwhile, didn't seem to care that he was throwing into 1 of the top secondaries in the NFL. His yardage was low (199), but only because the Eagles didn't have to throw much as a result of being up 31-9 at halftime. Wentz carved up Denver's defense when he had to, going 15-of-27 with 4 touchdowns. One of his scores was a perfect back-shoulder toss to "
