   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount couldn't get going in the first half with 13 yards on 4 carries. All of Tampa Bay's running backs struggled to find running room against the Lions front 7. The Bucs' inability to control the ball prevented them from getting Blount more carries in the first half. In the final 2 quarters, Tampa Bay was forced to throw the ball and play their 2.minute offense package that has Earnest Graham in the game instead of Blount. The second-year Blount finished with 15 yards on 5 carries. In order for Blount to be featured more, the Bucs have to be competitive throughout the game.    Tampa Bay struggled to get their top receivers involved. Tight end Kellen Winslow had 6 catches for 66 yards while Mike Williams finished with 4 receptions for 50 yards and a score. Many of the passes thrown to Winslow and Williams were off the mark, and the 1. that were catchable rarely hit them when they had room to run.   "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount get stuffed 3 times at the goal line reminded me of the fun days when Tampa Bay was the most inept team in the league. Seriously, Blount 3 times? He sucks, Schiano! </i>    In a shootout with either Drew Brees or Josh Freeman, 1 would have to bet on Brees, and he came out on top by a touchdown . However, Freeman almost pulled off an incredible comeback to force overtime. He threw a touchdown to Mike Williams on the final play of the game, but the wideout had been forced out of bounds before catching the pass, so the completion was negated by an illegal touching penalty. This game featured tremendous aerial assaults by Freeman and Brees, but both Tampa Bay and New Orleans played awful defense. Neither secondary could cover, and both teams had little pass rush. The tackling by the Bucs and the Saints was absolutely abysmal. Both defenses were painfully bad, and that point can't be emphasized enough.    The game didn't start out that way for Tampa Bay. Gerald McCoy tipped a pass on New Orleans' first possession, and Ronde Barber picked off the deflection. He had a nice return to the Saints' 13-yard line. Freeman threw a quick pass to Tiquan Underwood (2-35) on the next play for a touchdown.    Saint linebacker Jonathan Vilma was playing in his first game back and made an impact with a blitz that caused Freeman to throw a pass too high, allowing Roman Harper to collect an interception. The refs blew the call by saying it was an incompletion, and they screwed up the challenge by not reversing it. Vilma tipped a pass later on the same drive and almost intercepted it. Doug Martin (16-85) finished the possession with a 36-yard touchdown run. Freeman then opened up a 21-7 lead by hitting Vincent Jackson for a 17-yard touchdown. Brees answered with a deep pass to Devery Henderson for 39 yards in busted coverage. That led to a 17-yard touchdown pass to Marques Colston (7-73). Brees then went to Henderson (3-75) after he beat Eric Wright down the field, and Mark Barron missed a tackle on the sidelines. That set up a short touchdown pass to Darren Sproles (5-27 rushing, 4-32 receiving). The Saints' defense then finally got a stop, and Brees rewarded the effort with a 48-yard touchdown pass to Joe Morgan (only catch). The wideout shed tackles by Barron and Wright, who he'd already burned running down the field.    Brees was surgical in a 2.minute drill late in the first half. He gave the Saints the lead with a 20-yard touchdown pass to David Thomas (2-27), who was left uncovered by the safeties. The veteran signal-caller went 20-of-25 for 313 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception through the first 2 quarters.    The Bucs blew big opportunities in the third quarter, missing a 42-yard field goal and squandering a 95-yard catch by Jackson. Malcolm Jenkins showed great hustle to chase down Jackson short of a touchdown, but the wide receiver seemed to be coasting. LeGarrette Blount (5 for -2) was stopped on 3 tries, and on a 4.h-and-goal, Cam Jordan forced Freeman out of bounds. It was an epic fail for Tampa Bay with a bad decision by Greg Schiano not to take the points and terrible play-calling by offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan. The mistakes continued as the Bucs were called for an unsportsmanlike conduct on a pre-snap field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. Brees made Tampa Bay pay by the moving the ball close, setting up "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount to run out the clock when Doug Martin was just 54 rushing yards away from breaking Adrian Peterson's all-time single-game record. You really fooled the Raiders with that move, Greg. </i>    The meager playoff aspirations for the Oakland Raiders took a massive hit after being dropped at home by Tampa Bay. It was the Bucs' first win in Oakland in franchise history and helps Tampa Bay stay in the wild-card chase. Doug Martin (25-251) dominated to open up a big lead, but the pass defense almost blew an 18-point second-half lead.    This game was extremely sloppy in the early going. Oakland helped Tampa Bay move the ball with a series of penalties, but the Raiders' defense came up big with Lamarr Houston blocking a 35-yard field goal. He picked up the ball and returned it 33 yards. A roughing-the-punter penalty on the Bucs gave Oakland a first down. Carson Palmer burned Mark Barron for a 50-yard touchdown pass to Derek Hagan a few plays later, but a holding call brought the score off the board. A fake punt by Oakland was easily snuffed out by Ronde Barber, and Bucs kicker Connor Barth missed a 54-yard field goal before halftime.    Josh Freeman had a good day throwing against a pathetic secondary. He threw a 64-yard pass to Vincent Jackson and then finished the drive a few plays later with a touchdown pass to Jackson (2-84). The Buccaneers dominated the third quarter. Martin had a 45-yard touchdown run up the middle of the Raiders' defense. Tampa Bay expanded its lead with a short touchdown pass to Mike Williams (4-68). Palmer ended a promising drive with a pass off the back foot that was intercepted by Leonard Johnson. Martin took off on a 67-yard touchdown run a few plays later. Oakland found the endzone again in the 4.h quarter, but Martin ran up the middle for a 70-yard touchdown sprint in response. LeGarrette Blount fumbled the ball away to aid the Raiders' comeback effort. Martin had his 4.h score in the final 2 minutes. Freeman was 18-of-30 for 247 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions.    Darius Heyward-Bey (5-74) made a brilliant 46-yard 1.handed catch going against "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount, Shane Vereen and Julian Edelman (muffed punt) all dropped the ball, but didn't cost their team. Stevan Ridley also appeared to lose possession, but it was ruled that he was down by contact. The 4.h fumble was a botched snap, also pounced on by New England. Meanwhile, a Vereen drop bounced into the arms of a Buffalo player, which will officially go down as a Tom Brady interception. The Bills, meanwhile, didn't commit as many blunders, but they were more costly. T.J. Graham lost a fumble and also had a big drop on a 4.h-and-2. This was just 1 of 3 instances in which Buffalo failed to convert on 4.h down. It was a bit odd because Thad Lewis was able to complete some impressive throws on third-and-long situations. This obviously does not include a Fred Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a 4.h-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and "

Brady's second touchdown was a 59-yarder in the 4.h quarter, which completely blew the game open. It should've never happened, however, as the Patriots got away with a blatant pick play, per usual. It ultimately didn't matter because New England was winning in a blowout no matter what, but if this were a close contest, it would've been a shame if the game had been decided because the officials weren't paying attention.

Gronkowski led New England through the air with 11 receptions for 108 yards and a score. He really hurt the Jets' defense. It was Gronkowski's 18th career 100-yard game. Danny Amendola (8-86-1) and Julian Edelman (5-54) chipped in some critical receptions. "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount pummeled the Miami front, which was surprising. Blount gained 72 yards on 17 carries despite the fact that the Dolphins had surrendered just 3.1 yards per attempt since the bye. Both Blount and Lewis were effective tonight, which bodes well from a fantasy perspective if you own 1 of them.    As for the Dolphins' offense, they looked horribly inept until they put some garbage yardage together in the second half. They had fewer than 100 net yards prior to intermission and failed to cross midfield until the third quarter. Tannehill went 28-of-44 for 300 yards and 2 interceptions. Again, Tannehill's 300 yards are a mirage, as he had just 85 at halftime. He also took a safety when the ball was snapped before he was prepared. Tannehill's first pick was a telegraphed throw in which the defensive back ran the route for "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount had a huge game. He was stuffed on his first several carries, but got stronger as the game progressed. He eventually had a 41-yard burst for a score, thanks to an Edelman pancake block. Blount punched through for 105 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries.    The Texans, meanwhile, had to be a huge disappointment for those who thought they could take the next step. They flat out choked in this game. They showed everyone that they absolutely weren't ready for primetime, as they constantly made horrible mistakes throughout the evening. It began with a Stphen Anderson drop. The Texans then fumbled on a kickoff return, setting up a Brisett touchdown run, helped by a missed tackle by safety "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount, this was his worst performance of the year. He was supposed to carry the load for the Patriots in this game, but he only received 13 carries. Though Blount turned those carries into 54 yards, the Bills did a very good job of containing the bruising back. Because of his early struggles, the Patriots gave some carries to James White, who was not very effective. White ran the ball 4 times for 12 yards.    This game was a huge, signature win for Rex Ryan and the Bills. The team really needed to get a big victory this year to help ensure that Ryan's job was safe. This definitely qualifies. After beating the Cardinals in the previous week, the team went on the road to play a divisional rival and shut them out. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the play of "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount run, Gronkowski snared a 34-yard reception and rumbled down to the Cleveland 2-yard line, breaking 5 tackles in the process. Two plays later, Blount skipped into the end zone, and just like that, the game was over. If a football fan were asleep for 4 weeks and woke up without any idea as to what was going on, they would've never suspected that Brady missed any practice time whatsoever. Brady was incredibly sharp, and having Gronkowski at 100 percent didn't hurt. With these 2 in full gear, the Patriots look like the best team in the AFC. OK, maybe it's a bit presumptive to read that much into a victory against the Browns, but Brady was incredibly sharp. He went 28-of-40 for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns. Had the Browns been able to keep up on the scoreboard, Brady may have had a shot at 500-plus yards; he was up to 271 yards at halftime, putting him on track for 542 on the afternoon (thank you, Windows calculator). He threw numerous beautiful passes, including a perfect 43-yarder down the field to Chris Hogan to move into the red zone on 1 occasion. On an ensuing drive, Brady hit Hogan for 63 yards in stride, as the new Patriot receiver beat Joe Haden.    All 3 of Brady's touchdowns went to Martellus Bennett, which is remarkable considering that Bennett left the game early on with an injury. He returned and didn't looked like he was hobbled at all, catching 6 passes for 67 yards. He did this despite Gronkowski being healthy, but Gronkowski still produced; he caught 5 balls for 109 yards.    Brady's other big stat-producers were Hogan (4-114) and James White (4-63). Hogan left temporarily to be checked for a concussion, but he returned to action shortly afterward. Julian Edelman, meanwhile, snatched 5 balls for only 35 yards.    LeGarrette Blount helped his fantasy owners with a touchdown, but didn't do much otherwise, mustering only 37 yards on 18 attempts. He had 3 other chances to score, but Cleveland did a good job of stuffing him near the goal line.    As for the Browns, they never really had a chance, but they might have covered had "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount were stuffed for a total of 3 occasions, while 4.h down was a throw toward Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to Julian Edelman to set up a score.    Brady's top receiver wasn't Julian Edelman or Rob Gronkowski; it was Martellus Bennett, who reeled in all 7 of his targets for 102 yards. Edelman had a strong evening (7-99) until the very end when he lost a fumble. Chancellor stripped the ball away, and it set up Seattle's game-winning touchdown. Gronkowski, meanwhile, also appeared to fumble, but replay review showed that his bionic commando arm was down. Gronkowski missed a bit of action with what appeared to be a concussion, but he was able to return to action and was ultimately targeted on the final real play of the game.    Brady's fantasy owners weren't pleased because their quarterback didn't throw any touchdowns. LeGarrette Blount had all the scores, plunging into the end zone 3 times. He finished with 69 yards on 21 carries, while "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5.yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the 4.h quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.    The Patriots' defense had a good team effort with 4 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.   "

   "comment":"LeGarrette Blount ran down to the 1-yard line.    It seemed like the Jets had the advantage for most of this game. They were restricting the Patriots and were doing a great job of limiting mistakes on offense. Unfortunately for the Jets, they were unable to do enough to beat their opponents because of the efforts on the Patriots' penultimate offensive drive. On that possession, Tom Brady was nearly spotless. The team had to make lot of plays to get down the field, but Brady was able to pick apart the defense. The Jets had several coverage busts, and Brady delivered balls on the money that allowed the Patriots to move down the field. They scored a touchdown on a throw to Malcolm Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much. The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2.point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the 4.h quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. That can be chalked up to Brady's knee injury though. He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, Julian Edelman (8-83) led the way. Brady targeted him 11 times, and he was a beast over the middle of the field. He beat Darrelle Revis a couple of times and should get a boost if Gronkowski misses time. Martellus Bennett (3-22) left for some time with an injury as well, but he returned. He had a minimal impact on the outcome.    Elsewhere, Chris Hogan (4-70) looked solid and Malcolm Mitchell (5-42, 2 TD) looked like a star in the making. The rookie had been getting more involved in New England's attack in the previous weeks, but it now looks like he is becoming 1 of Brady's favorite targets. If Mitchell is available in your league, add him as soon as possible.    LeGarrette Blount put up some good numbers. However, going into the final drive, he had only 8 carries for 36 yards. He had a 23-yard burst on the last run of the game to pad his stats at 11 carries for 67 yards. Meanwhile, "

As for the Panthers, Newton struggled with the 3 turnovers, as his offensive line couldn't hold up against Philadelphia's elite defensive front. Cox's return had a major impact, and Newton frequently found himself under duress even though the Eagles seldom blitzed. Newton went 28-of-52 for only 239 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, Newton was able to scramble 11 times for 71 yards and a touchdown on the ground.    "
