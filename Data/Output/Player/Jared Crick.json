   "comment":"Jared Crick. Luck's performance was exemplary, especially considering that he was dealing with 2 backup guards and a center making his second career start. The center screwed up on 1 play, snapping the ball before Luck was ready. This was when Watt scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown. Luck targeted T.Y. Hilton early and often. The speedy wideout hauled in all 9 of the passes thrown his way for a whopping 223 yards and a touchdown. His yardage total was just 1 shy of Hall of Famer Raymond Berry's single-game record for the Colts. "

   "comment":"Jared Crick at the Tennessee's 10-yard line. Houston could only get 3 out of the turnover, but it didn't matter because the defense slammed the door on the Titans.    DeAndre Hopkins totaled 94 yards on 8 catches with a score. Nate Washington made 4 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Hoyer completed 23-of-35 for 235 yards with 2 scores. Alfred Blue, meanwhile, recorded 39 yards on 14 carries, a disappointing showing.    Zach Mettenberger went 22-of-31 for 171 yards with an interception. Antonio Andrews actually ran pretty well for the Titans, notching 64 yards on 16 carries.    Tight end Delanie Walker led Tennessee with 62 yards on 6 receptions. Kendall Wright (4-21), Justin Hunter (2-17) and Dorial Green-Beckham (1-12) couldn't do much with Mettenberger and the offensive line struggling.    Tennessee's defense played well considering the tough positions they were put in. The Texans couldn't run the ball with only Hopkins and Washington making plays for the offense. Karl Klug, Brian Orakpo, Jurrell Casey and Zach Brown all notched sacks for the Titans.    The Texans' defense was superb and finally played a complete game. Mercilus and Watt were animals off the edge. Mercilus recorded 3.5 sacks, while Watt notched 2.5 and a forced fumble. Jared Crick chipped in another sack. Rookie corner Kevin Johnson made 6 tackles, plus an interception, and played extremely well. The 1 negative was that "
