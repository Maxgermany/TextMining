Again, I don't want to sound overly negative because the Raiders made a great comeback and ultimately prevailed, but they were fortunate because of both the officiating and the opposition. If they want to make a playoff run - and they certainly have the talent to do so - they need to clean up their mistakes because they'll be penalized versus tougher foes. Something that would also help would be getting their right tackle situation shored up. It was fine heading into the game, but "
