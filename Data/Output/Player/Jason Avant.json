   "comment":"Avant for a 26-yard gain. However, Smith struggled in the red zone, which was expected. Smith went 29-of-50 for 246 yards and a touchdown, which doesn't look that bad at first glance, but his YPA (4.92) is pretty brutal. Smith did, however, make up for it by picking up 44 yards on the ground. That said, Smith is just way too limited to lead a team deep into the playoffs. He can beat up on bad teams during the regular season, but he'll never overcome top-level competition.    It didn't help Smith's cause that Jeremy Maclin barely played. Maclin was constantly on and off the field. It appeared as though he would be fine after reeling in an early catch on a third down to move the chains, but he limped off at 1 point and wasn't heard from again. He caught 2 passes for 23 yards.    The trio of Jason Avant (4-69), Albert Wilson (5-57, TD) and Chris Conley (5-33) tried their best to replace Maclin, as well as Travis Kelce (6-23), who was erased by Belichick's schemes."
