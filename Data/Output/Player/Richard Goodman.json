   "comment":"Goodman returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to provide San Diego with a 21-10 cushion. The Raiders, of course, turned to Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. Palmer found him down the middle for 22 yards, and after some short gains, another Janikowski field goal trimmed the lead to 21-13. The Chargers' offense never let off the pedal (463 total yards) in this 1 though. In 5 plays, they were at the Oakland 33-yard line. The defense held, forcing 3 straight San Diego incompletions, but Nova's long field goal put the Chargers ahead 24-13. Typically, the Raiders would answer in a 2.minute drill, having done so all year. This looked like no exception when Heyward-Bey caught a pass for a gain of 23 followed by a 9-yard pass to Bush, but with 11 seconds left and no timeouts to stop the clock, Palmer inexplicably completed a short pass to Murphy for a gain of 6. Instead of a long, but certainly makeable 55-yard field goal attempt, Oakland entered the locker room for halftime to a chorus of boos from the home fans. The offenses kept piling up stats in the second half, but field goals never beat touchdowns. Palmer dropped a bomb to Denarius Moore who went 78 yards but needed to go a few more. A short Bush run and 2 completions put Janikowski back on the field to slice the San Diego lead to 24-16. The response was a touchdown drive. The Chargers' big receivers used their height advantage all afternoon to school the small defensive backs trying to cover them. After a nice kickoff return set them up at the 34-yard line, Rivers completed all 5 passes he attempted for 51 yards including the 13-yard score to Vincent Jackson (2-29, TD), who played sidekick to Floyd (7-127, TD) and Gates (5-106 yards, TD) most of the game. Midway through the third quarter, it was looking bleak in the Black Hole. The Raiders got another big play, a 28-yard pass to Murphy, but again failed to finish with a touchdown. Janikowski's 4.h field goal closed them to within 31-19 as the third quarter wound down. Again, Oakland's defense couldn't really hold, but caught a break when Norv Turner started running the clock with Brinkley, who was given 4 consecutive carries. Rivers' first pass of the drive came on third-and-two and fell incomplete. Then, Nick Novak missed the 44-yard field goal giving the Raiders life with 11:05 to play. Late owner Al Davis would have been happy to watch the next quick strike drive. A big gain to Heyward-Bey, short run and touchdown right up the middle to Kevin Boss quickly put Oakland back in the game down 31-26. Boss took a hit that drew a penalty, and that almost turned the game around. That's because the ensuing kickoff almost turned into a safety when Janikowski bounced the kickoff inside the 5 and Goodman mishandled it. After a discussion, it was ruled he was down just outside the end zone and Hue Jackson chose not to challenge the call. San Diego's offense wasted no time getting out of trouble with a 19-yard pass to Floyd. After a penalty, Tolbert (9-58) had the only run of the afternoon that would matter, rumbling 40 yards down the field. Two plays later, Rivers again hit Floyd for a 43-yard scoring strike and 38-26 lead. It was all over but the fighting, even though 6:35 remained on the clock. Palmer (28-of-43, 417 yards, 2 TDs, INT) put the Raiders in scoring range, but "
