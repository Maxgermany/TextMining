   "comment":"Long tripping penalty. St. Louis squandering so many opportunities allowed the Panthers to eventually find their momentum without worrying about overcoming any sort of deficit. Cam Newton let the ball hit the ground just 2 times, going 15-of-17 for 204 yards and a touchdown. Mixed in was his usual, arrogant showboating, as well as 10 scrambles that went for 26 rushing yards. There was a scary moment concerning Newton in the second half. Robert Quinn injured Newton on a read-option play. Newton went to the sideline, but missed only 1 play.    Newton's sole aerial score went to Steve Smith (5-69). Greg Olsen was the only other Panther to catch more than 3 balls (4-47), but didn't look healthy at all. He was wincing in pain following some of his receptions.    While the Rams couldn't do anything about stopping the pass, particularly in the second half, they did a good job of limiting DeAngelo Williams to 40 yards on 15 carries. Mike Tolbert (13-36) vultured another touchdown.    A common theme of this game was the chippiness between these 2 squads. There were several scrums and unsportsmanlike penalties. In fact, 1 Ram (Chris Long) was ejected for throwing a punch. "
