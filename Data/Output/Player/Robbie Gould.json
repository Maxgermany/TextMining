I thought there was a good chance Cutler would just pack it in and quit again, but he actually played well for the first time in a while. He had a couple of sketchy moments during the afternoon - in addition to that fumble-penalty, he had a classic, #yolo interception in Minnesota territory - but his positive plays far outweighed the negatives.    Cutler finished 31-of-43 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The other pick was underthrown during the 2-minute drill at the end of the first half, which allowed "

   "comment":"Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the 4.h quarter. Palmer used Ellington and Chris Johnson as receivers before the 49ers' pass rush stepped up to keep the Cardinals to 3 points. Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining. However, Ray Ray Armstrong notched a sack and Elvis Dumervil recorded the 100th sack of his career to get the ball for the 49ers' offense. Hoyer couldn't do anything with it, forcing the 49ers to punt again. Dumervil added another sack, and that basically forced overtime. A pass interference on Patrick Peterson in overtime helped get San Francisco on the move. The 49ers advanced the ball with an 11-yard pass to Pierre Garcon (4-36), a third-down conversion with an 8.yard run by Kyle Juszcyk, and a pass to Hyde for 9 yards to get inside the 10-yard line. The drive stalled, and Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. Because it was the opening possession of overtime, Arizona got a chance to score. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for receptions of 17 and 25 yards. A holding on "
