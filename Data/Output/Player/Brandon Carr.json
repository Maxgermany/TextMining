Something like that shouldn't be humanly possible, and there's real potential that Beckham is some sort of football cyborg. Beckham finished with 10 catches (on 11 targets) for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he should've even had a much better performance. Beckham sprinted past the coverage and was wide open downfield late in the third quarter on what would've been an 87-yard touchdown, but Manning inexplicably didn't see him. Beckham left the game briefly with an injury, but he turned out to be fine.    Manning, despite that blemish, had a strong rebound performance off his 5.interception outing. He completed 29-of-40 attempts for 338 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, which was a high throw hurled to "

   "comment":"Carr for a 61-yard touchdown. Outside of that play, the Giants were limited to just 199 net yards.    Eli Manning did not have a good game, and his stat line is very misleading. He finished 17-of-28 for 193 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. If you take out the Beckham play, which was all Beckham, Manning would've gone 16-of-27 for only 132 yards and a pick. Manning was extremely fortunate to get away with only 1 interception, which he telegraphed to Victor Cruz. The Cowboys dropped a whopping 3 interceptions, including 1 by Barry Church, where the ball was thrown right to him. Had Church hung on, the Cowboys would've been set up in field-goal range, which would've allowed Dallas to tie the game. Manning also fumbled twice. He was a mess, and he's extremely fortunate that the defense once again bailed him out.    Beckham (4-94) was the offensive hero for New York. He was struggling prior to his 61-yard score, as he caught 3 balls for 33 yards otherwise, thanks to Carr's great coverage. Beckham also hurt himself with 2 drops inside the red zone. Outside of Beckham, New York's leading receiver was "
