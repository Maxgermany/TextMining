   "comment":"Bellore, the team's other starting inside linebacker, went down with an injury. The 49ers, who had 2 inside linebackers dressed for the game for some reason, had to use safety Vinnie Sunseri at the position. Sunseri is 210 pounds, so that should tell you how this game went. Of course, you could just look at the score and the stat sheet. The Falcons basically did whatever they wanted, scoring on nearly possession. They achieved a whopping 29 first downs and accumulated 550 net yards, averaging a ridiculous 8.3 yards per play. If that final stat means nothing to you, think about it this way - according to that figure, Atlanta nearly got a first down almost every single time it snapped the ball!    Matt Ryan misfired on just 6 occasions despite not having Julio Jones again. The 49ers' horrible, inside linebacker-less defense just made things so easy. Ryan went 17-of-23 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. Ryan threw the ball just 9 times after halftime, so if San Francisco was able to be more competitive, Ryan's stat line would've been much better. The 49ers simply had no chance to stop Ryan, given their problems at inside linebacker. Jimmie Ward leaving the game in the second quarter didn't help matters either.    Ryan missed out on some touchdowns because Devonta Freeman scored thrice. Freeman tallied 139 yards on just 20 carries. He nearly scored a 4.h time, but lost a fumble at the 1-yard line. Tevin Coleman was given 14 carries, which he turned into 58 scoreless yards.    With Jones out of the lineup, the thinking was that Mohamed Sanu would step up statistically, but that didn't happen. The mediocre Sanu caught just 3 balls for 44 yards. Ryan preferred Aldrick Robinson (4-111) and Taylor Gabriel (3-60) instead. Gabriel caught a touchdown, as did Austin Hooper on his only reception.    If there's a dark cloud over this victory, it's the dislocated finger Keanu Neal sustained in the second half. Neal's finger was disgustingly bent the wrong way. You can probably find a picture online if you haven't seen it on TV yet. It was pretty gross. It's unclear if there will be any long-term ramifications because of this, but I imagine that Neal will be able to play through this.    Going quickly through the 49ers, Colin Kaepernick struggled once again, going 20-of-33 for 183 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was doing nothing until the Falcons were up 21-0, which is when they relaxed and allowed Kaepernick to engineer a couple of scoring drives. Kaepernick can be a decent quarterback when the opponent doesn't try very hard, and that's exactly what happened in this contest. Kaepernick had a very ugly throw that was way late across the middle. He was fortunate that it wasn't picked off, but decisions like that will lead to interceptions in the future.    Carlos Hyde would've had a semi-decent game if it wasn't for an ugly blemish early on. Hyde lost a fumble to begin the game, leading to an Atlanta touchdown. Hyde otherwise gained 71 yards on 13 carries. Not a bad stat line considering that his 2 top offensive linemen - Joe Staley, Daniel Kilgore - were both out of the lineup.    Only 1 49er player accumulated more than 30 receiving yards, which was Blake Bell, who secured a 45-yard reception. "
