   "comment":"Quinten Rollins' poor coverage (though Rollins later redeemed himself with a pick). Take that away, and Foles was just 10-of-29 for only 73 yards and all of those interceptions. That's a YPA of just 2.5! Brodie Croyle even scoffs at YPAs like that. Foles was abysmal. He opened the game by taking a sack to take his team out of field goal range. His first interception wasn't his fault because Gurley fell down. However, Foles was then responsible for a delay-of-game infraction immediately following Rodgers' first turnover, and then was pick-sixed amid heavy pressure. Jeff Fisher showed such little faith in Foles that he opted to run a draw on a third-and-8 on the Green Bay 42-yard line with about 40 seconds and a timeout remaining in the opening half. Foles was also brutal following intermission. In fact, the best pass play St. Louis had outside of the garbage-time completion to Bailey was on a fake punt.    I'd commend the special teams, but "
