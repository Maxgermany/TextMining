   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas was guilty of dropping a pass and running the wrong route on 1 instance. Meanwhile, the offensive line couldn't block; Tebow took a whopping 7 sacks. Tebow began the game 4-of-14 for 60 yards. It was pretty ugly. I mentioned the poor blocking and atrocious receivers, but Tebow was partly to blame. He had some really hideous throws, including 1 where he completely overthrew a running back in the flat. There was also an instance in which Tebow could have been pick-sixed. But all of that doesn't matter because Tebow led his team to victory. He finished the contest 9-of-13 for 101 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 2-point conversion on a rushing attempt.    This game wasn't all about Tebow. OK, maybe it was. But here are some other notes: - "

In the first half, Tebow was sacked 3 times and under steady pressure, making only 4-of-13 passes for 37 yards. He also had carried the ball 4 times for 15 yards. FOX analyst John Lynch was very critical of the Broncos' play calling for not setting up some easy completions. When it was Detroit's turn, Stafford threw a jump ball and "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas, whpo dropped what would have been a first down in New England teritory on a third down during the team's second drive. I counted 5 drops in total.    Tebow finished just 9-of-26 for 136 yards and only had 13 rushing yards on top of that. Detractors will scoff at his poor stats, but he really had no chance to do anything. There aren't many quarterbacks who can succeed with pressure in their face on 9 out of every 10 plays.    A couple of bright spots for Denver: Willis McGahee rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Unlike last week, he didn't fumble. Meanwhile, Thomas hauled in 6 grabs for 93 yards, continuing to show good chemistry with Tebow. The tandem will be much better with an offseason to work with each other.    While Tebow hit the ground more than a dozen times, "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas caught a long pass early in the game and was racing down the field when Sterling Moore popped the ball out from behind. Moore recovered the ball just in front of the goal line. A blind-side sack by Rob Ninkovich forced a fumble, which Vince Wilfork pounced on, to set up a Ridley touchdown and a 31-7 lead for New England.    After Denver went down by 24 points, Manning moved the ball down the field quickly on a few possessions. He finished drives with short touchdown throws to Eric Decker (4-21), Joel Dreessen (4-21) and Brandon Stokley (2-10). Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1.handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a 4.h down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the 4.h quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas in the end zone and then Thomas paid him back with a dropped first down. Later on, a Manning pass fell incomplete on a 3rd-and-1 because he and Joel Dreesseen had a miscommunication. Manning would end up finishing 17-of-28 for 204 yards and a touchdown that went 51 yards to Eric Decker (8-133). Manning was pressured often for the third week in a row; he was sacked twice, but it could have been uglier for him if he wasn't capable of releasing the ball so quickly. Denver's offensive line has to be a concern heading into the playoffs, though getting guard Chris Kuper back from injury will help.    Decker was the only Denver wideout who had more than 36 receiving yards. Demaryius Thomas did very little (4-13), thanks to the aforementioned miscues early on.    The Broncos became the latest team to gash the Ravens on the ground. Moreno compiled 118 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries, which includes 1 play where he impressively leapt over "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas, Julius Thomas, Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past 3 weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does 10. to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him 4 away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish 1 to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on 8 carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on 3 tries.    As mentioned, Caldwell was the 1 who found the end zone on both occasions, leaving Demaryius Thomas (4-45), Julius Thomas (4-49) and Decker (2-42) with meager numbers.    Denver's defense, meanwhile, couldn't do anything right. This includes... - Stopping the run. "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas (8-54). Julius Thomas led the team in receiving (6-76) though he also committed a drop and lost a fumble that led to a missed field goal (more on that later). Decker, meanwhile, barely did anything positive on offense (2-32), but had a great punt return that would've been a touchdown had he not tripped over his own 2 feet.    The Broncos ran the ball extremely well with both of their running backs. Knowshon Moreno tallied 82 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, while Montee Ball looked very powerful as he registered 52 yards on just 10 attempts. Denver's ability to pound the ball allowed it to control the clock - it won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 11 minutes - which is exactly how San Diego won the previous matchup between these teams. The Broncos simply gave the Chargers a taste of their own medicine.    San Diego was able to control the clock last time via the run. That was not the case in this contest, as a hobbled Ryan Mathews mustered just 26 yards on 5 carries (most of which came on a 16-yard scamper in which he was bottled up that was broken outside). Danny Woodhead led the team with 29 rushing yards on 9 attempts.    There were 3 themes for the Chargers in this game: 1. San Diego couldn't pass protect. "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas in the back of the end zone. The Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and never relinquished possession. Russell Wilson converted first down after first down using both his arms and his legs. He marched Seattle all the way down the field and into the end zone. Manning never even had a chance in the extra session. What Manning did in the final minute was unbelievable, but he struggled mightily throughout the afternoon. He had issues with the crowd noise throughout the entire contest, and he simply didn't try to convert third-and-longs very much, settling for ineffective Montee Ball draws in those situations. His passes fluttered all over the place, some of which weren't even close to his intended targets. He also nearly threw a second interception - though it occurred prior to his actual 1 - as Kam Chancellor snagged a pass that just barely hit the ground. Chancellor would redeem himself later by securing what seemed to be a game-clinching pick in the red zone. However, Manning flipped the switch at the very end and gave his team a chance. He finished 31-of-49 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and that pick. Consider that Manning was just 11-of-16 for only 87 yards at intermission. Also, to be fair, Demaryius Thomas was hobbled with an injury throughout. He left the game briefly, but was never the same upon returning. It didn't help that he had to battle "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas for a big gain. However, Manning missed on his next couple of passes and had to settle for a field goal. The second drive was completely ruined with a bad snap and a subsequent sack by Muhammad Wilkerson. Manning then took another sack, while his offensive linemen continuously were flagged for holding penalties that nullified nice gains. With Vegas poised to lose a ton of money with a Denver cover, it looked awfully suspicious that the Broncos' big plays were nullified. However, an Aqib Talib pick-six at the very end ensured that the sportsbooks paid for posting such a short spread. Vegas lost millions because of that score. Manning struggled early, but ultimately got on track. He finished 22-of-33 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns, and he's now just 3 scores short of breaking Brett Favre's career record. One of Manning's best throws wasn't a touchdown, but ultimately led to 1. It was just an 8-yard completion, but he managed to find Demaryius Thomas for the gain while falling down. Thomas, in turn, tapped his toes inbounds, prompting Rex Ryan to throw the challenge flag. I have no idea how Manning managed to convert the pass. Manning's touchdowns once again went to nothing but Thomases. Demaryius (10-124) snagged 1. while Julius (4-51) had a pair. Julius yelled, It's so f***ing easy! It's so easy! following 1 of his scores. He was absolutely right, as New York's secondary once again offered no resistance.    "

Demaryius Thomas, who found the end zone twice, logged 8 yards for 171 yards.

Thomas also dropped a pass in overtime, but was fortunate that the Browns were flagged for 12 men on the field. Sanders, meanwhile, appeared to injure his shoulder at the very end of the 4.h quarter. Sanders seemingly caught a deep pass, but celebrated too much while grabbing his shoulder. As a result, time expired, ruining a chance at a field goal.

The drives were inconsistent for the rest of the first half after that, as Osweiler was sacked 5 times. However, Osweiler picked up some momentum following intermission and ended up completing 7-of-10 passes for 106 yards and a score in the second half, leading the Broncos on a 71-yard scoring drive to put this game away. Osweiler's final numbers were 20-of-27 for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns - impressive, considering how much pressure he was under all afternoon. He showed some zip on his passes and was able to scramble a couple of times, which was a vast change from what the Broncos have been used to from the decrepit Manning.    Despite the early touchdown, Thomas didn't really do much after that. He and Osweiler simply couldn't hook up, as Thomas snagged just 3 of his 8 targets for 59 yards and the score. Osweiler had way more success hooking up with his tight ends. "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the 4.h horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a 4.h timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell.    Brady's 3 touchdowns were thrown to Gronkowski (6-88), Chandler (5-58), who needs to be added in all formats if Gronkowski misses time, and running back Brandon Bolden (4 catches, 84 receiving yards), who beat Danny Trevathan on a wheel route for a 63-yard score. LaFell saw 9 targets, but snatched only 4 of them for 36 yards.    The Patriots predictably struggled to run the ball against Denver's stout front. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for only 27 yards on 9 carries. There will be better days for Blount versus weaker defenses.    Brock Osweiler, meanwhile, led the Broncos to a second-consecutive victory, and he continued to look much better than Peyton Manning. Osweiler went 23-of-42 for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was batted at the line of scrimmage, but his numbers don't tell the entire story. First of all, Osweiler was hurt by countless drops. Andre Caldwell let 1 go through his hands early, but Demaryius Thomas was the primary culprit. Thomas was guilty of 8 negative plays, which were either drops or passes defensed because he didn't come back for the ball. Thus, Osweiler could've easily completed 32 of his 42 attempts, which would've been extremely impressive against a stellar defense in fierce weather. Also with Osweiler, there were some negatives. He took a couple of bad sacks because he held on to the ball too long. He was bailed out by the hold on Thomas on 1 occasion, but another took his team out of field goal range. Also, Osweiler seemed to have trouble lining his team up sometimes, prompting the Broncos to waste a couple of timeouts early in the second half.    Going back to Thomas, he saw a whopping 13 targets, but was able to reel in just 1 pass for 36 yards. As mentioned, Thomas dropped passes and refused to come back for passes. He also had some miscommunications with Osweiler. I've never seen Thomas play so poorly before; it's as if he spent the entire prior night partying with Johnny Manziel. However, Thomas came up big when it mattered most, as his 36-yard reception came on a late drive in which Denver took the lead.    Denver's leading receiver was "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas wide open in the end zone for a 3-yard score. That was really the only drive for Denver's offense, which totaled 293 yards on the day. Late in the first quarter, Philip Rivers was hit as he threw by Malik Jackson, and the ball floated to Danny Trevathan for an interception. Trevathan coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. It was Rivers' 6.h pick-six of the season. Each team had a field goal drive before the half, and the Broncos took a 17-3 lead into the locker room. Early in the third quarter, Melvin Gordon had his fifth fumble of the season, which was recovered by the Broncos before they missed the field goal from 52 yards. San Diego wide receiver Malcom Floyd later fumbled the ball away after a hit from Josh Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position. Virgil Green burned Manti Te'o for 22 yards to get inside the 30 yards, but Osweiler threw a ball up for grabs in the end zone that Jason Verrett intercepted for San Diego. Both defenses shut the door, so there was no scoring in the second half.    Philip Rivers completed 18-of-35 passes for 202 yards and an interception. He was under heavy pressure from start to finish.    Melvin Gordon ran for 55 yards on 12 carries, but once again had ball-security issues. Adrian Peterson is the only back who has fumbled the ball more than Gordon than this season.    Antonio Gates led the Chargers' receivers with 6 catches for 50 yards. Both Stevie Johnson and Dontrelle Inman sustained injuries.    Brock Osweiler was 16-of-26 for 166 yards with a touchdown and 1 interception. He did a decent job of managing the game, but missed some opportunities to go vertical on San Diego.    Ronnie Hillman led the Broncos on the ground with 56 yards on 19 carries. C.J. Anderson got hurt, but was kept out for precautionary reasons.    Demaryius Thomas had 61 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions.    Denver's defense was tremendous. "

Sanders complained to the media during the week that he wasn't being used properly. He won't be upset about that after this performance.

On top of his impressive stat line - 10 catches, 133 yards - he also drew a pass interference flag.    Contrary to the Giants, the Broncos couldn't run the ball at all. "

   "comment":"Demaryius Thomas in the 4.h quarter was a great throw. Osweiler finally was able to launch a nice touch pass with perfect accuracy and ball location that Thomas went up to catch in the end zone. That score brought the Broncos to within 3. but they couldn't pull off the win. Overall, Osweiler finished 23-of-42 for 254 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a decent performance for him, but it's clear that he is a backup at the NFL level. He simply doesn't have the pocket awareness or consistent downfield accuracy to be a strong starter. The Broncos will likely look to add some competition to their quarterback room in the offseason. Perhaps they will consider 1 of the first-round quarterbacks in the 2018 NFL Draft.    Osweiler's top receivers this week were the aforementioned Thomas (5-64, 1 TD) and "
