Tebow began the game 4-of-14 for 60 yards. It was pretty ugly. I mentioned the poor blocking and atrocious receivers, but Tebow was partly to blame. He had some really hideous throws, including 1 where he completely overthrew a running back in the flat. There was also an instance in which Tebow could have been pick-sixed. But all of that doesn't matter because Tebow led his team to victory. He finished the contest 9-of-13 for 101 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 2-point conversion on a rushing attempt.    This game wasn't all about Tebow. OK, maybe it was. But here are some other notes: - "

Tebow finished 10-of-21 for 316 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 50 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. If you were unfortunate enough to miss this contest, Tebow was simply amazing. He was really accurate downfield, including 1 pass in which he made a perfect back-shoulder throw. He went through his progressions like any good quarterback. He showed great pocket awareness. And of course, he ran when needed to, displaying his trademark rushing ability. The Broncos led throughout, beginning in the second quarter, but it looked like they might lose this playoff battle late in the fourth quarter and overtime. The ironic thing was it would have been everyone's fault but Tebow's. Willis McGahee (19-61) fumbled at midfield prior to Pittsburgh's game-tying drive. The defense struggled to stop a hobbled Ben Roethlisberger, including Champ Bailey, who dropped an interception that went right through his hands right before Big Ben hit Jerricho Cotchery for the tying score.    @HunterAnsley tweeted, Josh McDaniels, the easiest target for lazy NFL fans, drafted both players that just won that game. Pretty crazy, huh? Thomas was amazing despite the aforementioned drop, catching 4 balls for 204 yards and the 80-yard decisive touchdown, torching corner Ike Taylor all evening."

Tebow finished just 9-of-26 for 136 yards and only had 13 rushing yards on top of that. Detractors will scoff at his poor stats, but he really had no chance to do anything. There aren't many quarterbacks who can succeed with pressure in their face on 9 out of every 10 plays.    A couple of bright spots for Denver: Willis McGahee rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Unlike last week, he didn't fumble. Meanwhile, Thomas hauled in 6 grabs for 93 yards, continuing to show good chemistry with Tebow. The tandem will be much better with an offseason to work with each other.

A pass bounced off Eric Decker later in the drive, but dropped into tight end Joel Dreesen in the back of the end zone. That put the Broncos down 31-25 with 6 minutes remaining. Denver didn't get the ball back until there were only seconds on the clock, and the Broncos were too far from the end zone to have a real shot at stealing a win.

   "comment":"Thomas caught a long pass early in the game and was racing down the field when Sterling Moore popped the ball out from behind. Moore recovered the ball just in front of the goal line. A blind-side sack by Rob Ninkovich forced a fumble, which Vince Wilfork pounced on, to set up a Ridley touchdown and a 31-7 lead for New England.    After Denver went down by 24 points, Manning moved the ball down the field quickly on a few possessions. He finished drives with short touchdown throws to Eric Decker (4-21), Joel Dreessen (4-21) and Brandon Stokley (2-10). Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1-handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the fourth quarter on a fourth-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a fourth down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the fourth quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   "

Brees misfired again - the ball was picked off on an underthrow - giving the Broncos great field position and a subsequent touchdown.

   "comment":"Thomas (4-22). Jacksonville had a lot of opportunities for big plays go wasted. In the first quarter, the Jaguars dropped 2 potential interceptions. An incredibly dumb un-sportsmanlike conduct penalty on Andre Branch gave the Broncos a first down after they just been stopped on third down. Manning took advantage with a pass down the seam to Wes Welker (6-63) for a 20-yard touchdown. After the Jaguars got a field goal set up by Justin Blackmon, Manning fumbled a snap. Jacksonville recovered that for its second field goal. A bobbled field goal snap cost the Jaguars more points, but a few plays later Paul Posluszny made a fantastic leaping catch before racing down the field for a 59-yard pick-6. The 2-point conversion try was picked off by Champ Bailey, but the Broncos had only a 14-12 halftime lead. Denver came out in the third quarter with a nice drive that almost ended in a turnover from a Ronnie Hillman fumble, but Eric Decker (5-50) recovered the ball. The Broncos finished the drive by having Moreno plunge into the end zone. The Jaguars answered with a possession led by completions to Blackmon. Maurice Jones-Drew (21-71) ripped off a 28-yard run and ended it with a short touchdown run. Manning came back to hit Demaryius Thomas (3-78) along the sideline, and he had a great run after the catch for a 42-yard gain. That set up Moreno for an 8-yard touchdown run. A 34-yard fake punt by the Broncos had them deep in Jacksonville territory, but another fumbled snap by Manning was recovered by the Jaguars. "

Manning answered with a drive down the field that was capped off with a short touchdown run from Montee Ball (11-37). The Broncos' next drive went down to the 1-yard line. On fourth-and-goal, Manning hit Joel Dreessen (2-9) for a touchdown to tie the game. Sav Rocca soon shanked a punt, which set up Denver at Washington's 35-yard line. The next play was a perfectly called and executed screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. He bolted down the field and weaved his way into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown. Moreno had a big game with 14 carries for 44 yards, 6 receptions for 89 yards and that score. Von Miller then made his presence felt with a strip-sack that was recovered by Derek Wolfe at the Redskins' 24-yard line. That led to a field goal. The Broncos got the ball back and were driving for more points when E.J. Biggers dropped an interception, but Jordan Pugh caught the deflection. Griffin gave it right back 2 plays later as Pierre Garcon fell down and the pass was caught by Chris Harris. Denver put the game on ice with a Demaryius Thomas 35-yard touchdown on short pass. Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to "

   "comment":"Thomas (3-106), who beat Cooper on his release to get open for a long catch and run of 77 yards inside Kansas City's 20-yard line. Denver took the lead with Decker's third touchdown catch of the game. He also beat Cooper on that play. Smith tossed a perfectly thrown deep ball that was dropped by A.J. Jenkins, so the Chiefs had to punt. Montee Ball (13-117) had a 45-yard run to midfield on a drive that also ended with a touchdown toss to Decker against Cooper. Despite Donnie Avery having 2 bad drops on passes downfield, Smith methodically moved the ball. At the goal line, Jamaal Charles (19-93) dove over the top to cut the Broncos lead to 7. Moreno converted a second-and-20 with a 31-yard completion, but eventually the Chiefs defense got off the field. The Chiefs took over inside their 10 with 3 and a half minutes remaining. Smith completed a 26-yarder on a third down to Jenkins (3-35), Dexter McCluster (5-43) made a diving catch for 28 yards and Smith got 25 more on a back shoulder to Bowe (3-56). On fourth down from the 12-yard line, Smith threw incomplete for Bowe in the end zone.    Smith finished 26-of-42 for 293 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He also ran for 46 yards on 4 caries.    Manning was 22-of-35 for 403 yards with 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Moreno was held to 18 yards on 15 carries, but had 4 receptions for 72 yards. Decker destroyed the Chiefs for 174 yards on 8 receptions with 4 touchdowns.    The Broncos really missed Derek Wolfe at the point of attack. Tight end Julius Thomas was missed as well. "

   "comment":"Thomas for a gain of 21 along the sideline. Manning was also able to move the chains after hitting his target on a third-and-6. This allowed Denver to bleed the clock out, as all Rivers could do was stand on the sidelines and wave his arms in disgust.    Manning didn't post eye-popping numbers like he did on many occasions during the regular season, but he was able to convert clutch throws. He went 25-of-36 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns andan interception that wasn't his fault (the ball deflected off Eric Decker's chest to safety Darrell Stuckey in the end zone). Manning suffered through several drops, including that Decker screw-up. Wes Welker also had a potential touchdown clang off his arms. However, Manning got away with a couple of picks, including 1 where he floated a pass downfield on the opening drive. The San Diego defender had the ball simply fall through his arms. This was a blown opportunity for the Chargers, as Denver eventually found the end zone on that drive.    Manning's touchdowns went to Welker (6-38) and Demaryius Thomas (8-54). Julius Thomas led the team in receiving (6-76) though he also committed a drop and lost a fumble that led to a missed field goal (more on that later). Decker, meanwhile, barely did anything positive on offense (2-32), but had a great punt return that would've been a touchdown had he not tripped over his own 2 feet.    The Broncos ran the ball extremely well with both of their running backs. "

Brady tried a screen early on a third-and-long that went nowhere. Manning bobbled a shotgun snap and still managed to convert a first down in the opening quarter. Brady took the only sack of the first half in field goal range. Manning's receivers got away with blatant offensive pass interferences. Brady's target was called for interference (referred to as a pillow fight by Phil Simms), negating a field goal. Manning got to play without Aqib Talib covering his receivers. Brady had to deal with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie after the corner got hurt. Manning converted second-and-20 deep in his own territory. Brady was sacked on third-and-10 deep in Denver territory. Manning got points in the 2-minute drill with an impressive drive at the end of the first half. Brady couldn't hit an open Austin Collie down the sideline for a big gain just before halftime. Manning was 18-of-25 for 214 yards and a touchdown in the first half. Brady was just 9-of-15 for 144 yards in the first half. Manning helped the Broncos accumulate 270 net yards in the opening half. Brady restricted the Patriots to 119 net yards in the opening half. Manning achieved 6 first downs in the opening touchdown drive of the third quarter. Brady managed just 6 first downs in the entire opening half. Manning had a stretch in which he converted 19 of 20 passes. Brady didn't get the Patriots inside the Denver 18-yard line until there were 10 minutes remaining in the game. Manning went 32-of-43 for 400 yards (third-most in AFC Championship history) and 2 touchdowns. Brady finished 24-of-38 for 277 yards and only 1 touchdown.    Two things absolutely killed the Patriots' chances of winning this game, and I alluded to both already. The first was Brady's inaccuracy. He overthrew several of his targets. Had he hit them, New England may have been victorious. He was sharp in the fourth quarter, but only because he had the luxury of battling a prevent defense. The second was Talib's injury. Talib got hurt in last year's AFC Championship, which completely ruined Bill Belichick's defensive game plan. The same thing happened in this contest. The Patriots actually played Denver's offense pretty well until Talib went down. After that, New England couldn't get the Broncos off the field, as Manning continuously hit Demaryius Thomas, who led all receivers with 134 yards and a touchdown on 7 catches. "

   "comment":"Thomas in the back of the end zone. The Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and never relinquished possession. Russell Wilson converted first down after first down using both his arms and his legs. He marched Seattle all the way down the field and into the end zone. Manning never even had a chance in the extra session. What Manning did in the final minute was unbelievable, but he struggled mightily throughout the afternoon. He had issues with the crowd noise throughout the entire contest, and he simply didn't try to convert third-and-longs very much, settling for ineffective Montee Ball draws in those situations. His passes fluttered all over the place, some of which weren't even close to his intended targets. He also nearly threw a second interception - though it occurred prior to his actual 1 - as Kam Chancellor snagged a pass that just barely hit the ground. Chancellor would redeem himself later by securing what seemed to be a game-clinching pick in the red zone. However, Manning flipped the switch at the very end and gave his team a chance. He finished 31-of-49 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and that pick. Consider that Manning was just 11-of-16 for only 87 yards at intermission. Also, to be fair, Demaryius Thomas was hobbled with an injury throughout. He left the game briefly, but was never the same upon returning. It didn't help that he had to battle "

   "comment":"Thomas for a big gain. However, Manning missed on his next couple of passes and had to settle for a field goal. The second drive was completely ruined with a bad snap and a subsequent sack by Muhammad Wilkerson. Manning then took another sack, while his offensive linemen continuously were flagged for holding penalties that nullified nice gains. With Vegas poised to lose a ton of money with a Denver cover, it looked awfully suspicious that the Broncos' big plays were nullified. However, an Aqib Talib pick-6 at the very end ensured that the sportsbooks paid for posting such a short spread. Vegas lost millions because of that score. Manning struggled early, but ultimately got on track. He finished 22-of-33 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns, and he's now just 3 scores short of breaking Brett Favre's career record. One of Manning's best throws wasn't a touchdown, but ultimately led to 1. It was just an 8-yard completion, but he managed to find Demaryius Thomas for the gain while falling down. Thomas, in turn, tapped his toes inbounds, prompting Rex Ryan to throw the challenge flag. I have no idea how Manning managed to convert the pass. Manning's touchdowns once again went to nothing but Thomases. Demaryius (10-124) snagged 1, while Julius (4-51) had a pair. Julius yelled, It's so f***ing easy! It's so easy! following 1 of his scores. He was absolutely right, as New York's secondary once again offered no resistance.    "

On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to Khalif Barnes. He fumbled the ball to Denver at the Oakland 18-yard line. Manning quickly produced another touchdown with a slant to Julius Thomas (6-63). Another touchdown pass to Thomas put the game away. Carr soon threw an interception to "

He shredded the Dolphins mercilessly, though he made 1 mistake when he missed an open Sanders for a deep touchdown. Manning also should've had another score, but offensive pass interference negated a Demaryius Thomas touchdown. To be fair to the Dolphins, they didn't have much of a chance because of the injuries they sustained. "

   "comment":"Thomas' absence. They continuously pounded the Chiefs, who haven't been able to stop the rush all year. 2. The pass rush: Alex Smith didn't have a chance in this game. His dreadful offensive line took 6 sacks. I have no idea what Eric Fisher was trying to do on some of the plays, as he looked more like a seventh-round prospect than a No. 1 overall pick. Six different Chiefs registered at least half a sack, and it's a miracle that Smith made it out of this game without an injury. 3. Bad luck/coaching for Kansas City: This was 1 of those days where nothing went right for the Chiefs. They accepted a penalty on a Denver punt and then watched the Broncos convert a fake. Smith had an interception tipped by Terrance Knighton that floated perfectly into DeMarcus Ware's arms. The Chiefs dropped 3 interceptions from Manning. The Broncos were able to recover a muffed punt when a clueless Kansas City player had the ball bounce off his leg after a poor kick, and coincidentally, the senile Walt Coleman missed that the recovering player didn't make an attempt to come inbounds after being pushed out, which should have been flagged. And, to put the cherry on top, Donnie Avery lost a fumble in Denver territory with about 4 minutes remaining. It also must be noted that Jamaal Charles had just 14 touches in this game. Reid had 10 days to prepare for this key divisional battle, and that's what he came up with? Granted, Charles gained just 35 yards on his 10 carries, but he's Kansas City's best player, by far. He needs the ball in his hands as much as possible. Fortunately for Charles' fantasy owners, he saved them with 4 catches for 24 receiving yards and a touchdown.    Alex Smith went 15-of-23 for 153 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned tipped interception. He had 1 very poor pass when he threw behind Dwayne Bowe in the red zone, but otherwise was OK. He just had no chance to maintain drives because of poor play-calling and terrible pass protection.    Meanwhile, Manning's final numbers looked like: 17-of-34 for only 179 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was just 4-of-14 for 43 yards after intermission. Manning converted some third-and-long situations early on because the Chiefs blitzed, which was foolish. However, they improved their game plan as the evening progressed and limited the Broncos to just 150 net yards in the second half. Manning was very fortunate that he got away with 3 interceptions. He didn't turn the ball over, save for his lost fumble, but the Kansas City defenders had their hands on 3 separate Manning throws.    Manning's 2 touchdowns went to Demaryius Thomas (6-63) and Anderson. Thomas hurt his quarterback with an early dropped touchdown. "

   "comment":"Thomas on a rollout and then overshot Emmanuel Sanders for a touchdown in the first quarter. Later on, he was errant on another potential touchdown to Sanders. He was then pick-sixed on a telegraphed throw. Even if you don't like Manning, this had to be painful to watch. He's a shell of his former self, and he can't use a bogus leg injury for an excuse this time. If you own him for some reason - he was on my bust list all summer - I would unload him immediately.    Manning's futility was the primary story of this game. Another very significant event was Terrell Suggs' season-ending Achilles tear in the second half. I wrote about what this means for the Ravens in my Disaster Grades page. In addition to Suggs, Baltimore also lost Eugene Monroe to a concussion. Not having Monroe completely changed the offense, as Joe Flacco, like Manning, was suddenly constantly under siege. The stats show that Flacco took just 2 sacks, but he was under duress all the time, and he had to force quick and inaccurate throws as a result. The lack of weapons Flacco had at his disposal also hindered him. Steve Smith was banged up a bit, which didn't help the already-bad situation. Smith, as a result, wasn't very effective (2 catches, 13 yards), so Flacco had to rely on Crockett Gillmore as his primary option on a potential game-winning drive at the end of regulation. Flacco actually did a good job of moving the chains, hooking up with Gillmore on a big completion and drawing a pass interference going to him once more, but after Smith let a touchdown fall through his hands in the end zone, Flacco was intercepted on another attempt toward Gillmore. Flacco finished 18-of-32 for 117 yards and 2 picks. The first interception matched Manning's pick-6. Aqib Talib, who snatched the ball, told the sideline reporter after the game that he recognized the play. He read it perfectly.    Flacco's leading receiver was Marlon Brown (2-25). Gillmore (2-23) was next. That's how bleak this situation is for Baltimore. Breshad Perriman needs to get healthy quickly.    Justin Forsett struggled as well. This was predictable, given how stout Denver's front line is, and Forsett had no hope after Monroe exited with an injury. He tried to help his PPR owners with 4 catches, but those went for just 13 receiving yards. He'll improve against inferior opponents, so target him as a buy-low candidate.    Going back to the Broncos for a bit, Ronnie Hillman actually outgained C.J. Anderson, 41-29, despite having the same amount of carries (12). The Ravens have a ferocious run defense, so don't be concerned for that reason if you drafted Anderson in the first round. Anderson sprained his toe, but he's fine, according to head coach Gary Kubiak.    Manning didn't throw a touchdown, so the Denver receivers also underwhelmed their fantasy owners. Sanders led the way with 8 catches for 65 yards, while Thomas (7-60) was right behind him. As with Manning, try to trade these guys because they won't be as productive with Manning and his decaying arm.   "

However, Osweiler picked up some momentum following intermission and ended up completing 7-of-10 passes for 106 yards and a score in the second half, leading the Broncos on a 71-yard scoring drive to put this game away. Osweiler's final numbers were 20-of-27 for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns - impressive, considering how much pressure he was under all afternoon. He showed some zip on his passes and was able to scramble a couple of times, which was a vast change from what the Broncos have been used to from the decrepit Manning.    Despite the early touchdown, Thomas didn't really do much after that. He and Osweiler simply couldn't hook up, as Thomas snagged just 3 of his 8 targets for 59 yards and the score. Osweiler had way more success hooking up with his tight ends. "

   "comment":"Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the fourth horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a fourth timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell.    Brady's 3 touchdowns were thrown to Gronkowski (6-88), Chandler (5-58), who needs to be added in all formats if Gronkowski misses time, and running back Brandon Bolden (4 catches, 84 receiving yards), who beat Danny Trevathan on a wheel route for a 63-yard score. LaFell saw 9 targets, but snatched only 4 of them for 36 yards.    The Patriots predictably struggled to run the ball against Denver's stout front. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for only 27 yards on 9 carries. There will be better days for Blount versus weaker defenses.    Brock Osweiler, meanwhile, led the Broncos to a second-consecutive victory, and he continued to look much better than Peyton Manning. Osweiler went 23-of-42 for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was batted at the line of scrimmage, but his numbers don't tell the entire story. First of all, Osweiler was hurt by countless drops. Andre Caldwell let 1 go through his hands early, but Demaryius Thomas was the primary culprit. Thomas was guilty of 8 negative plays, which were either drops or passes defensed because he didn't come back for the ball. Thus, Osweiler could've easily completed 32 of his 42 attempts, which would've been extremely impressive against a stellar defense in fierce weather. Also with Osweiler, there were some negatives. He took a couple of bad sacks because he held on to the ball too long. He was bailed out by the hold on Thomas on 1 occasion, but another took his team out of field goal range. Also, Osweiler seemed to have trouble lining his team up sometimes, prompting the Broncos to waste a couple of timeouts early in the second half.    Going back to Thomas, he saw a whopping 13 targets, but was able to reel in just 1 pass for 36 yards. As mentioned, Thomas dropped passes and refused to come back for passes. He also had some miscommunications with Osweiler. I've never seen Thomas play so poorly before; it's as if he spent the entire prior night partying with Johnny Manziel. However, Thomas came up big when it mattered most, as his 36-yard reception came on a late drive in which Denver took the lead.    Denver's leading receiver was "

   "comment":"Thomas wide open in the end zone for a 3-yard score. That was really the only drive for Denver's offense, which totaled 293 yards on the day. Late in the first quarter, Philip Rivers was hit as he threw by Malik Jackson, and the ball floated to Danny Trevathan for an interception. Trevathan coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. It was Rivers' sixth pick-6 of the season. Each team had a field goal drive before the half, and the Broncos took a 17-3 lead into the locker room. Early in the third quarter, Melvin Gordon had his fifth fumble of the season, which was recovered by the Broncos before they missed the field goal from 52 yards. San Diego wide receiver Malcom Floyd later fumbled the ball away after a hit from Josh Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position. Virgil Green burned Manti Te'o for 22 yards to get inside the 30 yards, but Osweiler threw a ball up for grabs in the end zone that Jason Verrett intercepted for San Diego. Both defenses shut the door, so there was no scoring in the second half.    Philip Rivers completed 18-of-35 passes for 202 yards and an interception. He was under heavy pressure from start to finish.    Melvin Gordon ran for 55 yards on 12 carries, but once again had ball-security issues. Adrian Peterson is the only back who has fumbled the ball more than Gordon than this season.    Antonio Gates led the Chargers' receivers with 6 catches for 50 yards. Both Stevie Johnson and Dontrelle Inman sustained injuries.    Brock Osweiler was 16-of-26 for 166 yards with a touchdown and 1 interception. He did a decent job of managing the game, but missed some opportunities to go vertical on San Diego.    Ronnie Hillman led the Broncos on the ground with 56 yards on 19 carries. C.J. Anderson got hurt, but was kept out for precautionary reasons.    Demaryius Thomas had 61 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions.    Denver's defense was tremendous. "

   "comment":"Thomas, who caught 2 touchdowns from Osweiler, to help his team out to an imposing 27-13 lead at halftime. That lead was made even more imposing by a Denver defense, who were swarming Ben Roethlisberger early and often.    The Steelers did keep within striking distance as they probed the Broncos' defense, with their final 2 drives of the half looking good, but both ended with field goals by Chris Boswell. Those 2 drives were full of Antonio Brown dog-walking Chris Harris around the field and foreshadowed what would happen in the second half.    Coming into this game, the Broncos had allowed 115 completions on 204 wide receiver targets for 1,316 yards and 2 touchdowns to wide receivers. That's in 13 games, so entire opposing wide receiver groups had averaged barely over 100 yards receiving, and you can barely see the number that happens after you divide 2 by 13. That is some dominance. But then Mr. Antonio Brown walked onto the field. The second half was the Antonio Brown show, as he took his initial dominance of Chris Harris to a new level. Brown was consistently open and open quickly. Roethlisberger pelted him with targets, and after a third-quarter touchdown to get the Steelers within 7 points, Brown finished the scoring with a beautiful pass from Roethlisberger for the receiver's second touchdown of the game, to make it 34-27.    That's right, the Broncos didn't score a single point in the second half, as Pittsburgh's pass rush started getting to Osweiler, causing him to hurry his throws. He threw 1 interception, but had 2 others bounce off Steelers defensive backs' hands. But Demaryius Thomas and Vernon Davis, who both had costly drops for the second straight game, didn't help Osweiler."

Siemian finished 18-of-26 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and he also jogged for 20 rushing yards on 5 carries. Both picks occurred inside the Carolina 30-yard line - 2 of Denver's 3 give-aways took place there - as 1 was tipped at the line of scrimmage, while the other 1 transpired as Siemian was under pressure and threw off his back foot. I won't blame Siemian for the first pick, but the second 1 was inexcusable. That was 3 easy points off the board, which would've made a huge difference had Gano nailed that field goal. Siemian also got lucky on 1 occasion, when he had an open Virgil Green in the end zone, but underthrew him with a pass that was nearly picked off. It's too bad that Siemian is just a bridge to Paxton Lynch, because I think there's something there. Siemian is a smart, gritty quarterback who, at the very least, proved that he can be a viable backup quarterback in this league.    C.J. Anderson looked like Denver's best offensive player at times. He ran extremely well with great power and burst, gaining 92 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. He also caught 4 passes for 47 receiving yards and a second score. Anderson has gotten off to slow starts the past 2 years, thanks in part to conditioning, but he appears to be in terrific shape right now.    Siemian connected with Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas a total of 9 times, as both wideouts posted meager numbers, 5-49 and 4-48, respectively. Thomas dropped a pass inside the 5-yard line that was nearly picked on a deflection.

However, he's playing better than the decrepit Manning ever had this past season. The Bengals actually did a good job of pressuring Siemian, but his pocket presence was impressive, as he slid around in the backfield very well.    Sanders complained to the media during the week that he wasn't being used properly. He won't be upset about that after this performance. Sanders caught 2 of Siemian's touchdowns, racking up 9 grabs for 117 yards in the process. Thomas also had a big game, snatching 6 balls for 100 yards and a score. Tight end "

Thomas was very strong during the day, making many nice catches, including a couple where he rose up to perfectly catch the ball at its high point. Sanders was every bit as good as Thomas, though he saw 13 targets and appears to be a favorite of the Broncos' quarterbacks. Both receivers were able to score a touchdown and should continue to be great plays in fantasy.    Denver's running game was surprisingly ineffective against the Buccaneers. "

   "comment":"Thomas for a big gain, but the star receiver lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and following a late scare that involved an onside kick recovery, they finally sealed their first victory since they beat the Jaguars in Week 2.    Philip Rivers set the tone for this victory by torching the Broncos on the initial 2 drives. Rivers was absolutely on fire, slinging precise throws on nearly attempt. In fact, his second possession went for 10 minutes, which was the longest drive of the season for any team. He began 14-of-18 for 148 yards and a touchdown. However, Denver's defense clamped down on the Chargers after that. Rivers was just 4-of-11 for 30 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 18-of-29 for 178 yards and a score. His overall numbers would've been better had Antonio Gates not dropped 2 passes, 1 of which would've moved the chains on a third down. Rivers played a great game despite the injuries he's been dealing with up front; Joe Barksdale was the latest blocker to get hurt, though he did return to action eventually. Rivers passed Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time passing leader in terms of yards.    Gates caught only 2 passes for 16 yards, and he played second fiddle to Hunter Henry. The rookie tight end was terrific, catching 6 balls for 83 yards and a touchdown. He was dominant, and the struggling Denver linebackers didn't have any sort of answer for him.    Excluding Henry and Gates, only 3 Chargers caught multiple passes: Tyrell Williams (3-28), Travis Benjamin (3-17) and Dexter McCluster (2-15). Benjamin muffed a punt in the opening half, setting up a Denver field goal. However, he made up for it by drawing a pass-interference flag on Aqib Talib.    Melvin Gordon struggled to find running room for the most part, but finally broke free for a 48-yard gain in the third quarter. Gordon dashed for 94 yards on 27 carries.    Before moving on to the Broncos, I have to say that this was definitely a feel-good moment for Mike McCoy, who was set to be fired if the Chargers lost this game. A teary-eye McCoy addressed the media, which called for his firing during the week, and he told them that he met with his daughter right after the game.    Denver struggled to move the chains until garbage time at the end that nearly turned into an improbable comeback. The Broncos were limited to 60 net yards of offense in the opening half. Part of this was because the Chargers controlled the clock, holding the ball for 20:27 of 30 first-half minutes. The other part was that the entire offense was both ineffective and mistake-prone. Trevor Siemian struggled. His final numbers don't look horrible - 30-of-50, 230 yards, 1 touchdown - but at the end of the third quarter, he was just 10-of-19 for only 58 yards. He didn't have any significant yardage, as most came with the Broncos down 2 or 3 scores and the Chargers turning into a prevent defense that nearly lost them the game. It's unknown why they changed their strategy, but it nearly clost them. Siemian had chances to score points in meaningful action, but missed throws. He had Emmanuel Sanders open for a deep touchdown in the first quarter, but overshot him. There were other passes he should've converted, including a gain of 15 or so to Demaryius Thomas that would've moved the chains on a third down, but Siemian just missed him. He also nearly threw an interception, but the ball was dropped.    Mistakes killed the Broncos all evening. For instance, C.J. Anderson rushed for only 37 yards and was outgained by "

Thomas was able to catch a critical touchdown as well, and he used his size to jump over the New Orleans defensive back who was covering him. Thomas should be a high-end WR2 in most weeks, though he could have issues if Siemian struggles. Meanwhile, Sanders had some nice catches, but he played second fiddle to Thomas today. Sanders is still a strong option in fantasy, but occasionally, he will underproduce depending on the matchup.    The running game for the Broncos was not particularly strong. "

It was a decent performance for him, but it's clear that he is a backup at the NFL level. He simply doesn't have the pocket awareness or consistent downfield accuracy to be a strong starter. The Broncos will likely look to add some competition to their quarterback room in the offseason. Perhaps they will consider 1 of the first-round quarterbacks in the 2018 NFL Draft.
