   "comment":"Dan Bailey with an easier field goal, Romo lazily took his time and spiked the ball with 7 seconds left. Bailey hit the game-winner - only to see it nullified by a Garrett timeout. I don't understand what the hell Garrett was thinking. He asked for the stoppage and then looked sheephishly as he saw Bailey's kick split the uprights. Of course, Bailey's next attept would fail. The Cardinals would win in overtime, thanks to "

  "comment":"Dan Bailey's field goal range. But, the Cowboys wouldn't need that field goal, because Ezekiel Elliott would finish off the day with a 32-yard burst up the middle for the game-winning touchdown and his third touchdown of the day.    Elliott finished the day with 114 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries while adding 2 catches for 95 yards and a touchdown on 2 targets. He's now eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards on the year and has 10 total touchdowns through 9 games. He's your rookie of the year unless things go south fast.    The Cowboys are rolling. They've now won their last 8 games after losing their season opener, and they should be favored in every game going forward. Oh, and they have an extremely good backup quarterback if their hot rookie is hurt or forgets how to play football.    The Steelers aren't doing nearly as well, as they now have a losing record at 4-5. Fortunately for them, they also are only 1 game back of Baltimore for the division lead. Add in the facts that the Ravens play the Cowboys next week and the Steelers take on the winless Browns, and there's a decent shot the Steelers are feeling better about their long-term chances by this time next week.
