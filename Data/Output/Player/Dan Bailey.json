   "comment":"Bailey's field goal range. But, the Cowboys wouldn't need that field goal, because Ezekiel Elliott would finish off the day with a 32-yard burst up the middle for the game-winning touchdown and his third touchdown of the day.    Elliott finished the day with 114 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries while adding 2 catches for 95 yards and a touchdown on 2 targets. He's now eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards on the year and has 10 total touchdowns through 9 games. He's your rookie of the year unless things go south fast.    The Cowboys are rolling. They've now won their last 8 games after losing their season opener, and they should be favored in every game going forward. Oh, and they have an extremely good backup quarterback if their hot rookie is hurt or forgets how to play football.    The Steelers aren't doing nearly as well, as they now have a losing record at 4-5. Fortunately for them, they also are only 1 game back of Baltimore for the division lead. Add in the facts that the Ravens play the Cowboys next week and the Steelers take on the winless Browns, and there's a decent shot the Steelers are feeling better about their long-term chances by this time next week.

Garrett didn't recognize it even though numerous readers did and asked me about it.    As for Prescott, he was brilliant in the 4.h quarter. The Burnett-less Packer secondary had no answer for him, as Prescott made numerous clutch plays, including a third-and-14 throw to "
