   "comment":"Jamison Crowder, but Dustin Hopkins missed a 45-yarder off the upright. On the final play of the half, Hopkins tied the game at 3. In the third quarter, the Lions got moving with an 18-yard run from Stafford and then a 52-yard bomb to Marvin Jones, who got a step on Josh Norman. Norman was injured on the play and went into the locker room with a concussion. A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10. The big play was Cousins hitting Vernon Davis (6-79) for a 27-yard reception to the Lions' 1-yard line, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Robert Kelley. Chris Baker bull-rushed through Larry Warford to help get the ball back for the Redskins. Washington moved down the field with Chris Thompson receiving and running the ball into the red zone. Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. Andre Roberts (1-20) made a great leaping grab to move the ball inside the 20. With just under 30 seconds remaining, Stafford threw a frozen rope to Anquan Boldin (3-28-1) for an 18-yard touchdown pass to win the game for Detroit.    Stafford entered this game red hot, but the Redskins' defense put the clamps on him in the first 2 quarters while being aided by some dropped passes by his receivers. He was only 7-of-13 for 79 yards at the intermission, but came up big in crunch time to finish 18-of-29 for 266 yards with a touchdown. Stafford also ran for 32 yards.    Justin Forsett led the Lions with 33 yards on 8 carries, plus 2 receptions for 15 yards. Marvin Jones led Detroit with 4 catches for 94 yards.    Kirk Cousins completed 30-of-39 passes for 301 yards with a touchdown. Jamison Crowder (7-108) led Washington through the air.    Matt Jones (10-27) turned in a meltdown performance with 3 fumbles. Chris Thompson (12-73) should take over as the feature back for the Redskins.    Defensively, the Redskins ramped up the edge rush, with "

   "comment":"Jamison Crowder's head by a couple of yards and into a defender. The interception cost the Redskins points, and it really shifted the momentum back in favor of the Eagles. That said, it was not an entirely bad performance for Cousins. He did have nice ball placement on quite a few downfield throws, including a potential touchdown pass to Terrelle Pryor. Cousins threw a perfect ball with just the right amount of arm strength. The throw hit Pryor right in the hands, but he dropped it. The play would have been called back due to a penalty anyway. Cousins ended up going 23-for-40 with 240 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. However, the stat line is a bit misleading, as Cousins was only able to put together a couple of good drives, at best. Additionally, he lost 2 fumbles on the day, but that was less of his fault.    The Redskins' offensive line has continued to struggle after a poor preseason performance. Against the Eagles, the unit struggled to deal with the team's strong pass-rushers. Brandon Graham was able to abuse Morgan Moses during the contest, and Cousins was constantly under pressure. The Redskins have to fix their problems in pass protection if they want to succeed this season.    Pryor was the most notable Washington receiver during the day. Pryor (6-66) made some nice catches, but he also had a couple of bad drops. One aforementioned 1 came on a play that was called back, but Pryor also dropped a wide-open catch for a first down. Pryor needs to continue to improve his catching ability. If he does, he will be a real weapon for the Redskins. The other top receivers for the Redskins, Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder, disappointed. Doctson barely saw the field, and it looks like "
