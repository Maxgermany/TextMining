   "comment":"Crowder, but Dustin Hopkins missed a 45-yarder off the upright. On the final play of the half, Hopkins tied the game at 3. In the third quarter, the Lions got moving with an 18-yard run from Stafford and then a 52-yard bomb to Marvin Jones, who got a step on Josh Norman. Norman was injured on the play and went into the locker room with a concussion. A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10. The big play was Cousins hitting Vernon Davis (6-79) for a 27-yard reception to the Lions' 1-yard line, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Robert Kelley. Chris Baker bull-rushed through Larry Warford to help get the ball back for the Redskins. Washington moved down the field with Chris Thompson receiving and running the ball into the red zone. Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. Andre Roberts (1-20) made a great leaping grab to move the ball inside the 20. With just under 30 seconds remaining, Stafford threw a frozen rope to Anquan Boldin (3-28-1) for an 18-yard touchdown pass to win the game for Detroit.    Stafford entered this game red hot, but the Redskins' defense put the clamps on him in the first 2 quarters while being aided by some dropped passes by his receivers. He was only 7-of-13 for 79 yards at the intermission, but came up big in crunch time to finish 18-of-29 for 266 yards with a touchdown. Stafford also ran for 32 yards.    Justin Forsett led the Lions with 33 yards on 8 carries, plus 2 receptions for 15 yards. Marvin Jones led Detroit with 4 catches for 94 yards.    Kirk Cousins completed 30-of-39 passes for 301 yards with a touchdown. Jamison Crowder (7-108) led Washington through the air.    Matt Jones (10-27) turned in a meltdown performance with 3 fumbles. Chris Thompson (12-73) should take over as the feature back for the Redskins.    Defensively, the Redskins ramped up the edge rush, with "

   "comment":"Crowder. Rodgers had very little success heading in that particular direction, so it's remarkable that Cousins was able to rip through Green Bay's secondary that easily, despite the numerous injuries. Cousins made just 2 mistakes during the evening; he threw a pass wide of Robert Kelley in the flat and then didn't see a wide-open DeSean Jackson standing in the end zone. However, Cousins made up for it with a nearly flawless 4.h quarter. He misfired just twice after intermission.    As mentioned, Garcon (6-116) and Crowder (3-102) caught deep touchdowns, as the 2 led the Redskins in receiving yardage. Jackson (4-51) also scored. "

   "comment":"Crowder's head by a couple of yards and into a defender. The interception cost the Redskins points, and it really shifted the momentum back in favor of the Eagles. That said, it was not an entirely bad performance for Cousins. He did have nice ball placement on quite a few downfield throws, including a potential touchdown pass to Terrelle Pryor. Cousins threw a perfect ball with just the right amount of arm strength. The throw hit Pryor right in the hands, but he dropped it. The play would have been called back due to a penalty anyway. Cousins ended up going 23-for-40 with 240 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. However, the stat line is a bit misleading, as Cousins was only able to put together a couple of good drives, at best. Additionally, he lost 2 fumbles on the day, but that was less of his fault.    The Redskins' offensive line has continued to struggle after a poor preseason performance. Against the Eagles, the unit struggled to deal with the team's strong pass-rushers. Brandon Graham was able to abuse Morgan Moses during the contest, and Cousins was constantly under pressure. The Redskins have to fix their problems in pass protection if they want to succeed this season.    Pryor was the most notable Washington receiver during the day. Pryor (6-66) made some nice catches, but he also had a couple of bad drops. One aforementioned 1 came on a play that was called back, but Pryor also dropped a wide-open catch for a first down. Pryor needs to continue to improve his catching ability. If he does, he will be a real weapon for the Redskins. The other top receivers for the Redskins, Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder, disappointed. Doctson barely saw the field, and it looks like "

   "comment":"Crowder (9-123) had his best game of the season by far. Crowder was explosive from the start and had a couple of nice long receptions. For the first time this year, he was able to get separation and find space to make moves in. He should be able to build on this performance and has upside as a potential WR3 moving forward. Meanwhile, the other receivers for the team didn't do very well. "

Crowder had 1 nice catch that saw him find open space and turn on the jets to get 36 yards. He looks like a WR3 candidate for the rest of the season. As for Davis, he was able to steadily rip off chunks of yardage throughout the day. He was reliable for the Redskins, and at this point, they may want to consider keeping him as the starter over the disappointing and oft-injured Jordan Reed. Whenever Reed is out, Davis can be used as a TE1. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Crowder (7-72). Doctson had a coming-out party in the first half, as he looked like the explosive play-maker who the Redskins believe they had drafted in the first round. Doctson had a nice, long catch early on and generally did well to find space. He is worth a speculative add as a potential FLEX play late in the year. As for Davis, he has taken over as the top tight end for the Redskins. He has great receiving ability and is a reliable target. He did have 1 brutal drop on the first play of overtime, but other than that, he was generally solid. Davis appears to be a TE1 as long as Jordan Reed is out. Elsewhere, Crowder was solid across the middle of the field while Cousins' touchdowns went to Ryan Grant (3-59), Chris Thompson (1-16) and Jeremy Sprinkle (1-7)."
