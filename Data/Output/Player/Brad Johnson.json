   "comment":"Johnson would play well, but I was very confident Dallas' defense would step up in the wake of Tony Romo's injury. Yeah... not so much. Dallas surrendered 24 points in the first half to the woeful Rams who didn't have Orlando Pace. Great job, losers. The only Dallas defender who doesn't deserve any blame is DeMarcus Ware, who managed 7 tackles and 3 sacks.    Speaking of Johnson, I didn't think he'd light up the scoreboard or anything, but I thought he would at least be competent. Instead, he played just as poorly as "

I thought the same thing as Clutch, until I realized that Wade Phillips is the worst head coach in the NFL not named Tom Cable. Instead of benching Johnson when the game was still in hand, Phillips stuck with the 80-year-old, who later threw another pick. Johnson finished the first half 5-of-11 for 71 yards. In all seriousness, Johnson is now the worst player in the NFL, and I doubt he could even make half the rosters in the CFL.    Phillips finally made the switch after halftime. Unfortunately, "
