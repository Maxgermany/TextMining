Dallas surrendered 24 points in the first half to the woeful Rams who didn't have Orlando Pace. Great job, losers. The only Dallas defender who doesn't deserve any blame is "

Instead of benching Johnson when the game was still in hand, Phillips stuck with the 80-year-old, who later threw another pick. Johnson finished the first half 5-of-11 for 71 yards. In all seriousness, Johnson is now the worst player in the NFL, and I doubt he could even make half the rosters in the CFL.    Phillips finally made the switch after halftime. Unfortunately, "
