   "comment":"Toby Gerhart also had some success on the ground and through the air. Gerhart also had some success on the ground and through the air. Donovan McNabb was able to execute some play-action passing because of the strong running game that overwhelmed the Bucs defense. In the first half Peterson ran for 83 yards on 15 carries with 2 short touchdown runs. Peterson also had a fumble, but it was recovered by Minnesota. Gerhart had 36 yards on 2 carries with 1 reception for 42 yards. At halftime, McNabb completed 11-of-17 passes for 153 yards with no interceptions or touchdowns. McNabb had a good run for a first down to extend the Vikings' second touchdown drive. He did a good job as a game manager early, but couldn't come up with needed plays in clutch time in the second half. At halftime, Minnesota had a 17-0 lead. Peterson, McNabb and Vikings were slow to move the ball in the second half. Peterson had only 9 yards rushing on 4 carries in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Minnesota had a field goal drive, but the offense didn't do enough to seal the win for the Vikings and that let the Bucs offense pull out a comeback.    Peterson ran for 120 yards on 25 carries with 2 touchdowns. McNabb completed 16-of-27 passes for 193 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Wide receiver "

   "comment":"Toby Gerhart. They eventually found their way into the end zone and were able to accomplish the same thing in the third quarter. They established a 4.point lead and never looked back.    Bortles had a very mixed game. He was dreadful in the early going, as he was just 9-of-15 for only 52 yards and a touchdown in the first half. He checked it down on an early third-and-7 without even bothering to look downfield. He was then strip-sacked, but was fortunate to have his teammate recover. He also missed some routine throws, but was able to get into a rhythm. Bortles finished 13-of-26 for 115 yards and a touchdown. He still had some poor throws following intermission, including an awful misfire toward Gerhart.

He still had some poor throws following intermission, including an awful misfire toward Cecil Shorts in the red zone, but he picked up some big gains on the ground, including a first-down scamper on third-and-long. Bortles compiled 50 rushing yards on 5 scrambles.    Gerhart missed some time in this game with a rib contusion, which is why he had just 12 carries. He ran well after getting stuffed early, finishing with 53 yards and a touchdown. He was outgained by "
