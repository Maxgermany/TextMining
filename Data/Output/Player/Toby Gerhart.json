   "comment":"Toby Gerhart didn't look like he was running at 2 mph, and Allen Hurns actually caught passes. And yet the Jaguars still lost by double digits. On the bright side, they actually covered the spread!    The Bengals were ripe for a letdown after a big win over Baltimore last week and with a game against division rival Cleveland this coming Thursday. However, Cincinnati drew Jacksonville, and the Jaguars just don't have the talent to go on the road and beat a playoff-caliber team like the Bengals. Jeremy Hill and Mohamed Sanu came up with huge performances to lead an injury-depleted Cincinnati squad to the win.    The Jaguars were fortunate to get on the board first as Bengals cornerback Terence Newman dropped interception deep in Jacksonville territory. Denard Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to "

He was then strip-sacked, but was fortunate to have his teammate recover. He also missed some routine throws, but was able to get into a rhythm.
