Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands.

   "comment":"Leinart. Matt Leinart? Matt Leinart!? Why!? Haven't we seen enough proof that he sucks? I guess Allen is too young to remember when Leinart played for Arizona. Leinart was predictably horrible, going 16-of-32 for 115 yards and an interception to set up a Carolina touchdown right before halftime. Most of his completions were checkdowns. As for Pryor, he played a handful of snaps. He completed a 5-yard pass, rushed for 2 yards and hauled in a 22-yard reception. And that was it. Nice job, Dennis.    "
