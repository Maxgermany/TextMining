   "comment":"Rosario in the back of the end zone as time expired, propelling the Panthers to victory as 9.5-point underdogs. Delhomme looked solid coming off Tommy John surgery, going 23-of-41 for 247 yards and a touchdown.    Philip Rivers, coming off a worse injury (ACL) than Jake Delhomme, also put up solid numbers. He was 17-of-27 for 217 yards and 3 scores, including a 44-yard bomb to Chris Chambers.    Keeping with the theme, Antonio Gates, off foot surgery, led the Chargers with 4 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown.    So, can we go 4-for-4? Would Shawne Merriman also have a solid performance despite playing with a shredded knee? As you can tell by Carolina's offensive output, not at all. Merriman rotated in and out of the lineup, and manged only 1 tackle. The Chargers couldn't contain the Panthers, much like they struggled to stop the Charlie Frye-led Seahawks in the preseason. Hey, I have the Broncos winning the division, so even though San Diego lost, the team performed better than I expected them to, given that Rivers and Gates looked sharp.    As for Carolina's skill players, DeAngelo Williams had more carries (18) than Jonathan Stewart (10). Williams managed 86 yards, while Stewart had 53. It appears as though neither will be a top fantasy option unless there's an injury involved. At wideout, Muhsin Muhammad caught 6 balls for 56 yards. D.J. Hackett had 5 receptions for 48 yards. Meanwhile, tight end Dante Rosario collected 7 catches for 96 yards and a touchdown. Rosario's production will decrease when "

Down 17 and in Miami territory with 8 minutes left, Cutler lackadaisically ran the offense, letting the clock tick down. It's almost as if he was resigned to losing at that point.    Meanwhile, Chicago's defense struggled once again. "
