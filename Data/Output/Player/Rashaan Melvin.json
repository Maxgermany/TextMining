   "comment":"Melvin with an injury. Bortles had the opportunity to actually break the single-game passing yards record, as he recorded 282 yards in the opening half alone. That would've put him on pace to eclipse Norm Van Brocklin's mark of 554. Unfortunately, the Colts couldn't do anything on offense, so the Jaguars took the air out of the ball following halftime. Bortles threw just 6 passes after intermission. Bortles finished 18-of-26 for 330 yards and a touchdown. He began the game by engineering a scoring drive, but he missed out on a touchdown by overshooting an open receiver in the end zone. "
