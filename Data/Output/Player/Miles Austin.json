I know Austin-Jones caught the tying and winning scores for 59 and 60 yards. However, Austin-Jones dropped a whopping 3 touchdowns. I won't fault him for 1 because it was a bit overthrown (but catchable). However, the other 2 went right through his hands. At the time, I thought Jerry Jones might seek a divorce, but Austin-Jones redeemed himself.    In addition to the 3 drops, the Cowboys made several other mental errors. On 1 sequence in the first quarter, they were whistled for a false start and then had to take an unnecessary timeout right afterward. In the first 25 minutes, Dallas was called for 6 penalties. The Cowboys also muffed a punt and bobbled a quarterback-center exchange that resulted in a lost fumble. Dallas finished with 13 penalties. It's almost as if they showed up and expected to win. It's this exact attitude that gets them bounced out of the playoffs early or before it even begins.    "

   "comment":"Austin-Jones both had easy drops on third down that would have moved the chains and kept drives alive in Atlanta territory. This would have given the Cowboys a pair of field-goal opportunities at the very least, which is key because they lost by 2 field goals. Also, Dallas had 7 plays in the red zone in the opening quarter and gained just 19 yards. On special teams, Dallas had a nice punt to pin the Falcons at their own 6-yard line at the end of the third quarter. The Cowboys committed a penalty, however, which gave Atlanta possession at the 20. The Falcons would go on to score a touchdown on the drive, breaking the 6-6 tie. On defense, the Cowboys had several opportunities to stop Atlanta and force a punt in the final minutes. However, Orlando Scandrick missed a tackle on Jacquizz Rodgers and then was whistled for a hold on Roddy White, allowing the Falcons to move the chains, eat up more time on the clock and kick the covering 32-yard field goal, prompting Al Michaels to give us his obligatory gambling reference.    Of course, the Falcons weren't flawless either. Matt Bryant whiffed on 2 attempts from 37 and 43 yards. Asante Samuel, meanwhile, dropped a gift Tony Romo interception in the end zone during the first half. Romo was decent overall, going 25-of-35 for 321 yards and a touchdown to Kevin Ogletree (3-96).    Dez Bryant was questionable entering this contest. He played, but did nothing (1-15), hurting his fantasy owners. Three Cowboys caught at least 5 passes: Austin-Jones (7-76), Felix Jones (5-70) and Jason Witten (7-51)."

   "comment":"Austin-Jones (2-22) injured his hamstring in the third quarter. Surprise, surprise.    Romo didn't have to do much because DeMarco Murray ripped off big chunks of yardage on almost every touch. He gained 175 yards and a touchdown on 26 attempts. He also caught 3 passes for 28 receiving yards. Dallas' offensive line simply manhandled the Rams' front, pushing defensive tackles Michael Brockers and Kendall Langford around as if they were small children. Linebacker Will Witherspoon was even worse; he doesn't look like he belongs on an NFL roster at this point.    The Rams came into the season with so much hype as a popular playoff sleeper pick that they were no longer a sleeper in that regard. They disappointed some in the season opener, but scratched and clawed their way to a victory against the Cardinals. They looked much worse the following week at Atlanta, but some fluky things happened in that contest, so excuses were made for them. But now? They have to be regarded as 1 of the worst teams in the NFL. It's almost inexplicable how they've regressed every single week. As mentioned, Bradford compiled a bunch of junk yardage at the end of the game. He finished 29-of-48 for 240 yards, but those numbers are a farce; he was just 6-of-12 for 43 yards by halftime. Again, Bradford didn't have much of a chance behind his terrible offensive line, so it's hard to tell how much blame he deserves for this loss. Bradford also had no running game to work with. Daryl Richardson was knocked out of the game on the first play from scrimmage with a foot injury, so Isaiah Pead was given the opportunity to waste 6 carries for 20 yards. Pead did catch 7 balls for 43 yards, nearly edging out Chris Givens (2-54) and Jared Cook (5-44). Austin Pettis (2-20) was the 1 who hauled in Bradford's lone score.   "

   "comment":"Austin in the red zone. He overshot Jordan Cameron for a potential touchdown. He backpedaled unnecessarily in pocket on a fourth-and-1 failed attempt. He didn't look like an NFL-caliber quarterback after playing so well in the first 6 weeks of the season.    Perhaps the reason for Hoyer's struggle - outside of center Alex Mack's absence - was that the Browns, for the first time, couldn't establish a ground attack. Jacksonville's defensive line put on an impressive showing, limiting Ben Tate to just 36 yards on 16 carries. Isaiah Crowell (7-18) couldn't do anything. Then again, Mack not being in the lineup had something to do with that too.    Only 3 Cleveland players had more than 1 reception: Andrew Hawkins (5-112), Austin (3-53) and Taylor Gabriel (3-39)."

He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle "
