Yet, he didn't even have a very good performance. I know Austin-Jones caught the tying and winning scores for 59 and 60 yards. However, Austin-Jones dropped a whopping 3 touchdowns. I won't fault him for 1 because it was a bit overthrown (but catchable). However, the other 2 went right through his hands. At the time, I thought Jerry Jones might seek a divorce, but Austin-Jones redeemed himself.    In addition to the 3 drops, the Cowboys made several other mental errors. On 1 sequence in the first quarter, they were whistled for a false start and then had to take an unnecessary timeout right afterward. In the first 25 minutes, Dallas was called for 6 penalties. The Cowboys also muffed a punt and bobbled a quarterback-center exchange that resulted in a lost fumble. Dallas finished with 13 penalties. It's almost as if they showed up and expected to win. It's this exact attitude that gets them bounced out of the playoffs early or before it even begins.

On defense, the Cowboys had several opportunities to stop Atlanta and force a punt in the final minutes. However, Orlando Scandrick missed a tackle on Jacquizz Rodgers and then was whistled for a hold on Roddy White, allowing the Falcons to move the chains, eat up more time on the clock and kick the covering 32-yard field goal, prompting Al Michaels to give us his obligatory gambling reference.    Of course, the Falcons weren't flawless either. Matt Bryant whiffed on 2 attempts from 37 and 43 yards. Asante Samuel, meanwhile, dropped a gift Tony Romo interception in the end zone during the first half. Romo was decent overall, going 25-of-35 for 321 yards and a touchdown to Kevin Ogletree (3-96).    Dez Bryant was questionable entering this contest. He played, but did nothing (1-15), hurting his fantasy owners. Three Cowboys caught at least 5 passes: Austin-Jones (7-76), Felix Jones (5-70) and Jason Witten (7-51)."

Perhaps the reason for Hoyer's struggle - outside of center Alex Mack's absence - was that the Browns, for the first time, couldn't establish a ground attack. Jacksonville's defensive line put on an impressive showing, limiting Ben Tate to just 36 yards on 16 carries. Isaiah Crowell (7-18) couldn't do anything. Then again, Mack not being in the lineup had something to do with that too.    Only 3 Cleveland players had more than 1 reception: Andrew Hawkins (5-112), Austin (3-53) and Taylor Gabriel (3-39)."
