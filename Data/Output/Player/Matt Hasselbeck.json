   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck began the contest 1-of-8 for 12 yards, as it was very apparent that missing his top 2 receivers and right tackle took a toll on him. Unlike Edwards, Hasselbeck couldn't recover. He finished 17-of-41 for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.    For all the talk of Seattle's skill-position battles (Julius Jones vs. Maurice Morris and Courtney Taylor vs. Ben Obomanu vs. Jordan Kent), nothing really materialized. Jones and Mooris combined for 76 yards on 19 carries, as Marcus Stroud ate them both alive. Taylor caught 2 balls for 17 yards. Kent had no receptions.    Impressive performance by the Bills despite losing Angelo Crowell for the year earlier this week. Buffalo sacked Matt Hasselbeck 5 times and limited the Seattle quarterback to a 4.6 YPA.   "

   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck pass and took it back 86 yards for a score. This turned momentum around for San Francisco, who scored another touchdown 2 minutes later.    I'd like to criticize Seattle's defense for allowing 33 points to Mike Martz and O'Sullivan, but the fact remains they sacked O'Sullivan 8 times and limited Frank Gore to just 61 yards on 19 carries. Matt Hasselbeck was at fault; he had the aforementioned pick-six and another interception. Hasselbeck, who missed almost all of the preseason with back problems, hasn't been able to get into a groove with his scrub receivers. Hasselbeck was 18-of-36, 189 yards and a pair of picks.    Speaking of Hasselbeck's wideouts, rookie tight end "

   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck's injury, but San Francisco actually led 13-3 before he left the game. Speaking of Hasselbeck, he took a similar shot to the ribs that knocked Donovan McNabb out last week. Hasselbeck could be out a few games if he hurt his lower ribs.    But sticking with the 49ers, there was a great example of Mike Singletary ball in the second half. Singletary is all about pounding the rock, controlling the clock and playing tough defense. Beginning with 1:20 remaining in the third quarter, the 49ers maintained possession until the 6:58 mark of the 4.h quarter, as the drive concluded with a "

The Cardinals' offense had only 2 really good drives in this contest, including the first opening possession where they went 80 yards on 15 plays. However, Arizona was able to establish an early 17-0 lead, thanks to a pair of short fields. Immediately following the first touchdown, the Cardinals recovered an onside kick and turned that into another end-zone trip. Right after that, they recovered a Hasselbeck fumble and kicked a field goal.    "

He missed some time in this contest with a broken bone in his non-throwing wrist, and while he was out, Charlie Whitehurst tossed an unbelievably horrid near-pick-six. "

Unfortunately for my wallet, the second half included a Clawful pick-six, a Seattle punt return that went to Carolina's 5-yard line, a penalty that nullified a Carolina kickoff return for a score, and really horrific tackling by the Panthers in the 4.h quarter. This was a complete meltdown by Carolina.    Clausen finished 18-of-34 for 169 yards and the aforementioned pick-six, which was a horrendous throw. He had absolutely no time in the pocket on most plays, and when he actually did, it seemed like his offensive line was guilty of a penalty to bring a positive play back. Carolina committed 8 infractions, but 4 came via the offensive front or blocking tight end. And as mentioned, another penalty negated a Panthers kickoff return for a touchdown.    On the bright side, Jonathan Stewart played well. He had 92 yards and a score on 21 carries.    Speaking of running backs posting great stats, Marshawn Lynch totaled 83 yards and 3 touchdowns on 21 rushes. Don't think Lynch has suddenly turned it around though; his production was the result of absolutely zero-effort tackling by Carolina in the 4.h quarter.    Matt Hasselbeck went 17-of-30 for 229 yards and 2 picks. Hasselbeck will need a healthy "

Chris Johnson was able to finish with 101 yards on 23 carries, but aside from a 25-yard scamper in the first quarter that probably should have been a longer gain, he wasn't able to do much until late when the Browns gave up. Hasselbeck, meanwhile, went 10-of-20 for 220 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick despite not having Kenny Britt for the first time this year. The bulk of his yardage came on an 80-yard touchdown to tight end "

   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck (5-of-7, 44 yards) injured his calf on a non-contact play in the second quarter. Locker performed really well, going 13-of-29 for 282 yards and a touchdown, along with 36 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Locker has played well enough in 2 games against playoff teams (Falcons, Saints) to give his fans optimism. In fact, I would start Locker for the rest of the year because Hasselbeck has been pretty mediocre, despite what Chris Berman says about him being the best free-agent acquisition this past summer.    The other notable thing about this contest was all the penalties. The teams combined for a whopping 15 infractions prior to intermission (19 in total). The first half was ridiculous. It seemed like there was a false start on every drive. In fact, Tennessee had a 1st-and-35 at 1 point because of consecutive false start, holding and illegal block penalties.    The Saints probably should have won this game by a wider margin. They had 60 more total yards and won the time-of-possession battle by 15 minutes. All the penalties were a killer though for "

Hasselbeck went 26-of-43 for 200 yards, 1 touchdown and that aforementioned pick, but a big chunk of his yardage and the sole score came in garbage time when the Vikings stopped trying. In fact, Tennessee didn't even cross the Minnesota 47-yard line until midway through the 4.h quarter. It was so pathetic, words can't even describe it.    If Hasselbeck's ineptness wasn't enough, "

   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck put a drive together with passes to Donte Moncrief and Coby Fleener. Adam Vinatieri drilled a 54-yard field goal to get on the board first. The Jaguars answered with Blake Bortles hitting Allen Hurns for 26 yards. Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting T.Y. Hilton involved. The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking. Donte Moncrief (6-75) also contributed and continued to play ahead of "

   "comment":"Matt Hasselbeck was even a debate, and that some people - cough, Keyshawn Johnson, fart - thought that Hasselbeck should keep the job even when Luck returned. If Luck doesn't come back next week, Indianapolis' season could be over.    This win could have saved Gus Bradley's job and given him a 4.h year in Jacksonville. Late in the first half, the Colts had a 13-3 lead, before a defensive touchdown by the Jaguars' Andre Branch opened an explosion of points from Jacksonville's offense and special teams. The Jaguars put up 42 points after halftime to blow out the Colts. Jacksonville clearly outplayed Indianapolis, and this Colts team looks undermanned, worn down, and absurdly lucky to be in the playoff race. Early in the season, the Colts got lucky in a home win over the Jaguars, as kicker Jason Myers had 2 missed field goals with 1 in the 4.h quarter and 1 in overtime that allowed Indianapolis to escape with an overtime win. If Myers had made 1 of those field goals, the Colts would be 5-8, and the Jaguars would be in the AFC South title race. Blake Bortles is the most improved quarterback in the NFL this year, and the credit goes to new offensive coordinator Greg Olson. If the Jaguars can improve their offensive line and pass defense this offseason, they could be a serious playoff contender in 2016.    The Jaguars were fortunate on the opening drive, as the Colts dropped 2 interceptions, and 1 went for a chunk completion to tight end Clay Harbor, who caught the pass while on the ground. T.J. Yeldon ran well, and Myers connected on a 46-yard field goal. The Colts answered right back as Matt Hasselbeck threw a ball up for T."
