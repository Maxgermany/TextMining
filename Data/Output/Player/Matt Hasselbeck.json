Hasselbeck could be out a few games if he hurt his lower ribs.    But sticking with the 49ers, there was a great example of Mike Singletary ball in the second half. Singletary is all about pounding the rock, controlling the clock and playing tough defense. Beginning with 1:20 remaining in the third quarter, the 49ers maintained possession until the 6:58 mark of the 4.h quarter, as the drive concluded with a "

On Seattle's third possession, they turned the ball over on downs, allowing Jason Hanson to kick a 41-yard field goal. Though the Seahawks carelessly fell into a 17-0 hole, they did a great job of sticking with their game plan and not panicking. Hasselbeck didn't toss another pick, finishing 39-of-51 for 329 yards and a touchdown. He easily shredded Detroit's secondary, and for the first time in weeks, he didn't have to worry about pressure because of the Lions' horrible defense. Hasselbeck was sacked only once. And by the way, congratulations to Hasselbeck, who became the all-time Seahawks leader in completions. Of course Dick Stockton was too senile at the time to talk about this; he probably thought Dave Krieg, the previous record-holder, was still under center.    Amazingly, 6 Seahawks had 5 receptions or more. Here's the list: "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck tossed the first of 3 interceptions. Instead of establishing an early lead, the Seahawks handed over all the momentum to Denver. I don't want to take away anything from the Broncos though. Kyle Orton was great, going 25-of-35 for 307 yards and 2 touchdowns. He converted a whopping 14-of-20 third downs, which explains how Denver was able to win the time-of-possession battle by just about 15 minutes.    Orton looked really comfortable going to his new weapon, as rookie Demaryius Thomas caught 8 balls for 97 yards and a score. Make sure you pick up Thomas in your fantasy leagues.    Three other Broncos had 3 or more receptions: Knowshon Moreno (4 catches, 67 yards), Eddie Royal (5-65) and Brandon Lloyd (3-53). Jabar Gaffney (2-15) was a non-factor.    In addition to Moreno's 67 receiving yards, he had 51 rushing yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Seattle's run defense has been incredible thus far, as they've shut down Moreno and Frank Gore in back-to-back weeks.    As mentioned, Hasselbeck tossed 3 picks. He was 20-of-35 for 233 yards and a touchdown otherwise. He also scrambled for a 20-yard score.    Forsett saw as many carries (8) as "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck is just a bit better than Charlie Whitehurst. I don't know who would have doubted this, but I'm sure there's a misinformed GameCenter poster out there who believed that Whitehurst was better. Making the start after a 1.game absence, Matt Hasselbeck went 22-of-34 for 333 yards and a touchdown. He missed some time in this contest with a broken bone in his non-throwing wrist, and while he was out, Charlie Whitehurst tossed an unbelievably horrid near-pick-six. "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck and company. Unfortunately for my wallet, the second half included a Clawful pick-six, a Seattle punt return that went to Carolina's 5-yard line, a penalty that nullified a Carolina kickoff return for a score, and really horrific tackling by the Panthers in the 4.h quarter. This was a complete meltdown by Carolina.    Clausen finished 18-of-34 for 169 yards and the aforementioned pick-six, which was a horrendous throw. He had absolutely no time in the pocket on most plays, and when he actually did, it seemed like his offensive line was guilty of a penalty to bring a positive play back. Carolina committed 8 infractions, but 4 came via the offensive front or blocking tight end. And as mentioned, another penalty negated a Panthers kickoff return for a touchdown.    On the bright side, Jonathan Stewart played well. He had 92 yards and a score on 21 carries.    Speaking of running backs posting great stats, Marshawn Lynch totaled 83 yards and 3 touchdowns on 21 rushes. Don't think Lynch has suddenly turned it around though; his production was the result of absolutely zero-effort tackling by Carolina in the 4.h quarter.    Matt Hasselbeck went 17-of-30 for 229 yards and 2 picks. Hasselbeck will need a healthy "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck went 26-of-46 for 258 yards and 3 touchdowns. Those numbers could have been even better if it weren't for all those drops (he had 2 more by Mike Williams in the second half). Despite a horrendous regular season, Hasselbeck has stepped up and performed well in the playoffs. The Seahawks should bring him back while they groom Charlie Whitehurst or another young signal-caller.    As for the other quarterback, Cutler went 15-of-28 for 274 yards and 4 touchdowns (2 pass, 2 rush). However, it could have been much worse for Cutler. He had that aforementioned dropped interception in the end zone. He also fumbled, which was fortunately recovered by his own lineman. Additionally, Cutler tossed a couple of sketchy passes that had a chance of being picked off.     Cutler's offensive line played a lot better than most people thought it would. It's unclear though if this was just a result of Seattle sucking or not; remember, the Packers sacked Cutler 6 times in the season finale, so the city of Chicago should wait a while before throwing a parade for its offensive front. The line thrived in both pass protection and run blocking. The Seahawks couldn't stop "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck moved the ball downfield. A 20-yard pass to tight end Jared Cook set the Titans up inside the 5.yard line, but the Steelers hunkered down and forced a field goal. The Steelers answered with a drive where Ben Roethlisberger moved the ball with passes downfield. Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown made good catches to get first downs. Big Ben finished the drive with an 8.yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. A fake punt where punter Daniel Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards. That set the Steelers up at the 17-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Hines Ward. After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9.yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward. Down 28-3, Hasselbeck and the Titans moved into the hurry-up offense. They were aided by a catch to Jared Cook that was actually an incompletion. The Titans capped the drive with Johnson's first touchdown of the season from 1.yard out. After the score, the Titans executed a nice onside kick that was recovered by cornerback "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck left the game with a sprained right elbow. Rookie quarterback Jake Locker came in the game with his team down 23-3. He quickly got the Titans in the end zone. Locker threw a deep out to Nate Washington about 20 yards downfield on the sideline. He cut back to the middle of the field and ran by a couple defenders for a 40-yard touchdown pass. In the 4.h quarter, rookie linebacker Colin McCarthy forced a fumble from Turner when Tennessee was backed up deep in their own territory. That helped keep the Titans in the game. Locker made a big play downfield after scrambling to buy time. He tossed a ball deep for Lavelle Hawkins and the 5-foot-11 wide out caught the pass over a defensive back for a 32-yard gain. It set up Tennessee at the Atlanta 4.yard line with 4 minutes left and down by 13. Locker made a good throw on third-and-goal to Washington for his second touchdown pass. Locker finished the game 9-of-19 for 140 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons' offense ran out the clock with some tough runs by Turner. Atlanta's offense played a balanced game. Turner ran for 100 yards on 21 carries with a score. Ryan was 22-of-32 for 316 yards and 1 touchdown. White led Atlanta with 7 receptions for 147 yards. It could have been an even bigger game but he dropped a couple of passes. The Falcons' defense really played well. Conversely, the Titans' offensive line played like crap. They weren't winning at the point of attack, and had only 41 yards rushing in the game. They looked very predictable for the Atlanta defense. Chris Johnson totaled 13 yards on 12 carries, and he will get a lot of criticism for this game, but the running lanes were terrible. Falcons defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux and defensive end John Abraham both played well. Dunta Robinson recorded an interception of Hasselbeck to end a scoring threat. On the other side of the ball, the Atlanta offensive line played well and was able to control Tennessee's front. The terrible line play, and the extension of Johnson's 2011 slump, was a huge hit to the Titans' playoff hopes. The Falcons remain in the thick of the NFC playoff race.   "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck was pressured and threw an interception to linebacker Geno Hayes. The Titans' Rob Bironas wasted another good drive for Tennessee by missing a 42-yard field goal. The Buccaneers started to move the ball before Titans defensive end Dave Ball made a great play, leaping to deny a screen pass and when he landed, slapped the ball out of Josh Freeman's hands. Ball recovered the fumble at the Tampa Bay 38-yard line but Tennessee couldn't get in the end zone. Later, Ronde Barber forced a fumble from Javon Ringer, and that led to a short touchdown pass from Freeman to Mike Williams. The score was 10-10 at halftime. Chris Johnson had 2 good runs but fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Aqib Talib. A few plays later, Williams fumbled the ball back to the Titans. Talib gave Tampa Bay the lead a little later with an interception he returned 27 yards for a touchdown. That was the 7.h turnover in the game. Blount produced the 8. turnover when he was stripped of the ball by Jurrell Casey. Tennessee answered by squandering great field position and punting. The Titans got some big runs from Johnson to lead them to a field goal and then a go-ahead touchdown. On 4.h-and-goal from the 2.yard line, with 3 minutes left in the game, Hasselbeck threw a dart to a wide-open Damian Williams in the back of the end zone for the game-winning score."

Locker performed really well, going 13-of-29 for 282 yards and a touchdown, along with 36 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Locker has played well enough in 2 games against playoff teams (Falcons, Saints) to give his fans optimism. In fact, I would start Locker for the rest of the year because Hasselbeck has been pretty mediocre, despite what Chris Berman says about him being the best free-agent acquisition this past summer.    The other notable thing about this contest was all the penalties. The teams combined for a whopping 15 infractions prior to intermission (19 in total). The first half was ridiculous. It seemed like there was a false start on every drive. In fact, Tennessee had a 1st-and-35 at 1 point because of consecutive false start, holding and illegal block penalties.    The Saints probably should have won this game by a wider margin. They had 60 more total yards and won the time-of-possession battle by 15 minutes. All the penalties were a killer though for "

Granted, Jacksonville's injury-ravaged defense can't stop anyone right now, and perhaps Locker would have done even better, but Hasselbeck was still able to lead Tennessee to its 8. victory.

Hasselbeck was inaccurate unless he was checking down, which he did far too often.

Hasselbeck went 26-of-43 for 200 yards, 1 touchdown and that aforementioned pick, but a big chunk of his yardage and the sole score came in garbage time when the Vikings stopped trying.

   "comment":"Hasselbeck and a Chris Conte fumble recovery of Chris Johnson. It's amazing that the Bears didn't even really need to run a single offensive play to get out to a 26-point lead. In fact, it would have been a 28-point advantage had they completely gone with the anti-Bobby Boucher approach because they took a safety on an offensive line penalty in their own end zone. The Titans were guilty of 5 turnovers in the first half. I mentioned the blocked punt, pick-six and Johnson fumble; Johnson had another fumble in Chicago territory, while Kenny Britt coughed the ball up at midfield. Jared Cook also fumbled in the second half; his 2 catches for 6 yards makes you wonder why no team wanted to acquire him at the trade deadline.    Jay Cutler didn't have to do much, but he put together a solid performance. He went 19-of-26 for 229 yards and 3 touchdowns, though it's worth noting that most of his production came when his team was well ahead and several of the Titans seemed to quit. Amazingly though, Cutler was sacked thrice, which makes you wonder how he would have survived had Tennessee not killed itself with stupid mistakes.    All 3 of Cutler's touchdowns went to Brandon Marshall, who had a monstrous afternoon with 9 catches for 122 yards. Only 1 other Bear caught more than 2 passes (Earl Bennett: 4-22).    Matt Forte was set up with a short touchdown thanks to Hester's aforementioned return. He received just 12 carries on the afternoon, but was able to finish with 103 yards and the score.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, finished with 141 yards and a touchdown on just 16 attempts. Those are pretty bogus numbers, however, because he scored on an 80-yard scamper in garbage time. He otherwise would have mustered 61 yards on 15 tries, most notably getting stuffed twice on 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 on the second drive. He also fumbled twice.    Hasselbeck finished 20-of-35 for 194 yards, 1 score (to Nate Washington, 2-35) and the aforementioned pick-six."

   "comment":"Hasselbeck put a drive together with passes to Donte Moncrief and Coby Fleener. Adam Vinatieri drilled a 54-yard field goal to get on the board first. The Jaguars answered with Blake Bortles hitting Allen Hurns for 26 yards. Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting "

Are we sure that this is still 2015, or did we travel back in time to 2006? There was major concern with Hasselbeck entering this contest. Andrew Luck was the 1 with the shoulder injury, but Hasselbeck spent time in a hospital on Tuesday morning with flu-like symptoms. A report by Stacy Dales prior to kickoff seemed to indicate that Hasselbeck may not make it through the entire game. Despite this, however, Hasselbeck was terrific. He fired sharp, accurate passes to his receivers and lofted some perfect throws to his targets for significant gains. A beautiful ball to Andre Johnson for 24 yards set up a touchdown, while a 43-yard bomb to "

   "comment":"Hasselbeck took advantage of the short field and moved the ball before threading a needle between defenders to Donte Moncrief for an 11-yard touchdown. A holding call and sack from Kendall Langford quickly got the ball back for Indianapolis with a nice punt return to the Texans' 35-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Andre Johnson moved the ball to the 17-yard line. That produced a chip-shot field goal for the Colts and a 10-0 lead. Houston's offense finally did something positive with a 41-yard run from Blue, but Bill O'Brien made a very questionable decision to have Nick Novak attempt a 57-yard field goal that wasn't even close. Before the half, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates moved the ball into Colts' territory, but went down with a knee injury that ended his day. Weeden finished the drive with a few completions to get inside the 5-yard line before having to settle for a field goal. The Colts took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bernardrick McKinney sacked Hasselbeck at the 1-yard line on a third down, and that set up the Texans to start a drive at the Colts' 32-yard line. Penalties on Houston's inept tight ends killed some nice plays, and Houston settled for a 47-yard field goal from Novak. After going 25 straight drives without a touchdown, the Texans started at their 11-yard line, and Weeden moved down the field with passes to Hopkins. Houston converted a 4.h-and-1 with Blue, and had a pass interference on "
