It'll be interesting to see if Johnson continues to see a greater overall workload than Crowell. Johnson will at least be a big part of the passing attack going forward, so he has a chance to overtake Crowell as the primary back. Johnson is owned in half of ESPN leagues, so pick him up if you can.    As for Benjamin, he snatched 6 balls for 79 yards. He's becoming more than just a situational deep threat, but it's hard to rely on him, given how inconsistent Cleveland's quarterbacks are.    It's a shame the Browns lost, as it spoiled "

   "comment":"Crowell and Robert Turbin (especially) are better options!? It makes no sense!    This was a typical game for the Browns, as they played well for awhile before self-destructing. Cleveland built a first-half lead, but Arizona's offense came storming back. After getting hot and scoring 3 touchdowns, the Browns' offense wilted with 4 punts, an interception and a fumble in the second half before garbage time when Johnny Manziel came in. The Cardinals didn't play a complete game, thanks to turnovers and coverage issues, but they made good second half adjustments to cruise in Cleveland.    To start the game, Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out. Troy Niklas (2-12) had 2 scores.    Josh McCown was 18-of-34 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The Browns had no running game. McCown led them with 18 yards on 5 carries. Isaiah Crowell (10-14) was ineffective, and for some reason, the explosive Duke Johnson had only 1 carry for 3 yards despite catching 2 passes for 68 yards.    Gary Barnidge led the Browns with 7 receptions for 53 yards. "

   "comment":"Crowell followed a huge hole behind Joe Thomas, Joel Bitonio and John Greco to explode down the field for an 85-yard touchdown run. Promptly, Joe Haden picked off Flacco to set up the Browns at the Ravens' 27-yard line. McCown converted a third down to Barnidge (4-37) before throwing a quick pass to Coleman in the flat, and Coleman made a tackler miss to get into the end zone from 11 yards out. However, the extra point was blocked and returned by the Ravens for a 2-point conversion. Cleveland had a 20-2 lead and couldn't muster any points the rest of the game. After trading some punts, the Ravens got moving with a 30-yard pass to Dennis Pitta, a 22-yard completion to Crockett Gilmore and a roughing-the-passer penalty. Baltimore finished the drive with Flacco throwing a dart to Mike Wallace (4-41) for a 7-yard score. The Ravens quickly got the ball back as a McCown overthrow floated to Eric Weddle for an interception. That gave them the ball close to midfield with 42 seconds left. That set up a 52-yard field goal for Justin Tucker, and the Browns took a 20-12 lead into halftime. To open the third quarter, Flacco moved the ball down the field with a 19-yard completion to Steve Smith and then a 31-yard pass to Smith (3-64). To finish the drive, Wallace got open for a 17-yard touchdown strike and the Ravens kicked the point to make it 20-19. Baltimore got moving again with a completion to Breshad Perriman (2-32), but Haden came through with an interception in the end zone to protect Cleveland's slim lead. To end the third quarter, McCown hit a 47-yard completion to Coleman as he made a leaping grab over Shareece Wright. However, a few plays later, Coleman got flagged for slugging Jimmy Smith, and that was critical lost yards for Cleveland as Patrick Murray then missed a 52-yard field goal. On the game-winning drive, Flacco hit Pitta (9-102) for a 28-yard gain down the middle of the field, and that set up Tucker to connect on a 49-yard field goal to give the Ravens a 22-20 lead. They tacked on another field goal to extend the lead to 25-20 with just under 3 minutes remaining. McCown had 1 more shot and moved the ball to the Ravens 30 before throwing a ball up for grabs in a crowd of defenders. C.J. Mosley made a leaping interception just in front of the goal line to clinch the victory for Baltimore.    Flacco completed 25-of-45 for 302 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Terrance West (11-42) and Justin Forestt (14-37) were held in check by the Browns.    McCown completed 20-of-33 for 260 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Coleman was impressive with 5 receptions for 104 yards with 2 scores, but his mental mistake and penalty was costly. Terrelle Pryor (3-32) wasn't a factor.    Crowell (18-133-1) was held in check aside from his 85-yard touchdown run.    Defensively, the Ravens played very well after the first quarter and were very stout in the second half. "

   "comment":"Crowell promptly plunged into the end zone. The Browns got the ball back and used Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the fourth quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2-yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. Terrelle Pryor pulled up on a route, and that allowed a pass to float to Marcus Gilchrist for an interception. After the Browns got the ball back deep in their own territory, McCown threw short for Duke Johnson, but a staggering hit from Calvin Pryor created a deflection that was caught by a diving Lorenzo Mauldin for an interception inside the 10-yard line. The Jets settled for a field goal, but that put the game out of reach.    McCown completed 25-of-49 passes for 341 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Pryor (6-101) led the Browns in receiving.    Crowell had 11 carries for 29 yards with a score and 2 receptions for 34 yards.    Fitzpatrick was 16-of-34 for 228 yards with 1 touchdown. He made enough plays to lead the comeback, but before long, the Jets should considering finding out what they have in Bryce Petty and/or Christian Hackenberg.    Forte had 82 yards on 25 carries with 2 scores. Enunwa (4-93-1) led the Jets in receiving.   "

   "comment":"Crowell lost a fumble in his own territory, which set up 1 of New York's 2 touchdowns in the opening half. Later, after the Browns had drawn to within 1 score, Johnathan Hankins hit Josh McCown's arm as he released the ball. The pass was picked off and taken back for 6. That effectively sealed the victory for New York, as the Browns didn't have much going on offense throughout the afternoon.    The Giants are fortunate that the Browns were guilty of dumb errors, as they couldn't do much on offense either. Again, 13 of their 27 points - an extra point was missed - came as a result of Cleveland turnovers. With that in mind, it's a horrible sign that New York was able to muster just 14 points against Cleveland's woeful defense. And don't blame Beckham's injury either. Though he missed some action, he still saw 11 targets. He reeled in 6 of them for 96 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've had a third score, but Eli Manning overthrew him on the first drive, as Beckham torched Joe Haden.    Manning accumulated 3 touchdowns, but struggled once again. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-27 for only 194 yards. That is a truly horrible stat line against 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Most quarterbacks have torched the Browns this year, so it has to be very discouraging for the Giants that Manning couldn't do much. He should've been able to make several downfield throws, but was just inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't all Manning's fault, as his offensive line had issues keeping the Browns out of the backfield. Cleveland sacked Manning once, but that's not indicative of the pressure Manning saw. Rookie Emmnauel Ogbah put some good heat on the Giant signal-caller.    Excluding Beckham, only 1 Giant had more than 18 receiving yards. That was Victor Cruz, who snatched just 1 of his 5 targets for 37 yards. Sterling Shepard didn't see a single target.    It wasn't a surprise that New York didn't run the ball very well against the Browns. Rashad Jennings gained 55 yards on 15 carries, while Paul Perkins (9-29) did about half as much.    As for the Browns, Josh McCown was able to post solid stats, going 25-of-43 for 322 yards and a touchdown. Don't be deceived, however, as much of this occurred in garbage time. To prove it, McCown was just 10-of-20 for 112 yards in the opening half. Many of his passes were way off the mark; on 1 occasion, he missed a wide-open Gary Barnidge (1 catch, 11 yards) for a substantial gain in New York territory. McCown wasn't officially charged with an interception, but he effectively had a pick-6 when a pass of his popped up in the air and into the arms of Jason Pierre-Paul, who ran back into the end zone. McCown was credited with a lost fumble on the play. He later lost another fumble, which ended all hopes for a Cleveland back-door touchdown.    Speaking of fumblers, Crowell, as mentioned, gave the Giants 7 free points in the first half. He gained 44 yards on 16 carries, as he continued to be ineffective on the ground. The Browns need to think about featuring "

There wasn't much intrigue as the Cleveland Browns came into Heinz Field to take on their old rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, but there was a competitive football game that went into overtime thanks to the Steelers resting their best players. This game felt like a preseason affair, but there were real-life consequences for the Browns, as a win could have lost them the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. Thankfully for them, they squandered plenty of opportunities to win, while the Steelers did just enough to squeak out the victory on the arm of Landry Jones.    The Browns got off to a fast start and a 14-0 lead behind 2 Robert Griffin III touchdown passes, 1 to Seth DeValve and the other to Gary Barnidge. Griffin showed some of his better traits early, making short, high-percentage passes and causing confusion with his legs, which gave running back Isaiah Crowell more running lanes. Griffin did throw a pick inside the red zone to kill a drive and then had a snap go over his head on the very next possession, which led to the Steelers' first score, an 11-yard touchdown pass from Jones to "

   "comment":"Crowell, who dropped the ball. It was a fumble, and the Jets recovered. Kizer once again moved the chains deep into Jets territory, and he had an opportunity to hit a wide-open David Njoku in the end zone, but he didn't see him. Instead, Kizer forced a bad pass, allowing Marcus Maye to come away with an interception. Meanwhile, all of this was sandwiched in between 2 missed field goals by Zane Gonzalez, 1 of which was from 39 yards. The Browns eventually managed to establish his first lead. Kizer was benched in favor of Kevin Hogan, who was able to find Njoku in the end zone. Hogan then had the Browns deep in Jets territory once again, but Hue Jackson foolishly passed on the opportunity to tie the game at 10. Jackson not only wasted a timeout, but called a predictable play, ramming Crowell into the middle of the line of scrimmage. Crowell was stuffed, and the demoralized Browns surrendered a 97-yard drive to the Jets, showing very little effort because they knew the game was over.    There are 2 pieces of big news concerning the Browns. The first is that Kizer was benched. He was terrible, going 8-of-17 for 87 yards and the aforementioned pick. The move to bench Kizer was the first correct thing Jackson has done all season, though he should've done this much earlier. Kizer has talent for sure, but he's just not seeing things correctly. He's making terrible reads, holding the ball too long, and misfiring on passes NFL quarterbacks should make. Hogan, meanwhile, was much better. He failed to complete just 3 passes, going 16-of-19 for 194 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. I wouldn't even put the pick on him, as it occurred when he was crunched by "

David Njoku dropped 2 passes. There were multiple defensive penalties, including a roughing-the-passer infraction that helped the Vikings score a touchdown. Before the Browns knew it, they saw their 13-12 halftime lead turn into a 30-16 deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter.    If there's a silver lining for the Browns, aside from them maintaining their draft position, it's that DeShone Kizer didn't commit any turnovers. Kizer, however, had some accuracy issues, as indicated by his stat line; he was 18-of-34 for only 179 yards to go along with 18 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground. Kizer threw some passes into the dirt and sailed a ball over Njoku's head for a big gain. However, he also had several passes that were dropped, as his receivers screwed him out of a potentially decent game.    Crowell, who had the aforementioned crucial fumble, actually had a strongfantasy performance for once. He rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, and he also caught 4 passes for 54 receiving yards. Crowell was a greater part of the passing game because "

   "comment":"Crowell, who tied the game up from a few yards out. The Browns got the ball back and moved it again with Kizer, who took off on a 20-yard run to defeat a poorly designed blitz to convert a third down. Kizer then hit DeValve (4-70) for 35 yards to the 1-yard line. Kizer then used the sneak that didn't work in the first half to get a touchdown. Cleveland's offensive line, especially the interior, was rolling Detroit at the point of attack in the third quarter. Detroit responded with Stafford hitting Kenny Golladay (2-64) for 50 yards as he beat Jamar Taylor. A couple plays later, Stafford hit Theo Reddick (3-12-1) for a short touchdown pass to tie the score at 24. Browns rookie David Njoku made a terrible play to not move his head to look to the outside. He missed a blitz on a max-protect play, and that allowed a bone-rattling hit from Quandre Diggs on Kizer. That knocked Kizer out of the game and into the locker room. The Lions took the lead with a drive that culminated with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Eric Ebron (2-39-1) as he beat Derrick Kindred down the sideline. Cody Kessler had Bryce Treggs running wide open down the sideline after he burned D.J. Hayden for what would have been about a 75-yard touchdown, but Kessler threw a terrible pass too long for Treggs. Detroit put the game away with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate on a simple wide receiver screen, and Tate went virtually untouched down the field for the score. Kizer came back into the game late in the fourth quarter, but he was out for some possessions, and Kessler was incompetent. In garbage time, Kizer led a drive close to Detroit's end zone before throwing an interception to Darius Slay on a fade pass to end the game.    Stafford was 17-of-26 for 249 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Tate led the Lions in receiving with 6 catches for 97 yards and a touchdown. Marvin Jones (1-22) didn't make a big impact.    Abdullah led Detroit in rushing with 52 yards on 11 carries and a touchdown.    Kizer completed 21-of-37 for 232 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He also ran for 57 yards and a touchdown. This was a positive performance from the rookie.    Crowell had 90 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown.    Defensively, "

He caught 6 balls for 80 yards. He dropped a pass, but he would've posted a better stat line had Kizer not been guilty of the aforementioned overthrow.
