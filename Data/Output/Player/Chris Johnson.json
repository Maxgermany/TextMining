   "comment":"Chris Johnson early in the game. Johnson had scores of 57, 69 and 91 yards. The Texans looked like they had only 6 men on the field on the first 1. Johnson was uncovered when he was split out wide on the second. And the last was a long burst from Tennessee's 9 on a 3rd-and-10. Johnson finished with 197 rushing yards and 87 receiving yards, destroying all of his fantasy opposers.    Johnson, shut down by Darrelle Revis last week, exploded against the Titans, catching 10 balls for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. In the past 2 seasons, the Texans are now 8-2 when Johnson accumulates at least 75 yards.    The only offensive blemish for the Titans was their inability to run the ball. "

It actually looked like Johnson was down, but the official mysteriously didn't overturn it when Jeff Fisher challenged. - The Titans had 10 penalties for 111 yards. - Down 3 late in the 4.h quarter, Tennessee muffed a weird kickoff. Denver recovered to ice the game.    I mentioned Johnson's fumble earlier. In addition to that lost ball, Johnson gained just 53 yards on 19 carries. His longest gain in this contest was only 8 yards. A possible explanation for this could be all of the carries Fisher gave to Johnson at the end of last year. The primary reason why I had Adrian Peterson over Johnson in my 2010 Fantasy Football Rankings was because running backs who lead the league in carries almost always struggle the following season. Johnson just does not look good running the football.    Johnson wasn't the only Titan who played poorly. Johnson fumbled deep in Denver territory.

   "comment":"Chris Johnson scored the game-winning touchdown 3 plays later.    Tony Romo went 31-of-46 for 406 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions (1 came in desperation mode). Believe it or not, Romo became the first Cowboys 400-yard passer since Troy Aikman in 1998.    Romo went to Miles Austin-Jones early and often. Austin-Jones had 9 catches for 166 yards and a score. Roy Williams (6-87) and Jason Witten (5-84) also caught touchdowns. As for Dez Bryant, the rookie wideout had only 3 catches for 22 yards. He injured his ankle in the second quarter. He missed some action and then limped around for the rest of the game.    Felix Jones looked great. While he ran like a sloth in the first 3 weeks of the season, he suddenly showed great quickness. Jones finished with 109 yards on 15 carries, while Marion Barber collected just 19 yards on 6 attempts.    For the third consecutive week after that awful outing against the Steelers, Vince Young did not throw an interception. Young went 12-of-25 for 173 yards and 2 touchdowns. Young found Kenny Britt for a 52-yard completion in the third quarter. Britt, who finished with 4 grabs for 86 yards and a score, completely abused Mike Jenkins all afternoon. Britt torched Jenkins on that 52-yard reception and also drew 2 pass-interference flags on the opening drive, and probably should have gotten a third later on.

   "comment":"Chris Johnson involved as much as possible. Munchak clearly had other plans in mind, as he ran the ball with Johnson just 4 times in the first half. This great strategy obviously didn't work, as Tennessee managed just 4 first downs prior to halftime. I know Jacksonville's run defense did a great job containing Johnson on his few attempts - he was held to 3 rushing yards - but it doesn't matter. Keeping the ball out of CJ2K's hands like that was really irresponsible. Munchak's not going to win (m)any games with this strategy. Johnson actually had more attempts in the second half. One more, to be exact. He finished with a whopping 9 carries for 24 yards. I'd buy low, if possible.    Still, it's inexcusable that Johnson had 9 attempts to Hasselbeck's 34. Hasselbeck went 21-of-34 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. He wasn't nearly as good as those numbers indicate, however, as he had a lucky 80-yard touchdown in which he heaved the ball up under pressure. Johnson involved as much as possible.

He took numerous big losses because his offensive line was blown up. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Johnson. Detroit then recovered an onside kick, and Hill launched a Hail Mary that was answered when a crowd of players tipped the ball to Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), Nate Burleson (10-69, TD) and Brandon Pettigrew (8-61)."

I mentioned the blocked punt, pick-six and Johnson fumble; Johnson had another fumble in Chicago territory, while Kenny Britt coughed the ball up at midfield. Jared Cook also fumbled in the second half; his 2 catches for 6 yards makes you wonder why no team wanted to acquire him at the trade deadline.

Amazingly though, Cutler was sacked thrice, which makes you wonder how he would have survived had Tennessee not killed itself with stupid mistakes.    All 3 of Cutler's touchdowns went to Brandon Marshall, who had a monstrous afternoon with 9 catches for 122 yards. Only 1 other Bear caught more than 2 passes (Earl Bennett: 4-22).    Matt Forte was set up with a short touchdown thanks to Hester's aforementioned return. He received just 12 carries on the afternoon, but was able to finish with 103 yards and the score.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, finished with 141 yards and a touchdown on just 16 attempts. Those are pretty bogus numbers, however, because he scored on an 80-yard scamper in garbage time. He otherwise would have mustered 61 yards on 15 tries, most notably getting stuffed twice on 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 on the second drive. He also fumbled twice.    Hasselbeck finished 20-of-35 for 194 yards, 1 score (to Johnson. It's amazing that the Bears didn't even really need to run a single offensive play to get out to a 26-point lead. In fact, it would have been a 28-point advantage had they completely gone with the anti-Bobby Boucher approach because they took a safety on an offensive line penalty in their own end zone. The Titans were guilty of 5 turnovers in the first half. I mentioned the blocked punt, pick-six and Johnson fumble; Johnson had another fumble in Chicago territory, while Kenny Britt coughed the ball up at midfield."

Jake Locker hit some big throws to Nate Washington (3-50) and Kendall Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Delanie Walker for a 10-yard touchdown.

Hopkins ran the wrong route to set up the interception. The Texans responded by moving the ball with passes to Hopkins and a gain to Andre Johnson to the 3-yard line.

I have no idea why the Titans are using Battle over Johnson. Are they that dumb that they don't realize that giving the ball to their best player gives them the best chance to win? Johnson had trouble running the ball - he gained 17 yards on carries - but he broke a reception for a 49-yard touchdown. Battle gained 38 yards on 6 carries, but that's deceiving because all but 1 of his yards came on a 37-yard scamper in which the Chiefs were caught unawares.    Fitzpatrick went 21-of-41 for 247 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks. He could've tossed a third interception, but the Chiefs dropped it. Fitzpatrick picked up a second score on the ground and actually happened to lead the team in rushing yardage (6-50).    "

Combine that with some red-zone ineptitude, and it's no wonder that New York didn't score at all following the break. QBDK wasn't awful though, as he went 21-of-28 for 196 yards and a touchdown to Eric Decker (9-63). He got hurt on a 4.h-down attempt in the red zone on a play in which his team was flagged for offensive pass interference. He was able to enter the game later in the 4.h quarter, but it was too late by then. Still, it was a reminder of how brittle QBDK is, and why teams simply can't rely on him to be a starter. Simms, by the way, did nothing in QBDK's absence, going 3-of-8 for 39 yards.    Percy Harvin was the primary reason why the Jets were able to move the chains and enter the red zone on some instances. Harvin caught a whopping 11 balls for 129 yards, and he also had a good kickoff return at the end of the first half to set up the team in field goal range. It's obviously very encouraging that Harvin was able to be such a huge part of this offense despite being in New York for only 2 weeks.

Ivory accumulated 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 attempts. Ivory had a scoring reception wiped out by a James Carpenter hold, but he found the end zone on the same drive anyway.    I mentioned that Marshall caught 1 of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns. The other was hauled in by Eric Decker, thought he managed just 2 receptions for 37 yards. He doesn't belong on 12-team rosters.    Going back to the Browns, Manziel finished 13-of-24 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, a pick and the 2 fumbles. I mentioned all of his mistakes before. He made a couple of nice plays early on, hooking up with Travis Benjamin for a 54-yard touchdown. He had a cool-looking first-down scramble, featuring a juke move, but that was negated by a chop block. However, the first fumble of his came immediately after that. He then overshot Andrew Hawkins, who was wide open in the end zone. As for McCown, he looked much more promising, going 5-of-8 for 49 yards. It seemed like the Browns were going to be much more competitive with him under center. I know McCown isn't very good, but he's light years ahead of Manziel.    Manziel happened to be Cleveland's leading rusher; he scrambled 5 times for 35 rushing yards. More hilariously, McCown was second on the list! He managed 23 yards on 3 scrambles. Duke Johnson (7-22) and Isaiah Crowell (12-20) couldn't find any room against the Jets' stout front."

David Johnson scored a touchdown and looked better overall, gaining 42 yards on 5 attempts. David needs to be on the field more than Chris before Andre Ellington returns.    One last note before moving on to Chicago: Johnson took the opening kickoff for a touchdown, and after they stopped getting in their own way with a couple of mistakes, they were able to establish a huge lead to improve to 2-0. Chicago offered very little resistance, as it continued to sport 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. The Bears were awful on that side of the ball. The trouble began when Kyle Fuller was flagged for a 42-yard pass interference on John Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. Alan Ball then took his turn with a deep pass interference flag, a 38-yarder, leading to a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. Chris Johnson handled most of the workload, but managed just 72 yards on 20 carries against a horrible defense. David Johnson scored a touchdown and looked better overall, gaining 42 yards on 5 attempts. David needs to be on the field more than Chris before Andre Ellington returns.

   "comment":"Chris Johnson drew another start. He looked good again, gaining 83 yards on 16 carries. David Johnson, as mentioned, had multiple screw-ups, including the fumble on the opening kickoff. David at least made up for it with 4 catches for 63 receiving yards and a touchdown. He was given just 3 attempts on the ground, which he turned into 18 rushing yards.    The Cardinals were screwed over by a horrible ruling. In the third quarter, Johnson dropped a touchdown in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble on the kickoff. The Cardinals also sputtered in the red zone all afternoon. So, despite outgaining St. Louis, 447-328, Arizona lost its first game of the year.    I guess you can say that Palmer performed well in between the 20s - especially when considering the circumstances. Palmer went 29-of-46 for 352 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception despite having no time to throw on many of his snaps. He was hit constantly by the Rams' ferocious pass rush. Despite this, Palmer was able to move the chains, though his team just failed deep in St. Louis territory and screwed up with turnovers.    It's no surprise that Fitzgerald led the team in receiving (7-99), but had that aforementioned fumble, which led to a St. Louis touchdown. John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone. It's worth noting that Floyd drew a pair of pass interference penalties.    With Andre Ellington out, Chris Johnson drew another start. He looked good again, gaining 83 yards on 16 carries. David Johnson, as mentioned, had multiple screw-ups, including the fumble on the opening kickoff. David at least made up for it with 4 catches for 63 receiving yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable. </i>    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to "

   "comment":"Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with Johnson, the Browns could've held on to lead, or at least the cover. Like seriously, what in the world is making him think that Isaiah Crowell and Robert Turbin (especially) are better options!? It makes no sense!    This was a typical game for the Browns, as they played well for awhile before self-destructing. Cleveland built a first-half lead, but Arizona's offense came storming back. After getting hot and scoring 3 touchdowns, the Browns' offense wilted with 4 punts, an interception and a fumble in the second half before garbage time when Johnny Manziel came in. The Cardinals didn't play a complete game, thanks to turnovers and coverage issues, but they made good second half adjustments to cruise in Cleveland.    To start the game, Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out."

   "comment":"Chris Johnson, who seems to be getting worse each week. Clearly out of gas, Johnson was restricted to 17 yards on 12 carries before leaving the game with some sort of leg injury. Johnson was able to run it in.    Palmer spent most of the afternoon either trying to avoid pass-rushers or throwing passes to Larry Fitzgerald. The future Hall of Famer saw 14 targets - double than the next receiver on the list. Fitzgerald reeled in 10 of those passes, but for only 66 yards, as Palmer didn't have the time to throw precise deep passes very often. Fitzgerald drew 2 pass-interference penalties in the end zone.    Arizona's leading receiver was actually John Brown, who snatched 5 balls for 99 yards. Nearly half of his production came on a 48-yard bomb. Michael Floyd was limited to just 1 reception for 14 yards. He saw just 1 other target, which was a deep drop.    It might be time for the Cardinals to move on from Chris Johnson, who seems to be getting worse each week. Clearly out of gas, Johnson was restricted to 17 yards on 12 carries before leaving the game with some sort of leg injury. "

Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining. However, Ray Ray Armstrong notched a sack and Elvis Dumervil recorded the 100th sack of his career to get the ball for the 49ers' offense. Hoyer couldn't do anything with it, forcing the 49ers to punt again. Dumervil added another sack, and that basically forced overtime. A pass interference on Patrick Peterson in overtime helped get San Francisco on the move. The 49ers advanced the ball with an 11-yard pass to Pierre Garcon (4-36), a third-down conversion with an 8.yard run by Kyle Juszcyk, and a pass to Hyde for 9 yards to get inside the 10-yard line. The drive stalled, and Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. Because it was the opening possession of overtime, Arizona got a chance to score. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for receptions of 17 and 25 yards. A holding on Jimmie Ward gave Arizona some more life, and Palmer took advantage. The Cardinals got a walk-off winer with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald as the future Hall of Famer got open to sky above the defender for a tremendous game-winning catch with only 38 seconds left in overtime.

   "comment":"Chris Johnson mustered only 21 yards on 9 carries, most of which came on 1 9-yard burst. No other running back had positive yardage. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Johnson suffered a concussion. This is huge because Philadelphia has to play Thursday night, so it's unlikely that he'll be ready to battle the Panthers and their terrific front 7.    As for the Cardinals, it was another rough outing for the offensive line. Carson Palmer was sacked just twice, but the Eagles brought tons of pressure, forcing lots of bad throws and checkdowns. Palmer never really had a chance, as his stat line was a byproduct of garbage time; he went 28-of-44 for 291 yards and a touchdown, but had just 123 yards at the break on 11-of-19 passing.    Larry Fitzgerald didn't find the end zone, but in hauling in 6 receptions for 51 yards, he had his 200th-consecutive game with at least 1 catch. That's the third-longest streak of all time, trailing only Jerry Rice and Tony Gonzalez. Fitzgerald was behind only J.J. Nelson (4-80) and Andre Ellington (9-65) on the stat sheet. John Brown (2-26) snatched Palmer's sole touchdown, but he also dropped a pass.    The Cardinals' running game struggled once again, which was hardly a surprise. Chris Johnson mustered only 21 yards on 9 carries, most of which came on 1 9-yard burst. No other running back had positive yardage. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
