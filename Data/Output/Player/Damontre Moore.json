   "comment":"Moore followed that up by holding on a nice punt return. The Giants tried their best to lose this game, but Fitzpatrick wouldn't let them. Fitzpatrick was disgraceful. Don't let the final stats fool you. He finished 20-of-34 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions, but almost all of that positive yardage came in garbage time. By halftime, Fitzpatrick was just 4-of-13 for 39 yards and 2 picks. He couldn't do anything when this game was still in doubt, as the Texans mustered just 83 yards of offense by the time the third quarter began. One of his interceptions was laughable; he heaved a dying ball to no 1 in particular, and the Giants were able to take possession on a short field and score more points. If Fitzpatrick keeps playing like this, we'll be seeing Ryan Mallett quite soon.    It hurt Fitzpatrick that he didn't have Arian Foster at his disposal. Bill O'Brien gave Foster too much of a workload in the first couple of weeks, so he wasn't able to go. "
