   "comment":"Harry Douglas and a third-and-nine to Roddy White. Ryan later managed a 26-yard pass on second-and-25. Late in the game, he found Michael Jenkins 26 yards downfield to set up Jason Elam's 48-yard game-winning field goal. Ryan, who looks like a seasoned veteran, was 22-of-30 for 301 yards and a touchdown versus Chicago's defense, though it should be noted that Nathan Vasher was out and Charles Tillman left the game with an injury. Still, Ryan was able to perform well despite the fact that Michael Turner was limited to 54 yards on 25 carries. More importantly, Ryan has the Falcons at 4-2. The same Falcons who were picked by many to finish at the bottom of the NFC South.    We all know about Roddy White, who was once again a force, catching 9 balls for 112 yards and a touchdown. But rookie Harry Douglas is beginning to emerge as a solid secondary option for Ryan. Douglas compiled 5 receptions and 96 yards.    Though the Bears couldn't score against the Falcons, "

   "comment":"Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to Chris Hogan, who beat Coty Sensabaugh to get inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal, Taylor went back to Hogan on a sprint out for a touchdown and a 14-13 lead. The Bills' defense came up with 2 stops to clinch the victory. On the second 1. Mariota was pressured by Marcell Dareus into throwing a deep ball up for grabs that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore to end the game for Buffalo.    Taylor completed 10-of-17 passes for 109 yards with a touchdown. He ran for 76 yards and 8 carries and a score. He'll continue to be a solid starting option in fantasy because of his rushing ability.    The Bills' offense was without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins. Their top running back was Dan Herron (9-28), while Chris Hogan (3-52) led them through the air.    Marcus Mariota was 21-of-32 for 187 yards with an interception. He ran for 47 yards on 5 carries. He didn't play poorly, and the Bills' defense did a good job of bending but not breaking.    The Titans' ground game was shutdown by Buffalo as Dexter McCluster (8-20) and Bishop Sankey (7-20 rushing, 3-23 receiving) were unable to get in any groove.    Antonio Andrews led the Titans through the air (3-45). Mariota spread the ball around to Kendall Wright (3-29), Justin Hunter (3-38), Delanie Walker (4-36) and Harry Douglas (2-17), but all were limited by the Bills. Walker and Wright suffered injuries late in the game that are worth monitoring.    Titans defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on Coty Sensabaugh to move the ball down the field. To end the drive, he went over Sensabaugh for a 15-yard touchdown. Texans safety Eddie Pleasant soon ripped the ball from Antonio Andrews for an interception at Tennessee's 34-yard line. A few plays later, Weeden threw a well-placed pass to Nate Washington for a 16-yard touchdown. A field goal drive expanded the Texans lead to 34. In the 4.h quarter, on a third-and-goal, J.J. Watt strip-sacked Zach Mettenberger and Houston recovered.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 117 yards and a score. What he's done this year with Houston's 4 different starting quarterbacks is truly remarkable.    Weeden was 15-of-24 for 200 yards with 2 touchdowns and a running score. Daniels was used as a read-option quarterback with 6 carries for 6 yards and 1 completion for 7 yards on 2 pass attempts.    David Cobb had 7 carries for 18 yards and Bishop Sankey had 2 for 11. Sankey also caught 3 passes for 43 yards.    Titans tight end Delanie Walker had 9 receptions for 59 yards. Harry Douglas led Tennessee's receivers with 6 catches for 79 yards. "
