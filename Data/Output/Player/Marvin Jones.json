   "comment":"Marvin Jones (5-65) and Jermaine Gresham (3-38).Jones on a go route. The second half saw a lot of inept offense and 2 good defenses. Dalton was intercepted on the first play of the third quarter by Cortez Allen. It was a bad throw by Dalton, who had telegraphed the pass. The Bengals had a nice drive inside the Steelers' 20-yard line, but penalties pushed them way back into a 4.h-and-22. Instead of a long field goal of around 50 yards, Cincinnati went for it. The team would've had it, but A.J. Green was pushed out of bounds before he could get 2 feet down on a superb catch. Pittsburgh took advantage with a drive that produced a Shaun Suisham 40-yard field goal. The Bengals crossed midfield in the 4.h quarter but Green fumbled the ball away after getting hit by Allen. Dalton threw another pick to Allen, who made a great catch off a deflection. Cincinnati missed a 56-yard field goal late in the 4.h quarter, but the Steelers missed a 53-yard field goal, too. With 20 seconds remaining, Roethlisberger made a dumb decision and overthrew Mike Wallace (1-3) on a roll out. The ball was easily picked off by Reggie Nelson. Dalton made a huge throw to Green to move the ball about 20 yards and get in range for the game-winning 43-yard field goal by Josh Brown.    Roethlisberger was 14-of-28 for 220 yards with a score and 2 picks. Pittsburgh's ground game never got into a groove. Jonathan Dwyer (14-39) and Rashard Mendenhall (11-50) had some nice runs but never could establish control against the tough Bengals defense.    One field-goal drive was all Cincinnati's offense could muster. The Steelers shut down the Bengals' ground offense, rendering BenJarvus Green-Ellis (15-14) completely ineffective. All Cincinnati could do to move the ball was some occasional completions to A.J. Green (10-116), Marvin Jones (5-65) and Jermaine Gresham (3-38)."

Dalton's third pick was forced into double coverage, while the 4.h was a poor misfire on a shot to A.J. Green in the end zone. Dalton, who also had some issues with the play clock in the first half, went 21-of-36 for 281 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and the 4 picks. He made some nice throws and connected with A.J. Green for a 53-yard scoring bomb, though that pass was underthrown. Dalton did manage to set the franchise single-season record for passing yardage and touchdowns with his numbers, but his struggles shouldn't be lost because they're a huge concern going forward.    Injuries are an issue for Cincinnati as well. Dalton didn't have either of his 2 tight ends in this matchup. He also missed left tackle Anthony Collins in the second half, as Collins left the game with an ankle. The Bengals already had tons of injuries, so they can't afford to see any more players get hurt.    Cincinnati was able to win this game because Joe Flacco had yet another poor outing. Flacco, who already had knee issues, looked like he hurt his shoulder on a first-quarter hit. He was then banged again soon after, and Tyrod Taylor started warming up. Flacco remained under center, but was largely ineffective, going 30-of-50 for only 192 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One pick was tipped at the line of scrimmage, but the interception that sealed the game was thrown behind his intended target and returned for 6. Flacco also missed an open Jacoby Jones for a touchdown.    Flacco's sole score went to Marlon Brown (5-30), though his top target was Dennis Pitta, who hauled in 8 grabs for 63 yards. Torrey Smith didn't do much (3-27), as Flacco was very limited.    The Ravens once again struggled to run the ball. Bernard Pierce had a nice gain of 14 early on, but neither he nor Ray Rice were able to do much on the ground much after that. Pierce tallied 28 yards on 5 carries, while Rice mustered only 15 yards on 6 tries, though he did catch 7 balls for 35 receiving yards. Rice was sidelined for much of the first half with an injury.    The Bengals had slightly more success on the ground. BenJarvus Green-Ellis looked good as he gained 66 yards on 11 carries, though Giovani Bernard (13-22) couldn't even average 2 yards per attempt. Bernard did mirror Rice in being a big factor in the passing game; he had 5 catches for 51 receiving yards.    Dalton's aerial touchdowns went to Green (4-61) and Marvin Jones (5-61). Green dropped a touchdown, so he could've had an even bigger day. Jones, meanwhile, made a great, acrobatic catch with 1 hand while falling down.   Jones.

   "comment":"Marvin Jones, who got a step on Josh Norman. Norman was injured on the play and went into the locker room with a concussion. A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10. The big play was Cousins hitting Vernon Davis (6-79) for a 27-yard reception to the Lions' 1-yard line, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Robert Kelley. Chris Baker bull-rushed through Larry Warford to help get the ball back for the Redskins. Washington moved down the field with Chris Thompson receiving and running the ball into the red zone. Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. Jones had a disastrous performance with 3 fumbles, including 1 into the end zone to take away critical points from his team. The Lions earned their third-straight win to stay in the playoff race, while the Redskins were dealt a blow with the Giants and Eagles both winning on Sunday.    Late in the first quarter, the Redskins got on the move with a completion to Niles Paul taking the ball across midfield. They moved the ball close to the end zone, but Matt Jones had his second fumble of the game and the Lions recovered the ball in the end zone to take points away from Washington. Detroit took advantage by getting on the move with a 27-yard screen pass to "

   "comment":"Marvin Jones also had a considerable gain wiped out when the ball slipped through his hands. Stafford finished 23-of-40 for 232 yards and a touchdown (as well as 30 rushing yards), but as you can see, his numbers should've been a lot better. The Vikings were able to stymie Stafford in the third quarter with some great pressure, but the Detroit signal-caller eventually came through in the clutch, as he's been wont to do this year.    Stafford's sole aerial score went to Boldin, who caught 7 passes for 69 yards. He trailed only Tate in that category, as Tate snatched 5 balls for 77 yards. Jones saw the most targets (11), but had a disappointing result - 4 catches, 54 yards - thanks to "

Jones then had the ball fall through their hands as well. The Lions crushed themselves with these drops, as I counted 5 in total. Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, didn't drop any passes, but was guilty of 2 personal-foul penalties and should've been ejected. It was an embarrassing effort on Detroit's part.    Thanks to all of the drops, Matthew Stafford had a low completion percentage, going 18-of-32 for 205 yards. Considering the drops, as well as the injuries to Travis Swanson and Riley Reiff, Stafford played relatively well, though he screwed up a 4.h-and-1 try in the second quarter on a horrible pass to Matthew Mulligan. I imagine Stafford wished he had a second chance at that play. I was surprised the Seahawks didn't pressure Stafford more, though they did rattle him on occasion. Still, Swanson and Reiff being out of the lineup was absolutely huge, as Detroit's offensive line was once a strength. The Lions just haven't been the same since losing Swanson, and Theo Riddick as well.    Jones led the team with 81 receiving yards on 4 catches, while Tate (3-25) struggled.

Detroit's offense did well as the game progressed, but the team killed itself with numerous mistakes. For example, T.J. Lang ruined a drive with an unsportsmanlike penalty, and a Ricky Wagner infraction negated a pass that would advance the Lions near the red zone. Stafford was able to nearly overcome this, going 25-of-45 for 264 yards and a touchdown. He appeared to have 2 scores, but the football gods were once again unfriendly to the Lions.

   "comment":"Marvin Jones (3-24) and Kenny Golladay (2-25) both were underwhelming.Jones predictably paced the Falcons in receiving with 7 grabs for 91 yards. He didn't score, but Taylor Gabriel did. Gabriel logged 5 receptions for 79 yards and a 40-yard touchdown, which involved him doing all of the work after catching a short pass.    Detroit's offense did well as the game progressed, but the team killed itself with numerous mistakes. For example, T.J. Lang ruined a drive with an unsportsmanlike penalty, and a Ricky Wagner infraction negated a pass that would advance the Lions near the red zone. Stafford was able to nearly overcome this, going 25-of-45 for 264 yards and a touchdown. He appeared to have 2 scores, but the football gods were once again unfriendly to the Lions.    Tate's near-touchdown at the very end also would've been his second. He caught 7 balls for 58 yards and 1 other score. He trailed only T.J. Jones (3-63) on the stat sheet, while Marvin Jones (3-24) and Kenny Golladay (2-25) both were underwhelming."
