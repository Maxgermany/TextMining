   "comment":"Marvin Jones. The second was an ugly overthrow that generated some boos from the crowd. Dalton's third pick was forced into double coverage, while the 4.h was a poor misfire on a shot to A.J. Green in the end zone. Dalton, who also had some issues with the play clock in the first half, went 21-of-36 for 281 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and the 4 picks. He made some nice throws and connected with A.J. Green for a 53-yard scoring bomb, though that pass was underthrown. Dalton did manage to set the franchise single-season record for passing yardage and touchdowns with his numbers, but his struggles shouldn't be lost because they're a huge concern going forward.    Injuries are an issue for Cincinnati as well. Dalton didn't have either of his 2 tight ends in this matchup. He also missed left tackle Anthony Collins in the second half, as Collins left the game with an ankle. The Bengals already had tons of injuries, so they can't afford to see any more players get hurt.    Cincinnati was able to win this game because Joe Flacco had yet another poor outing. Flacco, who already had knee issues, looked like he hurt his shoulder on a first-quarter hit. He was then banged again soon after, and Tyrod Taylor started warming up. Flacco remained under center, but was largely ineffective, going 30-of-50 for only 192 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One pick was tipped at the line of scrimmage, but the interception that sealed the game was thrown behind his intended target and returned for 6. Flacco also missed an open Jacoby Jones for a touchdown.    Flacco's sole score went to Marlon Brown (5-30), though his top target was Dennis Pitta, who hauled in 8 grabs for 63 yards. Torrey Smith didn't do much (3-27), as Flacco was very limited.    The Ravens once again struggled to run the ball. Bernard Pierce had a nice gain of 14 early on, but neither he nor Ray Rice were able to do much on the ground much after that. Pierce tallied 28 yards on 5 carries, while Rice mustered only 15 yards on 6 tries, though he did catch 7 balls for 35 receiving yards. Rice was sidelined for much of the first half with an injury.    The Bengals had slightly more success on the ground. BenJarvus Green-Ellis looked good as he gained 66 yards on 11 carries, though Giovani Bernard (13-22) couldn't even average 2 yards per attempt. Bernard did mirror Rice in being a big factor in the passing game; he had 5 catches for 51 receiving yards.    Dalton's aerial touchdowns went to Green (4-61) and Marvin Jones (5-61). Green dropped a touchdown, so he could've had an even bigger day. Jones, meanwhile, made a great, acrobatic catch with 1 hand while falling down.   "

A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10. The big play was Cousins hitting Vernon Davis (6-79) for a 27-yard reception to the Lions' 1-yard line, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Robert Kelley. Chris Baker bull-rushed through Larry Warford to help get the ball back for the Redskins. Washington moved down the field with Chris Thompson receiving and running the ball into the red zone. Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. "

However, the story of the game was Golladay, who was the third receiver on most snaps. He made some errors early by dropping the ball on a couple of instances. However, he had a terrific 4.h quarter. He scored twice, with 1 touchdown being an incredible, diving catch. Golladay hauled in 4 balls for 69 yards and 2 touchdowns. He's very talented, and he's worth picking up in fantasy leagues if he's available.    The Lions didn't have much luck running the ball, as "
