   "comment":"Jones on a go route. The second half saw a lot of inept offense and 2 good defenses. Dalton was intercepted on the first play of the third quarter by Cortez Allen. It was a bad throw by Dalton, who had telegraphed the pass. The Bengals had a nice drive inside the Steelers' 20-yard line, but penalties pushed them way back into a 4.h-and-22. Instead of a long field goal of around 50 yards, Cincinnati went for it. The team would've had it, but A.J. Green was pushed out of bounds before he could get 2 feet down on a superb catch. Pittsburgh took advantage with a drive that produced a Shaun Suisham 40-yard field goal. The Bengals crossed midfield in the 4.h quarter but Green fumbled the ball away after getting hit by Allen. Dalton threw another pick to Allen, who made a great catch off a deflection. Cincinnati missed a 56-yard field goal late in the 4.h quarter, but the Steelers missed a 53-yard field goal, too. With 20 seconds remaining, Roethlisberger made a dumb decision and overthrew Mike Wallace (1-3) on a roll out. The ball was easily picked off by Reggie Nelson. Dalton made a huge throw to Green to move the ball about 20 yards and get in range for the game-winning 43-yard field goal by Josh Brown.    Roethlisberger was 14-of-28 for 220 yards with a score and 2 picks. Pittsburgh's ground game never got into a groove. Jonathan Dwyer (14-39) and Rashard Mendenhall (11-50) had some nice runs but never could establish control against the tough Bengals defense.    One field-goal drive was all Cincinnati's offense could muster. The Steelers shut down the Bengals' ground offense, rendering BenJarvus Green-Ellis (15-14) completely ineffective. All Cincinnati could do to move the ball was some occasional completions to A.J. Green (10-116), Marvin Jones (5-65) and Jermaine Gresham (3-38)."

He produced fewer yardage than the other 2 receivers; Randall Cobb (5-54) was OK, but Jordy Nelson (8-93) made a spectacular, acrobatic catch where he tip-toed the sideline. This prompted the play-by-play announcer to exclaim, He catches everything! As for Jermichael Finley, he didn't catch a single pass because he was was knocked out in the first quarter because of a concussion.    Dalton had just 8 incompletions, going 20-of-28 for 235 yards, a pair of touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned turnovers. It helped his cause that Clay Matthews was knocked out of the game with an injury. Fortunately for the Packers, Matthews is expected to play next week. Dalton's scores went to A.J. Green (4-46) and Marvin Jones (3-38). Green's production all came after intermission, as he didn't do anything in the first half. "

His previous 2 contests saw him achieve decent stat lines of 3-71-1 and 4-57-1. He's a talented wideout and needs to be picked up in all fantasy formats, as he has grown into Dalton's second-favorite target.    Dalton's fifth score went to "

   "comment":"Jones. The second was an ugly overthrow that generated some boos from the crowd. Dalton's third pick was forced into double coverage, while the 4.h was a poor misfire on a shot to A.J. Green in the end zone. Dalton, who also had some issues with the play clock in the first half, went 21-of-36 for 281 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and the 4 picks. He made some nice throws and connected with A.J. Green for a 53-yard scoring bomb, though that pass was underthrown. Dalton did manage to set the franchise single-season record for passing yardage and touchdowns with his numbers, but his struggles shouldn't be lost because they're a huge concern going forward.    Injuries are an issue for Cincinnati as well. Dalton didn't have either of his 2 tight ends in this matchup. He also missed left tackle Anthony Collins in the second half, as Collins left the game with an ankle. The Bengals already had tons of injuries, so they can't afford to see any more players get hurt.    Cincinnati was able to win this game because Joe Flacco had yet another poor outing. Flacco, who already had knee issues, looked like he hurt his shoulder on a first-quarter hit. He was then banged again soon after, and Tyrod Taylor started warming up. Flacco remained under center, but was largely ineffective, going 30-of-50 for only 192 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One pick was tipped at the line of scrimmage, but the interception that sealed the game was thrown behind his intended target and returned for 6. Flacco also missed an open Jacoby Jones for a touchdown.    Flacco's sole score went to "

   "comment":"Jones along the sideline for 32 yards. In the red zone, the Ravens hurt themselves as Courtney Upshaw dropped an interception and a penalty on Will Hill gave the Bengals a first down. Dalton finished the drive by diving into the end zone after a 7-yard run. Ravens answered with a drive that was led by a Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback "

   "comment":"Jones also had a considerable gain wiped out when the ball slipped through his hands. Stafford finished 23-of-40 for 232 yards and a touchdown (as well as 30 rushing yards), but as you can see, his numbers should've been a lot better. The Vikings were able to stymie Stafford in the third quarter with some great pressure, but the Detroit signal-caller eventually came through in the clutch, as he's been wont to do this year.    Stafford's sole aerial score went to Boldin, who caught 7 passes for 69 yards. He trailed only Tate in that category, as Tate snatched 5 balls for 77 yards. Jones saw the most targets (11), but had a disappointing result - 4 catches, 54 yards - thanks to Xavier Rhodes' terrific coverage."

Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, didn't drop any passes, but was guilty of 2 personal-foul penalties and should've been ejected. It was an embarrassing effort on Detroit's part.    Thanks to all of the drops, Matthew Stafford had a low completion percentage, going 18-of-32 for 205 yards. Considering the drops, as well as the injuries to Travis Swanson and Riley Reiff, Stafford played relatively well, though he screwed up a 4.h-and-1 try in the second quarter on a horrible pass to Matthew Mulligan. I imagine Stafford wished he had a second chance at that play. I was surprised the Seahawks didn't pressure Stafford more, though they did rattle him on occasion. Still, Swanson and Reiff being out of the lineup was absolutely huge, as Detroit's offensive line was once a strength. The Lions just haven't been the same since losing Swanson, and Theo Riddick as well.    Jones led the team with 81 receiving yards on 4 catches, while Tate (3-25) struggled. Ebron (2-23) was somehow even worse, converting only a couple of his 6 targets. He needs to be replaced this offseason. The team's leader in receptions (6) was actually "

   "comment":"Jones predictably paced the Falcons in receiving with 7 grabs for 91 yards. He didn't score, but Taylor Gabriel did. Gabriel logged 5 receptions for 79 yards and a 40-yard touchdown, which involved him doing all of the work after catching a short pass.    Detroit's offense did well as the game progressed, but the team killed itself with numerous mistakes. For example, T.J. Lang ruined a drive with an unsportsmanlike penalty, and a Ricky Wagner infraction negated a pass that would advance the Lions near the red zone. Stafford was able to nearly overcome this, going 25-of-45 for 264 yards and a touchdown. He appeared to have 2 scores, but the football gods were once again unfriendly to the Lions.    Tate's near-touchdown at the very end also would've been his second. He caught 7 balls for 58 yards and 1 other score. He trailed only T.J. Jones (3-63) on the stat sheet, while Marvin Jones (3-24) and Kenny Golladay (2-25) both were underwhelming."
