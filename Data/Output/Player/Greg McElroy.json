Oh, if only the Jets had another quarterback on the roster - 1 who pulled off marvelous 4.h-quarter comebacks last year. What a shame that they don't possess such an individual. Darn it! McElroy wasn't as awful as Sanchez, but he was pretty ineffective. He went 14-of-24 for 185 yards, an interception and a lost fumble. Worst of all, he took a ridiculous 11 sacks, including 2.5 from "
