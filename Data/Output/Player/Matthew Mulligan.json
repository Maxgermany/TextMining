   "comment":"Mulligan (yes, yes, he didn't need 1). Amendola was the only Ram who had more than 3 receptions. He actually had 15 of them for 160 yards. The Redskins simply couldn't contain him, save for 1 play early in the first quarter when he was strip-sixed.    Jackson, who had the aforementioned angry spike, didn't see the field after that penalty, though that apparently was because of a groin strain. Sure. Seventh-round rookie "

   "comment":"Mulligan. I imagine Stafford wished he had a second chance at that play. I was surprised the Seahawks didn't pressure Stafford more, though they did rattle him on occasion. Still, Swanson and Reiff being out of the lineup was absolutely huge, as Detroit's offensive line was once a strength. The Lions just haven't been the same since losing Swanson, and Theo Riddick as well.    Jones led the team with 81 receiving yards on 4 catches, while Tate (3-25) struggled. Ebron (2-23) was somehow even worse, converting only a couple of his 6 targets. He needs to be replaced this offseason. The team's leader in receptions (6) was actually "
