The Patriots' defense did a pretty pedestrian job overall, despite the 13 points. The defensive line was pushed around, allowing the Bengals to accumulate 341 net yards (compared to 248 yards by the Patriots). The Patriots also permitted Cincinnati to convert a third-and-15 on its own 2-yard line in the third quarter. This ultimately led to the only touchdown of the afternoon. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Tyler Eifert in the first half with a very nasty elbow injury. Eifert dislocated it, so he'll be out for a while. The Bengals struggled to score following intermission without Eifert. They let a 15-0 advantage completely slip away, but Andy Dalton managed to hit A.J. Green with a 77-yard bomb. Green snagged it off a deflection and ran into the end zone for what turned out to be the decisive score. Dalton finished 25-of-38 for 301 yards and that touchdown, though he was just 7-of-14 following intermission. Green, meanwhile, made 6 catches for 131 yards and the score.    Giovani Bernard rushed for 48 yards on 14 carries, and he also paced the team with 10 targets, catching 6 of them for 62 receiving yards. His fantasy owners must have been thrilled to see Jeremy Hill receive just 4 carries. He won't be much of a fantasy factor unless Bernard gets injured.    With Marvin Jones out and Tyler Eifert banged up, Mohamed Sanu is worth an add."

   "comment":"Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by "
