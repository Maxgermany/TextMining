They let a 15-0 advantage completely slip away, but Andy Dalton managed to hit A.J. Green with a 77-yard bomb. Green snagged it off a deflection and ran into the end zone for what turned out to be the decisive score. Dalton finished 25-of-38 for 301 yards and that touchdown, though he was just 7-of-14 following intermission. Green, meanwhile, made 6 catches for 131 yards and the score.    Giovani Bernard rushed for 48 yards on 14 carries, and he also paced the team with 10 targets, catching 6 of them for 62 receiving yards. His fantasy owners must have been thrilled to see Jeremy Hill receive just 4 carries. He won't be much of a fantasy factor unless Bernard gets injured.    With Marvin Jones out and Tyler Eifert banged up, Mohamed Sanu is worth an add.Eifert in the first half with a very nasty elbow injury. Eifert dislocated it, so he'll be out for a while.

   "comment":"Tyler Eifert hold. Eifert hold. Joe Flacco then gift-wrapped an easy scoring opportunity when he threw an interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Bengals took over deep in Baltimore territory, but a botched snap gave the ball right back to the Ravens on a fumble recovery. In the second quarter, the Bengals were given a generous spot on a third down, converting it. They took a timeout for some reason, and Baltimore used that time to determine that the spot was off. John Harbaugh challenged the play, and won the review. The Bengals then declined a penalty that would've taken the Ravens out of field-goal range. Instead, Baltimore was able to kick for 3 points - 1 of 2 occasions in which Justin Tucker drilled a 50-yard field goal in the first half alone. Things didn't get much better for the Bengals after halftime. Mike Nugent missed yet another extra point - this prevented the Bengals from covering the spread - and Andy Dalton was strip-sacked a whopping THREE times. Dalton was fortunate that 2 fumbles that were forced by Terrell Suggs were recovered, but the third 1. created by Elvis Dumervil, was the decisive 1. as Baltimore was able to fall on the football.    Dalton couldn't do much without A.J. Green, going 26-of-48 for only 283 yards and a touchdown. That's a YPA of 5.89, which is pretty bad. He wasn't intercepted, but he easily could've been picked off by Eric Weddle in the first half, as the stud safety dropped the ball. It was apparent that Dalton missed Green, as he threw some passes up for grabs that his pedestrian receivers couldn't come up with. Dalton also had numerous passes tipped at the line of scrimmage. It seemed like this happened 4 times in the final quarter alone.    Only 3 Bengals logged more than 38 receiving yards: Eifert (5-68), Boyd (5-62) and Jeremy Hill (6-61)."
