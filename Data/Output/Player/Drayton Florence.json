   "comment":"Florence for a 60-yard gain to the Bills 5-yard line. Bradshaw dove over the top of the line, in for another short touchdown run. In the third quarter, the Giants broke a 17-17 tie with another short touchdown run by Bradshaw. It was set up by some passes from Manning to Ballard. Initially, Manning had a touchdown pass to Manningham, but it was reversed and put on the 1-yard line, where Bradshaw finished it off. Giants cornerback "

The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker "

   "comment":"Florence. On third-and-goal, Glennon dropped the ball and it was recovered by Carolina. Newton and Mike Tolbert moved the ball for a field goal. Just before halftime, LaFell (3-36) had Revis beat for a 50-yard touchdown, but Newton overthrew his receiver. A screen to Greg Olsen went for 30 yards inside the 10, and Newton dived over the top on fourth-and-goal. To start the third quarter, Glennon threw a deep ball up for grabs and it was picked off my Mike Mitchell. Newton hit Olsen (5-85) on the run for 28 yards and dropped in a beautiful 36-yard touchdown to Ted Ginn (2-47), who burned Revis for the score. After Tampa Bay missed a field goal, Revis dropped an interception and injured his chest/shoulder on the play. He left the game and went into the locker room. The Panthers moved the ball into Bucs territory before Newton made a terrible throw off his back foot for an interception to Lavonte David.    Newton finished 18-of-29 for 263 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He rushed for 68 yards and a score. Jonathan Stewart ran for 39 yards on 14 carries. Mike Tolbert was Carolina's leading back as he gained 48 yards on 9 carries with 3 receptions for 41 yards.    Glennon was 14-of-21 for 180 yards with a fumble and an interception. Bobby Rainey had 63 yards on 17 carries. Tiquan Underwood logged 3 receptions for 51 yards.    The Panthers' defense was suffocating. Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Star Lotulelei shut down Tampa Bay's running game. Rookie linebacker A.J. Klein flashed with a tackle for a loss and a sack. Drayton Florence had a deep pass breakup and a good day in coverage. "
