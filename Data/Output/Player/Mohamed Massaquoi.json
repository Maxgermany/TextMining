   "comment":"Massaquoi, but that was the result of busted coverage. His impressive passes were far and few between. McCoy barely had any support from his running game. The offensive line couldn't open up anything for Peyton Hillis, who rushed for 57 yards on 17 carries; more than a third of his yardage came on a 17-yard scamper. Hillis did help McCoy in the passing attack, catching 6 balls for 30 receiving yards.    The Browns really need to utilize Greg Little more often. Little caught just 1 pass for 12 yards and was targeted only 3 times. He also drew an embarrassing and uncharacteristic pass interference penalty on Leon Hall, who held on to Little's jersey to prevent a completion. It's really embarrassing that Cleveland is asking McCoy to throw to bums like Massaquoi and Brian Robiskie."
