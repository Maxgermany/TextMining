The offensive line couldn't open up anything for Peyton Hillis, who rushed for 57 yards on 17 carries; more than a third of his yardage came on a 17-yard scamper. Hillis did help McCoy in the passing attack, catching 6 balls for 30 receiving yards.    The Browns really need to utilize Greg Little more often. Little caught just 1 pass for 12 yards and was targeted only 3 times. He also drew an embarrassing and uncharacteristic pass interference penalty on Leon Hall, who held on to Little's jersey to prevent a completion. It's really embarrassing that Cleveland is asking McCoy to throw to bums like Massaquoi and Brian Robiskie."
