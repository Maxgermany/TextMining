   "comment":"Tyson Clabo this offseason, most assume it had some sort of contingency plan. Apparently not. The offensive line has been completely abused this year, and that trend continued in this contest, as Jets' defensive ends Muhammad Wilkerson and Sheldon Richardson manhandled Atlanta's front. The 2 combined for a couple of sacks and a forced fumble, but those numbers are not indicative of how dominant they were. Matt Ryan was constantly under pressure, so it shows how skilled he is that he was still able to go 36-of-45 for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns. He got away with a potential pick-six in the first quarter and happened to lose a fumble, but those were his only 2 blemishes on the evening. The offensive line also failed to open up any running lanes for Jacquizz Rodgers (14-43, 2 TDs) and Jason Snelling (7-13). The former's numbers are deceiving in that 19 of his 43 yards came on a draw for a score when the Jets weren't prepared for it. 3. Atlanta is poorly coached. How many times are the Falcons going to fail on 4.h down in the red zone rather than settle for 3 points? I wouldn't even have much of an issue with this aggressive play-calling if Atlanta had Ryan throw the ball to Julio Jones or Tony Gonzalez, but it's always something dumb. For instance, on a goal-line try with 1 second remaining in the opening half, the Falcons had Rodgers run the ball up the middle. He was predictably stuffed. As I posted on Twitter (: #Falcons logic: We have Julio, Gonzalez, White... let's run the ball in between the tackles with our 190-pound running back! This wasn't the only mistake on the drive. The Falcons let time tick off the clock prior to calling a timeout. Had they asked for a stoppage immediately, they would've had an extra opportunity or 2 to score points. Also, earlier in the series, the Falcons gave Snelling the ball in the red zone. The team has struggled immensely deep in enemy territory all year because it hasn't been able to run the ball. If the coaching staff recognized that, perhaps it wouldn't have called a play for the pedestrian Snelling and instead stuck with what it does best. The Falcons also wasted a valuable second-half timeout on the opening DEFENSIVE drive after intermission.    Wrapping up some other stuff: - Gonzalez (10-97) and Jones (8-99) both had big outings. Jones was whistled for a bogus offensive pass interference in the 4.h quarter but came back to haul in a 46-yard bomb with a 1.handed grab on the very next play. Jones also had the awareness to scoop up a Roddy White fumble in the opening period, which also turned out to be a gain of 46 yards. - Speaking of White, he had 1 of the worst performances of his career. The numbers don't look awful (4-45), but White fumbled twice, only to be bailed out by his teammates. He was also called for offensive pass interference. White's night finished early when he aggravated his hamstring. He's a shell of his former self. - Antonio Allen blocked an Atlanta punt in the first quarter, setting up a Jets' field goal.   "
