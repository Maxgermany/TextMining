   "comment":"Martin booted the ball out of bounds on a kickoff, setting up a Mason Crosby 54-yard field goal after James Jones made a brilliant 16-yard reception. - Matthew Stafford was strip-sixed when Nick Perry beat Riley Reiff. - Stafford was picked off by Tramon Williams in Green Bay territory. As Stafford and company walked off the field, the crowd booed furiously. At that point in the game, the Packers were up 10-3 despite not doing anything on offense. Had they maintained any sort of competent scoring attack, they probably would've beaten the mistake-prone Lions. But Matt Flynn was the quarterback, so Green Bay ultimately had no chance. This game was so lopsided that by the time Detroit made this a 40-10 affair, it had outgained the Packers, 563-56. That's just mind-boggling. As a reference, no team since 1989 (as far back as my data goes) has outgained its opponent by 507 yards or more. Green Bay secured some garbage yardage to keep itself from setting a dubious historical mark.    After some early mistakes, Stafford was pretty sharp. He went 22-of-35 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns, 2 picks and the lost fumble. His completion percentage should have been even better; he endured a handful of drops from his receivers, 2 of which were Calvin Johnson's fault.    Speaking of Megatron, he caught 6 balls for 101 yards and 1 of Stafford's 3 scores. The others were secured by Kevin Ogletree and Jeremy Ross.    Both Detroit running backs found the end zone as well. Bush atoned for the lost fumble, compiling 117 rushing yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to go along with 5 catches for 65 receiving yards. Joique Bell, meanwhile, gained 94 yards and a score on the ground on 19 attempts.    The Lions made some mistakes after their initial blunders. Stafford tossed that second pick - an end-zone shot in which Sam Shields covered Megatron extremely well - while Martin placed a second kickoff out of bounds. "
