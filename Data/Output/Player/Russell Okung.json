   "comment":"Russell Okung, Mike Williams and Marshawn Lynch is reason for optimism. There's a lot more optimism now. The Seahawks really dominated this matchup despite this 12-point spread. The reason it was so close is because out of 7 trips to the red zone, Seattle came up with just 1 touchdown. The Seahawks also committed 10 penalties. It could have been a lot worse for Arizona.    One thing we learned in this contest is that Williams is a stud. Finally living up to expectations, Williams hauled in 11 passes for 87 yards and a touchdown.    Another thing is that Seattle's pass protection still stinks. Matt Hasselbeck (20-38, 192, 1 TD) was sacked 5 times. Russell Okung left the game early with a high ankle sprain, which would explain how Arizona was able to put so much pressure on Hasselbeck.    Lynch ran for 89 yards on 24 carries.
