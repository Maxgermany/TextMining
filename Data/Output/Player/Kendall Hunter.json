The game was still in their control when Nnamdi Asomugha, signed to be a shutdown corner, let Michael Crabtree beat him for a gain of 32 yards to start a drive that ended in a touchdown to trim the lead to 23-17, which gave the visitors hope. At this point the offense kept moving down the field only to watch their rookie kicker act like a rookie. Alex Henery missed field goals on consecutive drives sandwiched around forcing a San Francisco punt. Suddenly, the 49ers had the ball with the outcome in doubt and 6:28 left. They got big plays from Hunter and the physically limited Frank Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper."

His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety Kenny Phillips to earn the final few yards, and with Gore sidelined, it was a good thing he did. They went for 2 and got it on a pass to Michael Crabtree, who caught only 1 pass (21 yards). The Giants took over down 20-13, and on the second play of the drive, Manning threw to where he thought Manningham would be. Instead Carlos Rogers was there for his second interception of the game. On the first play from scrimmage, Hunter bolted for a 17-yard score, and the 49ers were up 2 touchdowns. To their credit, New York was not shaken in hostile territory. They went 80 yards in 7 plays, finishing on a 32-yard deep ball to "

It looked like San Francisco had had about enough of that, completing passes to Crabtree and Davis, setting up yet another Akers field goal attempt. A funny thing happened though. No 1 covered Crabtree wide and Akers hit him for an easy touchdown, creating a seemingly safe 27-10 lead as the third quarter came to a close. Still, the St. Louis would not quit.
