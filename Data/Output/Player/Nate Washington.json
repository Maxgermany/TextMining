   "comment":"Nate Washington had a huge drop on what would have been a 60-yard touchdown early in the contest. Second, the Titans had 2 big turnovers near midfield. An Ahmard Hall fumble on first down at the Indianapolis 46 interrupted a promising drive, while a poorly thrown Vince Young interception (late along the sidelines) led to a Colts touchdown. And third, the Titans screwed up twice in the red zone. They had a 1st-and-goal on Indianapolis' 1-yard line and a 1st-and-10 on Indianapolis' 19, and managed a grand total of ZERO points on those 2 sequences. They went for it on 4.h down both times and failed. Had Jeff Fisher opted for field goals, his team would have been down only 4 points with possession and 1:21 on the clock. Fisher and Raheem Morris should create a Facebook group called the I Senselessly Go for It Instead of Kicking Obvious Field Goals Club.    But the big story is that the Colts are now 12-0. Four of the past 5 teams to start 12-0 have gone to the Super Bowl. This victory is also Indianapolis' 21st consecutive win in the regular season, matching the 2006-08 New England Patriots' record. Congratulations to Peyton Manning for kicking a**.    Manning went 24-of-37 for 270 yards and a touchdown. While Reggie Wayne (4 catches, 48 yards) and Dallas Clark (3-25) didn't do much, Pierre Garcon dominated the contest with 6 grabs for 136 yards. Austin Collie (4-18) had Manning's touchdown.    Joseph Addai annoyed Manning owners with multiple scores. Addai had 79 yards and 2 touchdowns on 21 attempts.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, topped the 100-yard rushing barrier for the 7.h consecutive contest. Johnson had 113 yards on 27 carries. He's now on pace to rush for 2,012 yards on the year.    Young, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre for a change. He threw for 241 yards and 2 touchdowns, but as mentioned, he had that horrible interception. He was also wildly inaccurate (24-of-43) and rushed for only 16 yards.    Young's touchdowns went to Bo Scaife (5 catches, 56 yards) and Kenny Britt (3-36). Nate Washington had 4 grabs for 44 yards, but was also guilty of that crucial dropped touchdown.   "

Locker then tried to bring down the Patriot who had possession, but hurt his non-throwing shoulder while making the tackle. The play was reviewed and it was ruled an incompletion, but the damage was done. The good news is that Locker is expected to play next week. I haven't even heard anything pertaining to Washington, so I assume that he's OK.    Locker played relatively well considering the circumstances, going 23-of-32 for 229 yards, a touchdown and an interception. However, he was constant siege in the backfield, and the Patriots were able to force him into enough errors (the pick and the aforementioned strip-six) to establish complete control of the game.    New England also did an outstanding job of bottling up "

Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston. He was 18-of-19 for 282 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for Tannehill. Miami seemed to have the perfect play call throughout the first half.    Lamar Miller was awesome. He ripped off 175 yards on 14 carries with 1 touchdown rushing. He added 3 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. All of this occurred in the first half. The Texans were incapable of defending Miller.    Jarvis Landry led Miami through the air with 5 catches for 83 yards and 2 scores. Rishard Matthews (3-75-1) also was impressive.    Brian Hoyer was 23-of-49 for 273 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Behind a weak offensive line, he was ineffective until the outcome was decided.    Arian Foster ran for 58 yards on 18 carries with a score. He had 66 yards on 5 catches with another touchdown. However, late in the 4.h quarter, Foster had his left leg give out on him untouched and had to be helped off the field with a cart ride into the locker room. This looks like it could be a serious injury to the left Achilles for Foster.    Surprisingly, Miami's weak secondary did the best job defending DeAndre Hopkins this season. He had only 6 catches for 50 yards. Nate Washington led Houston's garbage-time production with 127 yards on 9 receptions and 2 scores.    The Dolphins' defense flat-out destroyed the Texans' offensive line. "
