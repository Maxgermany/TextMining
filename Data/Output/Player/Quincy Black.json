Henne redeemed himself by putting together a game-winning drive with 1:14 remaining on the clock. Henne was 17-of-31 for 175 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    "

Ingram ran for 22 yards on 9 carries. The Buccaneers had no answer for tight end Jimmy Graham. He totaled 124 yards on 7 catches. Colston also had 7 receptions for 118 yards. Freeman completed 23-of-41 passes for 303 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. It was a good bounce-back performance for the Buccaneers' signal caller after a horrible game a week ago against the 49ers. Earnest Graham ran for 109 yards on 17 carries. He stepped up and did an excellent job filling in for the injured LeGarrette Blount. Benn had 3 receptions for 83 yards while "
