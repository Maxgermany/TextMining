   "comment":"Neal. It seemed inexplicable that the Panthers would focus on pounding the ball with Stewart, given that they used the 8.-overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft on a running back. Yet, that's what happened, and Carolina was penalized for it. McCaffrey was given more work in the second half - 13 touches following intermission, compared to 7 beforehand - and it paid off. McCaffrey generated 66 rushing yards and a touchdown to go along with 5 catches for 28 receiving yards. Stewart, meanwhile, plodded for 21 yards on 11 attempts, with most of his yardage coming on a 9-yard burst. Stewart sucks at this stage of his career, so it's inexcusable for McCaffrey to lose any touches to him.    Believe it or not, only 1 Panther logged more receiving yards than McCaffrey's 28. That was "
