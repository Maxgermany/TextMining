  "comment":"Jack Doyle's stat line. If you don't feel like scrolling down, he caught 12 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. I told you, worthless.    The Bengals came into this game as 10-point favorites, while the Colts were reeling after getting manhandled by the Jaguars 27-0, when quarterback Jacoby Brissett was sacked a whopping 10 times. The Bengals had also just lost badly to division rival Pittsburgh on the road, so back at home against a weak opponent was what the doctor ordered, that is, until the order got there and the Colts got a big helping of horse hoof in their guts. Thankfully for the Bengals, a last-minute transplant of the ball from the Colts' possession to the Bengals, gave them a much-needed win. This game started well for the Bengals, with 2 sacks of Brissett, forcing the punt, which set up a day of bad offensive line play from both teams. This includes special teams, as the Bengals blocked a punt to set up their first field goal and the Colts blocked a field goal a couple drives later. Brissett ended up getting sacked 4 times, while Dalton was sacked 3 times, but pressured more often than a poor Indianapolis pass rush should be able to accomplish.    The Colts' passing offense was dink and dunking their way all day, but effectively, as tight end Jack Doyle caught 12-of-14 targets for 121 yards and 1 touchdown. His second-most targeted receiver, ",
