   "comment":"Jack Doyle (4-53, TD). Add in some poor pass protection, and Luck couldn't sustain drives in the 4.h quarter and overtime despite having multiple opportunities to put his team in position to win the game with a score. Luck finished 21-of-32 for 252 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick was a forced pass to Hilton inside the Indianapolis 10-yard line prior to halftime. A field goal there would have been huge, and it perhaps would've allowed the Colts to prevail. With poor pass protection and a diminished receiving corps, Luck had to do more running than usual, which would explain his rushing stats (7 carries, 53 yards, TD).    "

   "comment":"Jack Doyle let the ball slip through his hands in the end zone on an ensuing possession. The Titans managed to roar back, thanks to numerous Indianapolis blunders. For instance, the Colts came up with an interception of Marcus Mariota while up 20-13, but unnecessary roughness negated the turnover. The Titans maintained possession and managed to move the chains via a pair of pass-interference flags. Tennessee established a field-goal lead, and the Colts seemed willing to allow them to keep it, as Andrew Luck nearly threw an interception, though the ball was tipped and sailed into the arms of Doyle. A bit later, Luck threw a touchdown to T.Y. Hilton, but an illegal shift nullified it. Devin Street then came up with a big catch for a first down in the red zone, but was flagged for spinning the ball. It's ridiculous calls like these that are driving fans away, by the way. Roger Goodell needs to crack down on this, and he should consider getting rid of Jerome Boger, whose officiating crew bungled yet another NFL game. Luck ultimately found Doyle for what would be the decisive touchdown. The Titans still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Mariota was strip-sacked, and Robert Mathis returned the turnover for a touchdown.    Luck played extremely well, save for the near-interception. He finished 27-of-39 for 353 yards and 3 touchdowns, which is impressive considering that he endured countless drops to begin the game. Tennessee's secondary made things easy, however, as the team has major issues both at cornerback and safety. I have them addressing both spots in my .    Luck's touchdowns went to his only reliable players who happen to be healthy at the moment. Hilton caught 7 balls for 133 yards and should've had that second score. Frank Gore caught all 5 of his targets for 22 yards. And then there was Doyle, who had a huge performance, snatching 9 passes for 78 yards. Jack Doyle rules.    Gore, by the way, didn't do much on the ground. He was limited to 61 yards on 17 carries. The Titans have 1 of the top run defenses in the NFL, so this wasn't much of a surprise.    As for the Titans, Mariota didn't post as great of a stat line as his counterpart, though he didn't play poorly either. Mariota went 22-of-37 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and the lost fumble. As mentioned, he should've thrown an interception, but was bailed out by a Colts mistake.    Only 1 of Mariota's touchdowns went to a likely target. "

   "comment":"Jack Doyle on the play and Clinton-Dix again was the beneficiary. Luck would have been better off taking the sack or lofting it out of bounds. He needs to improve his decision-making if he wants to be a truly elite quarterback.    For most of the day, Luck relied on 3 receivers to do a brunt of the work. T.Y. Hilton (6-81) led the team in both catches and yardage. The speedy top option is still not at full health as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Still, his big-play ability makes him a high-upside WR1 week in and week out in fantasy. After Hilton, Jack Doyle (5-61) and Donte Moncrief (3-55, 1 TD) were the major producers. Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9. and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.    In terms of the running game, "

   "comment":"Jack Doyle's stat line. If you don't feel like scrolling down, he caught 12 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. I told you, worthless.    The Bengals came into this game as 10-point favorites, while the Colts were reeling after getting manhandled by the Jaguars 27-0, when quarterback Jacoby Brissett was sacked a whopping 10 times. The Bengals had also just lost badly to division rival Pittsburgh on the road, so back at home against a weak opponent was what the doctor ordered, that is, until the order got there and the Colts got a big helping of horse hoof in their guts. Thankfully for the Bengals, a last-minute transplant of the ball from the Colts' possession to the Bengals, gave them a much-needed win. This game started well for the Bengals, with 2 sacks of Brissett, forcing the punt, which set up a day of bad offensive line play from both teams. This includes special teams, as the Bengals blocked a punt to set up their first field goal and the Colts blocked a field goal a couple drives later. Brissett ended up getting sacked 4 times, while Dalton was sacked 3 times, but pressured more often than a poor Indianapolis pass rush should be able to accomplish.    The Colts' passing offense was dink and dunking their way all day, but effectively, as tight end Jack Doyle caught 12-of-14 targets for 121 yards and 1 touchdown. His second-most targeted receiver, "
