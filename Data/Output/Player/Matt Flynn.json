   "comment":"Matt Flynn, nearly threw a pick on his first throw. Flynn finished 2-of-5 for 6 yards.    With that in mind, we have to ask why the Packers didn't have a veteran backup quarterback in this situation. Flynn was completely shellshocked and unprepared to take the field. A veteran signal caller could have at least moved the chains and put Green Bay in favorable field position. Instead, the Packers were forced to punt after a 3.and-out, setting up Bryant's decisive kick.    Aaron Rodgers finished 14-of-27 for 165 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. One of the interceptions was the aforementioned Jackson gaff. Another came after Rodgers returned off his shoulder injury.

   "comment":"Matt Flynn to come back and send it into overtime. They gave the Packers a field goal - which didn't clinch a victory per the new rules - because of some defensive penalties. The Vikings were given 1 possession to tie or take the lead. They drove down the field, but stalled in the red zone, thanks to a Cordarrelle Patterson dropped touchdown. Faced with a 4.h-and-14 on the Green Bay 17-yard line, Minnesota kicked the tying field goal. I don't get it. There were 4 minutes remaining in overtime, so the likelihood of the Vikings generating another long drive were slim. Thus, they were essentially pretty much guaranteeing that there would be a tie. What's the point of a tie for Minnesota? Green Bay doesn't exactly mind it because the team is now just half a game behind Chicago and Detroit instead of being 1 back with a loss. But what does a tie do for the Vikings? They should have just gone for the touchdown. It would've been a win-win situation. Had they converted, it would've energized the team to perhaps spark a late run that could carry over into 2014. A loss would improve draft positioning. A tie does neither.    The Packers were able to come back with Matt Flynn. I don't understand how Flynn can play so terribly elsewhere, yet thrive in Green Bay.

Green Bay secured some garbage yardage to keep itself from setting a dubious historical mark.    After some early mistakes, Stafford was pretty sharp. He went 22-of-35 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns, 2 picks and the lost fumble.

Speaking of Megatron, he caught 6 balls for 101 yards and 1 of Stafford's 3 scores. The others were secured by Kevin Ogletree and Jeremy Ross.    Both Detroit running backs found the end zone as well. Bush atoned for the lost fumble, compiling 117 rushing yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to go along with 5 catches for 65 receiving yards. Joique Bell, meanwhile, gained 94 yards and a score on the ground on 19 attempts.    The Lions made some mistakes after their initial blunders. Stafford tossed that second pick - an end-zone shot in which Sam Shields covered Megatron extremely well - while Martin placed a second kickoff out of bounds. David Akers also inexplicably whiffed on a 31-yard field goal at the end of the first half. Again, these errors didn't matter because Green Bay's offense couldn't do anything. Flynn was awful. He went 10-of-20 for 139 yards and an interception, but that doesn't tell the whole story. He had another pick dropped and lost 2 fumbles. He also took a safety in the third quarter. I must note that Flynn had no chance. Detroit's monstrous defensive front dominated Green Bay's offensive line. Flynn was sacked 7 times through 3 quarters, including the safety by "
