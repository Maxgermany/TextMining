Despite this, Gary Kubiak showed an unbelievable amount of trust in Lynch, calling for passes on numerous plays while his team was attempting to run out the clock, including on a second-and-12 with 4:30 remaining, up only 7. Lynch actually scrambled twice in these instances, and he almost picked up the first down on a third-and-4.    With Lynch struggling, only 2 Bronco receivers accumulated more than 10 yards, which is just sad. Thomas led the way with 6 grabs for 61 yards, including a diving catch to put the team into field-goal range at the end of the first half. Sanders (3-28) was the recipient of numerous inaccurate passes.    "
