Marshall also grabbed 6 balls for 89 yards and a touchdown. Scheffler, playing with an injured groin, had 4 receptions and 92 yards.    While Crennel had some curious play-calls and decisions, Mike Shanahan also made some bone-headed moves. Shanahan called a quarterback scramble at the end of the first half with 12 seconds remaining and no timeouts left. Cutler failed to get out of bounds, and all the time ticked off the clock. Shanahan, however, made up for it with a brilliant play. Not even NFL.com could recognize it. Check it out:   "
