Nearly a third of Rivers' yardage went to Keenan Allen, who hauled in 14 of the 15 passes thrown to him for 157 yards. Unfortunately for Allen, he suffered a hip injury in the second half and never returned.    Believe it or not, Allen wasn't the team leader in targets. Gates held that distinction with 16. He reeled in 9 balls for 95 yards. Malcom Floyd matched that yardage total on 5 catches (12 targets).    Allen wasn't the only Charger who suffered an injury. Melvin Gordon also limped off. He actually returned to the game and promptly fumbled. I actually thought the Chargers were better off without Gordon because A) he's very fumble-prone, and B) Danny Woodhead is a more-efficient player. The Chargers apparently agreed because they didn't use Gordon in the second half. Woodhead had far fewer yards on an equal 7 rushes (29 to 8), but he was so much better as a weapon in the passing attack. He snatched 5 receptions for 63 yards. He also didn't cough up the ball.    Before I move on to the Packers, Rivers' touchdowns went to Ladarius Green (3-35) and Inman (3-18). Inman saw 7 targets, but isn't much of a fantasy option unless Allen and Stevie Johnson miss more time.    "

Melvin Gordon was close behind Inman, rushing 19 times for 36 yards and 2 touchdowns, plus adding 6 receptions for 43 yards. The 2 scores raised his total to 6 on the season, but his 1.9 yards-per-carry average against a bad New Orleans defense is not even close to good enough. The offensive line was hurting, but there were yards there for him. He actually looked much better in the receiving game, making a few guys miss after the catch. But in the end, his fumble that gave the ball back to the Saints in scoring position with 7 minutes left in the game was the biggest knock on him Sunday. He'll need to step his game up.

The Broncos accumulated just 15 first downs (compared to 21 by San Diego) and was outgained by 45 yards. Siemian barely completed half of his throws, going 20-of-38 for 276 yards, a lost fumble and his pick-six. As mentioned, he was very fortunate to get away with some potential interceptions, including another 1 going back for a touchdown. He was very lucky that this wasn't a complete disaster for him.

Josh Lambo missed a 54-yard field goal on the final play of the half, and the Chargers led 14-7 at intermission. Houston had a drive going into San Diego territory before Lamar Miller fumbled for the first time this season thanks to a hit by Dwight Lowery. The loose ball was recovered by the Chargers at their own 21-yard line. They gave it back shortly later, however, after Demps intercepted an errant pass at the San Diego 38. The Texans got inside the 5-yard line, but settled for a field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Rivers led a drive, with Inman making receptions of 25 and 11 yards, to set up a short touchdown toss to Hunter Henry (2-20-1)."
