   "comment":"Dugan - not Adrian Peterson - and failed. Peterson also lost 2 fumbles, including 1 in the end zone that resulted in a touchback.    Despite those fumbles, Peterson still had a dominant performance, gaining 133 yards and 2 scores on just 18 carries.    Sidney Rice simply cannot be contained. The third-year wideout had 7 grabs for 201 yards. Meanwhile, Percy Harvin, Visanthe Shiancoe and Bernard Berrian each had 3 catches for 53, 43 and 22 yards, respectively.    As for Brett Favre, the old veteran went 20-of-29 for 344 yards and a touchdown to Dugan. Think the Lions will be happy when this guy finally retires?    "
