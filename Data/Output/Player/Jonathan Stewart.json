His first interception was particularly ugly, as he lobbed the ball into quadruple coverage in the end zone. Moore could have easily tossed a 4.h interception, but the Giants dropped it in the second quarter. Unfortunately for Moore (and perhaps fortunately for the Panthers), Moore suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. "

   "comment":"Jonathan Stewart in the end zone later in the period. Cowboys: Doug Free was whistled for a false start on a 3rd-and-4 in Carolina territory after halftime. Dallas consequently failed to convert in longer yardage. Panthers: Carolina did the same thing in a 3rd-and-10. Cowboys: Jay Ratliff's personal foul and Brandon Carr's defensive holding helped the Panthers score a touchdown. Dez Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97). Newton, meanwhile, was 21-of-37 for 233 yards, 1 touchdown to Brandon LaFell (4-53) and the aforementioned pick. One thing that really bothers me is that Newton is barely running in the red zone. He did scramble 6 times for 64 yards, but none of this came deep in Dallas territory. After the game, a sullen Newton told the media that he's demanding change. I'm not sure what sort of change, but it appears as though he's defeated mentally.    Of the receivers who didn't score a touchdown, Steve Smith (7-83) was best. Jason Witten (6-44) was just OK. Dez Bryant (2-14), however, disappointed. He appeared to suffer a concussion but reentered the game and dropped a touchdown. This was a very disappointing outing, as Bryant continued to show the inconsistency that has plagued him throughout his career thus far.    As mentioned, both running games were sluggish. Felix Jones, expected to gash Carolina's poor defense, gained just 44 yards on 15 carries. Jonathan Stewart, meanwhile, ran for 35 yards on only 10 attempts. "

Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

As for the Jaguars, Bortles was anemic, going 22-of-40 for just 183 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The huge liability at left tackle really hurt him, but aside from a couple of impressive drives, he was woeful. His first pass was a poor overthrow, which was a sign of how the afternoon would go. One of the picks was taken back for 6. as he telegraphed the throw. The other happened because he was hit as he released the ball. He also took some bad sacks. A few weren't his fault, as Young looked like a human turnstile, but Bortles struggled to release the ball quickly enough.    Bortles' supporting cast didn't help him. I mentioned the offensive line on numerous occasions already, but the receivers let him down as well. "

   "comment":"Jonathan Stewart took off on a 36-yard run with a great block from tight end Greg Olsen. Newton threw a bullet on the next play to Philly Brown at the Eagles' 1-yard line. Mike Tolbert pounded the ball into the end zone from there to give the Panthers a quick lead. Philadelphia promptly set up another score as Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing "

   "comment":"Jonathan Stewart led the way for the Panthers. He saw 14 carries and was able to turn them into 68 yards. Stewart found holes in the defense, and his offensive line did a good job of blocking the Patriots' weak defensive line. Rookie Christian McCaffrey only got 16 yards on 6 carries. He struggled to fight through stronger defenders close to the line of scrimmage, but showed promise in the passing game (4 catches, 33 yards).    Newton's top receiver in this contest was Funchess. The former second-round pick saw a team-high 9 targets and turned them into 7 catches for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns. Funchess displayed much better route-running skills than he has demonstrated in the past and was able to make catches over the Patriots' defensive backs thanks to his size. Funchess is a player who should be added in fantasy, as he will be the team's No. 2 receiver and receive a lot of targets. He could end up being a WR3 if he continues to improve. "

   "comment":"Jonathan Stewart's hands. A third interception sailed over the head of Kelvin Benjamin when Newton was trying a desperation comeback late in the 4.h quarter.    Wentz finished 16-of-30 for 222 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had his aforementioned early struggles, but caught fire with Kuechly off the field. He did a great job of converting third-and-long situations again, including a third-and-10 connection in which he stepped up in the pocket amid pressure. This ultimately led to a touchdown. Wentz's only real error, aside from his lost fumble, was not seeing an open Nelson Agholor to convert a first down to ice the game. Luckily for him, the defense did a great job on Newton.    Ertz had a tough matchup going into this game, as Carolina is excellent against tight ends. That changed with Kuechly out, as Ertz was able to score twice. He caught 2 balls for 18 yards. The other touchdown was caught by Agholor (4-55). Alshon Jeffery, meanwhile, finally had an easy matchup. He hauled in 4 balls for 71 yards, leading the team with 10 targets.    The Eagles ran the ball well for the most part; LeGarrette Blount did a good job of moving the pile and getting yards after contact. He mustered 67 yards on 14 carries. He also found the end zone on a 2.point conversion.    As for the Panthers, Newton struggled with the 3 turnovers, as his offensive line couldn't hold up against Philadelphia's elite defensive front. Cox's return had a major impact, and Newton frequently found himself under duress even though the Eagles seldom blitzed. Newton went 28-of-52 for only 239 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, Newton was able to scramble 11 times for 71 yards and a touchdown on the ground.    Christian McCaffrey was a big part of the passing offense, catching 10 passes for 56 receiving yards and Newton's sole aerial touchdown. However, he didn't do much on the ground, getting 4 carries for 8 yards. Still, he was way more effective than Jonathan Stewart, who somehow had minus-4 yards on 8 attempts on top of his drop that resulted in an interception. Stewart was hit in the backfield almost every single time he touched the ball, and it seemed like a wasted down every time the Panthers tried to involve him. Carolina needs to move away from Stewart, as he's slowing down the offense. Perhaps the coaching staff will figure that out with the extra time off this upcoming week.    Benjamin nearly hit the century mark, catching 9 balls for 99 yards. He would have gotten there had he not dropped a pass in the second half. Benjamin was the only Panther non-running back to be productive, as "
