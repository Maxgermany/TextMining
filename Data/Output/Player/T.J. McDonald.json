   "comment":"T.J. McDonald sack helped produce a punt, Tavon Austin (1-15 receiving, 3-25 rushing) ripped off a 41-yard return. However, Austin deflected a high screen pass, and it was intercepted by Giants rookie defensive end Kerry Winn. That resulted in another field goal. New York soon put together an 11-play drive that ended with Orleans Darkwa (4-21) darting into the end zone with a 12-yard score. The Rams answered with Kenny Britt (9-103) making a super leaping catch for 27 yards. Tre Mason (13-76) finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run. On the Giants' next possession, Alec Ogletree hit Beckham late out of bounds after a screen pass, which caused a huge fight to break out between the 2 teams. New York's Damontre Moore and Preston Parker were kicked out, while St. Louis' William Hayes was also ejected. The Rams tacked on another field goal before the half. In the third quarter, Andre Williams (26-110) ripped off a 45-yard run that saw him run over a safety and pick up another 15 yards. Manning finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Randle. The Rams answered with a scoring drive that ended with a 23-yard scoring pass to Lance Kendricks (2-35). Beckham quickly restored the Giants lead to 14, as he burned St. Louis safety Mark Barron on a double move to get wide open for an 80-yard touchdown pass. That pretty much ended the game for New York. With 4 minutes remaining, Shaun Hill found Chris Givens (1-47) wide open in busted coverage for a 47-yard touchdown.    The Giants' passing offense looked awesome. Manning was the star of the game, as he was 25-of-32 for 391 yards with 3 touchdowns. Beckham made 8 receptions for 148 yards and 2 scores, while Randle hauled in 6 passes for 132 yards and a score. Surprisingly, New York only allowed 1 sack, and that was to safety T.J. McDonald beating Williams on a blitz.    Hill had a solid performance, completing 24-of-32 for 290 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't completely his fault. He just couldn't keep pace with New York's offense.    The Giants' defense got a good game out of "
