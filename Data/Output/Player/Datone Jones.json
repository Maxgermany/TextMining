   "comment":"Jones on a slant that he broke down the field for a 39-yard gain. DeMarcus Ware and Orlando Scandrick had a sack, but Mason Crosby hit a 27-yard field goal to tie it. DeMarco Murray soon ripped off a 41-yard run up the middle, and a pass to Dez Bryant set up Bailey's second 3-pointer. Romo went down the seam to Jason Witten (4-71) for a 25-yard touchdown in the final seconds of the first quarter. Flynn threw a pick to Sterling Moore, and Bailey ended up with 2 more field goals before halftime. Romo hit a slant and go to Bryant for 37 yards. A few plays later, Murray charged into the end zone from a yard out for a 26-3 lead. Settling for all those field goals came back to bite Dallas. On the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Eddie Lacy took off on a 60-yard run. That led to Jordy Nelson (5-61) outfighting Orlando Scandrick on a jump ball for a touchdown. After another Bailey field goal, the Packers got 6 more with Flynn leading a drive. He connected with Andrew Quarless on a short slant for the score. Datone Jones and Clay Matthews sacked Romo on a third down just in front of the end zone."

He caught 6 of his 11 targets for 109 yards, highlighted by a juggling, diving catch at the end of the third quarter to set up a Green Bay score.    Linsley wasn't the only Packer who left the game with an injury. Davante Adams exited with an ankle. He had 3 catches for 36 yards. He, Jones, Cobb and Starks (1 catch, 30 yards) were the only Green Bay players who accumulated more than 10 receiving yards.    I mentioned that Lacy was a positive sign for the Packers. An even better 1 was the play of their defense. They absolutely swarmed "
