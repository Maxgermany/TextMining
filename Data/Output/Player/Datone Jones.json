   "comment":"Datone Jones racking up a pair of sacks. Green Bay also dominated the trenches in respect to the ground game. Adrian Peterson scored a touchdown, but was limited to 45 yards on 13 carries otherwise. Peterson also lost a fumble in the red zone during the 4.h quarter, which was a crushing blow for the Vikings, as they were just about a dozen yards away from trimming the margin to a 1.score game.    As for Bridgewater, he went 25-of-37 for 296 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled 4 times for 43 rushing yards. The numbers were fine, but Bridgewater didn't have an opportunity to keep drives alive because of all the sacks he took. He was very sharp early, converting some third-and-long situations, but he never was the same when he took a crushing blow on a sack late in the second quarter. Bridgewater missed just a couple of snaps, but he wasn't as effective after the jarring hit.    Bridgewater targeted Kyle Rudolph and Stefon Diggs the most, throwing the ball to them 9 times each. Rudolph surprisingly had a big outing, reeling in 6 receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. Diggs, meanwhile, also caught 6 balls, but for only 66 yards. Mike Wallace, meanwhile, didn't catch a single pass, thanks in part to a crucial drop that would've moved the chains on the opening drive.    I received an e-mail from someone who suggested that this was 1 of the most fixed games of the year. I could get behind that, as Walt Coleman was either very incompetent or corrupt. It seemed like the Vikings were flagged for offensive holding on almost every drive. There were also bogus defensive holding calls, and on 1 instance, Datone Jones somehow wasn't flagged for spiking the ball right after sacking Bridgewater. All of the major penalties went against the Vikings, who never had a chance with such biased officiating. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
