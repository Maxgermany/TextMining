DeMarcus Ware and Orlando Scandrick had a sack, but Mason Crosby hit a 27-yard field goal to tie it. DeMarco Murray soon ripped off a 41-yard run up the middle, and a pass to Dez Bryant set up Bailey's second 3.pointer. Romo went down the seam to Jason Witten (4-71) for a 25-yard touchdown in the final seconds of the first quarter. Flynn threw a pick to Sterling Moore, and Bailey ended up with 2 more field goals before halftime. Romo hit a slant and go to Bryant for 37 yards. A few plays later, Murray charged into the end zone from a yard out for a 26-3 lead. Settling for all those field goals came back to bite Dallas. On the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Eddie Lacy took off on a 60-yard run. That led to Jordy Nelson (5-61) outfighting Orlando Scandrick on a jump ball for a touchdown. After another Bailey field goal, the Packers got 6 more with Flynn leading a drive. He connected with Andrew Quarless on a short slant for the score. Datone Jones and Clay Matthews sacked Romo on a third down just in front of the end zone."

   "comment":"Datone Jones racking up a pair of sacks. Green Bay also dominated the trenches in respect to the ground game. Adrian Peterson scored a touchdown, but was limited to 45 yards on 13 carries otherwise. Peterson also lost a fumble in the red zone during the 4.h quarter, which was a crushing blow for the Vikings, as they were just about a dozen yards away from trimming the margin to a 1.score game.    As for Bridgewater, he went 25-of-37 for 296 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled 4 times for 43 rushing yards. The numbers were fine, but Bridgewater didn't have an opportunity to keep drives alive because of all the sacks he took. He was very sharp early, converting some third-and-long situations, but he never was the same when he took a crushing blow on a sack late in the second quarter. Bridgewater missed just a couple of snaps, but he wasn't as effective after the jarring hit.    Bridgewater targeted Kyle Rudolph and Stefon Diggs the most, throwing the ball to them 9 times each. Rudolph surprisingly had a big outing, reeling in 6 receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. Diggs, meanwhile, also caught 6 balls, but for only 66 yards. Mike Wallace, meanwhile, didn't catch a single pass, thanks in part to a crucial drop that would've moved the chains on the opening drive.    I received an e-mail from someone who suggested that this was 1 of the most fixed games of the year. I could get behind that, as Walt Coleman was either very incompetent or corrupt. It seemed like the Vikings were flagged for offensive holding on almost every drive. There were also bogus defensive holding calls, and on 1 instance, Datone Jones somehow wasn't flagged for spiking the ball right after sacking Bridgewater. All of the major penalties went against the Vikings, who never had a chance with such biased officiating. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Jones, who had a tremendous performance. He caught 6 of his 11 targets for 109 yards, highlighted by a juggling, diving catch at the end of the third quarter to set up a Green Bay score.    Linsley wasn't the only Packer who left the game with an injury. Davante Adams exited with an ankle. He had 3 catches for 36 yards. He, Jones, Cobb and Starks (1 catch, 30 yards) were the only Green Bay players who accumulated more than 10 receiving yards.    I mentioned that Lacy was a positive sign for the Packers. An even better 1 was the play of their defense. They absolutely swarmed "
