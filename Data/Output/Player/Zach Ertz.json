The Redskins, meanwhile, had chances to make this a close game, but lost because of stupidity by both the coach and quarterback. Jay Gruden made a dumb decision when he didn't call timeout at the end of the first half with a Dallas punt upcoming. The Redskins could've tried for a block or a nice return, but Gruden's not capable of this sort of sharp thinking. Griffin, meanwhile, was absolutely terrible. He had some long completions that were actually short or intermediate passes that his receivers took for big gains. That includes "

   "comment":"Zach Ertz. However, the Eagles, in an attempt to save their season, played a clean second half versus an incompetent New Orleans defense. Bradford finished with great numbers, going 32-of-45 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 interceptions. He's an obvious sell-high, as the Saints were discombobulated throughout the second half. A prime example of this was when Sean Payton and Rob Ryan wasted a timeout because the stop unit couldn't line up properly in the red zone. Despite this, the Eagles scored a touchdown on the very next play following the irrelevant stoppage. The Saints surrendered 519 yet yards of offense. It continues to be perplexing as to why Ryan wasn't fired in the offseason. He has no answers, and he and Payton still aren't getting along.    Philadelphia actually ran the ball effectively for the first time. The hapless Saints made that happen, surrendering 83 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to the previously struggling DeMarco Murray. He was still guilty of going east-west too much because of poor blocking on some occasions, and Ryan Mathews once again looked better. Mathews nearly had the same rushing total (73) and a touchdown on only 8 attempts. Both backs chipped in as pass-catchers. Murray logged 7 receptions for 37 yards, while Mathews snagged all 3 of his targets for 23 yards.    Bradford's touchdowns went to Josh Huff (4-78), who scored when 2 Saints collided with each other, and Brent Celek (3-44). It wasn't a surprise to see both Celek and Zach Ertz (5-60) have strong afternoons, given how much New Orleans has struggled versus tight ends this year.    As for Bradford's primary receivers, both "

   "comment":"Zach Ertz helped him by making some great catches, and thanks to a couple of Baltimore defensive penalties, Wentz scrambled into the end zone on a 4-yard run. It appeared as though the game would go to overtime, but the Eagles opted to go for 2. They failed to convert, but it ultimately didn't matter in the grand scheme of things because Philadelphia was already out of playoff contention. The only impact it had was the Browns' draft positioning improving, but Cleveland will likely squander that pick anyway. Wentz had that great drive, but as mentioned, he struggled otherwise. He finished 22-of-42 for 170 yards and an interception to go along with 8 rushing yards and his score on the ground. He was also strip-sacked, but was fortunate that the ball trickled out of bounds. Fierce winds, poor protection and horrible receivers all betrayed Wentz. In fact, the Eagles were down to their fifth-string right tackle, "

   "comment":"Zach Ertz. That tied things up. Following another quick drive by the Eagles, the Giants were able to take their first lead of the season. Sterling Shepard caught a 77-yard touchdown from Manning that gave the team a 21-14 lead with just 7 minutes left to go. But the Eagles would drive to tie it. After exchanging field goals, the game looked destined to be heading to overtime. Then, Jake Elliott happened. Elliott, the rookie kicker who had replaced an injured Caleb Sturgis just a week ago, was given a chance to kick a 61-yard field goal to clinch the win for the Eagles. The choice was not too surprising, given that Doug Pederson had been aggressive in going for it on 4.h down in multiple occasions in the contest. Still, handing the game over to a rookie for the longest kick of his life was risky, but it paid off.    Though the Eagles won, they still had a mediocre performance for most of the contest. Part of the the problem was their offense's lack of ability to consistently move the ball. Carson Wentz had his worst performance of the 2017 season and definitely didn't look great. He held onto the ball too long against the Giants' stellar pass rush, and he took 3 sacks as a result. The pressures occurred early in the game and seemed to get him out of rhythm. Wentz went 21-of-31 for 176 yards and a touchdown, but had issues with his downfield accuracy during the contest. He couldn't hit Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and "

   "comment":"Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery, setting up a touchdown. Following a poor Arizona drive, Kenjon Barner took a punt deep into Cardinals' territory to set up another score. On Philadelphia's next possession, Torrey Smith finally didn't drop a deep pass, hauling in a 59-yard touchdown. The Eagles sputtered a bit after that through the end of the opening half, but they put the clamps on Arizona following intermission, outscoring them 13-0 in the second half.    Wentz was excellent, going 21-of-30 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half, which was a deep shot into the end zone. Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to Nelson Agholor (4-93), Smith (3-70), Zach Ertz (6-61) and Trey Burton (2-16)."
