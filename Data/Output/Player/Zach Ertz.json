In addition to the interceptions, he overthrew LeSean McCoy on a third-and-long and once again passed too high toward Huff. He also took some bad sacks.

The Redskins, meanwhile, had chances to make this a close game, but lost because of stupidity by both the coach and quarterback. Jay Gruden made a dumb decision when he didn't call timeout at the end of the first half with a Dallas punt upcoming. The Redskins could've tried for a block or a nice return, but Gruden's not capable of this sort of sharp thinking. Griffin, meanwhile, was absolutely terrible. He had some long completions that were actually short or intermediate passes that his receivers took for big gains. That includes "

   "comment":"Ertz, which Sean Lee was able to intercept easily. On a key third down a bit later, Bradford's pass was way behind Nelson Agholor, though it's possible that the rookie receiver ran the wrong route. It was so ugly that it was difficult to tell what happened. With all that being said, I wouldn't panic on Bradford just yet. He has an easy matchup next week against the Jets, who may not have Antonio Cromartie, so he could rebound with a decent fantasy performance. However, it's difficult to justify starting him at this point until he shows that he can do something outside of garbage time. The offensive line is a huge issue, and if Bradford has to keep operating in long-yardage situations, the Eagles will be in trouble. Bradford led the team in rushing yardage (9) in this game, for crying out loud.    Jordan Matthews struggled as well. The stats may not show it, as Matthews secured 6 balls for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came late, and Matthews dropped several passes, including a third down early in the game. He'll continue to be a strong fantasy option, but he needs to improve in real life.    Agholor, who may have botched an aforementioned play, caught 3 of 6 targets for 31 yards. He was a bigger part of the offense this week, but he's not anywhere near the fantasy radar yet, especially with Bradford and the blocking struggling.    Two other Eagles that need to be mentioned: Ertz saw 7 targets, but reeled in just 3 grabs for 17 yards. Bradford was also intercepted while throwing the ball to him in the end zone. "

Bradford finished with great numbers, going 32-of-45 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 interceptions. He's an obvious sell-high, as the Saints were discombobulated throughout the second half. A prime example of this was when Sean Payton and Rob Ryan wasted a timeout because the stop unit couldn't line up properly in the red zone. Despite this, the Eagles scored a touchdown on the very next play following the irrelevant stoppage. The Saints surrendered 519 yet yards of offense. It continues to be perplexing as to why Ryan wasn't fired in the offseason. He has no answers, and he and Payton still aren't getting along.    Philadelphia actually ran the ball effectively for the first time. The hapless Saints made that happen, surrendering 83 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to the previously struggling DeMarco Murray. He was still guilty of going east-west too much because of poor blocking on some occasions, and Ryan Mathews once again looked better. Mathews nearly had the same rushing total (73) and a touchdown on only 8 attempts. Both backs chipped in as pass-catchers. Murray logged 7 receptions for 37 yards, while Mathews snagged all 3 of his targets for 23 yards.    Bradford's touchdowns went to Josh Huff (4-78), who scored when 2 Saints collided with each other, and Brent Celek (3-44). It wasn't a surprise to see both Celek and Zach Ertz (5-60) have strong afternoons, given how much New Orleans has struggled versus tight ends this year.

Riley Cooper dropped a potential 40-yard reception, and then Chip Kelly compounded the mistake by throwing the challenge flag. Drops weren't the only issue. Ertz had a big game - 13 catches, 122 yards - but he lost a fumble in the second quarter that set up the Redskins with a field goal. It seemed like Ertz's shin was down - the 2 CBS announcers and Mike Carey believed this to be true - but senile official Walt Coleman is too incompetent to overturn anything. The fact that Coleman is still officiating despite being mentality incapable of doing so is a complete embarrassment. At any rate, the Eagles had a sequence where they were flagged for illegal substitution on a special-teams trick play. A 5-yard penalty on an illegal formation pushed them back, and a false start moved them to first-and-20. "

   "comment":"Ertz.    The Eagles opened up with a 54-yard DeMarco Murray touchdown run. It was hilarious, as Murray actually went north-south instead of east-west, which Kelly took criticism for. Kelly had absolutely no clue how to utilize his high-priced free-agent signing, and it took just 1 play for the other Philadelphia coaches to figure it out. The Giants did a better job on Murray for the rest of the afternoon, as Murray was restricted to 69 yards and that touchdown on 12 carries, thanks to some poor blocking. Darren Sproles (3-24) also found the end zone.    As for Philadelphia's aerial attack, I mentioned that the Giants had no idea how to cover Ertz. The young tight end converted all 9 of his targets for 152 yards, and he was wide open on most of his receptions. New York has struggled against tight ends all year, so this was hardly a surprise. The Giants need to make some serious upgrades to their defense this offseason. Check out my to see whom I have them taking.    Thanks to the Giants' inept secondary, "

   "comment":"Ertz was guilty of a drop. Still, it didn't really matter, as Philadelphia needed 2 scores to overcome the 27-17 deficit.    There was 1 other glaring mismatch in the Redskins' favor. With Leodis McKelvin out, backup Jalen Mills had to cover DeSean Jackson. Kirk Cousins took advantage of this liability in the early going, as Jackson accumulated 51 receiving yards in the first quarter alone. Jackson only caught 1 pass after than (4 receptions, 55 yards), but that was part Cousins being inconsistent and part Jackson's ineptitude; Jackson dropped a touchdown at 1 point, though the Redskins ultimately found the end zone on the same drive. Speaking of Cousins, he struggled to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-34 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that happened to be a pick-six; Cousins launched the turnover off his back foot while under pressure. He panicked, and it was the sort of blunder Cousins has been guilty of far too often. Cousins was just 6-of-14 in the second half with a pass that was nearly intercepted in the end zone, as his inaccuracy allowed the Eagles to hang around. Fortunately for the Redskins, Philadelphia couldn't muster anything offensively, so it didn't matter at all.    Both of Cousins' touchdowns went to the players replacing Jordan Reed's production: Jamison Crowder (3-52) and Vernon Davis (2-50). Pierre Garcon led the Redskins in receiving; he caught 6 passes for 77 yards.    The Eagles had no answer for Matt Jones. He gashed them for 135 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. That includes a 57-yard burst at the end of the game to seal the victory for the Redskins. Robert Kelley (5-59) looked good in his brief action, and I think he could do a good job of handling the workload in the event of a Jones injury.    Going back to the Eagles, their 14 points came on Cousins' pick-six and Wendell Smallwood's kickoff return. Smallwood's score was actually the first kickoff return touchdown in the entire NFL this season. Roger Goodell has done a good job of taking the fun out of the game with his asinine kickoff rules.    Only 2 Eagles caught multiple passes: Jordan Matthews (3-75) and Nelson Agholor (3-34). Ertz (1-22), as mentioned, was guilty of a horrible drop.    Because of Philadelphia's early deficit, the team couldn't establish the run. In fact, "

   "comment":"Ertz (10-112). Wentz was able to pick apart the Redskins' porous secondary. He threw a nice deep ball to Nelson Agholor, at 1 point, that would have gone for a touchdown if it was not for a blatant pass interference by Quinton Dunbar. The only big mistake that Wentz made was a pick in the end zone. In the first half, the Eagles were driving and had all the momentum against the Redskins. They were facing a third-and-goal when Wentz threw a ball over the middle. Safety Deshazor Everett managed to get in front of the receiver and picked it off. It was not a bad throw from Wentz, but he has to show better decision-making as he continues to develop.    Wentz was able to do a lot despite having only 1 proven receiver. Ertz led the way in targets (13), catches (10) and yards (112) during the game. He could end up being a big fantasy performer down the stretch, though the Redskins have been notoriously bad against tight ends this year.    "

   "comment":"Ertz helped him by making some great catches, and thanks to a couple of Baltimore defensive penalties, Wentz scrambled into the end zone on a 4-yard run. It appeared as though the game would go to overtime, but the Eagles opted to go for 2. They failed to convert, but it ultimately didn't matter in the grand scheme of things because Philadelphia was already out of playoff contention. The only impact it had was the Browns' draft positioning improving, but Cleveland will likely squander that pick anyway. Wentz had that great drive, but as mentioned, he struggled otherwise. He finished 22-of-42 for 170 yards and an interception to go along with 8 rushing yards and his score on the ground. He was also strip-sacked, but was fortunate that the ball trickled out of bounds. Fierce winds, poor protection and horrible receivers all betrayed Wentz. In fact, the Eagles were down to their fifth-string right tackle, Isaac Seumalo, who is a natural guard. Seumalo got banged up in the game, as he was slow to get up on Wentz's interception.    Ertz was great on the final drive, and he played well overall, catching 6 passes for 80 yards. In fact, Ertz was the only Eagle with more than 30 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Ertz. That tied things up. Following another quick drive by the Eagles, the Giants were able to take their first lead of the season. Sterling Shepard caught a 77-yard touchdown from Manning that gave the team a 21-14 lead with just 7 minutes left to go. But the Eagles would drive to tie it. After exchanging field goals, the game looked destined to be heading to overtime. Then, Jake Elliott happened. Elliott, the rookie kicker who had replaced an injured Caleb Sturgis just a week ago, was given a chance to kick a 61-yard field goal to clinch the win for the Eagles. The choice was not too surprising, given that Doug Pederson had been aggressive in going for it on 4.h down in multiple occasions in the contest. Still, handing the game over to a rookie for the longest kick of his life was risky, but it paid off.    Though the Eagles won, they still had a mediocre performance for most of the contest. Part of the the problem was their offense's lack of ability to consistently move the ball. Carson Wentz had his worst performance of the 2017 season and definitely didn't look great. He held onto the ball too long against the Giants' stellar pass rush, and he took 3 sacks as a result. The pressures occurred early in the game and seemed to get him out of rhythm. Wentz went 21-of-31 for 176 yards and a touchdown, but had issues with his downfield accuracy during the contest. He couldn't hit Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and "

   "comment":"Ertz and Alshon Jeffery, setting up a touchdown. Following a poor Arizona drive, Kenjon Barner took a punt deep into Cardinals' territory to set up another score. On Philadelphia's next possession, Torrey Smith finally didn't drop a deep pass, hauling in a 59-yard touchdown. The Eagles sputtered a bit after that through the end of the opening half, but they put the clamps on Arizona following intermission, outscoring them 13-0 in the second half.    Wentz was excellent, going 21-of-30 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half, which was a deep shot into the end zone. Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to Nelson Agholor (4-93), Smith (3-70), Zach Ertz (6-61) and Trey Burton (2-16)."

   "comment":"Ertz, immediately following a Luke Kuechly concussion. Kuechly was lost for the entire game, and that had a profound impact on this result. The Eagles were so much more effective offensively following halftime, gaining 188 yards compared to 122 in the opening 2 quarters, and their yards-per-play average rose to 5.2 compared to the 4.3 figure they maintained at halftime. Meanwhile, the Panthers continued to turn the ball over. Newton had a second pick that bounced off Jonathan Stewart's hands. A third interception sailed over the head of Kelvin Benjamin when Newton was trying a desperation comeback late in the 4.h quarter.    Wentz finished 16-of-30 for 222 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had his aforementioned early struggles, but caught fire with Kuechly off the field. He did a great job of converting third-and-long situations again, including a third-and-10 connection in which he stepped up in the pocket amid pressure. This ultimately led to a touchdown. Wentz's only real error, aside from his lost fumble, was not seeing an open Nelson Agholor to convert a first down to ice the game. Luckily for him, the defense did a great job on Newton.    Ertz had a tough matchup going into this game, as Carolina is excellent against tight ends. That changed with Kuechly out, as Ertz was able to score twice. He caught 2 balls for 18 yards. The other touchdown was caught by Agholor (4-55). "
