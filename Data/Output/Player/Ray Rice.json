These are just some of the examples of how the Ravens screwed up.    That said, give the Giants a lot of credit for showing up in a pretty meaningless game. Earth, Wind and Fire were amazing; the 3 backs totaled 210 rushing yards on 31 carries on the league's top-ranked rush defense. Ahmad Bradshaw paced the team with 96 yards; Jacobs, who totaled 73 himself, found the end zone twice; Ward had only 41 rushing yards, but he led the squad with 54 receiving yards.    With Earth, Wind and Fire debacling Baltimore's suddenly pathetic stop unit, Eli Manning didn't really have to do much. He was 13-of-23 for 153 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Plaxico Burress led all wideouts with 3 receptions and 47 yards. For the first time in 4 weeks, Kevin Boss didn't score.    Coming into this game, Flacco was doing a great job of playing error-free football since getting blown out at Indianapolis. However, his inner rookie quarterback manifested itself, as he tossed 2 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, and maintained a disturbing YPA of 4.9. It should be noted that 1 of the picks wasn't Flacco's fault, as the ball bounced out of his receiver's hands.    Though Flacco led the team in rushing (57 yards), that's not a good thing. Ray Rice and Willis McGahee combined for just 37 rushing yards on 17 carries."

   "comment":"Rice had a 20-yard run down to the Colts 28 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but fumbled it away. - All of Baltimore's penalties were costly, either negating a turnover, a crucial first down, or a possession deep in Indianapolis territory. The officiating was seemed 1-sided, and I can only hope that the refs will donate some of their Colts winnings to Haiti relief.    I may have lost 5 units on this game, but I wouldn't say I had the wrong side. Of course, you have ignorant announcers like Dan Dierdorf saying, Hwa hwa hwa hwa, looks like the Colts knew what they were doing when they rested their starters, hwa hwa hwa hwa. Well, this was the first time Indianapolis had ever won - let alone covered - when coming off rest in Weeks 17 and 18. And I don't think the Colts played all that well; outside of 2 offensive drives in the second quarter, they mustered just 136 total yards of offense, and for the entire game, they only outgained the Ravens by 5 yards (275-270). If Baltimore didn't commit all of those dumb, careless errors, they could have easily won this matchup.    Peyton Manning completed 30-of-44 passes, but for only 246 yards. That YPA (5.6) is very telling, as Manning just dinked and dunked on most of his throws. He attempted some deep balls, but missed his targets. Manning threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, though only 1 pick counted because of a questionable pass interference call on an uncatchable ball.    The Colts struggled to run the ball. Joseph Addai led the team with 11 carries and 23 yards. He left the game in the first half with an injury, but returned in the fourth quarter.    Think the Ravens will be searching for some offensive weapons for Joe Flacco (20-35, 189, 2 INTs) this offseason? Of the 270 yards they compiled on offense, 191 of it came from Ray Rice and Derrick Mason."

All of Rice's yardage was hard-fought, and he ran really well despite the low YPC.

   "comment":"Rice run) and then fumbled the ball away on the ensuing trip. It wasn't better after intermission. On Baltimore's first possession, Derrick Mason tripped on his route on third down, forcing the Ravens into yet another short field goal. Fortunately for the Ravens, they were able to cover the enormous 12-point spread with 2 fourth-quarter pick-sixes.    The Panthers were simply overmatched, as they started their fourth-string quarterback and running back. Brian St. Pierre, who was a stay-at-home dad last week, went 13-of-28 for 173 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-sixes. He also should have thrown several more interceptions (Terrell Suggs missed an easy 1.) Most of St. Pierre's yardage came on 1 88-yard touchdown to David Gettis.    Poor Steve Smith had just 4 catches for 46 yards. He's wasting away on this miserable Carolina team.    Mike Goodson once again posted great fantasy numbers, rushing for 120 yards on 22 carries.    Joe Flacco was amazing, going 24-of-33 for 301 yards and a touchdown. At halftime, he was 16-of-18 for 213 yards and the score; it's a shame the Panthers couldn't keep up because Flacco could have posted career numbers.    Ray Rice didn't have great rushing numbers (19-65), but collected 131 total yards and a score.   "

   "comment":"Rice had just 6 carries at halftime (17 yards), while Joe Flacco threw the ball 19 times in the same span amid a close contest. Cam Cameron seemed to be up to his old tricks, so someone must have threatened him during intermission because Baltimore came out running. A 59-yard scamper later, and the Ravens were able to kick a field goal after stalling inside the Cincinnati 5-yard line. The 3 points made it a 2-possession game, which, at the time, seemed to put this game away for Baltimore because the Bengals had issues moving the chains.    Andy Dalton definitely didn't look like himself early on with A.J. Green out of the lineup. This was extremely apparent when Dalton attempted a 45-yard heave into the end zone during the second quarter. Green caught such a pass for a touchdown against the Steelers, but Andre Caldwell didn't have nearly as much success. Ed Reed picked off the pass. However, Dalton caught fire in the fourth quarter and was able to finish 24-of-45, 373 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He made some really great throws and was a Calvin Johnson rule away from tying the game. The Bengals lost both contests against Baltimore and Pittsburgh, but their fan base really has to be thrilled with Dalton. He's just going to get better.    Dalton's 1 score went to Caldwell (3-63), but Jerome Simpson was the 1 who picked up the slack in the wake of Green's absence. Simpson hauled in 8 balls for a whopping 152 yards.    As for the Ravens, Flacco continued to be inconsistent. He led the Ravens to just 1 first down in the first quarter and had a botched handoff with his running back. The offense as a whole just looked really sloppy. But in the ensuing quarter, he started connecting on deep bombs to Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. Flacco's success wouldn't last, however. He fired an ugly interception right before halftime. But when things looked bleak, he hit Torrey Smith (6-165, TD) for a perfect 38-yard touchdown strike.    Rice finished with 20 carries and was able to churn out 104 rushing yards and 2 scores. He also caught 5 balls for 43 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Rice and Ricky Williams combined for nearly 300 rushing yards in a meeting 4 weeks ago. The Browns did a much better job versus the run this time, limiting both backs. Rice had 87 yards on 23 attempts, while Williams tallied 45 yards on 10 tries. Rice was kept out of the end zone on the ground, but scored on a 42-yard reception (most of the yardage came through the air). He had 3 catches in total for 48 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Rice scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown immediately afterward. That seemed to shut the door on Cincinnati's playoff hopes, but many other outcomes allowed the team to somehow keep its postseason spot.    Cincinnati tried its hardest to kill itself throughout the rest of the contest. Baltimore safety Bernard Pollard dropped the easiest interception of his life when an Andy Dalton pass hit him right in the numbers. Dalton had a touchdown thrown to Bernard Scott, but the backup running back dropped the ball. Dalton also took unnecessary sacks and wasted too much time in 2 potential comeback drives in the fourth quarter.    With all of that being said, the Bengals still had a chance to win this game with 2 35-yard Hail Mary attempts. The first should have given them the ball on the 1-yard line because corner Lardarius Webb committed a blatant pass interference penalty that wasn't called. I know that such infractions are seldom whistled on Hail Mary attempts, but it was ridiculous. Webb grabbed Green's shoulder and pulled him down. It looked like Green had a good chance to haul in the pass.    Green had a pretty disappointing performance, catching just 2 balls for 26 yards. That's because Andy Dalton was erratic all afternoon, going 22-of-44 for 232 yards. He should have been picked off a couple of times.    Paling into comparison to Rice's 191 yards (24 carries) and 2 touchdowns, Cedric Benson had some tough runs, gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts."

   "comment":"Rice in his backfield, asked Joe Flacco to throw way too often. Flacco took a couple of sacks on the drive, 1 of which was in the end zone for a safety. The Ravens then didn't even cross midfield until there was a minute remaining in the first half. Flacco was terrible, completing just 3 of his first 11 passes for 25 yards and a pick-6 by Johnathan Joseph, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage by J.J. Watt, of course. Flacco was far from elite, looking like a rookie quarterback rattled by Houston's relentless pressure. Watt wasn't the only 1 tipping passes. Houston's entire front 7 was doing this, prompting the announcers to say that the Texans were treating this like a volleyball game. One of the other key tips was made by rookie Whitney Mercilus, allowing the ball to fall into Glover Quin's hands for another pick right at the end of the first half. Flacco ended up finishing 21-of-43 for 147 yards, a touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Defensively, meanwhile, the Texans completely embarrassed Baltimore after 3 poor drives. They outgained the Ravens, 420-176, as Arian Foster couldn't be stopped, gaining 98 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 19 carries. Matt Schaub, meanwhile, went 23-of-37 for 256 yards and a couple of scores. After the Texans went up by double digits, the Ravens looked like they were sleepwalking. The only player showing any sort of effort was Suggs, who was all over the place. He even had some decent stints in pass coverage. I have no idea how he performed so well just 6 months after tearing his Achilles. The Ravens may have actually been competitive if the other players showed the same sort of heart that Suggs did.    Schaub's touchdowns went to Kevin Walter (4-74) and Owen Daniels (7-59). Andre Johnson had a big game (9-86), but couldn't find the end zone. Ben Tate probably would have scored late in the game, but left with a hamstring.    Flacco, meanwhile, tossed a late, meaningless score to Tandon Doss. Torrey Smith (4-41) and Anquan Boldin (3-24) both struggled because their elite quarterback couldn't get them the ball.    I mentioned this above, but Cameron screwed up by not giving Rice the ball enough. Rice had just 14 touches, including only 9 carries. That's just inexcusable. Cameron didn't give Rice any touches when the Ravens were pinned inside their own 6-yard line in the first quarter, which led to the safety and Houston's subsequent barrage of points. I'd say it's time for Baltimore to begin searching for a new play-caller, but I've been criticizing Cameron for years.   "

   "comment":"Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. "

   "comment":"Rice allegedly converted a 4th-and-29. The team went up 28-3 in the third quarter Monday night and was absolutely dominating this contest. But that's when the Chargers reverted to their old habits. They did dumb things to relinquish the lead, as the Texans ultimately hit a last-second field goal to triumph by 3 points. It all started in the third quarter when San Diego surrendered multiple third-and-long situations. Matt Schaub converted a 3rd-and-18 as well as a 3rd-and-13. The Chargers then hit the center on a Houston field goal attempt early in the final period. The kick would've made it 28-17. Instead, the Texans were awarded a free first down and found the end zone on the very next play. The score was once 28-7, but Houston drew within 7. The Chargers proceeded to allow a converted fake punt, followed by a Philip Rivers tying pick-6 to Brian Cushing. Eddie Royal killed a potential first-down conversion on the next drive by dropping the ball, and Houston took over and eventually moved into field-goal range to secure the victory.    San Diego's defense deserves a ton of blame for this loss, but Rivers was awful in the second half. He was just 6-of-15 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-6 after intermission. His team didn't help him with poor blocking and dropped passes, but it was disappointing to see Rivers melt down after a hot start. His final numbers were 14-of-29 for 195 yards, 4 touchdowns and the interception.    Rivers' scores went to Ryan Mathews, Vincent Brown (2-13) and Royal twice (3-24). The Texans did a great job of scheming Antonio Gates (2-49) out of the game.    Mathews, who opened with the first touchdown, looked pretty quick at first. However, the Texans ultimately bottled him up, holding him to 33 yards on 13 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, caught just 2 passes. I'm not sure why he wasn't utilized more.    Everyone will laugh at the Chargers for the loss, but Houston's ability to rally can't be ignored. Matt Schaub was unstoppable in the second half, finishing 34-of-45 for 346 yards, 3 touchdowns and a fluke interception at the beginning of the game that was tipped into the air and picked by nose tackle Cam Thomas.    Schaub found only his tight ends in the end zone; Owen Daniels, who had 2 touchdowns, made 5 receptions for 67 yards. Garrett Graham (4-27) caught the other score. However, Andre Johnson was Schaub's preferred target. Johnson hauled in 12 receptions for 146 yards, making it the 19th time he has snagged at least 10 catches in a game throughout his career. That's an NFL record, believe it or not.    Gary Kubiak said that Arian Foster and Ben Tate were going to split touches. Well, it wasn't very even; Foster had twice as many carries as Tate (18-9). Despite this though, Foster outgained Tate by just 2 rushing yards (57-55) though he did catch 6 balls for 33 receiving yards. There's no doubt Tate is the better runner, but there's Foster is better at blocking and receiving. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

Pierce tallied 28 yards on 5 carries, while Rice mustered only 15 yards on 6 tries, though he did catch 7 balls for 35 receiving yards. Rice was sidelined for much of the first half with an injury.    The Bengals had slightly more success on the ground. "
