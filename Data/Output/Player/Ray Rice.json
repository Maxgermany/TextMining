   "comment":"Ray Rice had a 20-yard run down to the Colts 28 at the beginning of the 4.h quarter, but fumbled it away. - All of Baltimore's penalties were costly, either negating a turnover, a crucial first down, or a possession deep in Indianapolis territory. The officiating was seemed 1.sided, and I can only hope that the refs will donate some of their Colts winnings to Haiti relief.    I may have lost 5 units on this game, but I wouldn't say I had the wrong side. Of course, you have ignorant announcers like Dan Dierdorf saying, Hwa hwa hwa hwa, looks like the Colts knew what they were doing when they rested their starters, hwa hwa hwa hwa. Well, this was the first time Indianapolis had ever won - let alone covered - when coming off rest in Weeks 17 and 18. And I don't think the Colts played all that well; outside of 2 offensive drives in the second quarter, they mustered just 136 total yards of offense, and for the entire game, they only outgained the Ravens by 5 yards (275-270). If Baltimore didn't commit all of those dumb, careless errors, they could have easily won this matchup.    Peyton Manning completed 30-of-44 passes, but for only 246 yards. That YPA (5.6) is very telling, as Manning just dinked and dunked on most of his throws. He attempted some deep balls, but missed his targets. Manning threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, though only 1 pick counted because of a questionable pass interference call on an uncatchable ball.    The Colts struggled to run the ball. Joseph Addai led the team with 11 carries and 23 yards. He left the game in the first half with an injury, but returned in the 4.h quarter.    Think the Ravens will be searching for some offensive weapons for Joe Flacco (20-35, 189, 2 INTs) this offseason? Of the 270 yards they compiled on offense, 191 of it came from Ray Rice and Derrick Mason.Rice had a 20-yard run down to the Colts 28 at the beginning of the 4.h quarter, but fumbled it away. - All of Baltimore's penalties were costly, either negating a turnover, a crucial first down, or a possession deep in Indianapolis territory.

Cam Cameron seemed to be up to his old tricks, so someone must have threatened him during intermission because Baltimore came out running. A 59-yard scamper later, and the Ravens were able to kick a field goal after stalling inside the Cincinnati 5-yard line. The 3 points made it a 2.possession game, which, at the time, seemed to put this game away for Baltimore because the Bengals had issues moving the chains.    Andy Dalton definitely didn't look like himself early on with A.J. Green out of the lineup. This was extremely apparent when Dalton attempted a 45-yard heave into the end zone during the second quarter. Green caught such a pass for a touchdown against the Steelers, but Andre Caldwell didn't have nearly as much success. Ed Reed picked off the pass. However, Dalton caught fire in the 4.h quarter and was able to finish 24-of-45, 373 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He made some really great throws and was a Calvin Johnson rule away from tying the game. The Bengals lost both contests against Baltimore and Pittsburgh, but their fan base really has to be thrilled with Dalton. He's just going to get better.    Dalton's 1 score went to Caldwell (3-63), but Jerome Simpson was the 1 who picked up the slack in the wake of Green's absence. Simpson hauled in 8 balls for a whopping 152 yards.    As for the Ravens, Flacco continued to be inconsistent. He led the Ravens to just 1 first down in the first quarter and had a botched handoff with his running back. The offense as a whole just looked really sloppy. But in the ensuing quarter, he started connecting on deep bombs to Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. Flacco's success wouldn't last, however. He fired an ugly interception right before halftime. But when things looked bleak, he hit Torrey Smith (6-165, TD) for a perfect 38-yard touchdown strike.    Rice finished with 20 carries and was able to churn out 104 rushing yards and 2 scores. He also caught 5 balls for 43 receiving yards.   "

Cincinnati tried its hardest to kill itself throughout the rest of the contest. Baltimore safety Rice scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown immediately afterward. That seemed to shut the door on Cincinnati's playoff hopes, but many other outcomes allowed the team to somehow keep its postseason spot.    Cincinnati tried its hardest to kill itself throughout the rest of the contest. Baltimore safety Bernard Pollard dropped the easiest interception of his life when an Andy Dalton pass hit him right in the numbers. Dalton had a touchdown thrown to Bernard Scott, but the backup running back dropped the ball. Dalton also took unnecessary sacks and wasted too much time in 2 potential comeback drives in the 4.h quarter.    With all of that being said, the Bengals still had a chance to win this game with 2 35-yard Hail Mary attempts. The first should have given them the ball on the 1-yard line because corner Lardarius Webb committed a blatant pass interference penalty that wasn't called. I know that such infractions are seldom whistled on Hail Mary attempts, but it was ridiculous. Webb grabbed Green's shoulder and pulled him down. It looked like Green had a good chance to haul in the pass.    Green had a pretty disappointing performance, catching just 2 balls for 26 yards. That's because Andy Dalton was erratic all afternoon, going 22-of-44 for 232 yards. He should have been picked off a couple of times.    Paling into comparison to Rice's 191 yards (24 carries) and 2 touchdowns, Cedric Benson had some tough runs, gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts."

   "comment":"Ray Rice in his backfield, asked Joe Flacco to throw way too often.Rice in his backfield, asked Joe Flacco to throw way too often. Flacco took a couple of sacks on the drive, 1 of which was in the end zone for a safety. The Ravens then didn't even cross midfield until there was a minute remaining in the first half. Flacco was terrible, completing just 3 of his first 11 passes for 25 yards and a pick-six by Johnathan Joseph, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage by J.J. Watt, of course. Flacco was far from elite, looking like a rookie quarterback rattled by Houston's relentless pressure. Watt wasn't the only 1 tipping passes. Houston's entire front 7 was doing this, prompting the announcers to say that the Texans were treating this like a volleyball game. One of the other key tips was made by rookie Whitney Mercilus, allowing the ball to fall into Glover Quin's hands for another pick right at the end of the first half. Flacco ended up finishing 21-of-43 for 147 yards, a touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Defensively, meanwhile, the Texans completely embarrassed Baltimore after 3 poor drives. They outgained the Ravens, 420-176, as Arian Foster couldn't be stopped, gaining 98 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 19 carries. Matt Schaub, meanwhile, went 23-of-37 for 256 yards and a couple of scores. After the Texans went up by double digits, the Ravens looked like they were sleepwalking. The only player showing any sort of effort was Suggs, who was all over the place. He even had some decent stints in pass coverage. I have no idea how he performed so well just 6 months after tearing his Achilles. The Ravens may have actually been competitive if the other players showed the same sort of heart that Suggs did.    Schaub's touchdowns went to Kevin Walter (4-74) and Owen Daniels (7-59). Andre Johnson had a big game (9-86), but couldn't find the end zone. Ben Tate probably would have scored late in the game, but left with a hamstring.    Flacco, meanwhile, tossed a late, meaningless score to Tandon Doss. Torrey Smith (4-41) and Anquan Boldin (3-24) both struggled because their elite quarterback couldn't get them the ball.    I mentioned this above, but Cameron screwed up by not giving Rice the ball enough. Rice had just 14 touches, including only 9 carries. That's just inexcusable. Cameron didn't give Rice any touches when the Ravens were pinned inside their own 6-yard line in the first quarter, which led to the safety and Houston's subsequent barrage of points. I'd say it's time for Baltimore to begin searching for a new play-caller, but I've been criticizing Cameron for years. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce.

   "comment":"Ray Rice allegedly converted a 4th-and-29. The team went up 28-3 in the third quarter Monday night and was absolutely dominating this contest. But that's when the Chargers reverted to their old habits. They did dumb things to relinquish the lead, as the Texans ultimately hit a last-second field goal to triumph by 3 points. It all started in the third quarter when San Diego surrendered multiple third-and-long situations. Matt Schaub converted a 3rd-and-18 as well as a 3rd-and-13. The Chargers then hit the center on a Houston field goal attempt early in the final period. The kick would've made it 28-17. Instead, the Texans were awarded a free first down and found the end zone on the very next play. The score was once 28-7, but Houston drew within 7. The Chargers proceeded to allow a converted fake punt, followed by a Philip Rivers tying pick-six to Brian Cushing. Eddie Royal killed a potential first-down conversion on the next drive by dropping the ball, and Houston took over and eventually moved into field-goal range to secure the victory.    San Diego's defense deserves a ton of blame for this loss, but Rivers was awful in the second half. He was just 6-of-15 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-six after intermission. His team didn't help him with poor blocking and dropped passes, but it was disappointing to see Rivers melt down after a hot start. His final numbers were 14-of-29 for 195 yards, 4 touchdowns and the interception.    Rivers' scores went to Ryan Mathews, Vincent Brown (2-13) and Royal twice (3-24). The Texans did a great job of scheming Antonio Gates (2-49) out of the game.    Mathews, who opened with the first touchdown, looked pretty quick at first. However, the Texans ultimately bottled him up, holding him to 33 yards on 13 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, caught just 2 passes. I'm not sure why he wasn't utilized more.    Everyone will laugh at the Chargers for the loss, but Houston's ability to rally can't be ignored. Matt Schaub was unstoppable in the second half, finishing 34-of-45 for 346 yards, 3 touchdowns and a fluke interception at the beginning of the game that was tipped into the air and picked by nose tackle Cam Thomas.    Schaub found only his tight ends in the end zone; Owen Daniels, who had 2 touchdowns, made 5 receptions for 67 yards. Garrett Graham (4-27) caught the other score. However, Andre Johnson was Schaub's preferred target. Johnson hauled in 12 receptions for 146 yards, making it the 19th time he has snagged at least 10 catches in a game throughout his career. That's an NFL record, believe it or not.    Gary Kubiak said that Arian Foster and Ben Tate were going to split touches. Well, it wasn't very even; Foster had twice as many carries as Tate (18-9). Despite this though, Foster outgained Tate by just 2 rushing yards (57-55) though he did catch 6 balls for 33 receiving yards. There's no doubt Tate is the better runner, but there's Foster is better at blocking and receiving.   Rice allegedly converted a 4th-and-29.

It all started in the third quarter when San Diego surrendered multiple third-and-long situations. Matt Schaub converted a 3rd-and-18 as well as a 3rd-and-13. The Chargers then hit the center on a Houston field goal attempt early in the final period. The kick would've made it 28-17. Instead, the Texans were awarded a free first down and found the end zone on the very next play. The score was once 28-7, but Houston drew within 7. The Chargers proceeded to allow a converted fake punt, followed by a Philip Rivers tying pick-six to Brian Cushing. Eddie Royal killed a potential first-down conversion on the next drive by dropping the ball, and Houston took over and eventually moved into field-goal range to secure the victory.    San Diego's defense deserves a ton of blame for this loss, but Rivers was awful in the second half. He was just 6-of-15 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-six after intermission. His team didn't help him with poor blocking and dropped passes, but it was disappointing to see Rivers melt down after a hot start. His final numbers were 14-of-29 for 195 yards, 4 touchdowns and the interception.    Rivers' scores went to Ryan Mathews, Vincent Brown (2-13) and Royal twice (3-24). The Texans did a great job of scheming Antonio Gates (2-49) out of the game.    Mathews, who opened with the first touchdown, looked pretty quick at first. However, the Texans ultimately bottled him up, holding him to 33 yards on 13 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, caught just 2 passes. I'm not sure why he wasn't utilized more.    Everyone will laugh at the Chargers for the loss, but Houston's ability to rally can't be ignored. Matt Schaub was unstoppable in the second half, finishing 34-of-45 for 346 yards, 3 touchdowns and a fluke interception at the beginning of the game that was tipped into the air and picked by nose tackle Cam Thomas.    Schaub found only his tight ends in the end zone; Owen Daniels, who had 2 touchdowns, made 5 receptions for 67 yards. Garrett Graham (4-27) caught the other score. However, Andre Johnson was Schaub's preferred target. Johnson hauled in 12 receptions for 146 yards, making it the 19th time he has snagged at least 10 catches in a game throughout his career. That's an NFL record, believe it or not.    Gary Kubiak said that Arian Foster and Ben Tate were going to split touches. Well, it wasn't very even; Foster had twice as many carries as Tate (18-9). Despite this though, Foster outgained Tate by just 2 rushing yards (57-55) though he did catch 6 balls for 33 receiving yards. There's no doubt Tate is the better runner, but there's Foster is better at blocking and receiving.   "

A big gain to Rice to get a win that keeps the team tied at 3-2 with Cincinnati and Cleveland. In the first half, Flacco set up a field goal by hitting Torrey Smith for 41 yards. A big gain to Ed Dickson (2-51) of 43 yards set up the Ravens' second field goal. The Dolphins' offense also had opportunities, but had to settle for too many field goals. After dropping a pass inside the 10-yard line, Mike Wallace (7-105) beat Matt Elam and Lardarius Webb for a 49-yard reception. That only set up another field goal though. Tannehill hooked up with Brian Hartline (4-60) for a few completions just before halftime. The second-year signal-caller then tossed a nice back-shoulder touchdown to Charles Clay. Clay (3-52) had a nice game with a 45-yard reception that set up a field goal in the second half. In the third quarter, Torrey Smith (6-121) drew a pass interfence on Ben Grimes in the end zone. Rice (27-74 rushing, 6-28 receiving) plunged into the end zone on the next play. That gave the Ravens a 16-13 lead. He added to it with his second short touchdown run.

   "comment":"Ray Rice was ripping off big runs. Thanks to a Rice 47-yard burst and an inexplicable 52-yard field goal by Justin Tucker in the rain and wind, Baltimore had established a 10-0 lead. And that's when the mega storm rolled in. The wind and rain were so fierce that the NFL paused this game for 2 hours. The end of the first quarter resumed around 3:25 Eastern. Conditions were now safe for the fans and players, but the strong wind was still wreaking havoc. There was trash blowing all around the field; the goal posts were swaying back and forth, and someone had to repair 1 of them during a stoppage; the field crew replaced divots on the field during timeouts; and to top it off, an official's hat humorously blew off. The wind had such a big impact on this game that I found it quite puzzling that the Ravens chose to have possession when winning the coin flip in overtime. It would've been a wise decision before the new rules, but Baltmore should have chosen the wind. As a result of not doing so, its first drive ended prematurely, allowing the Bears to take over and drive down the field to set themselves up for a pushing field goal.    The weather is the big story, but a secondary plot line was Joe Flacco's ineptitude. Flacco went 17-of-31 for 162 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. One pick, taken back for a score, was thrown right to a defensive lineman. The other was heaved recklessly into triple coverage. Flacco now has 5 interceptions in the 3 games since the bye.    Flacco's awful outing ruined Ray Rice's best performance of the season. Rice was huge early, as mentioned, and the stoppage didn't slow him down. Rice, showing more power than ever all year, gained 131 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He also logged 3 catches for 17 receiving yards.    Flacco's sole score went to Rice was ripping off big runs. Thanks to a Rice 47-yard burst and an inexplicable 52-yard field goal by Justin Tucker in the rain and wind, Baltimore had established a 10-0 lead."
