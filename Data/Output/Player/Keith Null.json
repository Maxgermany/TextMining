   "comment":"Keith Null can't be much worse, can he? Well, now I know my answer. Null might be the worst quarterback to EVER play in the NFL. What's that you say? That title belongs to Ryan Leaf? Well, would you be surprised that Leaf was Null's mentor and coach at West Texas A&amp;M? Null at times appeared to be colorblind. I don't know whom he was throwing to at times because he constantly fired it to Titans defenders when there were no Rams receivers around. Null was 27-of-43 but for just 157 yards (3.7 YPA), 1 late touchdown and FIVE interceptions. What an embarrassing performance.    With Null firing it to any moving target on the field, the Titans were able to stack the line of scrimmage and limit "
