These numbers are all legitimate, and Wilson's best play was a 33-yarder in which he made a nice catch and broke tackles to move into Pittsburgh territory. He also was the target of a 19-yard pass on a big third-down conversion.    As for Smith's other weapons, Bowe was second on the team with 57 yards on 6 catches. "

Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5-reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

Smith is not a good quarterback, despite ESPN gushing all over him, and he'll definitely be worse without his No. 1 receiver.    Being too mediocre to spread the ball around, Smith was able to connect with only 3 players on multiple occasions: Maclin, Travis Kelce (8-128) and Wilson (2-9). Kelce was guilty of a drop, but that was his only blemish on the afternoon. The Texans had absolutely no answer for Kelce. They tried to have various defenders cover him, yet no 1 had any sort of success.    The Chiefs ran the ball pretty well despite battling a Watt-led front for nearly 3 quarters. "

The line could not get a lot of push up front, and the team had more success in the passing game. Ware did catch 3 passes for 23 yards and a touchdown, and he could have had more if Smith had hit him on that long pass. Ware is a low-end RB1 in most formats moving forward.    Final Note: Having "
