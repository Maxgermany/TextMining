   "comment":"Mangold.    Buffalo had its own turnover problems. Ryan Fitzpatrick had a really ugly outing, as he spent most of the first half lobbing interceptions to Jet linebackers. He was 4-of-12 for 24 yards and 2 picks at halftime, and most of his total yardage (191) came in that aforementioned 80-yard junk scoring possession. Fred Jackson was also guilty of a key give-away. Down just 6-0 at the beginning of the third quarter, he fumbled deep in his own territory, giving New York an easy touchdown drive. Given Buffalo's inability to move the chains - they had just 3 first downs up until that point - a 13-0 deficit was just too much for them to overcome.    As for the Jets, Mark Sanchez played pretty well aside from that aforementioned pick, though he nearly had a second interception prior to halftime. Sanchez finished 20-of-28, 230 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Sanchez's touchdown went to Santonio Holmes (3-29). Plaxico Burress, meanwhile, led the team in receiving (5-79).    Shonn Greene has been running the ball well since Nick Mangold returned from injury. That once again was the case today, as Greene gained 76 yards on 19 carries. Unfortunately, "
