   "comment":"Lewis for a 32-yard touchdown with seconds remaining in the 4.h quarter. There's no question about it - the throw was incredible, and it was 1 that neither Sage Rosenfails nor Tarvaris Jackson could ever make. However, did Favre have a great game? As an unbiased viewer, I don't think so. He played somewhat well, but despite what ESPN may tell you, it wasn't even close to great. Favre once again tossed multiple near-interceptions. He should have thrown at least 4 in this game, but he was fortunate that the San Francisco defensive backs kept dropping the ball. In fact, when Dre Bly dropped a potential pick-six in the 4.h quarter, the crowd booed Favre. Ironically, the 1 pick Favre actually threw wasn't his fault; the ball simply bounced out of Bernard Berrian's hands.    Favre had multiple long throws in this contest - a radical change from Weeks 1 and 2 - but his favorite target was Chester Taylor out of the backfield. Taylor caught 7 balls for 70 yards.    As for the receivers, Favre was an equal-opportunity passer, hitting Bernard Berrian, Sidney Rice and Percy Harvin 4 times each. They had 56, 56 and 51 yards, respectively.    Adrian Peterson had the worst game of his career against the 49ers 2 years ago (a performance that knocked me out of the playoffs in 1 of my fantasy leagues), but he was solid in this contest, gaining 85 yards on 19 carries. Unfortunately, it looks like Matt Birk can kiss his 3,000-yard prediction goodbye.    Favre's decisive touchdown to Lewis made the difference in the game, but if you're looking for a key stat, check this out: Favre and the Vikings were 10-of-20 on third downs. The 49ers were 0-of-11 on third downs. Pretty crazy.    Mike Singletary's workhorse, "
