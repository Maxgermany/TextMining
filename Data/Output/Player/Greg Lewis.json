   "comment":"Greg Lewis for a 32-yard touchdown with seconds remaining in the 4.h quarter. There's no question about it - the throw was incredible, and it was 1 that neither Sage Rosenfails nor Tarvaris Jackson could ever make. However, did Favre have a great game? As an unbiased viewer, I don't think so. He played somewhat well, but despite what ESPN may tell you, it wasn't even close to great. Favre once again tossed multiple near-interceptions. He should have thrown at least 4 in this game, but he was fortunate that the San Francisco defensive backs kept dropping the ball. In fact, when Dre Bly dropped a potential pick-six in the 4.h quarter, the crowd booed Favre. Ironically, the 1 pick Favre actually threw wasn't his fault; the ball simply bounced out of "
