He didn't fare well in the second half, going 15-of-27 for 149 yards and a pick after intermission.    Wallace hauled in Tannehill's sole score, though it was questionable. He made a 1.handed grab in the end zone, but the ball appeared to be moving as he hit the ground and went out of bounds. It shouldn't have stood as a touchdown, but it didn't matter in the long run. Wallace led the Dolphins with 104 receiving yards on 5 catches. "

   "comment":"Williams on a slow-developing play, which allowed Ryan Kerrigan to blow it up. Tannehill took bad sacks and missed receivers throughout the afternoon. One of the sacks resulted in a fumble that pinballed around and went backward about 30 yards. Tannehill also had a wide-open Kenny Stills at 1 point, but fired the ball out of bounds. He then was guilty of a crucial delay-of-game penalty on what was a promising drive. It was just painful to watch. Fortunately for the Dolphins, Jarvis Landry bailed the team out with a punt return touchdown in the 4.h quarter, allowing them to escape with a win that they didn't exactly deserve.    Tannehill finished 22-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he made numerous mistakes that even prompted picking podcast co-host Matvei to text me, I hope for Miami's sake that Tannehill signed his contract extension in pencil. He was a bit better in the second half, but he still had a very disappointing showing.    The hero of the game, Landry caught 8 out of 12 targets thrown to him for 53 yards to go along with that return touchdown. He finished only behind Jordan Cameron on the receiving chart; Cameron logged 4 receptions for 73 yards, and he also happened to draw pass interference in the red zone. Cameron made 1 of the top catches of the week, diving for a 27-yarder. He looks like he'll be a low-end TE1.    Lamar Miller didn't run as well as anticipated. He managed 53 yards on 13 carries, but a big chunk of that came on an 17-yarder. Miller was stuffed on a third-and-1 on Miami's opening drive, perhaps influencing the Dolphins to try Williams on that aforementioned short-yardage failure. Don't get too discouraged, though. Though the Redskins can't stop the pass, they had 1 of the tougher run defenses in the NFL last year.    As for the Redskins' offense, "

   "comment":"Williams fumble in the red zone that set up another quick New England score following a long return on the recovery.    Brady was nearly flawless, going 25-of-33 for 276 yards and 3 touchdowns. This result allowed him to set an NFL record for the best single-season touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history. He finished the year with 28 scores and just 2 picks. The previous record-holder was Nick Foles, who somehow managed a 27:2 ratio back in 2013. That required a lot of luck and dropped interceptions. Brady's new record, in contrast to Bradford's, is totally legitimate.    Brady's 3 touchdowns went to Edelman (8-151), Michael Floyd (3-36) and Martellus Bennett (3-33). Floyd is noteworthy, as his score was a great 1. he fought hard to reach the end zone, taking 6 Dolphins along for a ride. Floyd also had a crushing block on Edelman's long touchdown catch. With Rob Gronkowski out, a new weapon like Floyd is definitely welcome. Edelman, by the way, was guilty of a head-butting personal foul in the opening half. That was probably the only real blunder for New England's offense the entire afternoon.    The 2 Patriot running backs split carries evenly in the first half. Dion Lewis had 1 more attempt prior to halftime, but LeGarrette Blount finished with more tries, as Bill Belichick used the latter as an end-game hammer to run out the clock. Blount managed 51 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Lewis gained 48 yards on 11 attempts, all but 2 of which came in the opening half.    As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore didn't have a bad game, going 24-of-34 for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick really hurt, as it occurred when he hurled an underthrown pass while scrambling left. With the Patriots limiting Miami's possessions, every drive was going to be crucial, so the Dolphins couldn't afford that mistake. The same goes for the aforementioned Damien Williams fumble.    Moore's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Williams run, but an interception crushed the team. It wasn't Jay Cutler's fault, as DeVante Parker fell down in the end zone. This would be a trend for the Dolphins throughout the early stages of the afternoon, as Cutler tossed 3 picks in the opening half. The second 1 was definitely his fault, as he foolishly threw the ball across his body. The third was on Parker again, as he had the ball bounce off his hands. These interceptions, as well as a crushing penalty on Jermon Bushrod to negate a 48-yard reception by Jarvis Landry, allowed the Buccaneers to operate on short fields. They took advantage, notching 20 points in the opening half. They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit. Parker was awful in this contest, as he was responsible for 2 interceptions. Kenny Stills was much better, catching 7 of his 8 targets for a whopping 180 yards and a touchdown. Jarvis Landry (6-95) also had a score, and he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Meanwhile, Parker (4-26) never really did anything positive. The Dolphins have been disgruntled with Parker's work ethic, so this type of performance is not surprising in the slightest.    Miami's running game had a nice pick-up with Williams' aforementioned 69-yard gain, but Williams didn't do anything else; he finished with 78 yards on 10 carries. "

   "comment":"Williams run, but an interception crushed the team. It wasn't Jay Cutler's fault, as DeVante Parker fell down in the end zone. This would be a trend for the Dolphins throughout the early stages of the afternoon, as Cutler tossed 3 picks in the opening half. The second 1 was definitely his fault, as he foolishly threw the ball across his body. The third was on Parker again, as he had the ball bounce off his hands. These interceptions, as well as a crushing penalty on Jermon Bushrod to negate a 48-yard reception by Jarvis Landry, allowed the Buccaneers to operate on short fields. They took advantage, notching 20 points in the opening half. They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit. Parker was awful in this contest, as he was responsible for 2 interceptions. Kenny Stills was much better, catching 7 of his 8 targets for a whopping 180 yards and a touchdown. Jarvis Landry (6-95) also had a score, and he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Meanwhile, Parker (4-26) never really did anything positive. The Dolphins have been disgruntled with Parker's work ethic, so this type of performance is not surprising in the slightest.    Miami's running game had a nice pick-up with Williams' aforementioned 69-yard gain, but Williams didn't do anything else; he finished with 78 yards on 10 carries. "
