Newton needs to stop trying to become a passing quarterback. His best trait is running the ball. If he doesn't take advantage of that, he's only making things easier for the opposition.

This covered the spread, so I'm sure there will be some conspiracy-theory talk, but the ref made the right call.    No other Charger had more than 4 catches. Carter drew that assignment.

   "comment":"Tony Carter didn't hear him right away, and the ball hit him. The Patriots recovered and drilled the decisive field goal.    Brady finished 34-of-50 for 344 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned fumble. As mentioned, he was very sharp in the second half, but he missed Edelman for a score in the 4.h quarter. Brady also repeated what he did last week when he charged off the field and yelled at an official. The refs missed a blatant pass interference in overtime, and Brady went berserk. In fact, he wasted so much time yelling at the zebras that he had to use a timeout. The drive concluded with a punt, but it ultimately didn't matter. Two of Brady's touchdowns went to Edelman, who had a monstrous outing with 9 catches for 110 yards. "
