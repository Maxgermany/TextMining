   "comment":"Carter. Newton went 21-of-36 for 241 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 in garbage time) and the aforementioned 2 picks. What's puzzling is that he had just 4 scrambles for 7 rushing yards. Newton needs to stop trying to become a passing quarterback. His best trait is running the ball. If he doesn't take advantage of that, he's only making things easier for the opposition.    Both of Newton's touchdowns went to "

However, the official correctly ruled that his second action was crossing the goal line. This covered the spread, so I'm sure there will be some conspiracy-theory talk, but the ref made the right call.    No other Charger had more than 4 catches. "

   "comment":"Carter didn't hear him right away, and the ball hit him. The Patriots recovered and drilled the decisive field goal.    Brady finished 34-of-50 for 344 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned fumble. As mentioned, he was very sharp in the second half, but he missed Edelman for a score in the fourth quarter. Brady also repeated what he did last week when he charged off the field and yelled at an official. The refs missed a blatant pass interference in overtime, and Brady went berserk. In fact, he wasted so much time yelling at the zebras that he had to use a timeout. The drive concluded with a punt, but it ultimately didn't matter. Two of Brady's touchdowns went to Edelman, who had a monstrous outing with 9 catches for 110 yards. "
