If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. "
