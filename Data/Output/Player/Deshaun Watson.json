   "comment":"Deshaun Watson without any drama. I don't think the Texans' offense can function without a mobile quarterback, at least not until Duane Brown returns from his holdout.       This game was over by intermission. The first half of this game was sheer domination by Jacksonville from the beginning. Houston's offensive line was completely inept, as new Jaguar Calais Campbell had 3.5 sacks in the first half to set a franchise record for the most sacks in a single game (4). Jacksonville's Yannick Ngakoue had 2 sack-fumbles as well by halftime. Texans quarterback Tom Savage was awful, routinely holding onto the ball too long, and Houston's offensive line was putrid. Savage was lucky to have only 2 fumbles by halftime. Conversely, the suspect Jaguars' offensive line was superb, Leonard Fournette ran hard, and Blake Bortles managed the game well enough to win.    On the first third down of the game, Allen Robinson made a catch of 17 yards to move the chains, but he came up limping after he was pushed out of bounds. Robinson went into the locker room and didn't return to action. A serious injury to Robinson could be devastating to Jacksonville, plus hurt his fantasy owners. Bortles had another chunk completion this time to Allen Hurns (3-42), and that set up a short field goal for Jacksonville. The Jaguars added a second field goal after using rookie Leonard Fournette to move the ball on the ground and through the air, with Chris Ivory (9-42) chipping in a 17-yard run. Then, Ngakoue strip-sacked Savage to set up the Jaguars around midfield. Jacksonville took advantage with the aid of some Texans penalties to move to the goal line. On 4.h-and-goal, Fournette powered into the end zone. Houston moved into Jacksonville territory afterward, but Ngakoue forced another strip-sack that was scooped up by Dante Fowler and returned 53 yards for a touchdown. The Jaguars took a 19-0 lead into the half. Deshaun Watson took over at quarterback for the Texans in the second half and promptly moved the ball down the field. A penalty on the Jaguars took away an interception, and Watson made them pay by throwing a short touchdown pass to "
