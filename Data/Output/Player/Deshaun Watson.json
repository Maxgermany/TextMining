   "comment":"Watson without any drama. I don't think the Texans' offense can function without a mobile quarterback, at least not until Duane Brown returns from his holdout.       This game was over by intermission. The first half of this game was sheer domination by Jacksonville from the beginning. Houston's offensive line was completely inept, as new Jaguar Calais Campbell had 3.5 sacks in the first half to set a franchise record for the most sacks in a single game (4). Jacksonville's Yannick Ngakoue had 2 sack-fumbles as well by halftime. Texans quarterback Tom Savage was awful, routinely holding onto the ball too long, and Houston's offensive line was putrid. Savage was lucky to have only 2 fumbles by halftime. Conversely, the suspect Jaguars' offensive line was superb, Leonard Fournette ran hard, and Blake Bortles managed the game well enough to win.    On the first third down of the game, Allen Robinson made a catch of 17 yards to move the chains, but he came up limping after he was pushed out of bounds. Robinson went into the locker room and didn't return to action. A serious injury to Robinson could be devastating to Jacksonville, plus hurt his fantasy owners. Bortles had another chunk completion this time to Allen Hurns (3-42), and that set up a short field goal for Jacksonville. The Jaguars added a second field goal after using rookie Leonard Fournette to move the ball on the ground and through the air, with Chris Ivory (9-42) chipping in a 17-yard run. Then, Ngakoue strip-sacked Savage to set up the Jaguars around midfield. Jacksonville took advantage with the aid of some Texans penalties to move to the goal line. On 4.h-and-goal, Fournette powered into the end zone. Houston moved into Jacksonville territory afterward, but Ngakoue forced another strip-sack that was scooped up by Dante Fowler and returned 53 yards for a touchdown. The Jaguars took a 19-0 lead into the half. Deshaun Watson took over at quarterback for the Texans in the second half and promptly moved the ball down the field. A penalty on the Jaguars took away an interception, and Watson made them pay by throwing a short touchdown pass to "

A week after outplaying the defending Super Bowl champions on the road, Deshaun Watson and the Texans fired a shot across the bow of the AFC as they completely dominated the Titans. Late last week, I texted a league source that I thought the Texans were going to give the Titans a whipping this week, and that turned out to be spot on, as it was Houston domination from start to finish. In the first half, the Texans' offense had 6 possessions with 5 scores, including 4 touchdowns. Deshaun Watson was awesome. It looked like Watson was back at Clemson and playing Kent State.

Watson torched the Chiefs in garbage time, and he actually made things interesting, trimming the margin to 26-20. However, the Chiefs quickly scored with ease, feeling no resistance from a Mercilus- and Watt-less defense, and following a very confusing decision by Bill O'Brien to punt on 4.h-and-short with 7:30 remaining, Hill returned a punt to the house to seal the victory. O'Brien's call to punt was mind-boggling. Watson was on fire, and the defense couldn't stop anything, yet he punted on 4.h-and-short? Why? Still, Watson finished with some very impressive numbers, going 16-of-31 for 261 yards and 5 touchdowns. He also scrambled thrice for 31 rushing yards.

   "comment":"Watson's career that he entered a game as a favorite. He had done extremely well as an underdog, so the expectations were that he'd have a dominant performance over 1 of the worst teams in the NFL, and that's exactly what happened. There was some early drama, as the Browns had the game tied late in the opening quarter, but the Texans were up by 3 touchdowns by halftime and coasted the rest of the way.
