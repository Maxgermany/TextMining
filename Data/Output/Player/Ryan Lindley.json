   "comment":"Lindley, who was somehow even worse. Lindley just didn't look like he was ready to play. He was incredibly 10.ative in the pocket and even lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Lindley finished just 9-of-20 for 64 yards. He did not look like an NFL quarterback, though he was robbed of a nice completion to Larry Fitzgerald with 3 minutes remaining. Fitzgerald inexplicably dropped the ball, which would have given the Cardinals possession inside the Atlanta 10. Instead, the Cardinals eventually turned the ball over on downs and lost.    Fitzgerald had just 1 catch for 11 yards. He had that aforementioned missed opportunity for a touchdown, but cost his team the game. I can't ever remember saying that about the future Hall-of-Famer. By the way, the only Cardinal who had more than 2 receptions was "

Though Lindley played well at the beginning of this contest, what he did in the second half can be described as some of the worst quarterbacking of the year.

   "comment":"Lindley wasn't benched. To demonstrate how bad he was, he had a wide-open Larry Fitzgerald in the red zone for what would have been a short touchdown, but completely misfired. Lindley's completion rate looked like a batting average, as he connected on just 10-of-31 attempts for just 72 yards and a pick. That's a yards-per-attempt average of 2.3. I don't think I've ever seen a YPA that low on so many passes. I'm still not sure why John Skelton was benched in favor of this bum; Lindley just isn't prepared to play on this level.    As you might expect, the skill-position players struggled statistically because of the ineptness of the 2 quarterbacks. I mentioned Fitzgerald - he actually led the team with 23 receiving yards (1 catch). Meanwhile, Arizona's leading rusher was safety "
