   "comment":"Kyle Boller hit a pass to Danny Amendola to get the team close to the Bears 30. Unfortunately, Alex Barron was called for a holding penalty. One play later, Brandon Gibson fumbled the ball, returned by Chicago to St. Louis' 20. Just blown opportunities for the Rams all afternoon. They began 6 possessions in Chicago territory in this contest, but mustered just 3 field goals. Still, their fans can't be too upset; they're 1 step closer to landing Jimmy Clausen.    Cutler had a pretty weird stat line. He was just 8-of-17, but threw for 143 yards and a touchdown. Cutler collected his yardage on 2 big plays to Devin Hester (48) and Earl Bennett (71). Hester left the game with a calf injury, but should be fine for Week 14.    Forte ran well, compiling 91 yards and a score on 24 carries. However, his fantasy owners may have expected more from him in a matchup against St. Louis at the beginning of the season.    Forte's counterpart was predictably more impressive. Steven Jackson continued to run hard despite his back spasms, compiling 112 yards on 28 carries.    As you can imagine, Kyle Boller was pretty pedestrian; he was 17-of-32 for just 113 yards and an interception. "
