One play later, Brandon Gibson fumbled the ball, returned by Chicago to St. Louis' 20. Just blown opportunities for the Rams all afternoon. They began 6 possessions in Chicago territory in this contest, but mustered just 3 field goals. Still, their fans can't be too upset; they're 1 step closer to landing Jimmy Clausen.    Cutler had a pretty weird stat line. He was just 8-of-17, but threw for 143 yards and a touchdown. Cutler collected his yardage on 2 big plays to Devin Hester (48) and Earl Bennett (71). Hester left the game with a calf injury, but should be fine for Week 14.    Forte ran well, compiling 91 yards and a score on 24 carries. However, his fantasy owners may have expected more from him in a matchup against St. Louis at the beginning of the season.    Forte's counterpart was predictably more impressive. Steven Jackson continued to run hard despite his back spasms, compiling 112 yards on 28 carries.    As you can imagine, Kyle Boller was pretty pedestrian; he was 17-of-32 for just 113 yards and an interception. "

   "comment":"Boller, forced to start because newly acquired Carson Palmer was deemed not ready to go, threw a pass towards rookie Denarius Moore who was double covered. Kendrick Lewis intercepted the ball and returned it for a touchdown making it 7-0 Chiefs. Even after a 3.and-out drive, it was not time to panic yet for the Silver and Black. However, when Darren McFadden left with an injury (sprained right foot), it was looking like 1 of those days. Still, the defense forced a punt. Unfortunately, the offense eventually had to throw another pass. Boller found Brandon Flowers on the interception to set up Kansas City."
