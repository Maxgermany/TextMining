   "comment":"Fisher, and he fumbled the ball away to Philadelphia. The Eagles were set up close to midfield down 15 with 6 minutes remaining. However, Burfict made a great play to intercept Wentz and slam the door for Cincinnati.    Dalton completed 23-of-31 passes for 332 yards with 2 touchdowns. LaFell led the Bengals in receiving with 5 receptions for 95 yards and a score.    Wentz was 36-of-60 for 308 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Ertz had 9 receptions for 79 yards and a score.    Burfict had a tremendous game with 15 tackles and 2 interceptions. The Bengals' defensive line dominated the Eagles' offensive front. Carlos Dunlap was constantly making his presence felt, while "

   "comment":"Fisher hold. Mixon, meanwhile, was a colossal disappointment, tallying 9 yards on 8 attempts, and all but 1 of his yards came on 1 try. He also caught 3 passes for 15 receiving yards. Bernard was the most-productive player, registering 40 yards on 7 carries, though 23 of his yards came on 1 carry. Bernard also had a 39-yard reception. This situation is a mess for fantasy football purposes. It's a legitimate 3.headed time share, and the Bengals can't consistently open up lanes for any of the runners.    "
