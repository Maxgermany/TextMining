   "comment":"Fred Jackson had 9 carries each for 43 and 28 yards, respectively.    Congratulations to the Texans, who are now 5-3. This looked like a trap game, but Houston overcame an early deficit to win. This is the first time in the Texans' franchise history that they're 2 games over .500 (outside of a 2-0 start in 2007). It's also the first time ever that they've won a contest when favored on the road. Unfortunately, this victory for Houston comes with some unfortunate news. Daniels will be out for the rest of the year with what seems to be a torn ACL.   "

With Jackson's help, BUffalo actually outgained New England, 241-224 and won the time-of-possession battle by 7 minutes. Reed's dropped touchdown ended up being the deciding play.    Though the Patriots barely outplayed the Bills, let's just remember how many key players they were missing. They were down 2 defensive linemen (Vince Wilfork, Ty Warren) and 2 offensive linemen (Stephen Neal, Nick Kaczur). Also, Brady is definitely not himself, though there's no telling if he'll ever be close to 100 percent before the 2010 season. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Jackson rushed for 133 yards on 25 carries, and also caught 6 balls for 37 receiving yards. He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon. He had some passes dropped, but should have also tossed a couple more picks.    "

   "comment":"Fred Jackson; it wasn't even close. Jackson mustered only 14 yards on 9 attempts, which included a lost fumble deep in St. Louis territory. Jackson ultimately suffered a knee injury that reportedly doesn't look good. I don't understand what the hell Gailey was thinking; his refusal to involve Spiller in this offense has cost his team multiple victories. It's bad enough to do it once or twice, but this has occurred at least half-a-dozen times already this season. He has to be axed because he clearly can't learn from his mistakes.    Despite holding a lead throughout, the Bills attempted 33 passes to just 16 runs. That's smart. "

Manuel had a decent performance, though it probably should have been better considering his opponent. He went 18-of-32 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Manuel appeared to suffer an injury in the first half on a play that saw Atlanta commit a roughing-the-passer penalty, but he obviously remained in the game.    I mentioned Johnson and Chandler as the 2 players who helped ruin a potential victory. They happened to lead the team in receiving; Johnson had 5 catches for 55 yards, while Chandler's 4 receptions went for 63 yards.    The Falcons struggled to move the chains early, mustering just 189 net yards of offense in the first half compared to 234 afterward. "
