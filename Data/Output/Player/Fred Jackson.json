   "comment":"Jacksonville an overrated team because they've looked awful in the preseason and in their first contest. Whatever magic David Garrard had last year is gone. Garrard finished 17-of-28 for 165 yards and a pick. He now has as many interceptions (3) as he did all last year. Garrard's favorite target was Booger Candy Man (a.k.a. Matt Jones), who had 5 receptions and 50 yards.    I have to question why Fred Taylor had twice as many carries (14) as Maurice Jones-Drew (7). I also have to ask why Jones-Drew didn't carry the ball once in the first half.    Trent Edwards is evolving into a pretty good quarterback; he was 20-of-25 for 239 yards and a touchdown, and opened the game 10-of-10 for 114 yards. He threw to Lee Evans 4 times for 77 yards, but used second-string running back Fred Jackson the most. Jackson caught 7 balls for 83 yards. "

It's also the first time ever that they've won a contest when favored on the road. Unfortunately, this victory for Houston comes with some unfortunate news.

They surrendered multiple first downs on long-yardage situations, including a 3rd-and-15; they had careless penalties, including 1 instance where they had 12 men on the field when Buffalo was in the red zone; and they fumbled it 3 times on top of an interception. If I didn't know any better, I would have said that Jacksonville fired its head coach this week; not Buffalo.    Jones-Drew actually finished with 25 carries because Del Rio finally realized that he had to run the ball when Buffalo went up 15-10. Drew-Jones gained just 66 yards and a touchdown. Not sure why Jacksonville couldn't get him going; it's as if this team was asleep the entire afternoon.    "

If only Dick Jauron realized that Jackson gave his team the better chance to win... One of the hundreds of reasons his firing was warranted.    Ricky Williams wasn't the only Dolphin throwing interceptions. "

With Jackson's help, BUffalo actually outgained New England, 241-224 and won the time-of-possession battle by 7 minutes. Reed's dropped touchdown ended up being the deciding play.    Though the Patriots barely outplayed the Bills, let's just remember how many key players they were missing. They were down 2 defensive linemen (Vince Wilfork, Ty Warren) and 2 offensive linemen (Stephen Neal, Nick Kaczur). Also, Brady is definitely not himself, though there's no telling if he'll ever be close to 100 percent before the 2010 season.   "

Things looked ugly when he tossed a pick-six in the first quarter, but he rebounded from that and finished 15-of-22 for 187 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The second pick wasn't his fault - it was bobbled by his own receiver - but the third interception was an ugly, unnecessary heave in the second half as he was falling back into the pocket. Jackson's inconsistency is nothing new; he has always been pretty erratic. Favre still gives Minnesota its best chance to win, so he should start if he's healthy.    "

   "comment":"Jackson took advantage. He rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. He was also effective in the passing game, catching 6 balls for 85 receiving yards. The Eagles also gave this game away with sloppy play on offense. QB Dog Killer went 26-of-40 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns with 90 rushing yards. However, he also had 4 interceptions. Two of the picks weren't his fault. The first 1 was the result of a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage. The final interception occurred because the ball popped out of Jason Avant's hands. Avant had been enjoying a great game (9-139) prior to that mental error. This marked the third time in 4 weeks that an Eagle wideout screwed up on the final possession. Jeremy Maclin was the culprit against the Falcons and 49ers, dropping a catchable first down and fumbling, respectively. QB Dog Killer's other picks were his responsibility. He was hit as he threw on his second interception, but he held on to the ball way too long in the pocket. The other was a poor pick-six. Speaking of waiting too long in the pocket, the Eagles cost themselves 3 points at the end of the first half. The clock was running out, but QB Dog Killer held on to the ball too long. He fired an incompletion as time expired, so they weren't able to attempt a field goal. Sadly, Philadelphia fans have gotten used to this in the Andy Reid era.    Quality fantasy performances: DeSean Jackson (5-86, TD), LeSean McCoy (11-80, TD) and Jeremy Maclin (6-54, TD) all made their owners happy."

This marked the first time that the Bills have covered the spread in Toronto. From the shots I saw from FOX's cameras, it looked like half the seats were empty. Great job screwing the great Buffalo fans out of another home game, Ralph.   "

   "comment":"Jackson fumbled twice, which is amusing because the Bills talked about giving C.J. Spiller more touches all week. The first was a killer because it came at the goal line. The second was reviewed and ruled a non-fumble, but it cost Buffalo its final timeout because Jackson was injured on the play (a possible concussion). The lack of touches Spiller received was alarming. He had 11 last week and was given just 2 more at New England. He had 9 carries for 70 rushing yards and 4 catches for 61 receiving yards. He did so much more with the football than Jackson (16-80; 4-35) and didn't even cough it up. You have to wonder what Chan Gailey is thinking with this bizarre strategy.    Outside of the strip-sack, Fitzpatrick had a solid outing. He went 27-of-40 for 337 yards, 2 touchdowns and a late, desperation interception.    "

   "comment":"Jacksonville coming into this contest, but once again looked lost at Buffalo. Henne finished 18-of-41 for 208 yards, 1 touchdown, an interception and a lost fumble. Those numbers are way better than how he really looked, as the score and a big chunk of the yardage came in garbage time as Buffalo was playing prevent. Henne was just 5-of-15 for 86 yards at the break.    Henne's late, meaningless score went to Cecil Shorts (7-77), who was the only Jaguar wideout with more than 3 receptions. Shorts suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but it doesn't appear to be serious. Justin Blackmon had just 1 grab for 9 yards.    This was a rainy, sloppy matchup that naturally favored the team with the better ground attack. That obviously wasn't the Jaguars, who were missing both Maurice Jones-Drew and Jalen Parmele. Rashad Jennings (8-20) also sustained a concussion, while replacement Montell Owens was equally ineffective.    The Jaguars could have kept this game closer, but continuously shot themselves in the foot with dumb errors. For instance, right tackle Cameron Bradfield committed an incredibly idiotic personal foul when the Jaguars achieved a first down on Buffalo's 3-yard line, negating a potential touchdown. Henne had the aforementioned lost fumble by Mario Williams, giving the Bills a gift field goal. In the third quarter, a roughing-the-passer penalty by newly added Jason Babin - a questionable call according to the CBS announcers - allowed Buffalo to continue the drive and eventually find the end zone. Having said that, the Bills played very well overall and deserved to win this game. As mentioned, the rushing attack was paramount, and the Bills ran all over Jacksonville. "

   "comment":"Jackson, meanwhile, found the end zone twice with his 42 rushing yards (11 carries) and 36 receiving yards (4 catches).    E.J. Manuel had a decent performance, though it probably should have been better considering his opponent. He went 18-of-32 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Manuel appeared to suffer an injury in the first half on a play that saw Atlanta commit a roughing-the-passer penalty, but he obviously remained in the game.    I mentioned Johnson and Chandler as the 2 players who helped ruin a potential victory. They happened to lead the team in receiving; Johnson had 5 catches for 55 yards, while Chandler's 4 receptions went for 63 yards.    The Falcons struggled to move the chains early, mustering just 189 net yards of offense in the first half compared to 234 afterward. Matt Ryan went 28-of-47 for 311 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble despite a slow start. Ryan also had to deal with a ridiculous amount of pressure, as his offensive line struggled to protect against the Bills, who notched 6 sacks. Hughes was responsible for a pair. Ryan's score went to Tony Gonzalez (4-42), who logged 3 of his 4 receptions following intermission. Roddy White, meanwhile, led the Falcons with 10 catches for 143 yards.    Harry Douglas collected 6 receptions for 73 yards. Douglas drew that pass interference on Roby to set up Atlanta's tying touchdown, though again, there shouldn't have been a call.    Steven Jackson showed some rare life against the Bills. He still looked a bit slow, but he pummeled his way for 84 yards and 2 touchdown on 23 carries.   "

Henne then heaved another pick on a fade pass. Buffalo, meanwhile, didn't stay completely clean because Manuel lost a fumble. However, he wasn't too bad otherwise, going 17-of-24 for 193 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 10 times for 37 rushing yards and a third score on the ground.    Manuel's touchdowns went to Robert Woods (5-82) and fullback Frank Summers. Stevie Johnson did nothing, catching just 1 ball for 4 yards.    The Bills ran pretty well with both Fred Jackson (17-80) and C."

   "comment":"Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a 4.h-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though Aaron Dobson's injury didn't help.    As for the Bills, Lewis was pretty solid. Considering all of the drops and the horrible weather, his 16-of-29, 247-yard and 1.touchdown line is impressive. Lewis has not been any sort of downgrade from E.J. Manuel this season. Manuel obviously has more long-term potential, but Lewis has solidified himself as a solid backup.    Manuel's aerial score went to Graham (3-62). Jackson secured Buffalo's other touchdown (14-60); he was a factor in the passing game (3 catches, 53 receiving yards), though he was outgained on the ground by C."

Donald Brown (31-62) led the Chargers on the ground. Ladarius Green (4-64) made some plays, while Antonio Gates had only 1 catch for 8 yards. Keenan Allen (2-17) continued to disappoint his fantasy owners.    Manuel was 23-of-39 for 238 yards with a touchdown.

   "comment":"Jackson was the star in the Bills' backfield last week, so C.J. Spiller naturally grabbed the reins in this contest, gaining 60 yards on 15 carries, while Jackson took his mere 7 attempts for 33 yards. However, Jackson was used more in the passing game. He logged 6 catches for 52 receiving yards, while Spiller secured all 3 targets thrown his way for 24 receiving yards.    Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    "

The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as "
