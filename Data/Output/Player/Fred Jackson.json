This looked like a trap game, but Houston overcame an early deficit to win. This is the first time in the Texans' franchise history that they're 2 games over .500 (outside of a 2-0 start in 2007). It's also the first time ever that they've won a contest when favored on the road. Unfortunately, this victory for Houston comes with some unfortunate news. Daniels will be out for the rest of the year with what seems to be a torn ACL.   "

Though the Patriots barely outplayed the Bills, let's just remember how many key players they were missing. They were down 2 defensive linemen (Vince Wilfork, Ty Warren) and 2 offensive linemen (Stephen Neal, Nick Kaczur). Also, Brady is definitely not himself, though there's no telling if he'll ever be close to 100 percent before the 2010 season. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

This marked the first time that the Bills have covered the spread in Toronto. From the shots I saw from FOX's cameras, it looked like half the seats were empty. Great job screwing the great Buffalo fans out of another home game, Ralph.   "

Given Buffalo's inability to move the chains - they had just 3 first downs up until that point - a 13-0 deficit was just too much for them to overcome.    As for the Jets, Mark Sanchez played pretty well aside from that aforementioned pick, though he nearly had a second interception prior to halftime. Sanchez finished 20-of-28, 230 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Sanchez's touchdown went to "

Jackson ultimately suffered a knee injury that reportedly doesn't look good. I don't understand what the hell Gailey was thinking; his refusal to involve Spiller in this offense has cost his team multiple victories. It's bad enough to do it once or twice, but this has occurred at least half-a-dozen times already this season. He has to be axed because he clearly can't learn from his mistakes.    Despite holding a lead throughout, the Bills attempted 33 passes to just 16 runs. That's smart. "

Manuel had a decent performance, though it probably should have been better considering his opponent. He went 18-of-32 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Manuel appeared to suffer an injury in the first half on a play that saw Atlanta commit a roughing-the-passer penalty, but he obviously remained in the game.    I mentioned Johnson and Chandler as the 2 players who helped ruin a potential victory. They happened to lead the team in receiving; Johnson had 5 catches for 55 yards, while Chandler's 4 receptions went for 63 yards.    The Falcons struggled to move the chains early, mustering just 189 net yards of offense in the first half compared to 234 afterward. "
