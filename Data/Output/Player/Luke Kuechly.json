   "comment":"Luke Kuechly - went 6-of-8 for 51 yards to go along with a 9.yard scramble in the red zone during the decisive possession. He capped it off with a 2.yard floater to Stevie Johnson, who was inexplicably open in the end zone. Manuel's final numbers: 27-of-39 for 296 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. He'll be praised for the victory by the national media and Buffalo fans, but there are some issues. I already outlined the turnovers and inaccuracy. Manuel was also 10.ative at times, checking it down too often. Some of his throws in the red zone - earlier in the contest - were way off. The final drive was awesome, but he went down the field against a skeleton-crew Carolina stop unit. Part of the reason I won't blame the Panthers too much for screwing themselves out of another potential victory was because they suffered so many injuries in this contest. It started when "

   "comment":"Luke Kuechly barely touched the opponent. - Captain Munnerlyn was flagged for an unnecessary roughness for headbutting a Panther. This was a questionable penalty, but the thing that made this an absolutely horrific call was that Anquan Boldin wasn't whistled for the same exact thing right before San Francisco scored its first touchdown at the end of the opening half. - As Mike Pereira pointed out, the 49ers had 12 men in the huddle prior to that touchdown, yet Cheffers allowed them to take a player off the field. This is illegal, and San Francisco should've moved backward 5 yards, which would've probably forced a field goal, given that the team didn't have much time remaining on the clock.    Given that the Panthers were battling the unstoppable combination of Jim Harbaugh and the officials, it's understandable that some of the players would get deflated. This, however, does not excuse Cam Newton sulking on the sideline. He showed terrible body language, and even though a comeback was possible down 23-10 with 8 minutes remaining, it was obvious that the 49ers would come away with the victory. Newton had a horrific second half. After going 8-of-10 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (the pass thrown behind "

   "comment":"Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Jason Peters in the first half. Peters was carted off the field with a back injury, and losing him could be a huge blow to the Eagles' offense.    Ryan Mathews led the Eagles with 97 yards on 6 carries and a touchdown. DeMarco Murray had 65 yards on 18 carries.    Tight end Zach Ertz led Philadelphia's receivers with 5 catches for 63 yards. Jordan Matthews (3-14), Darren Sproles (5-31) and Miles Austin (4-52) were contained by Carolina's tough defense.    The Panthers' defense got another excellent game out of defensive tackle Kawann Short. For the second-straight week, Short recorded 2 sacks and caused a lot of disruption in the backfield. Jared Allen also had 2 sacks, including a clutch 1 late in the 4.h quarter. Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Josh Norman all had excellent games for Carolina."

   "comment":"Luke Kuechly to spring Freeman. After a Carolina punt was downed just outside of the end zone, Thomas Davis then made a superb play to deflect a pass from Ryan that was picked off by Kurt Coleman, who coasted into the end zone to get the Panthers back into the game. The Falcons and Panthers traded field goal drives before the half, but Carolina was lucky to be in the game as Atlanta dominated with the pick-six being the only thing that kept the Panthers close at 17-10. By the half, Jones had 7 receptions for 170 yards. The Falcons expanded their lead after halfrime as the Panthers had busted coverage where they completely forgot to cover Austin Hooper (1-42-1). That 42-yard touchdown pass gave Atlanta a 24-10 lead. Another long pass to Jones set up Ryan to loft in a beautiful 35-yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson (2-48-1). In the 4.h quarter, Atlanta added a 53-yard field goal from Matt Bryant. Down by 24, Carolina got its first offensive touchdown of the game with a 6.yard strike to Kelvin Benjamin. Newton ran in the 2.point conversion, but took a massive hit from Deion Jones. That hit sent Newton into the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, Cam Newton completed 14-of-25 passes for 165 yards with a touchdown. Newton's footwork and accuracy were off all game. Derek Anderson was 17-of-23 for 172 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions.    Greg Olsen (6-76-1), Kelvin Benjamin (3-39-1) and Corey Brown (5-48-1) chipped in touchdowns for Carolina.    Atlanta's defense got a good game from Dwight Freeney as he put a ton of pressure on the quarterback, taking advantage of the inept Mike Remmers. Not only did Remmers give up a sack and multiple hits, but he committed multiple penalties. Remmers played left tackle as Michael Oher was out with a concussion. Robert Alford hauled in 2 interceptions for Atlanta.    Luke Kuechly had 12 tackles with a sack, and Kawann Short had 5 tackles with a sack."

   "comment":"Luke Kuechly was tackled awkwardly with several minutes remaining. He was sobbing on the field and had to be carted off. It appeared as though there might have been some serious leg injury that could've ruined his career, but Kuechly was diagnosed with a concussion. It's unclear as to what was going on exactly, however, since Kuechly was extremely shaken and still had to be assisted into the locker room with a cart. He's missed multiple games because of a concussion in the past, so it's possible that he could be out for a while. The Panthers nearly lost this game despite establishing their huge lead. The Saints came charging back, shrinking the lead to 23-20. The Panthers were stuck with a third-and-10 deep in their own territory with about 2:30 remaining. A failed conversion would've given New Orleans plenty of time for a final drive to either win or force overtime - with no Kuechly on the field, by the way - but "
