   "comment":"Richard Rodgers for a 9-yard score. That was all the points the Packers' defense would need. In the second quarter, the 49ers got moving when Quinton Patton broke off a 40-yard gain. Patton came in motion, and after a shotgun snap, Kaepernick pitched the ball forward to Patton, who turned the corner to explode down the field. Sacks by Nick Perry and Jayron Elliott forced San Francisco to settle for a 33-yard field goal from Phil Dawson. Before the end of the half, the Packers drove into 49ers territory, but Mason Crosby missed a 44-yard field goal on the final play, so despite outplaying the 49ers, the Packers had only a 7-3 lead going into the locker room. In the third quarter, James Jones made an amazing catch on a beautiful 38-yard throw from Rodgers. Jones stretched out to snatch the pass while tapping his feet in bounds despite good coverage. After a holding penalty, Rodgers took off on a 17-yard run to the 1-yard line to set up a third-and-goal. John Kuhn vultured the touchdown away from Eddie Lacy and Rodgers, but Green Bay went up 14-3. Rodgers expanded the Packers' lead with a field goal drive. The Packers' defense continued to dominate as they were constantly harassing and sacking Kaepernick. He heaved a desperation bomb that was picked off by Sam Shields. Kaepernick threw his best pass of the game for a 47-yard completion to Torrey Smith, but on a 4.h-and-5, Kaepernick was sacked by Mike Neal to finish off San Francisco.    Aaron Rodgers completed 22-of-32 passes for 224 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 33 yards. He played well, but he had trouble sustaining some drives because his offensive line surrendered lots of pressures and 3 sacks.    Randall Cobb had 5 receptions for 44 yards, while Richard Rodgers (5-45) and James Jones (5-98) contributed. Eddie Lacy totaled 90 yards on 18 carries. He ran well for Green Bay.    Colin Kaepernick was 13-of-25 for 160 yards with an interception. He ran for 57 yards on 10 carries, but Kaepernick's regression is in full-blown crisis mode for San Francisco.    "

   "comment":"Richard Rodgers open in the end zone twice, but overthrew him on both occasions. As a consequence, Rivers had a chance to tie at the very end, but came up just a bit short. Rodgers finished 16-of-29 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those aren't bad numbers, by any means, but Rodgers simply didn't look right. His receiving corps and offensive line need to improve. The Packers have a bye week to get their act together.    Panic time for Eddie Lacy owners? Lacy was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 3 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Lacy had a 10.er ankle, which begs the question, why did he even play? Lacy looked slow and sluggish. He also fumbled, but was fortunate to have a teammate fall on the ball. James Starks, on the other hand, gained 112 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries, with most of his production coming on a 65-yard sprint to the end zone early on. Starks also caught a 5-yard touchdown on his only catch.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb is hurting. That was apparent, as he was able to catch just 2 balls for 38 yards. He also was guilty of a drop. James Jones had even fewer yards (2-30), but at least caught a touchdown. With Montgomery getting knocked out, Jeff Janis led the team with 79 receiving yards on 2 catches. He was targeted 4 times, though only 1 less than Cobb, Richard Rodgers and Jones.   "

   "comment":"Richard Rodgers hauled in the pass for the game-winning score. I'd say unreal, but it was destined to happen. The Packers had been struggling going into this contest, so they were very fortunate to get the much-needed win. However, this was a Pyrrhic victory. Green Bay, which already had issues on its offensive line heading into this game, lost 2 more blockers. Center Corey Linsley aggravated his ankle, while left tackle David Bakhtiari also got knocked out. Rodgers, as a result, had issues moving the chains for most of the evening because he was constantly under siege. At halftime, the Packers were averaging just 2.4 yards per play, and they had a turnover early on that led to a Detroit touchdown. It seemed like they were destined to drop to 7-5, but Detroit failed to put them away. That, and my bet doomed the Lions.    Rodgers finished 24-of-36 for 273 yards, 2 passing touchdowns and an interception, which was behind his receiver. He also did some damage on the ground, scrambling 4 times for 27 rushing yards and a score, which turned out to be the penultimate touchdown of the game. Rodgers fumbled as well, but his center recovered the ball. However, his center ended up getting hurt on the play, so that ended up being costly. Rodgers was on fire after intermission, going 14-of-20 for 193 yards and 3 scores.    Besides the win, the injuries and Rodgers' play, the big news concerning for the Packers was Eddie Lacy's benching. James Starks started, but wasn't completely effective on the ground, mustering 15 yards on 9 carries to go along with 5 catches for 45 receiving yards. He had a 32-yard reception called back, but fumbled twice. Lacy was on the field for a bit, but following some ineffective runs (5 carries, 4 yards), the fat running back was benched in favor of some practice-squad player named John Crockett, who gained 22 yards on 5 carries. Both Crockett and Starks looked much better than Lacy, who needs to lose about 20 pounds.    Richard Rodgers snared all 8 targets of his for 146 yards and the game-winning touchdown. I've heard people lamenting not playing him in fantasy, but his stat line prior to the Hail Mary was 7-85, which is solid, but not great. The play should have never even happened; the Lions could have just tackled Aaron Rodgers without getting him on the face mask - well, they actually did - and Rodgers would've never been in position to win the game with the touchdown.

   "comment":"Richard Rodgers, who are both incredibly slow, as well as Randall Cobb, who is laboring through an injury of his own.    Rodgers went 28-of-44 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was also strip-sixed, which was forced by Everson Griffen. The pick came late on a 4.h down in desperation time. Rodgers suffered through some drops from his receivers, but as I wrote earlier, he still doesn't seem like himself. One pass that stands out was a horrible miss to Jones that a healthy Rodgers would've hit 10 out of 10 times.    To illustrate how inefficient some of the Packer receivers were, Jones caught 4 passes for 102 yards, but it took him 13 targets to get there. Meanwhile, Cobb logged 6 catches, but for only 37 yards. He dropped a pass.    Green Bay's leading receiver aside from Jones, was Richard Rodgers (7-59), who scored a touchdown despite looking like the slowest person of all time. "
