Buffalo had its own turnover problems. Ryan Fitzpatrick had a really ugly outing, as he spent most of the first half lobbing interceptions to Jet linebackers. He was 4-of-12 for 24 yards and 2 picks at halftime, and most of his total yardage (191) came in that aforementioned 80-yard junk scoring possession. Fred Jackson was also guilty of a key give-away. Down just 6-0 at the beginning of the third quarter, he fumbled deep in his own territory, giving New York an easy touchdown drive. Given Buffalo's inability to move the chains - they had just 3 first downs up until that point - a 13-0 deficit was just too much for them to overcome.    As for the Jets, Mark Sanchez played pretty well aside from that aforementioned pick, though he nearly had a second interception prior to halftime. Sanchez finished 20-of-28, 230 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Sanchez's touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez went 20-of-39, 306 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and 2 picks. Sanchez was fine overall, but he's not anywhere near Brady's mental level where he can just murder a team on the fly based on a bad matchup. He also made a huge mental error by calling a timeout inside 2 minutes remaining in the first half. This allowed Brady to engineer a touchdown drive prior to intermission.    "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Dave Rayner flubbed the kickoff, hitting Emanuel Cook who was up on the front line. It looked almost like he was trying to knock the ball off an unsuspecting player and get a surprise onside kick, but up 14-7 with the half close to ending, it would make no sense. The Jets went to Greene who picked up 7 yards on a reception and another 15 was added on a personal foul by rookie Marcell Dareus. All of a sudden, they were at the Bills' 14-yard line as the 2.minute warning sounded. After 2 failed plays, Sanchez found Burress wide open for the tying touchdown pass. Buffalo's answer was 2 incompletions and another Maybin sack. New York tried to steal a field goal attempt, but couldn't get past the midfield stripe until the final play of the half. The Bills went right back to picking on Revis to start the second half with an 8-yard pass to Stevie Johnson (8-75 yards, TD), who had his fingerprints all over this result. Ex-Jets receiver "

The Eagles scored 7 plays later, giving them a 14-0 advantage and full control of the game.    Outside of Holmes' carelessness, what really hurt the Jets was the defensive liability in the middle of the defense. LeSean McCoy rushed for 102 yards and 3 touchdowns on 18 carries, while Brent Celek caught a team-high 5 balls for 156 yards and a score. With safety Jim Leonhard out for the year, New York is going to have major issues in the middle of the field. McCoy, by the way, broke Steve Van Buren's Philadelphia record for touchdowns in a single season. He has now found the end zone 20 times this season.    QB Dog Killer had a solid outing, going 15-of-22 for 274 yards, 1 passing touchdown and an interception. He also scrambled 5 times for 32 yards and a rushing score - his first of the year. He took some tough shots during the contest and appeared to grimace in pain. There's no question that he'll start next week, however.    DeSean Jackson did nothing again (2-28), but at least he had the excuse of Darrelle Revis blanketing him. A healthy Jeremy Maclin (3-57) was more productive.    Sanchez went 15-of-26 for 150 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He really didn't have much of a chance. Playing in a hole the entire game, Sanchez had to deal with a fierce pass rush that tallied 4 sacks. "

Tim Tebow, meanwhile, played just 7 snaps, carrying the ball 5 times for 11 yards. He also hauled in an attempted onside kick. Tebow was on the field on the first play as a receiver. Sanchez, as you might imagine, looked the other way and threw way wide of his target.

McElroy wasn't as awful as Sanchez, but he was pretty ineffective. He went 14-of-24 for 185 yards, an interception and a lost fumble. Worst of all, he took a ridiculous 11 sacks, including 2.5 from "

Sanchez, who has thrown 6 interceptions in 14 quarters, was responsible for a pair of picks in this contest, and he nearly had a couple of others. Both were terrible, and they were inexcusable because Sanchez forced the issue despite having a massive lead. The second interception was especially bad, as it was a terrible overthrow.

The 1 loss was a demolition at Green Bay, indicating that the Eagles won't stand a chance against the elite teams if Sanchez continues to be sloppy with the football.

With this loss, the Eagles need to win at New York and then have the Cowboys lose both of their remaining games. That could happen - Dallas has endured worse collapses - but there's no guarantee that Philadelphia will even prevail against the Giants, given the team's issues.    I mentioned the defensive breakdowns; Philadelphia's secondary was primarily responsible for this defeat. The 3 poor defensive backs - Cary Williams, Bradley Fletcher, Nate Allen - all had a big hand in this loss. Williams began the game by being penalized for unnecessary roughness on a third-down stop, pushing Andre Roberts after the play was over. DeSean Jackson torched Fletcher for a 51-yard gain on the following drive. Jackson later haul in a 55-yard bomb and then proceeded to draw what looked like 5 pass-interference flags on Allen in the end zone. Williams then whiffed on a Pierre Garcon tackle, allowing the Redskins to move in for the game-winning kick.    Sanchez didn't help matters. His fantasy numbers were great, but he was guilty of 2 turnovers. The pick at the end was a killer, and he also opened the game with a lost fumble, forced by "

This all won't matter to Kelly, as he'll be coaching at some high-profile college program in the near future.    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers did something Sunday that they had never done under coach Lovie Smith before. They won back-to-back games for the first time under Smith. They followed last week's victory against Dallas with a blowout win against Philadelphia. The victory gets the Bucs to 5-5. That's the first time they've been at .500 this late in a season since they started 6-4 under coach Greg Schiano in 2012. More importantly, the Bucs have put themselves in the playoff race. They still are well behind undefeated Carolina in the NFC South. But they now are in the mix for the wild-card spots in the muddled NFC playoff picture. It came on a day in which rookie quarterback Jameis Winston and running back Doug Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with Vincent Jackson back from an injury, Mike Evans continued to be the No. 1 wide receiver. Evans is a must-start receiver in your fantasy league. He had 4 catches for 63 yards and a touchdown.    Jackson had a nice first game back after dealing with a knee injury. He had 4 catches for 56 yards and a touchdown.    Linebacker Lavonte David and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are supposed to be the 2 cornerstones of the Tampa Bay defense. They had been taking some heat for being relatively quiet in recent weeks. But David and McCoy both had bounce-back games. David had 2 interceptions and McCoy had 1.5 sacks.

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez took the field for a bit, but Bradford was able to reenter the game to a standing ovation, as the crowd knew that it didn't have a chance with Sanchez under center. Bradford made some nice throws throughout the evening, but came up short in the second half, as he simply was too overmatched to compete in a shootout with Arizona's explosive offense. Bradford went 28-of-41 for 361 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions at the end. The first was a pick-six, which happened to be a miscommunication with "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez the rest of the way, so I'll focus on the Eagles. Sanchez the rest of the way, so I'll focus on the Eagles. Carson Wentz had a nice finale to his roller-coaster rookie year, going 27-of-43 for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns. Granted, Wentz was going up against a defense missing some starters, including Sean Lee, but despite some dangerous passes, Wentz flashed enough for Philadelphia fans to feel excited for next year. Wentz showed some great pocket awareness at times. On 1 instance, he was able to duck out of a sack and find Trey Burton for no gain. The end result isn't impressive, but Wentz avoided a big loss in the red zone, gave his teammate a chance to score, and set up a manageable third-down situation on the following play. Wentz later had a nifty scramble to move the chains in the red zone, setting up a touchdown to Zach Ertz.    Speaking of Ertz, the talented tight end had a big game, snatching 13 of his 16 targets for a whopping 139 yards and 2 touchdowns. He handed 1 of the touchdown footballs to some baseball player named Mike Trout, who apparently gave every single Eagle a pair of shoes this week. I don't know why any of this matters, but the baseball-obsessed FOX broadcast made a big deal about it.    Elsewhere in the receiving corps, the other tight end, Burton, was next with 5 catches for 39 yards. Jordan Matthews was out, so the wide receiver who posted the best stats was Paul Turner (2-30). Turner had a great preseason and might have a bright future.    Philadelphia fans definitely had a great time booing Sanchez, who was predictably horrible, save for 1 drive. Sanchez finished 9-of-17 for 85 yards and 2 interceptions. The first pick was a great play by "
