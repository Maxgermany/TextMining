Sharper backed up his talk and helped the Saints improve to 4-0.    Sanchez really struggled. After turning the ball over just 3 times in his first 3 starts, Sanchez coughed it up 4 times in this contest. He was just 14-of-27 for 138 yards with 3 picks and a fumble.

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez tossed an ugly interception in the end zone following a long opening drive. In the second quarter, there was a botched snap between Sanchez and Nick Mangold.    Buffalo had its own turnover problems. Ryan Fitzpatrick had a really ugly outing, as he spent most of the first half lobbing interceptions to Jet linebackers. He was 4-of-12 for 24 yards and 2 picks at halftime, and most of his total yardage (191) came in that aforementioned 80-yard junk scoring possession. Fred Jackson was also guilty of a key give-away. Down just 6-0 at the beginning of the third quarter, he fumbled deep in his own territory, giving New York an easy touchdown drive. Given Buffalo's inability to move the chains - they had just 3 first downs up until that point - a 13-0 deficit was just too much for them to overcome.    As for the Jets, Mark Sanchez played pretty well aside from that aforementioned pick, though he nearly had a second interception prior to halftime. Sanchez finished 20-of-28, 230 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Sanchez's touchdown went to "

He takes stupid sacks, makes careless mistakes and can't fire accurate accurate passes consistently. Sanchez went 13-of-29 for 103 yards an interception and a lost fumble on a third down in San Francisco territory. Sanchez nearly tossed a couple of other picks, as the crowd booed him mercilessly throughout the entire contest. I tweeted () the following during the third quarter following 1 of Sanchez's turnovers: Hey Jets, it's Tebow time. It really is. It has to be. Even if you're not a Tebow believer, you have to at least agree that it's time for New York to give up on Sanchez, and Tebow is the only alternative. Tebow was on the field on several occasions. He completed his only pass attempt for 9 yards, on a 3rd-and-1. However, his tight end fumbled the football after a fierce hit and the 49ers recovered it.    That wasn't the only instance in which an injured Jet coughed up the football while writhing in pain. "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez threw for 300-plus yards a week ago. Ugh. The stupid Patriots' defense is ruining my semi-trolling. </i>    The Miami Dolphins went on the road and proved that their strong start to the season was no fluke. They dominated the Jets in every aspect with a tremendous day defensively and on special teams alongside an efficient offense led by backup quarterback Matt Moore. New York played New England tough in an overtime loss a week ago, but the Jets looked like a team that belongs in the top 5 of the 2013 NFL Draft. Miami's special teams earned its franchise an early lead with a fabulous first half. It was 1 of the most impressive performances you'll ever see. Special teams pulled off an onside kick, a blocked a punt for a touchdown, a blocked a field goal and a long kick return by Marcus Thigpen.  The Jets were caught completely by surprise by the onside kick after the Dolphins had a field goal drive with the heavy lifting done by Reggie Bush (14-59). Miami lost starter Ryan Tannehill to quad and knee injuries early in the following a sack by Calvin Pace. The Dolphins took a 10-0 lead after a punt was blocked by Jimmy Wilson and recovered in the end zone by Olivier Vernon.    Mark Sanchez stunk up the field. He started the game slowly and couldn't sustain drives. Sanchez was strip-sacked on a corner blitz by "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez, who earlier tossed an ugly interception in the red zone, scrambled, inexplicably ran into his own guard and fumbled. The Patriots picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Joe McKnight had a fumble pop into the air, which was brought back for 6. A 56-yard Brady-to-Julian Edelman touchdown later, and New England was suddenly up 35-0. The frustrated crowd continuously chanted Te-bow for the rest of the evening, but Rex Ryan didn't listen to his fans' wishes. He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field. I think Ryan is full of crap. </i>    Tom Brady, meanwhile, went 18-of-28 for 323 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). He missed a couple of deep throws in the third quarter that had him frustrated, but was otherwise flawless. He was totally dialed in, as he was on a mission to prove that his offense could score without Rob Gronkowski.    Outside of "

Kelly, however, was more interested in padding his offensive stats in a meaningless game. He accomplished this, thanks to another fluky special-teams score, which was a blocked punt returned for a touchdown. Kelly went with Sanchez, who had a solid outing in his final game with the Eagles, for the most part. Sanchez went 23-of-36 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was a bad 1. as he stared down his receiver, and it led to a New York field goal. Sanchez hurled 2 other potential interceptions. One was actually snatched out of the air, but it was negated by a poor pass-interference penalty. Another errant pass was heaved into double coverage, but New York failed to come away with the turnover. Sanchez, however, did enough to move the chains consistently, opening the game with a 44-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez. Chip Kelly's horrible roster mismangement has depleted the roster, so Philadelphia can't be competitive if it has some injuries to deal with (i.e. to Jordan Hicks). This all won't matter to Kelly, as he'll be coaching at some high-profile college program in the near future.    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers did something Sunday that they had never done under coach Lovie Smith before. They won back-to-back games for the first time under Smith. They followed last week's victory against Dallas with a blowout win against Philadelphia. The victory gets the Bucs to 5-5. That's the first time they've been at .500 this late in a season since they started 6-4 under coach Greg Schiano in 2012. More importantly, the Bucs have put themselves in the playoff race. They still are well behind undefeated Carolina in the NFC South. But they now are in the mix for the wild-card spots in the muddled NFC playoff picture. It came on a day in which rookie quarterback Jameis Winston and running back Doug Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with Vincent Jackson back from an injury, Mike Evans continued to be the No. 1 wide receiver. Evans is a must-start receiver in your fantasy league. He had 4 catches for 63 yards and a touchdown.    Jackson had a nice first game back after dealing with a knee injury. He had 4 catches for 56 yards and a touchdown.    Linebacker Lavonte David and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are supposed to be the 2 cornerstones of the Tampa Bay defense. They had been taking some heat for being relatively quiet in recent weeks. But David and McCoy both had bounce-back games. David had 2 interceptions and McCoy had 1.5 sacks.    For Philadelphia, Mark Sanchez started at quarterback in place of the injured Sam Bradford but wasn't able to spark the offense. Sanchez completed 26-of-41 passes for 261 yards, with much of his yardage coming after the game already had been decided. Sanchez threw for 2 touchdowns, but was intercepted 3 times.    Philadelphia wasn't able to get much going against Tampa Bay's run defense. "

   "comment":"Mark Sanchez this past offseason was a head-scratcher at the time, especially when he traded for the injury-prone Sam Bradford. It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. "
