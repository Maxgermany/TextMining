   "comment":"Sanchez interceptions in the first quarter and a half. Most importantly, they couldn't get off the field; Houston let a rookie quarterback making his first NFL start convert 10-of-18 third downs. And these weren't just short-yardage situations; Sanchez moved the chains on 3rd-and-10 (3 times), 3rd-and-7 (twice), 3rd-and-9 and 3rd-and-8.    One interesting thing before we move on to the Jets. There were really 2 defenses that put the clamps on Houston's offense last year: Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Rex Ryan was the defensive coordinator for the Ravens in 2008; clearly, he has the perfect blueprint to shut down the Texans.    Mark Sanchez was brilliant in his first start; he was 18-of-31 for 272 yards, a touchdown and a pick. Sanchez did have 3 potential interceptions dropped, but he also converted 10-of-18 third downs, which is simply amazing for a rookie making his first NFL start in a hostile environment.    "

Even though the defense held Ben Roethlisberger to 7-of-14 passing for 96 yards and an interception prior to intermission, it could not stop the Steelers. Rashard Mendenhall trampled the Jets for 121 yards on 27 carries. Isaac Redman, meanwhile, chipped in with 27 yards on just 4 attempts. Rex Ryan's defense showed no interest in tackling. It was pathetic. The Steelers actually had more points (24) by halftime than New York ran plays (22).    The Jets were better in the second half - perhaps because Maurkice Pouncey injured his ankle - allowing Mark Sanchez to nearly engineer a miraculous comeback. Sanchez went 20-of-33 for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was ultimately betrayed by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's slow and shoddy play-calling inside the red zone. I really have no idea why "

The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Dave Rayner flubbed the kickoff, hitting Emanuel Cook who was up on the front line. It looked almost like he was trying to knock the ball off an unsuspecting player and get a surprise onside kick, but up 14-7 with the half close to ending, it would make no sense. The Jets went to Greene who picked up 7 yards on a reception and another 15 was added on a personal foul by rookie Marcell Dareus. All of a sudden, they were at the Bills' 14-yard line as the 2.minute warning sounded. After 2 failed plays, Sanchez found Burress wide open for the tying touchdown pass. Buffalo's answer was 2 incompletions and another Maybin sack. New York tried to steal a field goal attempt, but couldn't get past the midfield stripe until the final play of the half. The Bills went right back to picking on Revis to start the second half with an 8-yard pass to Stevie Johnson (8-75 yards, TD), who had his fingerprints all over this result. Ex-Jets receiver "

As illustrated above, the Chiefs were unable to do anything on offense, so they were at their opponent's mercy. After a quick exchange of punts, however, a 3.and-out did result in a 53-yard field goal by Ryan Succop to pull to 7-3 thanks to nice field position from a Javier Arenas punt return. Ironically, the play that got New York in charge also hurt them. Jets safety Jim Leonhard snagged an interception in plus territory, but injured his knee and is reportedly done for the season. Perhaps it is a case of d?j? vu, since he went down late in 2010, yet the team still rallied to make the AFC Championship Game. New York is going to miss his presence down the stretch, but the turnover led to a quick score. Greene caught a pass and took it 36 yards. After a loss by LaDainian Tomlinson, Sanchez threw to Santonio Holmes for a touchdown and the 14-3 advantage."

   "comment":"Sanchez pass that was intercepted in the red zone. The Eagles scored 7 plays later, giving them a 14-0 advantage and full control of the game.    Outside of Holmes' carelessness, what really hurt the Jets was the defensive liability in the middle of the defense. LeSean McCoy rushed for 102 yards and 3 touchdowns on 18 carries, while Brent Celek caught a team-high 5 balls for 156 yards and a score. With safety Jim Leonhard out for the year, New York is going to have major issues in the middle of the field. McCoy, by the way, broke Steve Van Buren's Philadelphia record for touchdowns in a single season. He has now found the end zone 20 times this season.    QB Dog Killer had a solid outing, going 15-of-22 for 274 yards, 1 passing touchdown and an interception. He also scrambled 5 times for 32 yards and a rushing score - his first of the year. He took some tough shots during the contest and appeared to grimace in pain. There's no question that he'll start next week, however.    DeSean Jackson did nothing again (2-28), but at least he had the excuse of Darrelle Revis blanketing him. A healthy Jeremy Maclin (3-57) was more productive.    Sanchez went 15-of-26 for 150 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He really didn't have much of a chance. Playing in a hole the entire game, Sanchez had to deal with a fierce pass rush that tallied 4 sacks. "

   "comment":"Sanchez attempt futile passes all afternoon. It's really laughable how bad Sanchez is. He takes stupid sacks, makes careless mistakes and can't fire accurate accurate passes consistently. Sanchez went 13-of-29 for 103 yards an interception and a lost fumble on a third down in San Francisco territory. Sanchez nearly tossed a couple of other picks, as the crowd booed him mercilessly throughout the entire contest. I tweeted () the following during the third quarter following 1 of Sanchez's turnovers: Hey Jets, it's Tebow time. It really is. It has to be. Even if you're not a Tebow believer, you have to at least agree that it's time for New York to give up on Sanchez, and Tebow is the only alternative. Tebow was on the field on several occasions. He completed his only pass attempt for 9 yards, on a 3rd-and-1. However, his tight end fumbled the football after a fierce hit and the 49ers recovered it.    That wasn't the only instance in which an injured Jet coughed up the football while writhing in pain. "

Gronkowski finished the drive with a diving 17-yard touchdown catch. New England tacked on 2 more after a botched handoff by Sanchez and Greene rolled into the end zone.

The stupid Patriots' defense is ruining my semi-trolling. </i>    The Miami Dolphins went on the road and proved that their strong start to the season was no fluke. They dominated the Jets in every aspect with a tremendous day defensively and on special teams alongside an efficient offense led by backup quarterback Matt Moore. New York played New England tough in an overtime loss a week ago, but the Jets looked like a team that belongs in the top 5 of the 2013 NFL Draft. Miami's special teams earned its franchise an early lead with a fabulous first half. It was 1 of the most impressive performances you'll ever see. Special teams pulled off an onside kick, a blocked a punt for a touchdown, a blocked a field goal and a long kick return by Marcus Thigpen.  The Jets were caught completely by surprise by the onside kick after the Dolphins had a field goal drive with the heavy lifting done by Reggie Bush (14-59). Miami lost starter Ryan Tannehill to quad and knee injuries early in the following a sack by Calvin Pace. The Dolphins took a 10-0 lead after a punt was blocked by Jimmy Wilson and recovered in the end zone by Olivier Vernon.    Mark Sanchez stunk up the field. He started the game slowly and couldn't sustain drives. Sanchez was strip-sacked on a corner blitz by "

   "comment":"Sanchez, who earlier tossed an ugly interception in the red zone, scrambled, inexplicably ran into his own guard and fumbled. The Patriots picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Joe McKnight had a fumble pop into the air, which was brought back for 6. A 56-yard Brady-to-Julian Edelman touchdown later, and New England was suddenly up 35-0. The frustrated crowd continuously chanted Te-bow for the rest of the evening, but Rex Ryan didn't listen to his fans' wishes. He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field. I think Ryan is full of crap. </i>    Tom Brady, meanwhile, went 18-of-28 for 323 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). He missed a couple of deep throws in the third quarter that had him frustrated, but was otherwise flawless. He was totally dialed in, as he was on a mission to prove that his offense could score without Rob Gronkowski.    Outside of "

   "comment":"Sanchez. The backup quarterback would have given this game away had the Titans been remotely competitive. Sanchez, who has thrown 6 interceptions in 14 quarters, was responsible for a pair of picks in this contest, and he nearly had a couple of others. Both were terrible, and they were inexcusable because Sanchez forced the issue despite having a massive lead. The second interception was especially bad, as it was a terrible overthrow. Sanchez, who went 30-of-47 for 307 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks, is now 2-1 as Philadelphia's starter. However, 2 of his victories have come against a pair ofmiserable teams (Carolina, Tennessee) at home. The 1 loss was a demolition at Green Bay, indicating that the Eagles won't stand a chance against the elite teams if Sanchez continues to be sloppy with the football. Meanwhile, there's a second reason why the Eagles probably won't go very far if they make the playoffs, and that would be their secondary. The defensive backs allowed "

I mentioned the defensive breakdowns; Philadelphia's secondary was primarily responsible for this defeat. The 3 poor defensive backs - Cary Williams, Bradley Fletcher, Nate Allen - all had a big hand in this loss. Williams began the game by being penalized for unnecessary roughness on a third-down stop, pushing Andre Roberts after the play was over. DeSean Jackson torched Fletcher for a 51-yard gain on the following drive. Jackson later haul in a 55-yard bomb and then proceeded to draw what looked like 5 pass-interference flags on Allen in the end zone. Williams then whiffed on a Pierre Garcon tackle, allowing the Redskins to move in for the game-winning kick.    Sanchez didn't help matters.

   "comment":"Sanchez headed for free agency, Chip Kelly probably should've discovered if Barkley could function as his backup signal-caller. Kelly, however, was more interested in padding his offensive stats in a meaningless game. He accomplished this, thanks to another fluky special-teams score, which was a blocked punt returned for a touchdown. Kelly went with Sanchez, who had a solid outing in his final game with the Eagles, for the most part. Sanchez went 23-of-36 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was a bad 1. as he stared down his receiver, and it led to a New York field goal. Sanchez hurled 2 other potential interceptions. One was actually snatched out of the air, but it was negated by a poor pass-interference penalty. Another errant pass was heaved into double coverage, but New York failed to come away with the turnover. Sanchez, however, did enough to move the chains consistently, opening the game with a 44-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Sanchez. Chip Kelly's horrible roster mismangement has depleted the roster, so Philadelphia can't be competitive if it has some injuries to deal with (i.e. to Jordan Hicks). This all won't matter to Kelly, as he'll be coaching at some high-profile college program in the near future.    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers did something Sunday that they had never done under coach Lovie Smith before. They won back-to-back games for the first time under Smith. They followed last week's victory against Dallas with a blowout win against Philadelphia. The victory gets the Bucs to 5-5. That's the first time they've been at .500 this late in a season since they started 6-4 under coach Greg Schiano in 2012. More importantly, the Bucs have put themselves in the playoff race. They still are well behind undefeated Carolina in the NFC South. But they now are in the mix for the wild-card spots in the muddled NFC playoff picture. It came on a day in which rookie quarterback Jameis Winston and running back Doug Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with Vincent Jackson back from an injury, Mike Evans continued to be the No. 1 wide receiver. Evans is a must-start receiver in your fantasy league. He had 4 catches for 63 yards and a touchdown.    Jackson had a nice first game back after dealing with a knee injury. He had 4 catches for 56 yards and a touchdown.    Linebacker Lavonte David and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are supposed to be the 2 cornerstones of the Tampa Bay defense. They had been taking some heat for being relatively quiet in recent weeks. But David and McCoy both had bounce-back games. David had 2 interceptions and McCoy had 1.5 sacks.    For Philadelphia, Mark Sanchez started at quarterback in place of the injured Sam Bradford but wasn't able to spark the offense. Sanchez completed 26-of-41 passes for 261 yards, with much of his yardage coming after the game already had been decided. Sanchez threw for 2 touchdowns, but was intercepted 3 times.    Philadelphia wasn't able to get much going against Tampa Bay's run defense. "

It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. "

   "comment":"Sanchez the rest of the way, so I'll focus on the Eagles. Carson Wentz had a nice finale to his roller-coaster rookie year, going 27-of-43 for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns. Granted, Wentz was going up against a defense missing some starters, including Sean Lee, but despite some dangerous passes, Wentz flashed enough for Philadelphia fans to feel excited for next year. Wentz showed some great pocket awareness at times. On 1 instance, he was able to duck out of a sack and find Trey Burton for no gain. The end result isn't impressive, but Wentz avoided a big loss in the red zone, gave his teammate a chance to score, and set up a manageable third-down situation on the following play. Wentz later had a nifty scramble to move the chains in the red zone, setting up a touchdown to Zach Ertz.    Speaking of Ertz, the talented tight end had a big game, snatching 13 of his 16 targets for a whopping 139 yards and 2 touchdowns. He handed 1 of the touchdown footballs to some baseball player named Mike Trout, who apparently gave every single Eagle a pair of shoes this week. I don't know why any of this matters, but the baseball-obsessed FOX broadcast made a big deal about it.    Elsewhere in the receiving corps, the other tight end, Burton, was next with 5 catches for 39 yards. Jordan Matthews was out, so the wide receiver who posted the best stats was Paul Turner (2-30). Turner had a great preseason and might have a bright future.    Philadelphia fans definitely had a great time booing Sanchez, who was predictably horrible, save for 1 drive. Sanchez finished 9-of-17 for 85 yards and 2 interceptions. The first pick was a great play by "
