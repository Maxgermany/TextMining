He launched a pass off his back foot into double coverage, allowing Tennessee to snatch it away. Luck was ultimately sacked thrice, but the number could have been much greater. Luck finished 18-of-30 for 260 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Considering the amount of pressure Luck was under in this game, those numbers have to be considered pretty impressive. Of course, the Titans have a poor defense that had issues against Johnny Manziel a week ago, so Luck's struggles don't bode well going forward. Perhaps the Colts will be able to get things together in terms of their putrid blocking, but there are major concerns around Luck. If you can deal him for something close to equal value, I'd pull the trigger.    "
