The Packers answered when Matt Flynn hit James Jones on a slant that he broke down the field for a 39-yard gain. DeMarcus Ware and Orlando Scandrick had a sack, but Mason Crosby hit a 27-yard field goal to tie it. DeMarco Murray soon ripped off a 41-yard run up the middle, and a pass to Dez Bryant set up Bailey's second 3.pointer. Romo went down the seam to Jason Witten (4-71) for a 25-yard touchdown in the final seconds of the first quarter. Flynn threw a pick to Sterling Moore, and Bailey ended up with 2 more field goals before halftime. Romo hit a slant and go to Bryant for 37 yards. A few plays later, Murray charged into the end zone from a yard out for a 26-3 lead. Settling for all those field goals came back to bite Dallas. On the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Eddie Lacy took off on a 60-yard run. That led to Jordy Nelson (5-61) outfighting Orlando Scandrick on a jump ball for a touchdown. After another Bailey field goal, the Packers got 6 more with Flynn leading a drive. He connected with Andrew Quarless on a short slant for the score. Datone Jones and Clay Matthews sacked Romo on a third down just in front of the end zone. A punt return by Micah Hyde set up Green Bay at the Dallas 22-yard line. The drive finished with a middle screen to James Starks for a score. The Packers looked ready to take the lead when a pass deflected off Witten and was intercepted by Tramon Williams. He returned the pass inside the Dallas 10, but the review ruled Williams had trapped the ball. Romo took advantage of the opportunity and hit another big gainer down the seam to Witten. To end the drive, Bryant made a miraculous catch over 2 defenders for a touchdown. Flynn got a big completion to "

   "comment":"Williams was lost in coverage. This was followed by a touchdown to Rishard Matthews, giving the Titans a quick score and the lead, which Tenessee would never relinquish. Mariota did a great job of moving the chains the entire afternoon; he was 7-of-13 on third-down conversions, as he absolutely murdered the Browns on several third-and-long situations. He constantly fired toward Kendall Wright, who beat Williams and safety Derrick Kindred like a rented mule the entire contest."
