One last thing I'd like to emphaize - and I said this in my - is that the Broncos are not 22 points better than Baltimore. If the 2 teams played this game 100 times, most of the results wouldn't be double-digit blowouts. A series of unfortunate events did the Ravens in, so they looked much worse than they really are. As a consequence, they could be a good bet on team going forward.   "
