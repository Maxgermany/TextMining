   "comment":"Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Jared Crick at the Tennessee's 10-yard line. Houston could only get 3 out of the turnover, but it didn't matter because the defense slammed the door on the Titans.    DeAndre Hopkins totaled 94 yards on 8 catches with a score. Nate Washington made 4 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Hoyer completed 23-of-35 for 235 yards with 2 scores. Alfred Blue, meanwhile, recorded 39 yards on 14 carries, a disappointing showing.    Zach Mettenberger went 22-of-31 for 171 yards with an interception. Antonio Andrews actually ran pretty well for the Titans, notching 64 yards on 16 carries.    Tight end Delanie Walker led Tennessee with 62 yards on 6 receptions. Kendall Wright (4-21), Justin Hunter (2-17) and Dorial Green-Beckham (1-12) couldn't do much with Mettenberger and the offensive line struggling.    Tennessee's defense played well considering the tough positions they were put in. The Texans couldn't run the ball with only Hopkins and Washington making plays for the offense. Karl Klug, Brian Orakpo, Jurrell Casey and Zach Brown all notched sacks for the Titans.    The Texans' defense was superb and finally played a complete game. Mercilus and Watt were animals off the edge. Mercilus recorded 3.5 sacks, while Watt notched 2.5 and a forced fumble. Jared Crick chipped in another sack. Rookie corner Kevin Johnson made 6 tackles, plus an interception, and played extremely well. The 1 negative was that "

   "comment":"Kevin Johnson for a short touchdown catch. The Texans got going with Chris Polk gashing Buffalo for 20 yards, before Hoyer converted a third down with a pass to offensive lineman Kendall Lamm, and then Jonathan Grimes ran for 18 yards on a third-and-7. The Texans ran a quick play when the Bills defense wasn't even lined up, so Hoyer threw to the flat to Ryan Griffin, who walked into the end zone from a few yards out. Nick Novak missed the extra point. Buffalo came right back as McCoy bounced a run to the outside for 32 yards. More McCoy runs moved the ball inside the 10-yard line. Taylor finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans answered as Hoyer methodically moved the ball down the field before throwing an 11-yard touchdown to Polk. Watkins soon beat Johnson again for a 53-yard bomb inside the Houston 20. On third-and-goal, Robert Woods beat Johnson for a short touchdown. The Bills took a 21-13 lead into halftime. Late in the third quarter, Watkins burned Jonathan Joseph on a double move to get open for a 52-yard catch. Buffalo missed the field goal, though. DeAndre Hopkins came alive as the Texans moved the ball down the field with passes to their star receiver for catches of 23 and 29 yards. He got away with a push-off on Ronald Darby to haul in a 19-yard touchdown to finish the possession. Grimes ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. McCoy ripped off a 20-yard run to get Buffalo to midfield in response. After the 2-minute warning, Charles Clay got wide open down the field for a 40-yard touchdown in busted coverage. Dan Carpenter missed the extra point, but the Bills' defense slammed the door for the win. Carpenter added a field goal after the Texans went 4.and-out.    Taylor was 11-of-21 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 28 yards and a score as well. Taylor played well against a good Houston defense, but got lucky as interceptions were dropped by Kevin Johnson and Andre Hal in the 4."
