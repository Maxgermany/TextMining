   "comment":"Vaccaro to the Saints' 2-yard line. A quick out to Brandon Marshall for 6 and a 2.point run by Matt Forte pulled the Bears within 8. but Chicago couldn't get the ball back with enough time. Cutler was 24-of-33 on the afternoon for 358 yards with 2 scores. He also ran for 27 yards on 4 carries.    The Bears' defense did a nice job of holding the Saints to field goals, but Chicago was unable to generate any takeaways. Lance Briggs was all over the place with 14 tackles and a sack, but he jumped offsides with 6 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-1 when New Orleans was probably not going to snap the ball. That allowed the Saints to drain more time off the clock and kick a field goal.    New Orleans' defense got good games from Curtis Lofton (9 tackles) and Jabari Greer, who did a good job defending Marshall. Aside from getting burned late by Jeffery, Vaccaro played well with 6 tackles and a sack.   "
