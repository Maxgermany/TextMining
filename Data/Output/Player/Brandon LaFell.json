   "comment":"Brandon LaFell. He went up over corner LaFell. He went up over corner E.J. Biggers to make the catch and raced downfield about 60 yards for a score. The touchdown went for a total of 91 yards. At halftime, Carolina had a 20-10 lead. Freeman threw a pick to start the second half, and that set up a 22-yard touchdown run by Williams. After that, Tampa Bay started to move down the field. Freeman made a nice completion on a trick play to Kellen Winslow, but when the veteran tight end tried to hurdle a defender, it all went wrong. He got hit in mid-air and fumbled the ball away to the Panthers. That started another Carolina scoring drive that culminated with a short touchdown pass from Newton to Jonathan Stewart. The Panthers then piled it on with a 49-yard touchdown run from Newton straight up the middle of the Buccaneers' defense. On the play, linebacker Quincy Black got caught overpursuing, while safety Tanard Jackson looked 10.ative trying to tackle Newton. Tampa Bay then fumbled the ball to Carolina on the kickoff, and Newton tossed a short touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey.    Tampa Bay just doesn't have the talent on its roster to match up and compete in the NFL. Every week, the opposition exploits mismatches throughout the Buccaneers' stop unit. Their run defense is awful due to pitiful gap integrity and bad linebackers. Their secondary is targeted and overwhelmed every week.    In their 2 games this season, the Panthers illustrated that there is a huge talent discrepancy between them and the Buccaneers. Carolina has outscored Tampa in 2 meetings, 86-35.    Freeman was 28-of-38 for 274 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving with 6 receptions for 63 yards.    Newton went 12-of-17 for 171 yards and 3 scores. He also ran for 65 yards and a score on 6 carries. Stewart (88 yards) and Williams (66 yards) had only 7 carries each. LaFell led Carloina in receiving with 3 receptions for 103 yards and a score.

   "comment":"Brandon LaFell, who beat rookie safety Mark Barron to get wide open.LaFell, who beat rookie safety Mark Barron to get wide open. Newton dropped in a bomb for 51 yards to Louis Murphy after he beat Talib down the field with 5 minutes in the 4.h quarter. The drive stalled inside the 5.yard line and Carolina settled for a field goal.    Tampa Bay ran out the clock with Martin to seal the win for new head coach Greg Schiano. The rookie running back totaled 95 yards on 24 carries. LeGarrette Blount had 8 yards on just 3 attempts. Wide receiver Vincent Jackson caught 4 passes for 47 yards. Freeman was 16-of-24 for 138 yards.    Newton completed 23-of-33 attempts for 303 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks. Smith (7-106), LaFell (3-65), Murphy (3-63) and Olsen (6-56) all did a good job of getting open.    If you need a tight end for your fantasy team, consider trading for Olsen. Without Jeremy Shockey on the team, all the tight end targets are going to Olsen rather than being split between the 2 tight ends. He had a good game and was open on other plays, but Newton didn't have the time to get him the ball.   "

His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from Michael Crabtree (3-26), who made a leaping grab for 20 yards in the second quarter.

Gray, who said his cell phone ran out of power, will regret not buying a new charger, as his missed practice may have ruined his entire NFL career.    Only 5 Patriots caught passes, but all of them had 5 or more receptions. Julian Edelman led the team with 11 grabs for 89 yards, while LaFell (9-98) paced the team in yardage. The 2 tight ends were also involved; Gronkowski had 5 catches for 78 yards, while Tim Wiright (5-36) secured both of Brady's touchdowns because the defense was so focused on Gronk. "

Any competent secondary would've picked off the pass, but Brady had the great fortune of battling a defensive backfield that's in shambles. Brady finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He easily could've thrown a third score, as Dion Lewis dropped a sure touchdown. Then again, his afternoon could've been a lot worse if the Redskins' miserable secondary managed to intercept him on that pseudo-punt. The pass protection is an issue, but not against crap opponents like Washington and the 3 other awful teams in the AFC East.    Brady's touchdowns went to Julian Edelman (5-55) and Brandon Bolden. The former converted a 4.h-and-2 on the opening drive with a 5-yard reception, but was guilty of a fumble in Washington territory after his team recovered an onside kick.    Brady's leading receiver was Brandon LaFell, who caught 5 balls for 102 yards. This wasn't fluky either; he paced the team with 9 targets. "
