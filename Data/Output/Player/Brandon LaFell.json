   "comment":"LaFell. He went up over corner E.J. Biggers to make the catch and raced downfield about 60 yards for a score. The touchdown went for a total of 91 yards. At halftime, Carolina had a 20-10 lead. Freeman threw a pick to start the second half, and that set up a 22-yard touchdown run by Williams. After that, Tampa Bay started to move down the field. Freeman made a nice completion on a trick play to Kellen Winslow, but when the veteran tight end tried to hurdle a defender, it all went wrong. He got hit in mid-air and fumbled the ball away to the Panthers. That started another Carolina scoring drive that culminated with a short touchdown pass from Newton to Jonathan Stewart. The Panthers then piled it on with a 49-yard touchdown run from Newton straight up the middle of the Buccaneers' defense. On the play, linebacker Quincy Black got caught overpursuing, while safety Tanard Jackson looked tentative trying to tackle Newton. Tampa Bay then fumbled the ball to Carolina on the kickoff, and Newton tossed a short touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey.    Tampa Bay just doesn't have the talent on its roster to match up and compete in the NFL. Every week, the opposition exploits mismatches throughout the Buccaneers' stop unit. Their run defense is awful due to pitiful gap integrity and bad linebackers. Their secondary is targeted and overwhelmed every week.    In their 2 games this season, the Panthers illustrated that there is a huge talent discrepancy between them and the Buccaneers. Carolina has outscored Tampa in 2 meetings, 86-35.    Freeman was 28-of-38 for 274 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving with 6 receptions for 63 yards.    Newton went 12-of-17 for 171 yards and 3 scores. He also ran for 65 yards and a score on 6 carries. Stewart (88 yards) and Williams (66 yards) had only 7 carries each. LaFell led Carloina in receiving with 3 receptions for 103 yards and a score.

   "comment":"LaFell, who beat rookie safety Mark Barron to get wide open. Newton dropped in a bomb for 51 yards to Louis Murphy after he beat Talib down the field with 5 minutes in the fourth quarter. The drive stalled inside the 5-yard line and Carolina settled for a field goal.    Tampa Bay ran out the clock with Martin to seal the win for new head coach Greg Schiano. The rookie running back totaled 95 yards on 24 carries. LeGarrette Blount had 8 yards on just 3 attempts. Wide receiver Vincent Jackson caught 4 passes for 47 yards. Freeman was 16-of-24 for 138 yards.    Newton completed 23-of-33 attempts for 303 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks. Smith (7-106), LaFell (3-65), Murphy (3-63) and Olsen (6-56) all did a good job of getting open.    If you need a tight end for your fantasy team, consider trading for Olsen. Without Jeremy Shockey on the team, all the tight end targets are going to Olsen rather than being split between the 2 tight ends. He had a good game and was open on other plays, but Newton didn't have the time to get him the ball.   "

He also has to use his legs more frequently. It's inexcusable that he scrambled only 4 times for 25 rushing yards.    Four Panthers had 4 or more receptions: Greg Olsen (5-79), Ted Ginn (4-78), Smith (4-60) and LaFell (4-47). Peterson did a number on Smith, who was frustrated enough to commit a pass-interference flag by pushing off the Pro Bowl corner. "

His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from Michael Crabtree (3-26), who made a leaping grab for 20 yards in the second quarter. Davis, meanwhile, had just 1 catch for 1 yard, but he did reel in Kaepernick's sole aerial touchdown by somehow dragging his feet inbounds as he was falling out of the end zone.    Some stats/notes for the Panthers: - DeAngelo Williams struggled to run the ball, mustering just 13 yards on 5 carries. Mike Tolbert outgained him with 20 yards on 8 attempts. - Only 4 Panthers caught passes, and all 4 of them had 4 receptions: Ginn (4-104), Smith (4-74, TD), Olsen (4-55) and LaFell (4-34). - Carolina suffered a tough injury to safety "

   "comment":"LaFell for a potential score. However, he got things together and continued to shred Detroit's overwhelmed secondary. He finished 38-of-53 for 349 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. With Gronkowski healthy, and a strong running game in support, it's difficult to imagine Brady slowing down anytime soon.    Speaking of the powerful ground attack, it was someone completely different this week. Jonas Gray rumbled for 201 yards and 4 scores Sunday night against the Colts, but he was nowhere to be seen in this game. Gray didn't even have a single touch despite being active, as Bill Belichick wanted to teach him a lesson for showing up late for practice. Gray may have lost his job permanently, as LeGarrette Blount was very effective, gaining 78 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 12 carries. Gray, who said his cell phone ran out of power, will regret not buying a new charger, as his missed practice may have ruined his entire NFL career.    Only 5 Patriots caught passes, but all of them had 5 or more receptions. Julian Edelman led the team with 11 grabs for 89 yards, while LaFell (9-98) paced the team in yardage. The 2 tight ends were also involved; Gronkowski had 5 catches for 78 yards, while Tim Wiright (5-36) secured both of Brady's touchdowns because the defense was so focused on Gronk. "

The 2 CBS announcers were clamoring for Philbin to throw the red flag, but he didn't even seem like he was aware that it was a close play that should be looked at. This was significant because the Patriots ultimately scored on that drive.    The Patriots ran well against the Dolphins, who were missing 2 starting linebackers. "

Any competent secondary would've picked off the pass, but Brady had the great fortune of battling a defensive backfield that's in shambles. Brady finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He easily could've thrown a third score, as Dion Lewis dropped a sure touchdown. Then again, his afternoon could've been a lot worse if the Redskins' miserable secondary managed to intercept him on that pseudo-punt. The pass protection is an issue, but not against crap opponents like Washington and the 3 other awful teams in the AFC East.    Brady's touchdowns went to Julian Edelman (5-55) and Brandon Bolden. The former converted a fourth-and-2 on the opening drive with a 5-yard reception, but was guilty of a fumble in Washington territory after his team recovered an onside kick.
