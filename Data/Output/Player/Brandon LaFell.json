   "comment":"Brandon LaFell) in the first half, Newton was just 7-of-12 for 72 yards and a pick (overthrow into double coverage) after the break, subtracting a garbage-time 59-yard flip to Ted Ginn. His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from Michael Crabtree (3-26), who made a leaping grab for 20 yards in the second quarter. Davis, meanwhile, had just 1 catch for 1 yard, but he did reel in Kaepernick's sole aerial touchdown by somehow dragging his feet inbounds as he was falling out of the end zone.    Some stats/notes for the Panthers: - "

   "comment":"Brandon LaFell registered 6 catches for 66 yards. I'm giving him his own entry to highlight a blunder by Dolphins' head coach Joe Philbin. The ball hit the ground on LaFell's 19-yard reception, but Philbin didn't even bother challenging. The 2 CBS announcers were clamoring for Philbin to throw the red flag, but he didn't even seem like he was aware that it was a close play that should be looked at. This was significant because the Patriots ultimately scored on that drive.    The Patriots ran well against the Dolphins, who were missing 2 starting linebackers. "

   "comment":"Brandon LaFell actually had to stop for several seconds to wait for the pass, though he managed to reel in the ball for 48 yards. Any competent secondary would've picked off the pass, but Brady had the great fortune of battling a defensive backfield that's in shambles. Brady finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He easily could've thrown a third score, as Dion Lewis dropped a sure touchdown. Then again, his afternoon could've been a lot worse if the Redskins' miserable secondary managed to intercept him on that pseudo-punt. The pass protection is an issue, but not against crap opponents like Washington and the 3 other awful teams in the AFC East.    Brady's touchdowns went to Julian Edelman (5-55) and Brandon Bolden. The former converted a 4.h-and-2 on the opening drive with a 5-yard reception, but was guilty of a fumble in Washington territory after his team recovered an onside kick.    Brady's leading receiver was Brandon LaFell, who caught 5 balls for 102 yards. This wasn't fluky either; he paced the team with 9 targets. "
