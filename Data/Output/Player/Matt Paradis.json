   "comment":"Paradis. Plus, as mentioned, Anderson's impressive touchdown reception was nullified by another hold. The Broncos racked up 103 penalty yards, indicating that they simply weren't prepared to play, as a result of Kubiak's absence.    Both of Denver's receivers disappointed their fantasy owners. Thomas saw 10 targets, but caught 5 balls for only 35 yards. He also lost the aforementioned fumble. Sanders (4-40) was only slightly better. Sanders sustained some sort of injury in the second half, but was able to return to action. Both wideouts would've done much better if Siemian didn't struggle with accuracy issues.    Phil Simms, as usual, was horrible. Here were some of his quotes from tonight: To get 66 percent of any people to agree on anything is next to impossible. Simms said this about the Chargers' stadium deal. What's funny about this is that 3 days ago, the Las Vegas stadium passed at a 76.2-percent rate. Nice 1, Phil. In golf terms, Jim, it's just like a golf swing keeping that arm straight with his swing. I have no idea what this means. I guess that was for the 10 golf fanatics watching Thursday Night Football. Simms also poked fun at fantasy football at some point in the first half. He did the same thing last week, according to Matthew Berry, who went savage on Simms on Twitter. Simms, proving that he's completely out of touch, needs to understand that most people were watching this game because they're fantasy football owners checking out what their players were up to. The completely arrogant Simms just offended most of his viewer base instead. Why the hell is CBS still employing this guy!? Besides, it's not like Simms has many fans.
