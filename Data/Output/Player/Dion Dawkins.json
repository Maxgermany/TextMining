   "comment":"Dawkins.    Speaking of Clay, much was made of his return from injury because of a potential great matchup versus New Orleans' poor linebackers. Clay was a big disappointment with 2 catches for 13 yards. As mentioned, he was responsible for Taylor's sole pick. Benjamin also had a disappointing outing, catching 3 passes for 42 yards in his Buffalo debut. His yardage came late when the game was already decided.   "
