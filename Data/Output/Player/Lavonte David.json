   "comment":"David had another superb day for Tampa Bay. The rookie had a nice interception dropping into the middle of the field on a poor decision by Manning. David also made some tackles for a loss and was all over the field. The weakness at cornerback continues to plague Tampa Bay and looks like the Achilles' Heel that could keep the team out of the postseason.   "

Tampa Bay stopped Atlanta inside the 10 to hold the Falcons to a field goal. The Bucs had a bad drive and a terrible 20-yard punt to set up the Falcons at Tampa Bay's 37-yard line. On the first play after the punt, Ryan hit Douglas (7-149-1) for a score after he beat Johnthan Banks and Dashon Goldson with a double move. In the third quarter, Falcons wide receiver Drew Davis had a nifty 1-handed 24-yard catch for a nice gain. A pass to Gonzalez (2-30) set up Atlanta in the red zone. Ryan threaded a needle to Rodgers (8-16 rushing, 8-46-2 receiving) who squirted through the defense for an 8-yard touchdown. Ryan completed 20-of-26 passes for 273 yards with 3 touchdowns.    Tampa Bay's offense was carried by the unstoppable Vincent Jackson. However, Mike Glennon spotted the Falcons a quick lead via a William Moore strip-sack on the Bucs' first drive. Thomas DeCoud scooped up the loose ball for Atlanta and scored from 30 yards out. Glennon rebounded by throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Jackson after he spun free from Asante Samuel. Falcons' cornerback Robert Alford fumbled the ball away on a third-quarter punt return to set up the Tampa Bay at Atlanta's 23-yard line. That resulted in a short touchdown pass to Jackson (10-138-2). The Bucs had 2 fourth-quarter field goals, but simply ran out of time. Glennon played well overall, completing 26-of-44 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. Mike Williams was held to 4 catches for 32 yards.    All game, Tampa Bay killed itself with penalties. The Buccaneers had 5 15-yard penalties for unnecessary roughness, personal foul or facemasks. An illegal hands to the face on Davin Joseph canceled out a fourth-and-goal touchdown pass to Tiquan Underwood. Tampa Bay played extremely sloppy football like the team did in Weeks 1 and 2 this season.    Aside from the play where Rodgers beat him, Lavonte David was all over the field for the Bucs. David is a stud and should be a Pro Bowler. He and "

   "comment":"David. Tampa Bay's drive was aided by a bogus hitting the quarterback low on Nick Fairley that gave the Bucs a first down after a third-down stop. Mike Glennon hit Tim Wright (8-75) for some chunk plays to move the ball into a short field goal. The Lions answered by moving into Tampa Bay territory thanks to a 28-yard screen pass to Nate Burleson (7-77). The drive ended with a bullet to Burleson for a short touchdown. Glennon later hit a 47-yard bomb to Vincent Jackson (2-61), and the Bucs took the lead with a short touchdown pass to Underwood. Detroit came right back with passes to Calvin Johnson to set up a short touchdown pass to Joseph Fauria. Just before halftime, Stafford threw a pick-6 to Leonard Johnson, and Tampa Bay took a 17-14 lead into the half. Brandon Pettigrew made a terrible effort to catch the pass. In the third quarter, Stafford ripped the ball down the field to the take lead with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Pettigrew (3-32). Detroit's next possession started with a 41-yard run by Reggie Bush (15-83), but Stafford had an ugly overthrow in the middle of the field that was picked off by Keith Tandy. The Bucs took the lead when Glennon hit Underwood for an 85-yard touchdown as Chris Houston was burned on the play. It was a great throw by Glennon to hit Underwood on the run. The Bucs then blocked a Lions punt to take over at Detroit's 10-yard line, but Tampa Bay lost yards and missed a 24-yard field goal. The Lions started moving the ball, but Kris Durham (3-46) fumbled the ball away to the Bucs. Detroit's defense came up clutch as Glennon took a sack from Willie Young and Ryan Lindell missed another field goal. On the final drive, Stafford moved into field goal range. He lofted a ball into Johnson (7-115) on a third-and-long. Megatron then had a catch inside the 5-yard line, but Tandy jarred it loose and Johnthan Banks was able to catch the deflection for an interception.    Stafford was 26-of-46 passes for 297 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. The defense played well for Detroit, while the Lions' offense completely blew the game. Ezekiel Ansah beat Donald Penn for 2 sacks and Detroit's front 7 played really well - the secondary let them down.    Glennon was 14-of-21 for 247 yards with 2 touchdowns. Bobby Rainey was held to 35 yards on 18 carries. Lavonte David was phenomenal with 11 tackles, an interception and a forced fumble.    "

Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2, but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2-point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6-yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David - 8 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble - were excellent for Tampa Bay. Los Angeles' "
