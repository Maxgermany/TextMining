   "comment":"Jones definitely is, and he had a stellar performance in his first career start. Jones burst for 125 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries. He had a key run on the team's final drive; he picked up a big gain and also managed to step out of bounds.    Nelson was hampered with an injury, but he was still able to help his fantasy owners with a touchdown, catching 2 balls for 24 yards. He should've snatched a 2.point conversion in the 4.h quarter; he was wide open, but Rodgers sailed the ball over his head. Meanwhile, Adams' decisive score wasn't his only 1. He caught 7 balls for 66 yards and found the end zone twice. This was amazing, considering the brutal hit he took from Danny Trevathan on Thursday night. Elsewhere in the receiving corps, "

Jones is clearly the better runner over Montgomery, who is a natural receiver. It's mind-boggling that Green Bay would use Montgomery over Jones, especially when considering that the former is injured.    As for the Vikings, their chances of winning the NFC North have greatly increased in the wake of Rodgers' injury. Even better, it sounds like Teddy Bridgewater will have a chance to play next week.
