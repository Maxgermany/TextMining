Nelson was hampered with an injury, but he was still able to help his fantasy owners with a touchdown, catching 2 balls for 24 yards. He should've snatched a 2.point conversion in the 4.h quarter; he was wide open, but Rodgers sailed the ball over his head. Meanwhile, Adams' decisive score wasn't his only 1.

It's mind-boggling that Green Bay would use Montgomery over Jones, especially when considering that the former is injured.

   "comment":"Aaron Jones bursting for 15 yards on the first play of the afternoon. Brett Hundley then drew the Saints offside on a third down, clearly showing that he learned something from Aaron Rodgers. Jones then sped by the New Orleans defenders for a 46-yard touchdown run. The defense, meanwhile, stepped up by picking off Drew Brees twice deep in Green Bay territory. The Packers went into halftime, up 14-7, and they even led in the 4.h quarter, 17-16. However, the clock struck 12 and the magic vanished. Hundley turned into an inaccurate pumpkin late in the game, while the defense suddenly couldn't keep the Saints out of the end zone. New Orleans outscored Green Bay in the second half, 19-3, picking up a 9.point victory.    Brees proved to be way too lethal for Green Bay's defense to handle in the second half. Just take a look at his stats following intermission: 14-of-18 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Packers simply couldn't get off the field against him. Brees' final numbers were 27-of-38 for 331 yards, 1 score and the aforementioned 2 picks.    Ted Ginn had a monster afternoon, likely because I bet so heavily against his team. He caught all 7 of his targets for a career-high 141 yards. His 1 blunder was a muffed punt early in the afternoon, but the officials ruled that there was interference to make the catch. Meanwhile, Michael Thomas had a strong second half, catching 7 passes for 82 yards. All but 1 of his receptions came after the break.    The Saints also had a ton of success running the ball once again despite battling a defense that has been solid versus the rush with Mike Daniels back in the lineup. Mark Ingram gashed the Packers for 105 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries. Alvin Kamara also had great success, gaining 57 yards on just 9 attempts, and he also caught 5 passes for 50 receiving yards.    While Ingram and Kamara were terrific, the best runner was Aaron Jones, who tallied 131 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. The Packers may have lost, but they've at least found a potent running back. I suppose that's somewhat of a silver lining. The Packers wasted some downs feeding the ball to Jones bursting for 15 yards on the first play of the afternoon. Brett Hundley then drew the Saints offside on a third down, clearly showing that he learned something from Aaron Rodgers. Jones then sped by the New Orleans defenders for a 46-yard touchdown run.
