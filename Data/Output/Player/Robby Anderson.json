   "comment":"Anderson was tipped into the air. The next 1 occurred late in desperation time. Fitzpatrick finished 23-of-41 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 picks. People will see the 3 interceptions in the box score and assume Fitzpatrick performed poorly again, but that's not the case. He was not the problem in this game, at least not as much of 1 as the Jets' secondary was.    Despite the matchup against Sherman, Marshall was able to catch 4 passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. He did this on 12 targets, however. "

   "comment":"Anderson for a gain of 52. This was part of a 99-yard drive, capped off by a Jalin Marshall reception and a hook and lateral to Bilal Powell, who scampered into the end zone. The Jets went up 6-3 - the extra point was missed - and that was all they did during the afternoon. The Jets mustered just 197 total yards outside of that possession. Petty finished 19-of-32 for 163 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception late in the game on an inaccurate throw. Petty had that bomb to Anderson, but spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking. He looked like a poor-man's Ryan Fitzpatrick, which is just sad. Granted, he didn't have Nick Mangold blocking for him against the Rams' ferocious defensive front, but he appears to be just a backup at best in this league.    "

   "comment":"Anderson, who looked like he made an incredible catch. The Jets then waved the white flag on the next possession, punting on 4.h-and-short despite being down 2 possessions with about 4 minutes remaining. It was 1 of several curious decisions Todd Bowles made this afternoon.    Tyrod Taylor finished 16-of-28 for 224 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which, as discussed, wasn't his fault. Taylor also did some work on the ground, dashing for 38 yards on 8 scrambles. Taylor was awful in the preseason, but he had a nice performance in his 2017 debut. Before anyone gets too excited, however, Taylor threw against the worst team I've ever covered, so I wouldn't expect him to maintain this level of production.    LeSean McCoy had a scare in this game when he hurt his hand on a run down to the 1-yard line. He left the game, allowing Mike Tolbert to vulture a touchdown. McCoy returned on the next drive, so everything is OK. McCoy looked great, gaining 110 yards on 22 carries and also catching 5 balls for 49 receiving yards. McCoy was as outstanding as those numbers indicate, and he even juked Jamal Adams out of his cleats in the early going on a 21-yard catch-and-run play.    Despite his blunders, Clay had a nice stat line, registering 4 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. He trailed only Jordan Matthews (2-61), who did most of his work on 1 47-yard reception. The big catch (47 yards) was a nice play by Taylor, as he escaped some pressure and kept his eyes downfield. Meanwhile, Zay Jones converted only 1 of his 4 targets for 21 yards. He was a big disappointment.    Moving on to the Jets, Josh McCown finished with a nice completion percentage (26-of-39), but only because he dinked and dunked on almost every throw. He didn't have much of a choice because of poor protection, but I'd still describe him as Sam Bradford on crack. His 39 attempts went for 187 yards, which gave him a YPA of 4.79. To put that in perspective, McCoy averaged more yards per carry than McCown did per throw! McCown tossed 2 interceptions, but neither was really his fault. The first, which I discussed already, was a great play by Poyer. The second was a desperation heave in the final minutes.    I mentioned some questionable decisions made by Bowles. I'd say not involving Bilal Powell very much was 1. Powell saw just 3 carries in the opening half, and he wasn't on the field for most of the first quarter, as Matt Forte drew the start for some reason. Forte (6-16) predictably was out-produced by Powell (7-22). It's obvious that Powell is the best player the Jets have on offense, so it makes absolutely no sense for him to be losing touches to Forte.    Thanks to McCown's pedestrian passing, only 1 Jet accumulated more than 34 yards. That was newly acquired Jermaine Kearse, who caught 7 balls for 59 yards. McCown otherwise spread the ball around, with Anderson (4-22) seeing the next-most targets with 8.   "

   "comment":"Anderson on a third-and-10, then scrambled for 16 yards on third-and-8. Jeremy Kerley made an acrobatic catch on a third-and-6 at the 1-yard line, and then McCown hit Austin Seferian-Jenkins for a touchdown on third-and-goal. The Jets scored once again to go up 14-0, thanks to Mike Gillislee's fumble inside the red zone. McCown once again did his thing, hitting Jermaine Kearse for 16 yards on a third-and-5, and then following that up with a 31-yard bomb to Kerley. It looked like the Jets were going to upset the Patriots, but that's when Tom Brady happened. Brady caught fire, aside from an interception on a poor deep shot into double coverage. The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by Brandin Cooks, who still managed to lead the team with 6 catches for 93 yards. Brady spent most of the afternoon hurling deep balls to Cooks and some of his other receivers, and they had success doing so as the game progressed following some early struggles.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were thrown to Rob Gronkowski, who caught 6 balls for 83 yards. He nearly had a third touchdown, as he drew a pass interference penalty in the end zone. Meanwhile, Danny Amendola (3-40) and Chris Hogan (1-19) didn't do much. Hogan hurt his ribs on a fierce hit, but missed only 1 drive.    With Gillislee fumbling, Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him. Lewis gained 52 yards on 11 carries otherwise, while Gillislee tallied 44 yards on 10 attempts.    As for the Jets, McCown had a terrific stat line, going 31-of-45 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned interceptions. This is nothing new for the Patriots' defense, which hasn't been able to stop the pass all year. It's a bad sign that Bill Belichick hasn't been able to figure anything out during his 9 days off. It's amazing that New England continued to blow tons of coverage with lots of time to prepare for this game, and it didn't help that McCown had an eternity in the pocket. Perhaps the Patriots shouldn't have cut Kony Ealy.    Despite McCown's massive yardage total, no Jet player had more than 80 receiving yards. Kearse led the way with 4 grabs for 79 yards, while Robby Anderson (4-76) wasn't too far behind him. Kerley (2-61) and Seferian Jenkins (8-46) both scored touchdowns, though, as mentioned, Seferian-Jenkins should've found the end zone twice.    "
