   "comment":"Robby Anderson was tipped into the air. The next 1 occurred late in desperation time. Fitzpatrick finished 23-of-41 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 picks. People will see the 3 interceptions in the box score and assume Fitzpatrick performed poorly again, but that's not the case. He was not the problem in this game, at least not as much of 1 as the Jets' secondary was.    Despite the matchup against Sherman, Marshall was able to catch 4 passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. He did this on 12 targets, however. "

He should be the No. 3 option for the Jets next year, provided that Marshall and Eric Decker both return healthy. As for Anderson, he had a mixed outing. He has game-breaking speed, but he was guilty of a terrible drop. Anderson should be a depth guy for the team next year, as his straight-line speed makes him a great situational weapon.

   "comment":"Robby Anderson on a third-and-10, then scrambled for 16 yards on third-and-8. Jeremy Kerley made an acrobatic catch on a third-and-6 at the 1-yard line, and then McCown hit Austin Seferian-Jenkins for a touchdown on third-and-goal. The Jets scored once again to go up 14-0, thanks to Mike Gillislee's fumble inside the red zone. McCown once again did his thing, hitting Jermaine Kearse for 16 yards on a third-and-5, and then following that up with a 31-yard bomb to Kerley. It looked like the Jets were going to upset the Patriots, but that's when Tom Brady happened. Brady caught fire, aside from an interception on a poor deep shot into double coverage. The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by Brandin Cooks, who still managed to lead the team with 6 catches for 93 yards. Brady spent most of the afternoon hurling deep balls to Cooks and some of his other receivers, and they had success doing so as the game progressed following some early struggles.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were thrown to Rob Gronkowski, who caught 6 balls for 83 yards. He nearly had a third touchdown, as he drew a pass interference penalty in the end zone. Meanwhile, Danny Amendola (3-40) and Chris Hogan (1-19) didn't do much. Hogan hurt his ribs on a fierce hit, but missed only 1 drive.    With Gillislee fumbling, Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him. Lewis gained 52 yards on 11 carries otherwise, while Gillislee tallied 44 yards on 10 attempts.    As for the Jets, McCown had a terrific stat line, going 31-of-45 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned interceptions. This is nothing new for the Patriots' defense, which hasn't been able to stop the pass all year. It's a bad sign that Bill Belichick hasn't been able to figure anything out during his 9 days off. It's amazing that New England continued to blow tons of coverage with lots of time to prepare for this game, and it didn't help that McCown had an eternity in the pocket. Perhaps the Patriots shouldn't have cut Kony Ealy.    Despite McCown's massive yardage total, no Jet player had more than 80 receiving yards. Kearse led the way with 4 grabs for 79 yards, while Robby Anderson (4-76) wasn't too far behind him. Kerley (2-61) and Seferian Jenkins (8-46) both scored touchdowns, though, as mentioned, Seferian-Jenkins should've found the end zone twice.    "
