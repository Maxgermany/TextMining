Washington's offense, meanwhile, had a very disappointing afternoon considering it was battling the Sean Lee-less inept Dallas defense. The Redskins put 23 points on the board, but they would've had a much greater output had it not been for so many red-zone miscues. They committed tons of penalties and wasted timeouts deep in Dallas territory. One infraction negated a touchdown, as a "

All of this set up the game-winning score for Dallas, and the team then went up by 10 when Bruce Carter pick-sixed Austin Davis.    Like Romo, DeMarco Murray markedly improved after halftime. Murray lost a fumble in St. Louis territory early on, but finished with 100 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Sixty of his 100 yards came after intermission. He also chipped in as a pass-catcher, hauling in 4 balls for 31 receiving yards.

Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and "

He gained 140 yards on 30 carries, and he also caught 2 balls for 20 receiving yards. Elliott looked great running behind his terrific defensive line, but once again, this wasn't much of a test because the Bears are missing half their defense. The 1 thing we can take away for sure is that Elliott didn't fumble, which has been his only issue thus far.    The first drive of the game was almost disastrous for the Cowboys. "

   "comment":"Terrance Williams (2-36) led the way. Witten is a fine TE2 and can be used as a streamer in good matchups, but for the most part, Bryant is the only Cowboys pass catcher who is worth owning.    Kirk Cousins had a pretty strong day for the Redskins. Though his stat line may not look like anything more than average - 26-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 pick - he did well in the very rainy conditions. Cousins' ball placement was very good, but he was victimized by drops from his receivers and a couple of throws that were taken by gusts of wind. For the most part, he was able to hit his receivers with accurate passes. Cousins' best throw came on his touchdown pass to Doctson. Cousins showed poise in the pocket and took a hit while delivering a perfect strike to Doctson in the back of the end zone. It was lofted just over the linebacker where only Doctson could get it. Cousins has clutch abilities, and that will help him get a big deal if he hits the open market this offseason.    Though the receivers didn't play particularly well for the Redskins on Sunday, they finally got 1 of their top guys going. "

   "comment":"Terrance Williams for a 51-yard big gainer. Prescott then finished that drive off with a great 10-yard touchdown run to give his team a 14-3 lead with just 13 seconds remaining. This is where you can say, fairly confidently, that Prescott is this team's MVP. Yes, Elliott is a much-needed piece to this offense and the Cowboys will lose games because he isn't playing, but without Prescott, this team is dead in the water. So, on we go to the second half! Wait, there's still a few clicks on the clock and the Chifes have the ball at their 37-yard line with 9 seconds remaining. Dallas goes into a deep, prevent defense, so deep that 7 defensive backs are hovering around the goal line, which sets up 1 of the crazier plays of the week. Smith takes the snap and has no real pass rush to deal with, while Tyreek Hill runs to the middle of the field, catches an easy pass with nobody to meet him other than his teammates setting up to block. From there, they work their way down the field, Demarcus Robinson makes a couple of beautiful blocks and Hill uses his speed to go into the end zone, easy-peasy. It was truly 1 of the dumbest defensive efforts ever by a professional football team. That touchdown made the game 14-10 Dallas, and then on his first drive of the second half, Alex Smith led his team down the field and hit Travis Kelce for a 2-yard touchdown to give Kansas City a 17-14 lead, and we had a game! In that short time frame, we saw some of the best, worst and most exciting football of the season. At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half. In the end, Dallas was able to convert on 7-of-12 third downs. The Chiefs also have some questions that need to be answered about their offense. Why did Kareem Hunt run the ball just 9 times, and why did Tyreek Hill see just 4 targets? The answer is likely to be the offensive line, which was not at its best despite being healthy. And as the run game has declined, so have Kansas City's wins. After getting off to a 5-0 start, the Chiefs have now lost 3 of their last 4 games, and a lack of strong ground game has been a big part of those losses.    The Cowboys should be riding high after a big win like this, which took them to 5-3 on the season, but there's a strong chance that Elliott will finally have to serve his 6.game suspension. I have no idea, but that does seem to be the way of the prevailing winds right now. This game by Prescott should at least give Dallas fans some hope though. Elliott rushed 27 times for 93 yards and a touchdown, but didn't see a target. That 3.4 yards per carry can probably be garnered from Alfred Morris and friends, and Prescott will take the lead. At least we'll really get to see just how good Prescott can be without Elliott, which I'm betting is pretty darn good.    Dez Bryant left this game with an ankle injury, but said afterward that he was just sore and bruised. We'll see where he is next week against Atlanta, but for now, it looks like he could be ready.    Terrance Williams did more than just bring in that 51-yard pass to set up Prescott's rushing touchdown; he ended up catching all 9 of his targets for 141 yards, the most in his career and the most since Week 1, when he gained 68 yards. Unfortunately, he did hurt his knee late in the game, but there isn't much info just yet.    Kansas City will get a bye next week and then face the crumbling Giants on the road, while Dallas takes on Atlanta on the road, in what will be an important NFC matchup for both teams.   "
