Bernard was stuffed on that overtime loss, but he made some big plays, gaining 58 yards on just 14 carries to go along with 8 catches for 37 receiving yards and a touchdown. The man who brought the Bengals into overtime obviously had the other score. Green had 8 catches for 151 yards and the Hail Mary touchdown. All but 1 of his receptions came after intermission.
