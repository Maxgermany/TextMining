Still, nothing changed. The Radiers' next possession produced just a single first down, and when the Dolphins got the ball back, they delivered a soul crushing 91-yard journey down the field for a clinching touchdown. At 1 point, they ran 6 times in a row with 3 different players right up the middle and managed 20 yards, while keeping the chains moving. "

   "comment":"Clay dropped a touchdown, and that conversion would've at least given Miami a chance to pull through in overtime. And even before that, Tannehill heaved a careless interception in the red zone. Being down by 1 would've made a difference; the Dolphins drove to their 40-yard line with 10 seconds left, so 1 long completion would have put them in position to try the game-winning kick. Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). "

   "comment":"Clay for a touchdown, but Miami ended up finding the end zone anyway. He was also helped by a sick catch by Mike Wallace, who caught the ball off a deflection and dived into the end zone for a 16-yard grab. Overall though, Tannehill was unstoppable. The Vikings just had no answer for him, so this has to be very encouraging for Miami going forward.    Tannehill was great at the end of the game, but Lamar Miller was the 1 who sparked the offense with some great runs. He gained 92 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries, and he also contributed in the passing attack, snatching 5 balls for 58 receiving yards. Miller had been struggling lately because of a nagging injury, but he looked completely healthy in this contest.    I mentioned that Wallace had an awesome touchdown catch. He actually found the end zone twice, as he and Tannehill actually had some great chemistry with each other. He hauled in all 5 of his targets for 58 yards in addition to the scores. Charles Clay (6-114) led the team in receiving, while Jarvis Landry (8-31) disappointed his non-PPR owners, and he also hurt his team with a lost fumble that set up a late Minnesota touchdown that temporarily gave Minnesota the lead."

   "comment":"Clay's feet, which was ruled incomplete but overturned after a review. Manuel followed that up with a great pass to Robert Woods along the sideline and then scored on a touchdown run. It was 7-0, Bills, and they appeared primed to pull the upset. And then, the rest of the game went like the New England contest. The Bills lost to the Patriots because they absolutely killed themselves with horrible penalties. This game was different in that the Bengals beat them legitimately with superior talent, with the help of a key injury. Cincinnati, despite having great field position on many drives in the first half, sputtered early on, but accumulated 234 net yards following intermission. The Bengals put together multiple touchdown drives even though they began starting inside their own 20 for a change.    Andy Dalton was exceptional, going 22-of-33 for 243 yards and 3 touchdowns despite playing a terrific defense. A big reason for Dalton's success was his pass protection. The Bengals have an elite offensive line, and it once again thrived, surrendering zero sacks despite battling the likes of Jerry Hughes, Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus. The Bills even tried blitzing, and it was no use. Dalton had plenty of time on most occasions, and even when he didn't, he released the ball quickly and allowed his play-makers to move the chains. One of those play-makers happened to be Marvin Jones, who saw a team-high 12 targets. He caught 9 balls for 95 yards and a touchdown, which was an acrobatic flip into the end zone. His best catch was a 42-yard haul in the third quarter in which he somehow came down with the ball after leaping up for it in double coverage. The pass looked like it was going to be intercepted, but Jones managed to snatch it out of the air.    A.J. Green didn't do much, disappointing his fantasy owners. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards, struggling because of Ronald Darby's elite coverage. Meanwhile, Tyler Eifert (4-30) caught a touchdown.    The Bengals kept their word and ran the ball more with Jeremy Hill, but Giovani Bernard had a greater YPC average. Hill's 16 attempts turned into 56 yards, while Bernard's 8 tries transformed into 50 yards and a touchdown. Hill actually caught a receiving touchdown early on. Like Jones, he flipped into the end zone.    Going back to the Bills, Manuel cooled down after a hot start. He was sharp early, but began throwing passes wide and short of the mark. His final numbers weren't terrible - 28-of-42, 263 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception, 22 rushing yards, 1 rush touchdown - but some of that came in garbage time, and he had so much trouble maintaining drives after that initial possession. His pick, by the way, was a poor underthrow. To be fair to Manuel, he was much more ineffective without Sammy Watkins. The No. 1 wideout caught a touchdown just prior to halftime, which was an amazing feat because he injured himself prior to making the reception. This drew the game to within 3, but the Bills couldn't get anything going without Watkins, who was on crutches right after the break. To illustrate Buffalo's troubles, Manuel was 15-of-20 for 129 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick with Watkins and 13-of-22 for 134 yards without him. The score was 17-14 with Watkins and 17-7 without him.    Watkins at least helped his fantasy owners prior to leaving. He snatched 4 balls for 48 yards and the score in 1 half of action. No Buffalo player finished with more than 62 yards, with Charles Clay leading that category. Clay saw a whopping 13 targets, more than double than any other Buffalo player saw. He turned those into 9 grabs for 62 yards. Clay was producing even with Watkins on the field, so don't think that the injury opened up opportunities for him.    McCoy ran well despite being questionable prior to kickoff, though he didn't have much of an opportunity because the Bills trailed throughout. McCoy tallied 90 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts.

   "comment":"Clay and Robert Woods. Clay caught all 5 of his targets for 73 yards and looked to be Taylor's favorite weapon. As long as Sammy Watkins is out, Clay will be the best receiver on the Bills. As for Woods, he was a major disappointment. He caught only 2 passes for 26 yards; however, he was guilty of numerous drops. He is simply too inefficient to be relied on in any fantasy format.    For the Rams, this game was another black mark on the tenure of Jeff Fisher. The team had problems converting red-zone opportunities and had to settle too often. Case Keenum was a part of the problem today as well. Though his 21-of-31 completion rate and 271 passing yards were good on paper, his performance left a lot to be desired. Keenum tossed the 2 aforementioned picks and was unable to throw a touchdown. In the red zone, he was unable to do anything as the team only got 1 touchdown and 4 field goals during the game. Keenum did not help the cause as he struggled to get the ball to his receivers and was unable to deal with the pressure that the Bills were putting on him. After this performance, it is fair to wonder if the Rams will be able to win many games with Keenum as quarterback. He simply is too limited to be more than a stop-gap starter. If the team continues to lose, then the staff should strongly consider giving No. 1-overall pick Jared Goff some playing time just to speed up his development.    On the ground, "

Clay is a high-end TE2 in fantasy at this point, and I would consider picking up Woods at this point as well. Woods does have issues with drops at times, but he is going to catch 5 passes most days. He is worthy of a bench spot in most 12-team leagues.    For the 49ers, this game was actually not all that bad. The final score is actually less lopsided than the scoreboard indicates. In fact, the 49ers were down 24-16 early in the fourth quarter. A lot of this was thanks to the early play of Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick was nowhere close to perfect, but the veteran was an upgrade over Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick's numbers do not look all that good - 13-of-29 for 187 yards and 1 touchdown - but he played better than they indicate. He hit some downfield passes that Gabbert would not have made.

   "comment":"Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    "

The Bills need to consider starting Taylor next year. He is still a work in progress, but he has proven at times to be a solid option. Even if the franchise parts way with Rex Ryan, Taylor should begin 2017 as the quarterback.    Thanks to Taylor's success, the Bills were able to support some solid receiving performances. The leader on the day was Charles Clay (7-72, 1 TD), and it was definitely the tight end's best game of the year. Clay was able to matchup well against the Browns' linebackers and was Taylor's favorite target. Most weeks, Clay is nothing more than a TE2. However, he could fare well in the team's matchup with the Jets next week. The other top receivers on the day were "

   "comment":"Clay gave them a 3-point advantage. Then, the Dolphins drove to kick a field goal and tie things up. The overtime saw the teams exchange a couple of meaningless possessions, including a missed field goal by Bills kicker Dan Carpenter. Then, with 4 minutes left, the Dolphins got a huge run from Jay Ajayi to get into scoring range. They then ran the clock down and attempted a game-winning field goal. It was good from Andrew Franks.    Tyrod Taylor put together what was a very solid performance in the passing department. After starting the game looking shaky, Taylor slowly built up his confidence as the contest went along. In short, he kept getting better as time went on, and most notably, his deep accuracy improved. After missing several passes early on, Taylor was able to create a strong connection with Sammy Watkins and make some of the downfield throws. Overall, Taylor went 26-of-39 for 329 yards and 3 touchdowns. He really helped to lead the team's comeback, and if he plays like he did in the second half, he can be a franchise quarterback. His mobility really helps him, and it was a huge reason that the Bills were able to make the comeback. My theory on why Taylor struggled early is the rumors that have been swirling around him. Rex Ryan may not be returning as the head coach, and if he is not back, the Bills may opt to make a change at quarterback. Taylor is probably thinking about that possibility and may have been trying to force it too much. That would explain why he struggled. He was overthinking everything.    As usual, Buffalo's receiving attack generated a couple of strong performances from its top receivers. Leading the way on Saturday was Sammy Watkins (7-154, 1 TD), who put together a strong performance and really established himself as a downfield threat. If he is fully healthy in 2017, he could be a massive weapon for the Bills. The other top receiver for Buffalo was Charles Clay. The tight end, going against his former team, saw 10 targets and snatched 8 of them for 85 yards. He also caught 2 touchdowns and should be an athletic red-zone weapon.    Despite the strong performance from the passing game, the Bills' rushing attack was really what carried them. Once again, "

   "comment":"Clay had the ball tip off his hands. The Bills should've retained possession because the interceptor, Juston Burris, fumbled the ball, but the officials ruled him down by contact for some reason. This wouldn't be the only time Clay would screw up. He dropped numerous passes and fumbled as well. Throw in a missed 46-yard field goal, and the Bills blew lots of opportunities to score early, which allowed the Jets to hang around. The game effectively ended for New York, however, when "

   "comment":"Clay. I never thought I'd write something like that.    Much was made of the fact that the Bills were a 3-1 team coming into this contest. While they were the leaders of the AFC East, it was widely expected that they would regress at some point. On Sunday, that happened on the offensive side of the ball. For most of the matchup against the Bengals, Buffalo's offense was unable to get anything going. Tyrod Taylor is to be blamed for this. The third-year starter did not look good at all in Cincinnati, and it's clear that the Bills will need an upgrade over him if they want to be a legitimate contender. Taylor spent most of the day throwing from the pocket, and he just didn't look comfortable in there. Taylor held the ball for far too long, and as a result, he was sacked 6 times. The worst part was that Taylor continued to hold onto the ball despite being sacked. He didn't make the necessary adjustment to get the ball out quicker and give the Bills' offense a chance to win. When Taylor was able to get the ball out, his passes were erratic. This game was played in torrential rain at times, so perhaps that bothered him. But Taylor was inconsistent with his accuracy. He consistently overshot receivers downfield and underthrew his checkdowns. It wasn't all bad for Taylor, who had a beautiful touchdown pass to Brandon Tate that saw him throw a touch pass perfectly over the Bengals' linebacker and into Tate's arms. Overall, Taylor finished 20-of-37 with 166 yards, 1 touchdowns and 1 interception. It was a poor stat line and definitely was indicative of his performance. He needs to improve if the Bills want to challenge for a playoff spot.    Because of Taylor's struggles, the Bills were limited to mostly checkdowns and middle-of-the-field options. Taylor heavily targeted his tight ends, and Nick O'Leary (5-54) led the team in receiving yardage. O'Leary did well replacing Charles Clay (2-31), who left with an injury. Still, O'Leary is best suited as a backup and has no value in fantasy. Elsewhere, "
