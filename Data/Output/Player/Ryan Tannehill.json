He had this expression on his face where it looked like he was thinking, F*** this s***, I'm flying down south after this game and lounging by my pool for a whole week. </i>    This game took on real meaning for the Patriots when the Texans lost to the Colts earlier in the afternoon. That opened up the opportunity for New England to get a first-round bye with a win over Miami. After an ugly performance a week ago, the Patriots played with a sense of urgency and dominated the Dolphins from start to finish.    Miami was playing pretty tough against New England early on. However, the game turned in New England's favor when Ryan Tannehill threw a bad pass that was intercepted by Steve Gregory."

As a result of improved pass protection, Tannehill let the ball hit the ground only 8 times. He finished 20-of-28 for 208 yards. Most importantly, he didn't turn the ball over.

Wallace finished with 5 grabs for 127 yards and a score, but that final drop cost his team a victory. The problem for the Dolphins is that they couldn't run the ball, so they weren't able to bleed the clock.

Miami played with a serious lack of discipline as 13 penalties for 112 yards played a huge role in the Dolphins dropping this game. A huge loss for the Dolphins also came when left tackle Brandon Albert suffered an injury in the first half and did not return. His injury could have a huge impact on Miami's season.    The Jaguars took the opening kickoff and moved down the field on the Dolphins' defense. The big play was a 36-yard pass to Robinson, and the drive ended with Bortles throwing a 3-yard scoring strike to the emerging No. 1 wideout. The Dolphins answered when a tipped pass fell into Rishard Matthews, who raced down the field for a 48-yard gain. Tannehill was lucky it wasn't intercepted, but it set up a field goal for Miami. Robinson kept coming as he went up over a defensive back to haul in a 52-yard bomb from Bortles. That led to a field goal for the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Bortles took off on a 26-yard run to convert a third down. He finished the drive by finding Robinson, who was running wide open down the middle of the field, for a 46-yard touchdown. Robinson burned safety Walt Aikens on a double-move to get wide open. Miami answered with 19- and 26-yard completions to tight end Jordan Cameron. On third-and-goal, Tannehill scrambled before finding running back Damian Williams for a score. Just before the half, the Dolphins missed a 42-yard field goal, and the Jaguars completed a couple of passes before Jason Myers made a 58-yard field goal to give Jacksonville a 20-13 lead. To start the third quarter, Tannehill hit Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was anemic, though his numbers indicate that he wasn't that bad. Tannehill went 26-of-49 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, but he was just 11-of-23 for 112 yards and the 3 picks in the first half. Much of his yardage, including the 2 scores, came in garbage time. It's difficult to blame just Tannehill. His receivers didn't help him out at all. "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill overshot Greg Jennings by a mile; and a false start on a punt backed up Miami even farther. Brandon Marshall was then open for a 22-yard gain on a third down, allowing the Jets to score once more. At that point, it was apparent that New York would run away with a blowout, and that's exactly what happened. The Dolphins had no sense of urgency throughout the game. They were guilty of unforced penalties; Philbin was asleep on 1 play and didn't recognize that he should challenge a Tannehill fumble that looked like a pass; offensive coordinator Bill Lazor didn't seem to understand how to deal with the Jets' constant blitzing. They just looked dead, yet they should have been desperate to avoid a 1-3 hole, which would drop them way behind every other team in the division. That's why Philbin needs to go. Immediately.    Ryan Tannehill went 19-of-42 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but don't be fooled; much of his yardage came in garbage time when his team was down 27-7. He was 7-of-15 for just 58 yards and a touchdown by halftime. Tannehill played poorly - he missed numerous receivers - but it wasn't all his fault. His pass protection was horrid, and his offensive coordinator didn't seem to understand how to counter the Jets' constant blitzes. In an embarrassing sequence of events, the Dolphins had a 3.and-out in just 16 seconds, with all 3 plays featuring tipped passes as a result of blitzes that weren't picked up. It was a joke.    Another issue for Tannehill was that Jarvis Landry was bottled up. It was reported during the week that "

The Bills, mired in similar distractions this week when several defensive players called out Rex Ryan, didn't rebound similarly. Instead, they made the same mistakes they always do. It goes without saying that there are major issues in Buffalo. Losing to the worst team in football is obviously a major red flag. The only silver lining is that Tyrod Taylor and Sammy Watkins were both out, but the fact that the stop unit couldn't prevent "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill hit Rishard Matthews in stride on a slant, and he took off for 53 yards to pay dirt. Shortly later, Jarvis Landry broke off a 50-yard touchdown reception. He ran an out route to the sideline before slashing all the way across the field while veering downfield to dart into the end zone. Lamar Miller was up next to gash the Texans' defense with a 29-yard run. A few plays later, Tannehill hooked up with Landry for a 10-yard touchdown on a crossing route. Tannehill added his 4.h touchdown pass of the half with a 54-yard screen pass to Miller. He ran untouched into the end zone. If that wasn't bad enough, Texans tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz bobbled an easy catch, and Reshad Jones caught the deflection with a quick return of 23-yards for a touchdown. Under 3 minutes before the half, Lamar Miller ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run. Miami took a 41-0 lead into the locker room. Obviously, the second half was all garbage time. The Texans produced a fumble from the Dolphins' Damian Williams, and that set up a 7-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster. Shortly later, Foster added another touchdown on a short run and Nate Washington caught a 27-yard score. Miami then tacked on a 53-yard field goal, and Washington had another short touchdown catch to conclude the scoring.    Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston. He was 18-of-19 for 282 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for Tannehill. Miami seemed to have the perfect play call throughout the first half.    Lamar Miller was awesome. He ripped off 175 yards on 14 carries with 1 touchdown rushing. He added 3 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. All of this occurred in the first half. The Texans were incapable of defending Miller.    Jarvis Landry led Miami through the air with 5 catches for 83 yards and 2 scores. Rishard Matthews (3-75-1) also was impressive.    "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill, well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that Tannehill wasn't guilty of a turnover. He also did a good job of moving the chains at times, especially in the first half, when he was 11-of-13 for 98 yards and a touchdown. The bad news is that Tannehill nearly had a meltdown following intermission. His stat line in the second half was hideous: 6-of-15, 51 yards. He also was nearly responsible for a potential pick-six that was dropped in the red zone. Tannehill refused to challenge "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill has been criticized a lot, but he threw some amazing passes in clutch time, and the Dolphins' defense was tremendous at producing turnovers in the second half to get Miami a tough road win against a quality opponent. The Chargers let some games get away from them earlier in the season, so they had little room for error in letting winnable games get away from them. At 4-6, San Diego's playoff hopes are on life support in the toughest division in football. Basically, the Chargers now have to run the table to have any shot at getting a wild-card berth.    The first half was low scoring as both defenses did a good job of getting off the field. The first points came after Melvin Gordon ran well to set up a Chargers field goal. Philip Rivers then put together a good drive with passes to Gordon, Tyrell Williams and Antonio Gates (4-63-1) to get the ball to the Miami 11-yard line. Rivers finished the drive by throwing a bullet to Gates for the touchdown. Late in the second quarter, Tannehill threw a tremendous pass to Kenny Stills for a 39-yard touchdown to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-7 at halftime. Jay Ajayi had only 16 yards on 11 carries by halftime, but not long into the third quarter, he broke off a 40-yard run behind Laremy Tunsil. A 25-yard pass to Jarvis Landry (6-53) put the ball at the 2-yard line, and Damien Williams plunged into the end zone to give Miami the lead. San Diego responded with a completion to Tyrell Williams, a run from Gordon, and a pass interference in the end zone. On third-and-goal, Rivers connected with Hunter Henry (2-11-1) to put San Diego up 17-14. Miami quickly responded thanks to a 21-yard run from Ajayi and Tannehill had about a 15-yard run to convert a critical third-and-11. Tannehill lofted in an 18-yard touchdown pass to Williams get the Dolphins back on top 21-17. After a Miami stop, the Dolphins' Jakeem Grant muffed a punt at 5-yard line, and Darrell Stuckey recovered it for San Diego. The Dolphins had a pass interference after a third-down stop, but Rivers had a pass thrown off the mark, and it was intercepted by Tony Lippett. The Chargers were able to get the ball back, and Rivers used Dontrelle Inman (5-43) to move into Miami territory, but then he had an overthrow picked off by Byron Maxwell to deny San Diego. A good punt return set up Rivers close to midfield with 5 minutes remaining, and less than a minute later, San Diego had a 24-21 lead as Rivers hit Tyrell Williams on the run for a 51-yard touchdown. Miami came right back though, as Tannehill stepped into a hit and threw another dime deep down the field to connect with DeVante Parker for 56 yards with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Corey Liuget tacked on to put the Dolphins at the 10-yard line. Miami had to settled for a field goal though, but that still tied the game at 24. A run by Gordon of 13 yards and a screen to him of 20 yards moved the ball across midfield, but then disaster struck for Rivers as Kiko Alonso undercut a route to pick off the pass and return it 60 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Rivers had 1 minute remaining, but Tony Lippett added his second interception to clinch the Miami victory.    Philip Rivers completed 23-of-44 passes for 326 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Tyrell Williams led San Diego with 5 receptions for 125 yards and a score.    Melvin Gordon was contained by the Dolphins' talented defensive line. He had 70 yards on 24 carries, but also contributed 5 receptions for 62 yards.    Ryan Tannehill completed 17-of-24 for 240 yards on 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't illustrate that Tannehill made some phenomenal throws, and he threw the deep ball better than any game I've ever seen from him.    Jay Ajayi (19-79) was contained by the Chargers' defense. DeVante Parker (5-103) led Miami in receiving.    "
