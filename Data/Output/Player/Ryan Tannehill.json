Tannehill had some bad luck as 2 of his 3 picks came on tipped passes. He got little help from his teammates as he was pressured consistently.    It is painfully obvious that Miami has crap at wide receiver. None of the team's wideouts were getting separation and working themselves open. The Dolphins' leading wideouts were Devon Bess (5-45) and "

Tannehill was able to abuse the Raiders' secondary because top cornerback Ronald Barrtell was out of the lineup. Going into this game, I never imagined that Bartell's absence would have much of an impact against Miami's beleaguered receiving corps, but it certainly did. "

Tannehill, who misfired on numerous long attempts against the Jets last week, connected on multiple long bombs to Hartline. However, he made what would be the game-losing pick in overtime, heaving the ball carelessly as he was hit. It's worth noting that Tannehill was actually intercepted on a third occasion just after halftime, but the turnover was wiped away because of a shaky call on "

Luck, by the way, is on pace for 4,808 yards, which is just sick. </i>    Andrew Luck was a beast for the Colts on Sunday and looked like a quarterback who is capable of leading his team to a wild-card berth in the weak AFC. Ryan Tannehill played really well, but wasn't good enough to keep pace with Luck. The rookies started the game on fire as they combined for 431 yards through the air by halftime. Luck kept it going in the second half and set the rookie record for passing yards in a single game.  Tannehill led an early field goal drive and Luck answered. Rookie tight end "

   "comment":"Tannehill, who played college football at Texas A&amp;M, did not seem like he enjoyed the cold weather. He had this expression on his face where it looked like he was thinking, F*** this s***, I'm flying down south after this game and lounging by my pool for a whole week. </i>    This game took on real meaning for the Patriots when the Texans lost to the Colts earlier in the afternoon. That opened up the opportunity for New England to get a first-round bye with a win over Miami. After an ugly performance a week ago, the Patriots played with a sense of urgency and dominated the Dolphins from start to finish.    Miami was playing pretty tough against New England early on. However, the game turned in New England's favor when Ryan Tannehill threw a bad pass that was intercepted by Steve Gregory."

   "comment":"Tannehill. The real star of the game was the Dolphins' front 7. The unit dominated the line of scrimmage. Cameron Wake destroyed right tackle Mitchell Schwartz as he notched 2.5 sacks and had a ton of pressure. The defensive tackles Randy Starks (1.5 sacks), Paul Soliai (2 batted passes) and Jared Odrick all played well. Dion Jordan had a sack and Derrick Shelby had a strip-sack going against Schwartz. The front 7 did a great job defending the run as well. Browns' guard Oniel Cousins was horrible for Cleveland as he was beaten for sacks and called for a holding that took away a Browns touchdown. Trent Richardson had about 25 yards on the first drive and after that was shut down by Miami. Richardson (13-47, 2 catches for 30 yards) actually ran better than the numbers indicate considering his lack of holes. The Dolphins were crowding the tackle box, daring Brandon Weeden and the receiving corps to beat them. Cleveland had a nice first drive when Weeden threw a ball up for grabs, but it was off the mark and Nolan Carroll came down with an interception at the 1.yard line. Wide receiver Travis Benjamin (2-30) didn't do a great job of fighting for the ball either.    Playing his former team, Dimitri Patterson had probably the best game of his career against Cleveland. His first interception came when Greg Little (4-26) dropped another pass. Patterson made a fabulous catch off the deflection as he fell to the ground. That set up a Caleb Sturgis field goal. Weeden's third interception was a pass high and behind Jordan Cameron for a deflection. Patterson snatched the fluttering ball for the third pick of the half for Weeden.    Weeden had some nice chemistry with Cameron (9-108), but the second-year signal-caller otherwise struggled to move the ball with his receivers. In the second quarter, Cameron made a highlight-reel 22-yard reception. He set up a score with a big catch inside the 10 and finished the drive with a leaping touchdown reception in the corner of the end zone. That gave the Browns a 7-6 halftime lead. However, Cleveland couldn't move the ball in the final 2 quarters. Weeden finished 26-of-53 for 289 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Davone Bess (5-47) and the other wideouts couldn't make up for Josh Gordon being suspended.    Tannehill carried Miami's offense. The running game was pathetic as the offensive line had a weak performance. "

He was especially accurate after intermission, misfiring on just 3 passes (10-of-13). The 1 blemish is that he fumbled twice, though he only lost 1. NFL.com credited Tannehill with 3 fumbles, but the third was a botched snap.    Making things even better for Tannehill, he won't have to hear "

As a result of improved pass protection, Tannehill let the ball hit the ground only 8 times. He finished 20-of-28 for 208 yards. Most importantly, he didn't turn the ball over.

I wondered why Miller was being used instead of Knowshon Moreno at that moment. Joe Philbin and his staff apparently had the same thought. Moreno was used much more after that, as his 24 carries for 134 yards and a touchdown dwarfed Miller's 11 totes for 59 yards, though Miller did score on a receiving touchdown (4 catches, 19 yards) and had another score wiped out by a holding penalty. Moreno was awesome though. He simply wouldn't go down on some plays. Having him healthy is a huge boost for this offense.    Tannehill, meanwhile, went 18-of-32 for just 178 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. Tannehill was solid overall, but did have some accuracy issues.

   "comment":"Tannehill hit consecutive passes to Mike Wallace (5-74) for 45 yards, but the drive was stifled and Caleb Sturgis missed a field goal. Kansas City then finally started to advance the sticks, and Knile Davis punched the ball into the end zone on a 21-yard run. An Alex Smith 26-yard pass to Joe McKnight and some runs by Davis set up a short dump-off pass from Smith to Travis Kelce (3-36), and the big tight end rumbled into the end zone from 20 yards out. Tannehill then led a drive inside the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but because of the clock, the Dolphins settled for a 22-yard field goal to get on the board for a 14-3 score at the half. In the third quarter, the Chiefs allowed their 4.h sack of the afternoon as "

Miami, as a consequence, had to settle for a field goal instead of a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line. The Dolphins actually trailed going into the second quarter, but then reality set in. Tannehill caught fire against Oakland's putrid defense and was close to perfect for the remainder of the first half. He misfired just once until intermission, going 17-of-19 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've had a huge statistical day had the Raiders been remotely competitive, but the Dolphins took the air out of the ball with such a big lead. Tannehill ended up finishing 23-of-31 for 278 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Consistency has always been an issue for him, so maintaining this success will be a challenge.

It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time.

   "comment":"Tannehill tipped interception and injuries that depleted the defense spoiled a potential huge victory for the team. Peyton Manning also had something to do with it. Manning bounced back from a poor performance at St. Louis, torching Miami's top-five defense by going 28-of-35 for 257 yards and 4 touchdowns. Manning didn't even have Julius Thomas at his disposal, though he was fortunate to have Emmanuel Sanders back in the lineup. He shredded the Dolphins mercilessly, though he made 1 mistake when he missed an open Sanders for a deep touchdown. Manning also should've had another score, but offensive pass interference negated a Demaryius Thomas touchdown. To be fair to the Dolphins, they didn't have much of a chance because of the injuries they sustained. Jared Odrick was knocked out in the second quarter with a rib injury. He managed to return, but Miami's run defense wasn't the same after that. Cornerback Jamar Taylor also exited, but he didn't come back into the game. His absence was painful, as the Dolphins were already missing Cortland Finnegan. They were so thin at corner and didn't stand a chance against Manning and his 2 stud wideouts.    Thomas and Sanders both had stellar performances. They each saw 13 targets, with Sanders reeling in 9 balls for 125 yards. He should've had a long touchdown, but Manning missed him. He did, however, making a diving catch on third-and-20 in the 2-minute drill at the end of the first half, getting open because of a fantastic double move. Thomas, meanwhile, hogged all of the scores. He found the end zone thrice on his 10 receptions for 87 yards.    As mentioned, the Broncos ran the ball especially well in the second half once Odrick got banged up. C.J. Anderson pounded for 167 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He had 114 yards on 17 attempts following intermission. He also contributed in the passing game, snaring 4 balls for 28 receiving yards.    The 1 dark cloud over Denver's victory was that kicker Brandon McManus missed another field goal. This 1 was from 33 yards, which prompted the crowd to boo heavily. I can't imagine they understand why their team let go of Matt Prater, who drilled a 50-yarder for Detroit today.    This loss spoiled a strong outing by Ryan Tannehill. He went 26-of-36 for 228 yards, a career-high 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception, which really wasn't his fault, as the ball was tipped. He also scrambled 4 times out of the read-option for 15 rushing yards. Tannehill made some great throws as he was hit, but was guilty of a couple of mistakes, including a sack in which he was tackled 11 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Tannehill has an issue where he runs backward to avoid pressure, which often results in huge losses.    Two of Tannehill's aerial scores went to the emerging "

He was guilty of 2 interceptions into New England's talented secondary, and both turnovers led to New England touchdowns. The Dolphins actually had this at 14-13 at halftime, and they were outgaining the Patriots by about 170 yards. However, the Patriots broke free in the third quarter, outscoring Miami 24-0 in that frame. Before long, this was a complete blowout, as the Patriots preserved the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

   "comment":"Tannehill didn't get a lot of help, and the Dolphins' defense was prone to allowing big plays downfield. Miami played with a serious lack of discipline as 13 penalties for 112 yards played a huge role in the Dolphins dropping this game. A huge loss for the Dolphins also came when left tackle Brandon Albert suffered an injury in the first half and did not return. His injury could have a huge impact on Miami's season.    The Jaguars took the opening kickoff and moved down the field on the Dolphins' defense. The big play was a 36-yard pass to Robinson, and the drive ended with Bortles throwing a 3-yard scoring strike to the emerging No. 1 wideout. The Dolphins answered when a tipped pass fell into Rishard Matthews, who raced down the field for a 48-yard gain. Tannehill was lucky it wasn't intercepted, but it set up a field goal for Miami. Robinson kept coming as he went up over a defensive back to haul in a 52-yard bomb from Bortles. That led to a field goal for the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Bortles took off on a 26-yard run to convert a third down. He finished the drive by finding Robinson, who was running wide open down the middle of the field, for a 46-yard touchdown. Robinson burned safety "

   "comment":"Tannehill. Tannehill was anemic, though his numbers indicate that he wasn't that bad. Tannehill went 26-of-49 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, but he was just 11-of-23 for 112 yards and the 3 picks in the first half. Much of his yardage, including the 2 scores, came in garbage time. It's difficult to blame just Tannehill. His receivers didn't help him out at all. "

   "comment":"Tannehill overshot Greg Jennings by a mile; and a false start on a punt backed up Miami even farther. Brandon Marshall was then open for a 22-yard gain on a third down, allowing the Jets to score once more. At that point, it was apparent that New York would run away with a blowout, and that's exactly what happened. The Dolphins had no sense of urgency throughout the game. They were guilty of unforced penalties; Philbin was asleep on 1 play and didn't recognize that he should challenge a Tannehill fumble that looked like a pass; offensive coordinator Bill Lazor didn't seem to understand how to deal with the Jets' constant blitzing. They just looked dead, yet they should have been desperate to avoid a 1-3 hole, which would drop them way behind every other team in the division. That's why Philbin needs to go. Immediately.    Ryan Tannehill went 19-of-42 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but don't be fooled; much of his yardage came in garbage time when his team was down 27-7. He was 7-of-15 for just 58 yards and a touchdown by halftime. Tannehill played poorly - he missed numerous receivers - but it wasn't all his fault. His pass protection was horrid, and his offensive coordinator didn't seem to understand how to counter the Jets' constant blitzes. In an embarrassing sequence of events, the Dolphins had a 3.and-out in just 16 seconds, with all 3 plays featuring tipped passes as a result of blitzes that weren't picked up. It was a joke.    Another issue for Tannehill was that Jarvis Landry was bottled up. It was reported during the week that "

The Bills, mired in similar distractions this week when several defensive players called out Rex Ryan, didn't rebound similarly. Instead, they made the same mistakes they always do. It goes without saying that there are major issues in Buffalo. Losing to the worst team in football is obviously a major red flag. The only silver lining is that Tyrod Taylor and Sammy Watkins were both out, but the fact that the stop unit couldn't prevent "

   "comment":"Tannehill took 5 sacks, which was a season-high total for him - which is saying a lot because he didn't have Branden Albert shielding his blind side prior to the bye. In the third quarter, Cameron Wake was down on the field for a while, and it was determined that he sustained an Achilles injury. Wake could be done for the season, which is huge, considering that he's 1 of the NFL's top pass-rushers. With Wake gone for the year, the Dolphins' chances of securing the second wild-card spot are very slim.    The Patriots, meanwhile, have moved on to 7-0. Aside from the opening drive, they had trouble moving the chains in the first half. The Dolphins did a great job of putting pressure on Tom Brady, and it seemed like New England was in third-and-longs on every other set of downs. Once Wake went out, however, Brady suddenly had more time, and the Patriots became unstoppable on offense against a deflated team. Brady went 26-of-38 for 356 yards and 4 touchdowns. He once again played extremely well - not at all like a rotting corpse - but the pass protection continues to be a problem, especially in the wake of guard Tre' Jackson going down with an injury. In a year in which pass protection is so prevalent, this is going to be a problem against better teams that can actually keep up with New England on the scoreboard.    Two of Brady's touchdowns went to Julian Edelman (7-81), while the other 2 were thrown to Rob Gronkowski (6-113) and Dion Lewis (6-93). All 3 saw 9 targets. Gronkowski's score was a 47-yarder in which safety Reshad Jones whiffed on a tackle. This occurred after Lewis, who had 5 carries for 19 rushing yards, converted a third-and-14 on a screen. That was basically New England's offense in the opening half before the final minute.    LeGarrette Blount pummeled the Miami front, which was surprising. Blount gained 72 yards on 17 carries despite the fact that the Dolphins had surrendered just 3.1 yards per attempt since the bye. Both Blount and Lewis were effective tonight, which bodes well from a fantasy perspective if you own 1 of them.    As for the Dolphins' offense, they looked horribly inept until they put some garbage yardage together in the second half. They had fewer than 100 net yards prior to intermission and failed to cross midfield until the third quarter. Tannehill went 28-of-44 for 300 yards and 2 interceptions. Again, Tannehill's 300 yards are a mirage, as he had just 85 at halftime. He also took a safety when the ball was snapped before he was prepared. Tannehill's first pick was a telegraphed throw in which the defensive back ran the route for "

That run-first philosophy was evident from the fact that Lamar Miller rushed for 20 times for the first time since December 1, 2013. And in the passing game, Tannehill threw the ball just 19 times. On the day, the Dolphins threw the ball 19 times and ran it 27 times. On the whole, Miami had 8 first downs and 219 total yards.

   "comment":"Tannehill proved to be too incompetent to get the ball into the end zone.    Frank Gore was the catalyst for Indianapolis' offense for most of the afternoon. He ripped through the Dolphins' defense, gaining 85 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries. Miami was guilty of countless missed tackles, which is why Gore was so effective. That said, I'm wondering why Gore had just 15 carries compared to 29 passing attempts from Hasselbeck and Whitehurst combined. The offensive play-calling was terrible, and this has to make you think where the Colts would be had they decided to stick with Bruce Arians as their head coach instead of Chuck Pagano. Then again, as 1 Hall of Fame running back once said, Hindsight is 50-50.    Thanks to the horrible passing numbers from Hasselbeck and Whitehurst, only 1 Colt accumulated more than 40 receiving yards. That was T.Y. Hilton, who logged 4 catches for 64 yards. Donte Moncrief (2-15) disappointed following his solid Week 15 performance, but only because he didn't play on most of the snaps. Coby Fleener (2-15) was even worse despite posting the same stat line, as he dropped a couple of passes.    A quick note on Adam Vintarieri, who drilled his 500th field goal of his Hall of Fame career. He became the third kicker ever to reach that mark.    As for the Dolphins, box-score observers will see that Tannehill went 26-of-38 for 329 yards and an interception. Solid numbers, right? Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean that Tannehill played well. He took a safety at the beginning of the game because he held on to the ball for an eternity. He then threw an awful interception and ultimately took a bad sack for the Colts to the ice the victory. Tannehill did well in between the 20s at times, and he actually had a touchdown to "

With Wilson sustaining an injury later in the game, that touchdown could've allowed the Dolphins to take complete control of the contest.

He definitely did not play poorly, and had Stills hauled in the 71-yard touchdown, his passing stat line would've been 17-of-29 for 257 yards and a score. That looks much better, doesn't it? Despite the loss, the Dolphins have to feel very encouraged. Tannehill did a solid job of moving the chains against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL, all while playing on the road in 1 of the most hostile environments in the NFL. He took a couple of bad sacks because he held on to the ball too long, but it was a very positive showing overall in Adam Gase's new offense.

   "comment":"Tannehill launched a 74-yard bomb to Kenny Stills, who torched Cincinnati's inept safety tandem. The speedy receiver made the deep catch this time and put his team up, 7-3. Miami, however, didn't score a single point after that. The primary issue for Miami was the state of the offensive line. The team was missing its starting left tackle and top 2 centers, and it showed. Tannehill had tons of pressure in his face, and despite throwing mostly short passes, he took 5 sacks, 1 of which resulted in a lost fumble. Things will improve for the Dolphins once they get Branden Albert and Mike Pouncey back from injury. Thanks to heavy pressure, Tannehill went just 15-of-25 for 189 yards, 1 touchdown and an atrocious interception in which he fired right to a Bengal defensive back. He nearly threw a pick-six off a deflection. The back-door push seemed to be there for Tannehill the entire 4.h quarter, but the interception, some sacks and a "

For the Dolphins, this game has to be considered another disappointment. They simply did not show well against the Titans. One of the main culprits of the team's failure was Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill had a poor outing against the Tennessee defense. Though he was under pressure for most of the day, he was unable to get anything going on offense. He was just 12-of-18 for 191 yards. Tannehill did not throw any touchdowns, but he did toss 2 picks. The first interception was not entirely Tannehill's fault. He threw the ball slightly behind his intended receiver, but the receiver was able to get his hands on it. However, "

The bad news is that Tannehill nearly had a meltdown following intermission. His stat line in the second half was hideous: 6-of-15, 51 yards.

   "comment":"Tannehill has been criticized a lot, but he threw some amazing passes in clutch time, and the Dolphins' defense was tremendous at producing turnovers in the second half to get Miami a tough road win against a quality opponent. The Chargers let some games get away from them earlier in the season, so they had little room for error in letting winnable games get away from them. At 4-6, San Diego's playoff hopes are on life support in the toughest division in football. Basically, the Chargers now have to run the table to have any shot at getting a wild-card berth.    The first half was low scoring as both defenses did a good job of getting off the field. The first points came after Melvin Gordon ran well to set up a Chargers field goal. Philip Rivers then put together a good drive with passes to Gordon, Tyrell Williams and Antonio Gates (4-63-1) to get the ball to the Miami 11-yard line. Rivers finished the drive by throwing a bullet to Gates for the touchdown. Late in the second quarter, Tannehill threw a tremendous pass to Kenny Stills for a 39-yard touchdown to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-7 at halftime."

   "comment":"Tannehill posted solid numbers, going 20-of-30 for 285 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't have 3 of his best offensive linemen, but was also battling an injury-ravaged team completely devoid of talent. Tanehill was robbed of a 4.h score, but DeVante Parker was ruled out of bounds on what appeared to be a touchdown at first glance. Jay Ajayi ran in the score shortly afterward. Having said all of this, Tannehill made some mistakes. He should've thrown an interception, but it was dropped. He also was guilty of taking a bad sack to move his team out of field-goal range in the third quarter.    Parker missed out on having a monster day. He had a touchdown wiped out because his forearm landed out of bounds before his second foot was planted in the end zone. He also had a 32-yard leaping grab along the sideline wiped out by another review. As a result, Parker caught 3 passes for 64 yards, but he easily could've eclipsed the century mark and scored a touchdown. Adding injury to insult, Parker was knocked out of the game with a back injury. Elsewhere in Miami's receiving corps, "
