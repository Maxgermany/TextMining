   "comment":"Ashley Lelie. The Ravens went 3.and-out, but Oakland consequently was stuck in poor field position. 5. OK, I don't have any more, but I'd like to once again point out that Cable was 11-35 at Idaho. Maybe he would have been 12-34 if he knew how to manage timeouts, down-and-distance situations and conversion opportunities!    It turns out Baltimore was able to maintain its top-ranked rush defense all afternoon. Lelie. The Ravens went 3.and-out, but Oakland consequently was stuck in poor field position. 5.
