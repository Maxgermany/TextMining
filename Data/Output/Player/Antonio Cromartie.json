   "comment":"Cromartie had come ready to play though. He was penalized on the opening drive and it was a theme throughout. Kevin Boss made a nice first catch in a Raider uniform for 28 yards to set up McFadden's short touchdown run for a quick 7-0 lead. Sanchez came out firing, completing his first 2 passes for 40 yards to Plaxico Burress and Dustin Keller. That would be a theme as well as he finished with 369 yards. However, the drive stalled. When the Jets quickly got it back, LaDainian Tomlinson made a dynamic run after catch good for 74 yards to set up a Sanchez bootleg run to tie it up at 7. Sanchez was asked to roll out of the pocket quite a bit, and while it worked early, the Raiders adjusted and shut it down. It was really an uneven game for him even with the big passing numbers. Rookie Jeremy Kerley returned a punt 53 yards only to watch Sanchez give it away on an interception to Tyvon Branch. The second quarter was a scoring frenzy. To be honest, I had trouble keeping up after watching the defensive struggle earlier in the day. Tomlinson caught a touchdown pass to put the Jets on top 14-7. Raider fans used to seeing Tomlinson in a Chargers uniform saw another vintage performance from him as he piled up 154 yards on 11 touches. McFadden answered with a few tough runs for 17, 15 and 6 yards to get Oakland just close enough for Sebastian Janikowski to try a 56-yard field goal. He missed, but it would set him up for later on. The field position allowed the Jets to drive and eventually kick a short field go to go up by 10, but it would be 2 full quarters before their offense scored again. In the meantime, the Raiders started working on offense. McFadden turned in a brilliant 70-yard touchdown run. On the next drive, Campbell completed short pass after short pass to march the team into position for Janikowski to make a field goal from 54 yards out and tie the game at halftime. New York head coach Rex Ryan could be seen shaking his head as his team walked off the field. This was not a vintage Jets performance, and although Tomlinson and Shonn Greene did combine for 97 yards on the ground, the running game did not come close to dominating like they have grown accustomed to doing in the past. Alternating punts chewed up the first half of the third quarter, as both offenses failed twice. Then came the turning point of the game. New York had a 3rd-and-2 from the Oakland 37-yard line. Two incompletions later, the 43-yard drive resulted in no points. The answer from Oakland was dramatic. On the play's third drive, McFadden had a pass option and instead ran left for 27 yards. Rookie phenomenon Denarius Moore then took a reverse 23 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. The Black Hole was rocking, and all of the frustration from a game with 4 penalties built up for Cromartie. He booted the return, and 2 plays later, a "

   "comment":"Cromartie dropped 2 potential pick-sixes - and he misfired badly on his final attempt, but he was definitely not at fault for this defeat. Kaepernick's sole score went to Michael Crabtree, who reeled in 10 of his 11 targets for 80 yards. However, Stevie Johnson paced the 49ers in catches (9) and receiving yards (103). Boldin didn't do much (6-36) aside from costing his team points. You'd think a veteran like him would know better. Harbaugh spent some time yelling at Boldin on the sideline, but the message was lost because his team wouldn't stop shooting themselves in the foot.    The 49ers struggled to run the ball. Frank Gore managed just 10 yards on 6 carries, and making matters worse for his fantasy owners, Carlos Hyde (3-13) vultured a touchdown.    As for the victors, Drew Stanton went 18-of-33 for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which were thrown to third-round rookie John Brown (4-52). As mentioned, Stanton got away with a couple of interceptions. However, he was very hot in the second half, going 10-of-16 for 161 yards and a pair of scoles following the break. The 49ers helped him out with their dumb mistakes, but it was an impressive second-half performance nonetheless.    Stanton struggled to get the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, as the future Hall of Famer didn't log a single reception until the fourth quarter for the second time in 3 games. Fitzgerald finally hauled in his 3 targets (for 34 yards) in the final period, but he hurt his team by losing a fumble inside the San Francisco 5-yard line. Meanwhile, Michael Floyd had a huge performance, catching 5 balls for 114 yards. He nearly had a touchdown, but rookie safety Jimmie Ward made a great pass break-up.    Andre Ellington didn't have a great stat line overal - 18 carries, 62 rush yards; 3 catches, 13 rec. yards - but he was going up against a stalwart front that just put the clamps on Matt Forte. Considering his competition, Ellington had a nice outing.    Arizona's third victory was a bit spoiled in that Cromartie suffered a knee injury. He'll undergo an MRI on Monday.   "

He had a stomach bug and ran out of the locker room with a stocking cap on after the first play. However, he grabbed some Skittles (seriously), stuffed them into his mouth and entered the game. He was stuffed on his initial carry, but eventually had a strong touchdown run. Of course, his best play was a 79-yard burst in which he broke numerous tackles, including 1 from Patrick Peterson, who helplessly tried to strip the ball out of his arm. Lynch finished with 113 yards and a 2 touchdowns on just 10 carries. While he was out, Robert Turbin (10-38) and Christine Michael (6-26) were able to split the workload.    Arizona hasn't been able to cover tight ends all year, and Willson exposed that, leading the Seahawks with 139 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns on just 3 receptions, torching the anemic Larry Foote each time. Doug Baldwin (7-113) also had a big game, while rookie Paul Richardson (7-52) also contributed. Richardson saw more targets than usual because Jermaine Kearse was knocked out with a hamstring in the second quarter.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals are barely worth mentioning. Everything they've worked for this whole season is for naught because of injuries to the quarterback position. They did keep this game close for a while - it was 14-6 entering the fourth quarter - but missed out on numerous opportunities. Ryan Lindley couldn't get the ball to an open John Brown on a third down. Michael Floyd dropped a deep pass. Lindley underthrew Brown a bit in the end zone. Peterson dropped an interception which would've given Arizona the ball in the red zone. Floyd tipped a pass away from Larry Fitzgerald for a first-down conversion on a miscue. Cromartie fell down on a long Baldwin reception. The Cardinals needed things to go their way considering their quarterback situation; instead, they just couldn't get any breaks beyond Hauschka's missed field goals.    Arizona's defense sucked, but Lindley was even worse. His overall numbers say it all, as he went 14-of-35 for 178 yards and an interception. He had some nice throws, including a nice rainbow to Floyd, who caught the pass over "

   "comment":"Cromartie, but Newton managed to chase him down. Newton nearly had a couple of other interceptions, including 1 play in which he appeared to throw a backward pass that was nearly picked off by an Arizona defensive lineman. The Panthers got away with that 1, as it was just 1 of about a dozen terrible calls by Ed Hochuli and his crew throughout this contest, but I'll get to that later.    Newton's 2 touchdowns went to Mike Tolbert and Fozzy Whittaker. The latter was a bit fluky in terms of Newton's stat line, as Whittaker caught a short pass and went 39 yards into the end zone because of some of the worst tackling you'll ever see.    The Panthers were able to pick up some big runs in this game, as Arizona's defense had tackling issues throughout the evening. I mentioned Newton's scrambles - he had 35 yards on 7 attempts - but Jonathan Stewart picked up most of the yardage on the ground. He gained 123 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Tolbert vultured a score away in the second half, but those who used Stewart in daily formats weren't disappointed, as the big back has been tremendous since the team's Week 12 bye. The Cardinals will need to spend some early-round picks on defensive players, including a pass-rusher and a cornerback if Cromartie leaves via free agency.    Other Carolina stats: "
