   "comment":"Ajayi 2-point conversion and that was all she wrote. Well, other stuff happened, but the Dolphins didn't score another point and still won the game.    That other stuff was mostly rookie Javorius Buck Allen, who played a great game, putting up 170 yards and a touchdown on 17 rushing attempts and an amazing 12 receptions! Matt Schaub was a checkdown machine with 13 targets to Allen, who did well to catch 12 of them and put up 107 yards receiving and his touchdown. Kamar Aiken couldn't do as much with his short- to mid-range targets, which he saw 11 of, but only caught 6 for 48 yards.    Schaub's conservative play almost got it done, as Justin Tucker hit 2 field goals and Allen took a short screen for a 41-yard touchdown, to bring the Ravens within 2 points, but that short timeframe when Schaub was picked twice in the second quarter, doomed Baltimore to yet another loss and a 4-8 record.    The Dolphins move to 5-7 and still have a slim hope of squeaking into the playoffs, but Tannehill has bred little confidence of late. And you don't get to play Matt Schaub every week. If Miami's defense can come up big the rest of the season, and Jay Ajayi and Lamar Miller can control the ground game, this team could turn things around enough to at least stay in the hunt.   "

   "comment":"Ajayi and the offensive line. Ajayi was simply terrific. The Buffalo front could not contain the second-year back at all. He finished the day with 29 carries for a whopping 214 yards and a touchdown. He constantly ripped off 10-yard chunks and had numerous impressive runs. One of his best came when he broke for a 53-yard run when the Dolphins were backed up in their own territory, and that run helped to flip field position. Ajayi looks to be the workhorse back for the team working forward. He has back-to-back 200 yard games, and he could end up being a huge pick-up if he is available in your fantasy league. Part of the reason that Ajayi was able to run so well was the performance of his offensive line. This was the second time that the normal starters played all together, and they were able to open some huge lanes. If they stay healthy, the Dolphins could end up making a playoff push.    In the passing game, "

Ajayi didn't quite generate 200 rushing yards for the third consecutive game, but he did break the century mark, which was considered a daunting task considering that New York has a stout run defense. Ajayi actually didn't do much early - he gained 26 yards in the opening half - but Miami's offensive line wore down the Jets' defensive front late in the afternoon. The New York linemen looked completely gassed even though "

Ajayi couldn't find any room otherwise against Los Angeles' stout front.    Ajayi just barely outgained Todd Gurley, who tallied 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. As with Ajayi, a big chunk of Gurley's yardage came on 1 attempt, a 24-yarder that happened to be a first-quarter touchdown. The Dolphins stacked the line of scrimmage, much like every other team this year, daring the Los Angeles quarterback to beat them. Goff, like Case Keenum, couldn't get the job done to open up some running room for his stud running back.    No Ram accumulated more than 50 receiving yards. Britt led the way with 5 grabs for 43 yards, though he did draw a pass-interference flag on third down near midfield. Kendricks was next (4-38), but he lost a fumble in his own territory when "

He also was guilty of taking a bad sack to move his team out of field-goal range in the third quarter.    Parker missed out on having a monster day. He had a touchdown wiped out because his forearm landed out of bounds before his second foot was planted in the end zone. He also had a 32-yard leaping grab along the sideline wiped out by another review. As a result, Parker caught 3 passes for 64 yards, but he easily could've eclipsed the century mark and scored a touchdown. Adding injury to insult, Parker was knocked out of the game with a back injury. Elsewhere in Miami's receiving corps, Kenny Stills (3-72), Dion Sims (4-53) and Leonte Carroo (1-15) caught Tannehill's touchdown. Jarvis Landry had a disappointing afternoon with 4 grabs for 47 yards. He dropped a pass.    Ajayi, missing 3 offensive linemen, didn't have the best rushing day, gaining just 45 yards on 18 carries.

Tannehill and Moore's heroics were crucial, as the Dolphins couldn't run the ball against Arizona's stalwart front. Ajayi managed just 48 yards on 20 carries, and 13 of his yards came on 1 burst. As mentioned earlier, Ajayi should've caught a touchdown, but Tannehill overshot him. Ajayi was also robbed of another score, as a scamper of his into the end zone was nullified by a hold.    Thanks to the conditions, only 2 Dolphins accumulated more than 15 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Ajayi fumbled in his own territory. And to top it off, they had a missed extra point after their first touchdown. They eventually took advantage of the Jets' errors, allowing them to pull away with a massive victory. The thing is, the Jets were hanging around well into the third quarter and even had double the yards Miami did at that point (225-129). New York also had more yards per play than Miami, 5.9-5.6, at intermission. The Jets simply self-destructed. They had 3 possessions in the first half in which they were over midfield, but came away with zero points. Bryce Petty was strip-sacked on 1 of the possessions. Petty then threw an interception right to Cameron Wake at the Miami 25, as he didn't see Wake dropping into coverage. The other drive saw Bilal Powell stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 at the Miami 47. The Jets were still down just 13-10 at that point, but the game quickly got away from them because of a blocked punt returned for a touchdown, a failure to pick up Ajayi's aforementioned fumble, and a Petty interception that happened to be a great play by Tony Lippett."

   "comment":"Ajayi to get into scoring range. They then ran the clock down and attempted a game-winning field goal. It was good from Andrew Franks.    Tyrod Taylor put together what was a very solid performance in the passing department. After starting the game looking shaky, Taylor slowly built up his confidence as the contest went along. In short, he kept getting better as time went on, and most notably, his deep accuracy improved. After missing several passes early on, Taylor was able to create a strong connection with Sammy Watkins and make some of the downfield throws. Overall, Taylor went 26-of-39 for 329 yards and 3 touchdowns. He really helped to lead the team's comeback, and if he plays like he did in the second half, he can be a franchise quarterback. His mobility really helps him, and it was a huge reason that the Bills were able to make the comeback. My theory on why Taylor struggled early is the rumors that have been swirling around him. Rex Ryan may not be returning as the head coach, and if he is not back, the Bills may opt to make a change at quarterback. Taylor is probably thinking about that possibility and may have been trying to force it too much. That would explain why he struggled. He was overthinking everything.    As usual, Buffalo's receiving attack generated a couple of strong performances from its top receivers. Leading the way on Saturday was Sammy Watkins (7-154, 1 TD), who put together a strong performance and really established himself as a downfield threat. If he is fully healthy in 2017, he could be a massive weapon for the Bills. The other top receiver for Buffalo was Charles Clay. The tight end, going against his former team, saw 10 targets and snatched 8 of them for 85 yards. He also caught 2 touchdowns and should be an athletic red-zone weapon.    Despite the strong performance from the passing game, the Bills' rushing attack was really what carried them. Once again, LeSean McCoy put together an absolutely stellar showing. He saw another 24 carries for 128 yards and parlayed 1 of the carries into a touchdown. He was able to follow his blockers very well and used his shifty running style to rip off chunks of yardage. Mike Gillislee also helped to contribute to Buffalo's success on the ground. He looked strong in his role as a backup, and he had a big role in the go-ahead drive. In overtime, Gillislee broke a huge run that put the Bills into scoring position. Had Carpenter not missed a field goal, the Bills would have had a chance to shut down the Dolphins on defense to possibly win. Overall, Gillislee racked up 91 yards on 11 carries. Taylor totaled 60 yards on 12 scrambles of his own.    At the end of regulation, Rex Ryan made a scene. It appeared that both Corey White and Ryan had tried to call a time out prior to Andrew Franks' game-tying field goal. However, Ryan called time out simultaneously with the snap, so the officials rightfully did not call the time out.    For the Dolphins, this was another solid showing for Matt Moore. The veteran quarterback was a solid game-manager, going 16-of-30 for 233 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was very costly, as it came in the end zone and cost the team points heading into halftime. That said, Moore was able to keep Miami's offense moving, and he opened things up for the running game.    Once again, the Dolphins rode Jay Ajayi to a huge performance. The second-year star saw 32 carries and turned them into a ridiculous 209 yards. He also ran for a touchdown. Ajayi looked very strong, yet also displayed a lot of speed. He was able to rip mercilessly through the Buffalo front, thanks to some poor tackling by the Bills. Change-of-pace back "

   "comment":"Ajayi rushed for 204 yards against the Steelers in the first meeting between these teams in Week 6, as the Dolphins prevailed, 30-15. This was a complete role reversal, with Pittsburgh winning by nearly the same score. This time, it was Le'Veon Bell who dominated on the ground. Bell was terrific. He was ripping off 6 to 8 yards on almost every carry in the opening half, as the Dolphins' depleted defense appeared helpless to stop him. Bell showed great patience to find holes to burst through, and he ultimately hit a big gain of 26 to seemingly score a touchdown. He was ruled down at the 1-foot line, but he reached the end zone 2 plays later. Bell ultimately set the Steelers' franchise single-game playoff rushing record. He did this when he scored his second touchdown. Bell gained 167 yards on 29 carries, a stat line that could've been even better had Pittsburgh given him carries in the second half of the final quarter. This game was out of hand, however, so DeAngelo Williams entered the game. Bell caught only 2 passes, but expect him to be a greater factor as a receiver next week, as the Steelers try to take advantage of Derrick Johnson's absence.    Ben Roethlisberger's stat line could've been better as well, but the Steelers took the air out of the ball with such a huge lead in the second half. Roethlisberger attempted only 6 passes after halftime, though 1 occurred with 4:30 remaining in regulation. Roethlisberger was picked as he was getting hit hard by Cameron Wake, and he walked off the field, wincing and holding his shoulder. I have absolutely no idea why the Steelers were throwing with less than 5 minutes remaining while holding a 30-12 lead. If Roethlisberger is injured, heads will need to roll for that decision-making. Roethlisberger finished 13-of-18 for 197 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He was on fire to start the game, completing his first 11 passes. The first misfire was actually a pick, as Roethlisberger scrambled out of pressure and overshot Antonio Brown as a result.    Speaking of Brown, he had a huge performance despite the limited passing. He caught 5 balls for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Dolphins, missing 3 of their starters in the secondary, had no chance to cover him, and Brown scored on gains of 50 and 62 yards. No other Steeler logged more than 2 receptions.    The Steelers will play in Kansas City next week. They've been installed as 1.point favorites. As a result of the Pittsburgh win, Houston will travel to New England.    As for the Dolphins, they will be under some scrutiny for how they handled a vicious hit that Matt Moore took in the second quarter. Bud Dupree smacked Moore in the jaw, drawing a roughness penalty. Moore sat out 1 play, as it didn't appear as though he went through concussion protocol, even though he appeared to be out of it upon getting crushed. Moore reentered the game and instantly lost a fumble, his first of 3 turnovers. Moore didn't look like quite himself until late in the game when he engineered a garbage-time touchdown drive. Moore was actually playing well beforehand; he was 10-of-13 for 140 yards by halftime. The turnovers were killers, however. He was strip-sacked by both James Harrison and Michael Mitchell, and then he threw an interception when he didn't see Ryan Shazier. Was that bad field vision, or was it because he was playing concussed? I suppose we'll find out later. At any rate, Moore finished 29-of-36 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick. He wasn't close to the reason why the Dolphins lost this game.    Ajayi didn't get to 200 rushing yards this time. In fact, he didn't even reach the halfway point to 100. He was limited to 33 yards on 16 attempts, and he was knocked out in the 4.h quarter with a shoulder injury. The Steelers tackled sloppily in the first meeting, but they made sure Ajayi wasn't going to do much in the rematch. Of course, it helped that the Dolphins were without Mike Pouncey. They have not been the same since losing their Pro Bowl center.    "

Rivers promptly responded by connecting on a few completions, including a 21-yarder to Allen, a 10-yarder to Hunter Henry, and then a 7-yard touchdown to Antonio Gates (2-11-1). That set the NFL record for touchdown catches by a tight end with 112. Huge congratulations to Gates on making NFL history. Ajayi had some nifty runs to get the Dolphins in Los Angeles territory, and then DeVante Parker made a great leaping 31-yard reception to get inside the 10-yard line."

When Gase opted to punt after that, the game was over. Gase did a poor job in this contest. The Dolphins, now 1-2, look absolutely dreadful. They could really use a bye week to get Cutler in better rhythm with his teammates, but that's not possible because of Hurricane Irma, and all of the travel isn't helping either. You have to wonder about Miami's decision not to take a bye following London.   "

He mustered only 77 yards on 25 carries to go with his 2 catches for 2 yards. He also lost a fumble deep in his own territory. Ajayi was able to explode last year when Miami's offensive line got healthy, but it doesn't appear that the blocking is going to improve anytime soon.    The Titans, meanwhile, didn't have much of a chance with Cassel. Good teams often step up and play very hard with their backup quarterback, but Cassel is so terrible that the Titans couldn't prevail with him against a dreadful Miami squad. It's ridiculous that the Titans went into this season with Cassel as their reserve behind Marcus Mariota. Cassel completed 21-of-32 passes, but had just 141 yards and a touchdown. He also had the aforementioned fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Cassel was able to hit 1 big play, an apparent 59-yard score to "

   "comment":"Ajayi was dropping passes; Jay Cutler threw an interception deep in Atlanta territory; and Miami couldn't convert third downs to keep promising drives alive. It seemed like the Falcons were going to be able to coast to an easy victory, but they began looking ahead to next week's battle against the Patriots too early. The Dolphins rallied, outscoring Atlanta 20-0 in the second half to pull the upset as massive 13-point underdogs. While everything went wrong for the Dolphins in the opening half, the complete opposite occurred following intermission. For instance, the Dolphins, down 17-7, were able to get a third-down conversion because of a pass interference. Cutler then tossed another pick, but a horribly blatant roughing-the-passer penalty nullified the turnover. All of this allowed Miami to score to trim the margin to a 1.score game. Meanwhile, the Falcons had a promising drive disrupted by a Jake Matthews holding call, and following a sack in which no 1 blocked Cameron Wake for some reason, the Dolphins were able to take over at midfield because the snap on a punt hit the personal protector. Miami scored, thanks to a Cutler 4.h-and-2 conversion, and took the lead. The Falcons had a chance to either send the game to overtime or take the lead on a final possession. They drove to the Miami 26-yard line, but a Matt Ryan pass to Austin Hooper was picked because cornerback Cordrea Tankersley popped the ball out of Hooper's hands and into the arms of safety Reshad Jones. This gave the Dolphins the victory, allowing them to improve to 3-2 on the year.    Cutler finally showed signs of life in this game. He struggled in the opening half - his pick was a forced throw while under pressure - but he did a good job of moving the chains after intermission. Cutler, who finished 19-of-33 for 151 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception, was fiery, showing signs of energy that wasn't there during the loss to the Saints in London.    The reason the Dolphins won this game, aside from Atlanta's second-half blunders, was Ajayi. Though Ajayi had some early drops, he punished the Falcons with some terrific running. The Dolphins opened up huge lanes for Ajayi, who gained 130 yards on 26 carries. Credit the Dolphins for sticking with the run despite being down 17-0 in the second half.    Cutler's touchdowns went to "
