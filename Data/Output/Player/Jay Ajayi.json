   "comment":"Jay Ajayi 2-point conversion and that was all she wrote. Well, other stuff happened, but the Dolphins didn't score another point and still won the game.    That other stuff was mostly rookie Javorius Buck Allen, who played a great game, putting up 170 yards and a touchdown on 17 rushing attempts and an amazing 12 receptions! Matt Schaub was a checkdown machine with 13 targets to Allen, who did well to catch 12 of them and put up 107 yards receiving and his touchdown. Kamar Aiken couldn't do as much with his short- to mid-range targets, which he saw 11 of, but only caught 6 for 48 yards.    Schaub's conservative play almost got it done, as Justin Tucker hit 2 field goals and Allen took a short screen for a 41-yard touchdown, to bring the Ravens within 2 points, but that short timeframe when Schaub was picked twice in the second quarter, doomed Baltimore to yet another loss and a 4-8 record.    The Dolphins move to 5-7 and still have a slim hope of squeaking into the playoffs, but Tannehill has bred little confidence of late. And you don't get to play Matt Schaub every week. If Miami's defense can come up big the rest of the season, and Jay Ajayi and Lamar Miller can control the ground game, this team could turn things around enough to at least stay in the hunt.   "

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi and the offensive line. Ajayi was simply terrific. The Buffalo front could not contain the second-year back at all. He finished the day with 29 carries for a whopping 214 yards and a touchdown. He constantly ripped off 10-yard chunks and had numerous impressive runs. One of his best came when he broke for a 53-yard run when the Dolphins were backed up in their own territory, and that run helped to flip field position. Ajayi looks to be the workhorse back for the team working forward. He has back-to-back 200 yard games, and he could end up being a huge pick-up if he is available in your fantasy league. Part of the reason that Ajayi was able to run so well was the performance of his offensive line. This was the second time that the normal starters played all together, and they were able to open some huge lanes. If they stay healthy, the Dolphins could end up making a playoff push.

Ajayi actually didn't do much early - he gained 26 yards in the opening half - but Miami's offensive line wore down the Jets' defensive front late in the afternoon.

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi had only 16 yards on 11 carries by halftime, but not long into the third quarter, he broke off a 40-yard run behind Laremy Tunsil. A 25-yard pass to Jarvis Landry (6-53) put the ball at the 2-yard line, and Damien Williams plunged into the end zone to give Miami the lead. San Diego responded with a completion to Tyrell Williams, a run from Gordon, and a pass interference in the end zone. On third-and-goal, Rivers connected with Hunter Henry (2-11-1) to put San Diego up 17-14. Miami quickly responded thanks to a 21-yard run from Ajayi and Tannehill had about a 15-yard run to convert a critical third-and-11. Tannehill lofted in an 18-yard touchdown pass to Williams get the Dolphins back on top 21-17. After a Miami stop, the Dolphins' Jakeem Grant muffed a punt at 5-yard line, and Darrell Stuckey recovered it for San Diego. The Dolphins had a pass interference after a third-down stop, but Rivers had a pass thrown off the mark, and it was intercepted by Tony Lippett. The Chargers were able to get the ball back, and Rivers used Dontrelle Inman (5-43) to move into Miami territory, but then he had an overthrow picked off by Byron Maxwell to deny San Diego. A good punt return set up Rivers close to midfield with 5 minutes remaining, and less than a minute later, San Diego had a 24-21 lead as Rivers hit Tyrell Williams on the run for a 51-yard touchdown. Miami came right back though, as Tannehill stepped into a hit and threw another dime deep down the field to connect with DeVante Parker for 56 yards with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Corey Liuget tacked on to put the Dolphins at the 10-yard line. Miami had to settled for a field goal though, but that still tied the game at 24. A run by Gordon of 13 yards and a screen to him of 20 yards moved the ball across midfield, but then disaster struck for Rivers as Kiko Alonso undercut a route to pick off the pass and return it 60 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Rivers had 1 minute remaining, but Tony Lippett added his second interception to clinch the Miami victory.    Philip Rivers completed 23-of-44 passes for 326 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Tyrell Williams led San Diego with 5 receptions for 125 yards and a score.    Melvin Gordon was contained by the Dolphins' talented defensive line. He had 70 yards on 24 carries, but also contributed 5 receptions for 62 yards.    Ryan Tannehill completed 17-of-24 for 240 yards on 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't illustrate that Tannehill made some phenomenal throws, and he threw the deep ball better than any game I've ever seen from him.    Jay Ajayi (19-79) was contained by the Chargers' defense. DeVante Parker (5-103) led Miami in receiving.    "

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi posted 77 yards on 16 carries despite missing 2 of his best offensive linemen. However, that's misleading because most of Ajayi's yardage came on 1 36-yard burst. Ajayi couldn't find any room otherwise against Los Angeles' stout front.    Ajayi just barely outgained Todd Gurley, who tallied 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. As with Ajayi, a big chunk of Gurley's yardage came on 1 attempt, a 24-yarder that happened to be a first-quarter touchdown. The Dolphins stacked the line of scrimmage, much like every other team this year, daring the Los Angeles quarterback to beat them. Goff, like Case Keenum, couldn't get the job done to open up some running room for his stud running back.    No Ram accumulated more than 50 receiving yards. Britt led the way with 5 grabs for 43 yards, though he did draw a pass-interference flag on third down near midfield. Kendricks was next (4-38), but he lost a fumble in his own territory when "

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi fumbled in his own territory. And to top it off, they had a missed extra point after their first touchdown. They eventually took advantage of the Jets' errors, allowing them to pull away with a massive victory. The thing is, the Jets were hanging around well into the third quarter and even had double the yards Miami did at that point (225-129). New York also had more yards per play than Miami, 5.9-5.6, at intermission. The Jets simply self-destructed. They had 3 possessions in the first half in which they were over midfield, but came away with zero points. Bryce Petty was strip-sacked on 1 of the possessions. Petty then threw an interception right to Cameron Wake at the Miami 25, as he didn't see Wake dropping into coverage. The other drive saw Bilal Powell stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 at the Miami 47. The Jets were still down just 13-10 at that point, but the game quickly got away from them because of a blocked punt returned for a touchdown, a failure to pick up Ajayi's aforementioned fumble, and a Petty interception that happened to be a great play by Tony Lippett. The Dolphins managed to prevail, and they are now 9-5. However, they definitely were not as good as this 34-13 margin indicates. If they play like this against a real team, they are going to lose.    Matt Moore had nothing to do with Miami's struggles. In fact, he was 1 of the best offensive players the team had on the field on this particular evening. Moore misfired on just 6 attempts, going 12-of-18 for 236 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Moore was lucky to get away with a dropped pick in the first half, but he ate the Jets' secondary alive, as New York sent ineffective blitzes at him, exposing its horrible defensive backfield as a result. Moore's sole interception came on an underthrown pass. Now, before anyone gets excited, it needs to be noted that Moore was battling 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. We'll see what happens against legitimate NFL personnel.    Moore hit some big plays to Jarvis Landry and Kenny Stills for gains of 66 and 52 yards, respectively. Both scored touchdowns, as Landry eclipsed the century mark with 3 catches for 108 yards. Dion Sims (4-31) snatched a pair of scores.    Jay Ajayi and DeVante Parker had disappointing showings for their fantasy owners in the semi-finals."

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi to get into scoring range. They then ran the clock down and attempted a game-winning field goal. It was good from Andrew Franks.    Tyrod Taylor put together what was a very solid performance in the passing department. After starting the game looking shaky, Taylor slowly built up his confidence as the contest went along. In short, he kept getting better as time went on, and most notably, his deep accuracy improved. After missing several passes early on, Taylor was able to create a strong connection with Sammy Watkins and make some of the downfield throws. Overall, Taylor went 26-of-39 for 329 yards and 3 touchdowns. He really helped to lead the team's comeback, and if he plays like he did in the second half, he can be a franchise quarterback. His mobility really helps him, and it was a huge reason that the Bills were able to make the comeback. My theory on why Taylor struggled early is the rumors that have been swirling around him. Rex Ryan may not be returning as the head coach, and if he is not back, the Bills may opt to make a change at quarterback. Taylor is probably thinking about that possibility and may have been trying to force it too much. That would explain why he struggled. He was overthinking everything.    As usual, Buffalo's receiving attack generated a couple of strong performances from its top receivers. Leading the way on Saturday was Sammy Watkins (7-154, 1 TD), who put together a strong performance and really established himself as a downfield threat. If he is fully healthy in 2017, he could be a massive weapon for the Bills. The other top receiver for Buffalo was Charles Clay. The tight end, going against his former team, saw 10 targets and snatched 8 of them for 85 yards. He also caught 2 touchdowns and should be an athletic red-zone weapon.    Despite the strong performance from the passing game, the Bills' rushing attack was really what carried them. Once again, LeSean McCoy put together an absolutely stellar showing. He saw another 24 carries for 128 yards and parlayed 1 of the carries into a touchdown. He was able to follow his blockers very well and used his shifty running style to rip off chunks of yardage. Mike Gillislee also helped to contribute to Buffalo's success on the ground. He looked strong in his role as a backup, and he had a big role in the go-ahead drive. In overtime, Gillislee broke a huge run that put the Bills into scoring position. Had Carpenter not missed a field goal, the Bills would have had a chance to shut down the Dolphins on defense to possibly win. Overall, Gillislee racked up 91 yards on 11 carries. Taylor totaled 60 yards on 12 scrambles of his own.    At the end of regulation, Rex Ryan made a scene. It appeared that both Corey White and Ryan had tried to call a time out prior to Andrew Franks' game-tying field goal. However, Ryan called time out simultaneously with the snap, so the officials rightfully did not call the time out.    For the Dolphins, this was another solid showing for Matt Moore. The veteran quarterback was a solid game-manager, going 16-of-30 for 233 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was very costly, as it came in the end zone and cost the team points heading into halftime. That said, Moore was able to keep Miami's offense moving, and he opened things up for the running game.    Once again, the Dolphins rode Jay Ajayi to a huge performance. The second-year star saw 32 carries and turned them into a ridiculous 209 yards. He also ran for a touchdown. Ajayi looked very strong, yet also displayed a lot of speed. He was able to rip mercilessly through the Buffalo front, thanks to some poor tackling by the Bills. Change-of-pace back "

   "comment":"Jay Ajayi, who gained 46 yards on 12 carries. Ajayi had some nice runs called back for holding penalties. He was also stuffed on a key third-and-1. When Gase opted to punt after that, the game was over. Gase did a poor job in this contest. The Dolphins, now 1-2, look absolutely dreadful. They could really use a bye week to get Cutler in better rhythm with his teammates, but that's not possible because of Hurricane Irma, and all of the travel isn't helping either. You have to wonder about Miami's decision not to take a bye following London.   "

He mustered only 77 yards on 25 carries to go with his 2 catches for 2 yards. He also lost a fumble deep in his own territory. Ajayi was able to explode last year when Miami's offensive line got healthy, but it doesn't appear that the blocking is going to improve anytime soon.    The Titans, meanwhile, didn't have much of a chance with Cassel. Good teams often step up and play very hard with their backup quarterback, but Cassel is so terrible that the Titans couldn't prevail with him against a dreadful Miami squad. It's ridiculous that the Titans went into this season with Cassel as their reserve behind Marcus Mariota. Cassel completed 21-of-32 passes, but had just 141 yards and a touchdown. He also had the aforementioned fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Cassel was able to hit 1 big play, an apparent 59-yard score to "
