His plan didn't work, however, as Carlos Dunlap scooped up the ball for the Bengals and ran it back for a touchdown. Cincinnati covered because of that score. It was bizarre. There was no reason for Garcon to do this. Had he just gone down, it would have been a 2nd-and-5 at his own 38 with about 2:10 remaining. Garcon just had a brain fart, and it cost Indianapolis bettors.    That play ruined a solid game for Garcon, who caught 8 balls for 52 yards. "

   "comment":"Garcon in the end zone. Then he underthrew a wide-open Jacob Tamme. A false start and a sack later, and Indianapolis had to settle for a field goal. Orlovsky wouldn't complete another pass until 3 minutes into the second half. Even more damning is the fact that the Colts had just 1 total yard of offense in the second quarter. The Patriots, on the other hand, couldn't be stopped once they moved into their no-huddle. They scored touchdowns just prior to and after the half. Up 24-3, they sealed the deal by recovering yet another Delone Carter fumble.    New England did not seal the cover, however. They allowed cheap touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, including 1 where Orlovsky was getting sacked and just tossed it up for grabs to Pierre Garcon (9-150, 2 TDs). Garcon's second score was more legitimate, but it didn't really matter at that point (save for any poor bettor who had the Patriots in a teaser.)    Orlovsky went 30-of-37 for 353 yards, the 2 touchdowns to Garcon and an interception. Don't buy into these numbers though; most of Orlovsky's yardage came in garbage time.    As for the real quarterback in this matchup, "

Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to Rahim Moore for his second interception. Manning gave it right back when DeAngelo Hall ripped the ball out of the hands of Thomas for an interception. Kirk Cousins came in to finish out the game and threw a pick-six to Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Shaun Philips added an interception in garbage time.    Manning finished completing 30-of-44 for 354 yards with 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.    Griffin was 15-of-30 for 132 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions.

Terrence Knighton had a sack and a lot of pressures for the Broncos. "

   "comment":"Garcon for 30 yards, but the drive stalled inside the 10. A chip-shot field goal was blocked by Lawrence Guy. Chargers' punter Mike Scifres had 2 punts down to the 1-yard line. The second punt resulted in a defensive touchdown for San Diego. Griffin had a pass batted by Guy, and it ping-ponged off a few linemen before Sean Lissemore was able to control it for a pick-six. Just when the Chargers were looking like they were taking control of the game, Rivers and wide receiver Vincent Brown weren't on the same page as Brown cut outside when Rivers thought he would go to the inside. The ball floated to E.J. Biggers for an interception. A Griffin pass to Leonard Hankerson (5-55) and 2 runs by Alfred Morris ate up the remaining 30-plus yards and a touchdown for Morris. San Diego took the lead just before halftime. D.J. Fluker had a great block on a wide receiver screen to Eddie Royal (4-56) for a 15-yard touchdown. Corey Liuget batted 2 passes just before halftime and blocked a long field goal attempt on the final play. In the third quarter, Garcon (7-172) made a highlight reel 38-yard catch where he batted the ball up with 1 hand and controlled it after the ball bounced off Derek Cox."

   "comment":"Garcon and Santana Moss in the end zone.    Ponder, despite the dubious first possession, had a pretty solid outing. He let the ball hit the ground just 3 times, going 17-of-21 for 174 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was going up against a putrid defense, but the fact remains that he played very well after the ugly interception. Ponder also had a 14-yard scramble that appeared to be another score, but replay showed that the ball was fumbled and dribbled out of bounds just short of the goal line. Unfortunately, Ponder suffered an injury on the dive and had to leave the game. Matt Cassel - not Josh Freeman - took over for Ponder and also looked decent, completing 4-of-6 passes for 47 yards. Ponder hit a key throw that allowed Minnesota to bleed out the clock.    The Redskins couldn't exactly concentrate on Ponder (or Cassel) because they had to worry about wrapping up Adrian Peterson. The stud back didn't have a great YPC - he gained 75 yards on 20 carries - but he scored twice and ran really tough, dragging defenders with him on multiple occasions.    John Carlson had a big game for Minnesota. Taking over for the injured Kyle Rudolph, Carlson led the Vikings with 7 catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. Cordarrelle Patterson also scored, as he caught both of his passes (for 22 yards) on a single drive. Meanwhile, Greg Jennings struggled yet again with 3 catches for only 18 yards.    As for Girffin, he went 24-of-37 for 281 yards and 3 touchdowns, along with 7 scrambles for 44 rushing yards. He was masterful until the middle of the third quarter; at 1 point, he was 18-of-24 for 221 yards and the 3 scores. He was particularly lethal on third down, converting 9 of 16 tries, including a third-and-15 to Garcon. However, Griffin finished just 6-of-13 for 60 yards because the Minnesota pressure got to him.

Most of Jackson's yardage came on an 81-yard bomb in which he shook off a tackle. He then waltzed into the end zone backward and taunted the Eagle fans with their own celebration. The Philadelphia faithful responded with another chorus of boos.    The Redskins had more success running the ball than the Eagles did, but "

   "comment":"Garcon near midfield. DeSean Jackson followed that up with a drop, and the Giants proceeded to march down the field for another score. With Washington down early, the blunders multiplied. There was holding in the red zone. Logan Paulsen, playing for a concussed Niles Paul, then fumbled deep in New York territory to cost his team at least 3 points. After that, Cousins began firing countless interceptions. The first occurred because he predetermined where he was going to throw the ball and fired it to a covered receiver. The second was heaved carelessly downfield as he lofted the ball out of the back of the end zone. The third was heaved right at Trumaine McBride, and I just don't know what Cousins was possibly thinking on that play. The 4.h was a dying pass because Cousins had pressure in his face and couldn't step up in the pocket. Cousins finished 19-of-33 for 257 yards, 1 touchdown and the 4 picks. He was solid at times early on, but by the end of the evening, he looked defeated as he sat on the bench. It appears as though all of his confidence is gone, so it's a good thing that he'll have 10 days of rest to figure things out before the next game. The bad news? Washington has Seattle in Week 5.    As mentioned, Paul was knocked out of the game on a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit over the middle of the field. Paul (3-60) appeared to lose consciousness. He was helped off the field and never returned.    Neither of the primary Washington wideouts did anything. Garcon hauled in 2 balls for 28 yards, while Jackson reeled in just 1 pass for 9 yards. Jackson had a nice sideline catch taken away from him by a poor officiating ruling. "

   "comment":"Garcon (5-87, TD) eluded the inept Blidi Wreh-Wilson and Michael Griffin. McCoy misfired only once throughout the second half, going 11-of-12 for 128 yards and the touchdown. However, he threw nothing but checkdowns, managing the game. Again, this is better than anything Cousins did, but McCoy is not anywhere close to being a starting-caliber quarterback. The Redskins need Griffin to return, but he'll probably just get hurt again anyway.    Like Cousins, Alfred Morris had a disappointing showing. He was expected to have a big outing versus an inept run defense, but he managed just 54 yards on 18 carries. He got banged up early on, injuring his ankle, but remained in the game, so perhaps that's why he was so ineffective.    DeSean Jackson also remained in the game despite getting hurt. He injured his knee in the second quarter, but didn't miss much action. He caught 3 passes for 49 yards, 1 of which was a great grab along the sideline to set up a red-zone opportunity. Jackson also lost a 36-yard grab because of a hold and drew a long pass interference to set up the game-winning chip-shot field goal. Meanwhile, Jordan Reed tied Garcon for the team lead in receptions (5), registering 54 yards in the process.    The Redskins ultimately prevailed with a field goal as time was ticking down, but this was a Pyrrhic victory because they may have lost "

   "comment":"Garcon in the end zone, allowing a defensive back to break up the pass. The special teams was flagged for a personal foul on a simple kickoff kneel-down. A holding call negated a 25-yard reception by Jamison Crowder. Cousins launched another interception, a pass that was late across the middle into tight coverage. Andre Roberts dropped a pass. And, to effectively end the game, Matt Jones fumbled the ball into the end zone, resulting in a touchback. As you can tell, this was a horrible coaching effort by the Redskins. They didn't seem prepared to play, as Tom Coughlin coached circles around Jay Gruden. The Giants, meanwhile, improved to 1-2. They could - not should, like Jim Nantz repeatedly said - be 3-0 right now had they not blown consecutive double-digit leads in the 4.h quarter. They managed to hold on this time, at least, albeit against an opponent they've dominated for years.    Kirk Cousins had an awful game. The final numbers weren't bad - 30-of-48, 316 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but most of his yardage came in garbage time. By the time the score was 25-6 late in the second half, Cousins was just 11-of-19 for 132 yards and the 2 picks. That means that nearly 200 yards and a touchdown occurred when the game was out of hand, and the Giants were playing a simple prevent defense. Cousins is most definitely not the long-term solution for the Redskins. Both picks were poor throws, including his first 1 that he telegraphed, which showed how 10.ative he was. He could've thrown multiple scores, but his passes were underthrown and/or late. He was hurt by some drops, but many of his long-range passes were off the mark, at least when the verdict of this game was still up in the air.    The Redskins were expected to run the ball well in this contest; New York's ground defense hasn't been very good, while Matt Jones and Alfred Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents. It looked like they'd have success doing that early on, as they opened up with 2 nice rushes, but then left guard Shawn Lauvao was carted into the locker room. Lauvao may not be a big name, but he and Trent Williams are the team's best run blockers by a wide margin. Washington 10.s to pound the ball left most of the time, so not having Lauvao on the field really hurt. Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the 4.h quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    Jordan Reed led the Redskins in receiving with 96 yards on 6 catches. He was targeted 9 times. Much of his yardage came in junk time, but he'll continue to serve as a TE1 as long as he stays healthy. Reed has been injury-prone in the past, but he has changed his diet, and it appears as though it's paying off.    No 1 else on Washington's roster stood out. Pierre Garcon had an inefficient evening, catching 5 of his 12 targets for 64 yards. Don't blame Garcon though; Cousins had him open for a touchdown, but the ball was underthrown.    You might notice that someone named "

Cousins finished 22-of-40 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those are mediocre numbers, and yet they were enhanced by garbage time; at halftime, Cousins was just 7-of-14 for 60 yards and the pick. However, it's not like he played poorly. His receivers simply let him down.    Cousins' sole score came at the very end of the game, and it was lofted to Jordan Reed, who had a pedestrian game otherwise; he caught 3 balls for 18 yards, dropping some passesin the process. DeSean Jackson also disappointed; the leader of the Crips returned to the field, but managed to reel in just 3 of his 6 targets.    The top producers in the Washington passing attack were Garcon (4-70) and Jamison Crowder (6-50)."

   "comment":"Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over Josh Norman, for what was called a touchdown, but upon review, Perriman only got 1 foot down and it was overturned to an incompletion. On 4.h down, Will Compton broke up a pass intended for Wallace.    Joe Flacco was 30-of-46 for 210 yards and 1 touchdown. Baltimore's offensive line had problems protecting Flacco in the second half. Terrance West (11-95) led the Ravens on the ground.    Mike Wallace (7-63) was Baltimore's leading receiver. Dennis Pitta (7-59) played well, while Steve Smith (3-29) left the game with an ankle injury. Midway through the game, Breshard Perriman (2-11) dropped a perfect bomb for what should have been a 50-yard touchdown and didn't get his second foot down on the end-zone catch in the 4.h quarter.    Kirk Cousins was 29-of-41 for 260 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Garcon led the Redskins receiving. "

Rodgers had very little success heading in that particular direction, so it's remarkable that Cousins was able to rip through Green Bay's secondary that easily, despite the numerous injuries. Cousins made just 2 mistakes during the evening; he threw a pass wide of Robert Kelley in the flat and then didn't see a wide-open DeSean Jackson standing in the end zone. However, Cousins made up for it with a nearly flawless 4.h quarter. He misfired just twice after intermission.    As mentioned, Garcon (6-116) and Crowder (3-102) caught deep touchdowns, as the 2 led the Redskins in receiving yardage. Jackson (4-51) also scored. "

Just before the half, Arizona tacked on a field goal thanks to some excellent receptions by Larry Fitzgerald and Johnson. Arizona took a 10-6 lead into the locker room. To open the third quarter, Cousins threw a beautiful 59-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (his only catch), who ran by Tyvon Branch down the middle of the field to get inside the 10-yard line. Cousins was able to dive into the end zone on third-and-goal to get the Redskins a 13-10 lead. A Trent Murphy sack led to Arizona missing a 53-yard field goal. However, Calais Campbell strip-sacked Cousins and Markus Golden returned the fumble to the Redskins' 10-yard line. Carson Palmer then fired a fastball to Michael Floyd (3-18-1) for the score and a 17-13 lead. Cousins struck back with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder (3-42-1), who beat Tony Jefferson to get wide open. Arizona responded by ripping the ball down the field quickly and scored with a 25-yard pass to Johnson. The Redskins countered with a field goal to make it 24-23 Arizona midway through the 4.h quarter. The Cardinals went for a 4.h-and-1 at their own 34-yard line and Johnson ripped off an 18-yard run. Palmer then hit J.J. Nelson (1-42) for a 42-yard touchdown strike just after the 2-minute warning a few plays later. With forty seconds remaining, D.J. Swearinger blitzed to force a pass off the mark, and it was picked off by Patrick Peterson to clinch the Cardinals' win.    Palmer played very well, completing 30-of-46 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Fitzgerald continues to rewrite the record books as he totaled 9 catches for 91 yards.    David Johnson was the big star for the Arizona offense with 18 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Through the air, he had 9 receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Cousins was 21-of-37 for 271 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He added a rushing touchdown. Garcon led the Redskins in receiving with 78 yards on 7 receptions.

   "comment":"Garcon on a fade route. Cousins put that 1 right on the money, and it was probably his best throw of the day. Overall, this was another performance that will help make Cousins some money when he signs a long-term deal in the offseason.    Cousins' leading receiver was Jackson (3-102, 1 TD). Cousins only threw to Jackson on those 3 occasions, and the veteran was able to make some big-time plays. He still has excellent game-breaking speed. He can be trusted as a high-upside WR2 in the fantasy playoffs. There is always a chance Jackson could disappear though in a touch matchup. Elsewhere, Garcon (5-59, 1 TD) led Washington in targets with 6. and once again, he was able to work well in the intermediate game. I could consider him to be Cousins' No. 1 option moving forward, as the veteran has developed a strong rapport with the franchise quarterback this season.    "

Cousins is getting a ton of flak on Twitter, with a hilarious Jordan meme where Michael Jordan's face replaced Cousins during the iconic You like that? moment. However, while Cousins is partly to blame for the pick, the Redskins' offensive line is mostly at fault. The pressure they allowed prompted the losing pick. The other interception occurred because his receiver fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie also snatched that 1.    The only 2 successful targets for Cousins happened to be Garcon (4-96) and Jordan Reed (5-40, TD)."

They lost star safety Lamarcus Joyner to a hamstring, and Michael Brockers and Robert Quinn had to leave the game with injuries at some point. San Francisco, a team that hadn't scored a single touchdown entering this contest, transformed into an offensive machine, as both Garcon and Marquise Goodwin made circus catches along the sidelines to help Hoyer, who was gaining more confidence with every throw."
