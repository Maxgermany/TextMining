   "comment":"Pierre Garcon in the end zone. Then he underthrew a wide-open Jacob Tamme. A false start and a sack later, and Indianapolis had to settle for a field goal. Orlovsky wouldn't complete another pass until 3 minutes into the second half. Even more damning is the fact that the Colts had just 1 total yard of offense in the second quarter. The Patriots, on the other hand, couldn't be stopped once they moved into their no-huddle. They scored touchdowns just prior to and after the half. Up 24-3, they sealed the deal by recovering yet another Delone Carter fumble.    New England did not seal the cover, however. They allowed cheap touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, including 1 where Orlovsky was getting sacked and just tossed it up for grabs to Pierre Garcon (9-150, 2 TDs). Garcon's second score was more legitimate, but it didn't really matter at that point (save for any poor bettor who had the Patriots in a teaser.)    Orlovsky went 30-of-37 for 353 yards, the 2 touchdowns to Garcon and an interception. Don't buy into these numbers though; most of Orlovsky's yardage came in garbage time.    As for the real quarterback in this matchup, "

Cousins went downfield on numerous occasions, and 2 of his wideouts eclipsed the century yardage mark as a consequence. Garcon paced the team with 11 receptions for 138 yards and a touchdown, while Jackson accumulated 5 catches for 117 yards and a score of his own. Most of Jackson's yardage came on an 81-yard bomb in which he shook off a tackle. He then waltzed into the end zone backward and taunted the Eagle fans with their own celebration. The Philadelphia faithful responded with another chorus of boos.    The Redskins had more success running the ball than the Eagles did, but "

   "comment":"Pierre Garcon in the end zone, allowing a defensive back to break up the pass. The special teams was flagged for a personal foul on a simple kickoff kneel-down. A holding call negated a 25-yard reception by Jamison Crowder. Cousins launched another interception, a pass that was late across the middle into tight coverage. Andre Roberts dropped a pass. And, to effectively end the game, Matt Jones fumbled the ball into the end zone, resulting in a touchback. As you can tell, this was a horrible coaching effort by the Redskins. They didn't seem prepared to play, as Tom Coughlin coached circles around Jay Gruden. The Giants, meanwhile, improved to 1-2. They could - not should, like Jim Nantz repeatedly said - be 3-0 right now had they not blown consecutive double-digit leads in the 4.h quarter. They managed to hold on this time, at least, albeit against an opponent they've dominated for years.    Kirk Cousins had an awful game. The final numbers weren't bad - 30-of-48, 316 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but most of his yardage came in garbage time. By the time the score was 25-6 late in the second half, Cousins was just 11-of-19 for 132 yards and the 2 picks. That means that nearly 200 yards and a touchdown occurred when the game was out of hand, and the Giants were playing a simple prevent defense. Cousins is most definitely not the long-term solution for the Redskins. Both picks were poor throws, including his first 1 that he telegraphed, which showed how 10.ative he was. He could've thrown multiple scores, but his passes were underthrown and/or late. He was hurt by some drops, but many of his long-range passes were off the mark, at least when the verdict of this game was still up in the air.    The Redskins were expected to run the ball well in this contest; New York's ground defense hasn't been very good, while Matt Jones and Alfred Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents. It looked like they'd have success doing that early on, as they opened up with 2 nice rushes, but then left guard Shawn Lauvao was carted into the locker room. Lauvao may not be a big name, but he and Trent Williams are the team's best run blockers by a wide margin. Washington 10.s to pound the ball left most of the time, so not having Lauvao on the field really hurt. Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the 4.h quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    Jordan Reed led the Redskins in receiving with 96 yards on 6 catches. He was targeted 9 times. Much of his yardage came in junk time, but he'll continue to serve as a TE1 as long as he stays healthy. Reed has been injury-prone in the past, but he has changed his diet, and it appears as though it's paying off.    No 1 else on Washington's roster stood out. Pierre Garcon had an inefficient evening, catching 5 of his 12 targets for 64 yards. Don't blame Garcon though; Cousins had him open for a touchdown, but the ball was underthrown.    You might notice that someone named "

Overall, this was another performance that will help make Cousins some money when he signs a long-term deal in the offseason.    Cousins' leading receiver was Jackson (3-102, 1 TD). Cousins only threw to Jackson on those 3 occasions, and the veteran was able to make some big-time plays. He still has excellent game-breaking speed. He can be trusted as a high-upside WR2 in the fantasy playoffs. There is always a chance Jackson could disappear though in a touch matchup. Elsewhere, Garcon (5-59, 1 TD) led Washington in targets with 6. and once again, he was able to work well in the intermediate game. I could consider him to be Cousins' No. 1 option moving forward, as the veteran has developed a strong rapport with the franchise quarterback this season.    "
