   "comment":"Ricardo Louis led the Browns in receiving with 5 grabs for 64 yards. Britt (3-52) needs to be discussed because he drew plenty of boos from the crowd when he dropped a pass, slipped on a key play and was responsible for an interception. Cleveland needs to cut Britt now if it wants to salvage Kizer because Britt and his horrible lethargy are hurting Kizer's development. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
