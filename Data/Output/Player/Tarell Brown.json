   "comment":"Tarell Brown intercepting Clemens once again. Set up at the 13-yard line, the 49ers ran the ball 5 times with Hunter and Dixon (8-21 yards, TD) sharing the work and Dixon's score putting them safely up 34-13. Well, everyone thought San Francisco was safe with just 6:30 left in the game up 21 points. However, St. Louis was on a different page than the rest of America. A pass to Lloyd coupled with a 15-yard penalty put the Rams almost at midfield in the blink of an eye. Three plays later, a deep touchdown to Lloyd making it 34-20. After recovering the onside kick, which was moved up thanks to another 15-yard penalty on the 49ers, Brown was flagged for interfering with Lloyd, and the ball was spotted at the 1-yard line. Williams cashed in the touchdown from there, and, to everyone's amazement, the score was San Francisco 34, St. Louis 27 with plenty of time (4:36) left. The 49ers couldn't do anything with Smith sacked on third down by "
