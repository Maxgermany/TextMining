   "comment":"Brown. Smith wasted no time finishing this second-consecutive drive and putting San Francisco on top, completing 2 passes to Michael Crabtree (9-92, 2 TDs) to cover the 34 yards and make it 14-7. Cadillac Williams substituted in for Jackson on the next drive for St. Louis, but again, the team couldn't move the ball, so it flipped back to the 49ers. Having started at their own 33-yard line, which on this day was par for the course, San Francisco executed 2 short runs, which Smith followed by hitting Vernon Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, Frank Gore (7-9) was clearly not part of the equation due to an exhausting season of wear and tear. Two runs from Kendall Hunter for a total of 19 yards helped put San Francisco in plus territory, and a completion to Davis made it an easy field goal opportunity for Akers who put the 49ers up 20-7 at halftime when the Rams failed on their final desperation 2.minute drive. To its credit, St. Louis came out firing in the second half. Jackson ripped off a 27-yard run, but the drive stalled. The field position was changed at least, and San Francisco had to punt after a weak ensuing posession.The Rams responded with big gains to Kendricks and Lloyd, keying a drive that resulted in a 49-yard field goal from Josh Brown, trimming the 49ers' lead to 20-10. It looked like San Francisco had had about enough of that, completing passes to Crabtree and Davis, setting up yet another Akers field goal attempt. A funny thing happened though. No 1 covered Crabtree wide and Akers hit him for an easy touchdown, creating a seemingly safe 27-10 lead as the third quarter came to a close. Still, the St. Louis would not quit. A couple passes to "
