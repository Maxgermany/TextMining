Rivers came back to lead a nice drive with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Allen (8-128), who beat Amerson with a double move. With a few minutes remaining, Rivers engineered a great drive. He converted a 4.h down with a 26-yard completion to Allen, who was left uncovered. A pass to Danny Woodhead took the ball to the 6-inch line, but a great tackle by Amerson kept Woodhead (7-21 rushing, 9-77 receiving) out of the end zone. The Redskins came up with a clutch goal-line stand to force a field goal and overtime. The Chargers had terrible play-calling by Ken Whisenhunt, as San Diego threw the ball twice despite having timeouts available and being less than a yard from a game-winning touchdown. In overtime, Morris (25-121) had a nice run, and Griffin had great throws to Reed and Garcon to move the ball down the field. Young (5-12) scored his third touchdown from a few yards out to win the game for Washington.    Griffin was 23-of-32 for 291 yards with an interception. He also ran for 17 yards.    Rivers was 29-of-46 for 341 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Ryan Mathews (7-34) started strong before being pulled with an apparent injury.    There was some horrible officiating in this game. Antonio Gates lined up obviously offsides late in the second quarter, but wasn't called for it. A few plays later, Keenan Allen was flagged for an offensive pass interference when there wasn't any contact between him and the cornerback. In the 4.h quarter, Danny Woodhead fumbled the ball away but the referee blew the challenge. In overtime, the officials got ticky-tack with a helmet-to-helmet hit on Garcon. This unit needs to get it together before screwing up a critical game down the stretch.   Allen early in the 4.h quarter and David Amerson cut underneath for an interception.

   "comment":"Keenan Allen (3-27) once again disappointed his fantasy owners.   Allen simply refused to utilize Holmes when he's Oakland's most-talented receiver.    Carr's other scores went to Brice Butler (3-64) and James Jones (5-56). The latter was guilty of offensive pass interference in the first half on what was an obvious push-off.    The Raiders continued to feature Darren McFadden primarily in the running game. McFadden gained 80 yards on 14 carries, while Maurice Jones-Drew (4-30) barely saw any touches.    The best running back on the field was Branden Oliver, by far. The undrafted rookie handled a full workload in only his 4.h NFL game, tallying 101 rushing yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. He also caught 4 passes for 23 receiving yards. Despite being small, Oliver ran very tough and moved piles at times. He's completely legit.    The Chargers sputtered on occasion, but don't blame Philip Rivers, who went 22-of-34 for 313 yards and 3 touchdowns. Rivers was victimized by some drops - including 1 by Antonio Gates in the end zone - and saw some penalties ruin some promising drives. For example, a shady, late flag negated a field goal try, and then a terrible pass attempt on a fake punt sailed out of bounds.    Rivers' touchdowns went to Malcom Floyd (5-103), Gates (3-27), who missed out on a second score, and Eddie Royal (2-49), who injured his ribs. Keenan Allen (3-27) once again disappointed his fantasy owners.   "

A stiff arm and a nasty cut into the middle of the field plus speed that a 30-year-old man of his size shouldn't have, and there was his second touchdown of the game. He went on to have a couple more nice runs and also got vultured at the goal line by Zach Line for what should have been his third touchdown of the game, but the Vikings had built too large a lead, and they rested him for part of the 4.h quarter. Feel good about that fantasy pick.    Teddy Bridgewater on the other hand, didn't look sharp early, as the Vikings went to the air instead of pounding the ball on the ground with Peterson. But as soon as the running game got going, Bridgewater had a much easier time with a better pocket to work from. He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant. He was hurried and sacked all game, while his offensive line limped off the field seemingly every other play. D.J. Fluker was shown limping, Orlando Franklin was carted off the field with a right ankle injury, and King Dunlap also had to come out of the game. Rivers was officially sacked 4 times, but was pressured and harassed all game. He took 1 shot to the ribs that almost took him out of the contest, and when the game was officially out of hand, Rivers went to the bench where he couldn't be hurt anymore. Except for his feelings, maybe.    The Vikings' defense was led by Everson Griffen, who had 2 of those 4 sacks and dominated the Chargers line all game. Then, linebacker Chad Greenway twisted the dagger deeper when he intercepted a ball that Stevie Johnson couldn't hold on to in the red zone and returned it for a 91-yard touchdown in the 4.h quarter to put the game even further out of reach at 31-7.    Keenan Allen was the big offensive star for the Chargers as he saw 18 targets, catching 12 for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns.

He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant. He was hurried and sacked all game, while his offensive line limped off the field seemingly every other play. D.J. Fluker was shown limping, Orlando Franklin was carted off the field with a right ankle injury, and King Dunlap also had to come out of the game. Rivers was officially sacked 4 times, but was pressured and harassed all game. He took 1 shot to the ribs that almost took him out of the contest, and when the game was officially out of hand, Rivers went to the bench where he couldn't be hurt anymore. Except for his feelings, maybe.    The Vikings' defense was led by Everson Griffen, who had 2 of those 4 sacks and dominated the Chargers line all game. Then, linebacker Chad Greenway twisted the dagger deeper when he intercepted a ball that Stevie Johnson couldn't hold on to in the red zone and returned it for a 91-yard touchdown in the 4.h quarter to put the game even further out of reach at 31-7.    Keenan Allen was the big offensive star for the Chargers as he saw 18 targets, catching 12 for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns. On Allen's first touchdown, "

Allen's resurgence continues following a poor sophomore campaign. Green, meanwhile, had a big catch on the final drive, but that should've been negated by offensive pass interference. Green will take a back seat to Antonio Gates next week, so I wouldn't blame you if you decided to drop him.    Stevie Johnson led San Diego in targets (8), but caught just 4 balls for 32 yards.

The Giants took advantage with Manning lofting in a touchdown pass to Roger Lewis, who beat Casey Hayward for the 29-yard score. Rivers responded by leading the Chargers down the field, spreading the ball around on a 92-yard, 12-play drive. Once again, the Giants were burned by a tight end as Rivers made a tremendous throw off his back foot to lead Hunter Henry (3-42-1) past 2 safeties for a 25-yard touchdown pass. That gave the Chargers a 17-16 lead entering the 4.h quarter. The lead didn't last long as Beckham got wide open after torching Hayward for a 48-yard touchdown. A 2.point attempt failed, so New York had a 22-17 lead. Rivers led another drive deep into Giants territory, but Thompson came up big with a diving pass breakup to save a touchdown. Los Angeles cut the lead to 22-20 with just under 5 minutes remaining. Disaster than struck for New York as Beckham went down with an injury to his left leg and had to be carted off the field. That sucked the air out of the building, and on the next play, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Manning. Ingram recovered the loose ball to set up Los Angeles at the Giants' 11-yard line. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gordon in the flat, and Gordon darted into the end zone to give the Chargers a 27-22 lead. Manning had 1 more chance, but after getting to midfield, a tipped pass was picked off by Tre Boston to clinch the victory for Los Angeles.    Manning completed 21-of-36 for 225 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Manning was under constant duress as the Giants' offensive line was terrible in pass protection. Ingram and Joey Bosa each had 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    Beckham took 5 receptions for 97 yards and a score, but he broke his ankle. The Giants' receiving corps was absolutely decimated by injury in this game with Sterling Shepard (ankle), Brandon Marshall (ankle) and Dwayne Harris (foot) all going out prior to Beckham getting injured.    Wayne Gallman ran for 57 yards on 11 carries. He had more carries than Darkwa, but Darkwa outgained him.    Rivers completed 21-of-44 passes for 258 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Allen led the Chargers in receiving with 4 reception for 67 yards.    Gordon ran for 105 yards on 20 carries with 6 receptions for 58 yards and 2 touchdowns. Gordon was excellent, and he dominated New York's vulnerable linebackers.   "

As for Allen, this performance was a bit disappointing, given that the Raiders' corners had underperformed this season.

Allen can be trusted as a WR2 in fantasy and may have a chance to improve. Benjamin had an impressive performance on offense, and his explosive play-making ability was on display. His touchdown saw him outrun the Patriots' defense, and he almost had a second touchdown as well, but it was called back by a penalty. He is worth adding as a boom-or-bust type of play-maker. It is worth noting, however, that Benjamin produced 1 of the worst punt returns in NFL history in this contest. He muffed the ball around the 15 before picking it up at the 10. He then proceeded to run backward into the end zone, where he was tackled for a safety. Those 2 points gave the Patriots a lead they never relinquished.    Finally, the running game for the Chargers was a strength. "

Perryman, a very talented linebacker, made numerous big plays in this contest and helped limit Fournette to only 33 yards on 17 carries. It also didn't help that the Jaguars didn't have their starting right tackle, Jermey Parnell. His backup was abused by Joey Bosa, who had a terrific performance as well.    Bortles' sole touchdown went to Marqise Lee (6-55), who had a stupid taunting penalty in the 4.h quarter. Lee trailed Allen Hurns (7-70) and Keelan Cole (3-61) on the stat sheet."
