The woman-beater shouldn't be playing right now, but there's no denying that he's an unbelievable talent. DE Woman Beater treated Brady like 1 of his girlfriends on 1 occasion, hitting him so hard that the ball was jarred loose. Despite all of this, however, Brady wasn't sacked a single time in the second half. Bill Belichick made the proper adjustments, and the Dallas defense wore down because it was on the field so much. Brady consequently misfired on just 1 pass in the second half. He ended up finishing 20-of-27 for 275 yards, 2 touchdowns and the lost fumble. His sole incompletion following intermission was nearly picked, but he was flawless otherwise.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were drastically different. One was a short dump-off to "
