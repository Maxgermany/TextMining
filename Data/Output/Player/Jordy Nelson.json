Green Bay's defense was playing like garbage entering the 4.h quarter. Their pass rush wasn't getting to Freeman and their pass coverage was too soft as he moved the ball down the field. Early in the 4.h, Freeman hit Mike Williams on a 9.yard slant to make the score 21-19. Then Tampa Bay went for 2 and had a wide open Kellen Winslow drop an easy pass for a failed conversion. The Packers' offense woke up and started to attack the Buccaneers' vulnerable run defense. Green Bay was aided by some penalties by Tampa Bay, and fullback John Kuhn dove into the end zone from 2 yards out. After a Rodgers' interception, the Buccaneers got a big play downfield with a long pass from Freeman to Arrelious Benn. That set up a short touchdown pass to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe. Tampa Bay trailed 28-26 with 4 and half minutes left. The Buccaneers made a terrible decision to do an onside kick rather than to kick it deep. The Packers recovered the attempt and were set up at midfield in prime position to get a game-clinching score. Rodgers made the Tampa Bay pay with a perfect pass he dropped into Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown. . After a terrible game last week, the Buccaneers dug deep and played the Packers really tough. Rodgers' accuracy was off frequently in the game and he didn't look like his normal self against Tampa Bay. Green Bay's defense is showing some weakness with the amount of yards they are giving up. That could come back to bite them in the postseason. Freeman was 28-of-38 for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Winslow caught 9 passes for 132 yards, while Blount ran for 107 yards on 18 carries. Rodgers was 23-of-34 for 299 yards with 3 scores and an interception.

It was really a rinse-and-repeat situation for the next several drives. The Raiders went nowhere and the Packers kept scoring. First, Green Bay settled for a field goal on a drive wrecked by penalties to make it 17-0 early in the second quarter. Then they took what they wanted on a quick 84-yard drive covering just 6 plays. Two passes went to Driver for 28 yards, and the bookend completions were to Nelson who got loose down the sideline for a 37-yard score to start the bloodbath.

   "comment":"Jordy Nelson. Drops plagued the Packers in their loss to the Chiefs, and that issue festered once again. - Nelson. Drops plagued the Packers in their loss to the Chiefs, and that issue festered once again. - Aaron Rodgers missed a wide-open Jennings for a touchdown on the opening drive. The Packers would have to settle for a field goal. - John Kuhn lost a fumble in Giants' territory during the second quarter. - Rodgers then lost a fumble of his own in New York territory on the opening drive of the third quarter. - Rodgers had a wide-open Finley on a third down with 13 minutes to go, but missed him. He was sacked on the following play, which turned the ball over on downs. - Grant fumbled the ball away down 10 in the 4.h quarter. Chase Blackburn returned it inside the Green Bay 5-yard line. Eli Manning threw the game-sealing touchdown on the very next play to give his team a 30-13 lead.    Another Packer gaffe was a Jennings' lost fumble on the second drive. It was initially ruled a fumble, but then the officials discussed it and said he was down by contact. Tom Coughlin challenged the play because it was pretty apparent that Jennings did in fact fumble. FOX announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were even speculating on where the ball would be spotted. However, official Bill Leavy ruled that Jennings was down and offered no explanation. The Packers maintained possession and would go on to score a touchdown on the drive. If you're not familiar with Leavy, he's the inept/crooked ref who botched/fixed the Steelers-Seahawks Super Bowl. I don't know how the hell he's still permitted to officiate playoff games. He needs to be fired because allowing him to work another game would be completely irresponsible. He's either bought or just completely awful at his job.    The Packers also screwed themselves defensively. They barely got any pressure on Manning, while their tackling efforts were atrocious. I don't have enough fingers to count how many tackles they missed. It really hurt them when Hakeem Nicks caught an intermediate pass and was able to elude several pitiful defenders to score a 66-yard touchdown. That wasn't even the craziest Nicks score. Manning launched a Hail Mary on the final play of the first half, and New York Nicks came down with it in the end zone. The Packers covered the Hail Mary very poorly - almost as if they had no idea it was coming. Nicks finished with 7 grabs for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns. Mario Manningham (3-31) also scored. Victor Cruz (5-74) was also a factor.    The quarterback throwing the ball to these guys was absolutely incredible. Manning went 21-of-33 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He had no pressure in his face, as mentioned, but what he did on third down was amazing. The Giants were 8-of-16 on third downs, thanks to his clutch throws.    On the other side, Rodgers had good numbers (26-of-46, 264 yards, 2 TDs, INT) despite all of those aforementioned drops. With a non-existent rushing attack, he picked up 66 yards on 7 scrambles, most of which came on third down.    One Packer who did not have any drops was Donald Driver, who paced the team with 45 receiving yards and a score. Jennings (4-40), Nelson (3-39) and Finley (4-37) were all huge disappointments.   "

It negated a first down and ultimately forced a punt. - Mason Crosby nailed the spread-covering field goal, but missed 3 other kicks. The box score may say that he was 1-of-3, but he actually whiffed on a try just as Jim Schwartz called a timeout. One of Crosby's failed attempts was from 38 yards out. - The Packers had some time management issues prior to halftime. They let 30 seconds tick off in Detroit territory before settling for a long field goal, which was 1 of Crosby's misses. - Green Bay ran the ball too much. A statement like that may anger Tom Jackson, but James Starks was incredibly ineffective, rushing for just 74 yards on 25 carries. There was 1 sequence in which the Packers had a 1st-and-5. Starks was given 2 carries and picked up just 3 total yards. Following an incompletion on a 3rd-and-2, the team had to settle for a field goal, which was 1 of Crosby's misses. - Aaron Rodgers tossed an interception right before that, but Green Bay had possession only because of a Matthew Stafford fumble. Rodgers went 19-of-27 for 236 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. His best play occurred at the end of the first quarter when he showed tremendous elusiveness under pressure, evading the Detroit pass-rushers and finding Donald Driver for a first down. Rodgers was sacked 3 times, twice by Nick Fairley, who was completely dominant.    Rodgers' scores went to Cobb (9-74) and Jermichael Finley (3-66). Finley's touchdown was his first since Week 1.

This is why it's absolutely crucial for Rodgers to return. If the Packers don't have him or Lacy, they'll have major problems moving the chains next week despite how awful Chicago's defense looked Sunday night.    Lacy wasn't the only major Packer to suffer an injury. Clay Matthews aggravated his thumb injury in the first half and never reentered the game. There's a chance he broke it again, which would be disastrous.    A trio of Packers caught 3 or more passes: Boykin (5-54, TD), Nelson (3-46) and James Jones (9-84)."

He had an opportunity to reel in another reception, but he slipped in the red zone.    Green Bay's defense was just as excellent as its offense. It made Ponder look terrible. His final numbers - 22-of-44, 222 yards, 2 interceptions - aren't indicative of how poorly he played. As mentioned, the Vikings didn't run a play past midfield until there were 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ponder was then able to rack up some garbage yardage to make his stats look respectable. Ponder had major issues with pass protection. The Packers swarmed his backfield and brought him down on 6 occasions. They also forced some holding penalties. "

By halftime, he was 18-of-25 for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns. Rodgers was once again on pace to challenge an NFL record in the first half - this time, the single-game passing yardage mark - but as with last week's game, he stopped throwing because the contest wasn't competitive. Rodgers finished 22-of-36 for 341 yards and 3 touchdowns. Not included in those stats was a long pass interference that Nelson drew. Rodgers also picked up some first downs with his legs, scrambling thrice for 32 rushing yards.

Green Bay responded with 46-yard pass to Adams set up a Mason Crosby field goal. The Packers muffed the punt on the Titans' next drive, giving Mariota a short field. He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (2-8-1). The Packers scored quickly in response, as Rodgers used Adams to move the ball and set up a screen touchdown pass to James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown.

On the opening drive of the game, Rodgers made a great play to dodge a sack and find Jared Cook (6-85) for a 27-yard gain. Another third-down conversion to Cook and a roughing-the-passer penalty on Akiem Hicks set up a rushing touchdown for Ty Montgomery. The Bears answered as Barkley moved the ball with some nice completions to set up Connor Barth for a short field goal. The Bears then took the lead thanks to Barkley, throwing some ropes down the field. He threw a quick pass to the flat to Josh Bellamy, who ran over Damarious Randall with a stiff arm to get into end zone from 10 yards out. Rodgers responded with a field-goal drive to tie the game at 10. Chicago tried a Hail Mary in the final seconds of the first half, but Micah Hyde picked off the deflection. On the first play of the third quarter, Julius Peppers burned Charles Leno Jr. for a blind-side strip-sack of Barkley. Peppers recovered the ball to set up the Packers inside the Bears' 20-yard line. Davante Adams had his second dropped touchdown of the game though, and Rodgers was tackled at the 1-yard line on third-and-goal to force a field goal. Green Bay's defense continued to get the job done, with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix picking off Barkley to set up the Packers near midfield. A chunk completion to Adams and then a 26-yard run by Montgomery moved the ball to the 1-yard line before Montgomery plunged into the end zone. Clinton-Dix quickly picked off Barkley again, as wideout Daniel Braverman screwed up by quitting on the route. A few plays later, Christine Michael (4-45-1) broke down the field for a 42-yard touchdown run. Down 27-10, the Bears got back into the game, as Barkley started connecting with Alshon Jeffery (6-89-1) with 3 completions for 58 yards, including an 8-yard strike for 6. Barkley and Jeffery connected some more to set up a 9-yard touchdown run by Jordan Howard. Late in the 4.h quarter, Barkley made another drive deep into Green Bay territory, but on third-and-goal, Hyde made a tremendous diving breakup to force a game-tying field goal. With under a minute remaining on a third-and-long, Rodgers hit a 60-yard bomb to Jordy Nelson, who somehow got behind the Bears' coverage.

Cornerback Davon House and Randall Cobb were also knocked out. With so many injuries on both sides of the ball, the Packers couldn't be very competitive with the Falcons, who were an offensive machine in this contest despite losing a tackle themselves (Ryan Schraeder). Clay Matthews had success with Schraeder's backup, but that barely slowed down Atlanta. Matt Ryan's numbers don't look great - 19-of-28, 252 yards and a touchdown - but only because he barely threw following intermission. Out of 252 yards, 201 came prior to halftime. Ryan didn't do much in the second half, but he was effective on the 8 throws, as he completed 6 of them. They involved moving the chains and keeping the Packers off the field, chewing up enough clock for Atlanta to hold on to a giant lead for a change. Why the Packers never attempted an onside kick is beyond me. The Atlanta defense, meanwhile, did a tremendous job, although the stats don't show it. Rodgers finished 33-of-50 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 10-of-18 for 85 yards and a pick in the first half. The Falcons changed their defensive philosophy when they were way ahead, playing way off Green Bay's receivers. This allowed the Packers to accumulate tons of garbage yardage, but it also took a ton of time as well. Helping the Falcons' defense's cause was the play that occurred right before halftime. Rodgers, hit by Vic Beasley, fired a pass that was scooped up by Desmond Trufant, who ran the ball into the end zone. It looked like the pass was going forward, but the officials ruled it to be a lateral. Following the challenge, they inexplicably allowed the call to stand even though it was clearly the wrong 1. Suddenly, a 17-7 deficit turned into a 24-7 disadvantage at halftime, and the injured Packers couldn't climb out of that hole.    The Packers had a number of other things go against them as well. In addition to all the injuries, 2 big Cobb plays were negated by offensive pass interference. Mike McCarthy was so furious about the first that he was flagged for an unsportsmanlike penalty. As mentioned, Cobb (6-60) was knocked out with a shoulder injury, joining Nelson on the sidelines. Meanwhile, "

The Packers' victory was terrific, and the cherry on top is that they may have found a legitimate running back. Ty Montgomery is a solid player, but he's not a natural at the position. Rookie Aaron Jones definitely is, and he had a stellar performance in his first career start. Jones burst for 125 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries. He had a key run on the team's final drive; he picked up a big gain and also managed to step out of bounds.    Nelson was hampered with an injury, but he was still able to help his fantasy owners with a touchdown, catching 2 balls for 24 yards.
