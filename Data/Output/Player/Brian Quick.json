The eighth-overall pick had 5 catches for 39 yards, and he also found the end zone on a 63-yard bomb that was wiped out by a penalty. He also had the aforementioned lost fumble.   "

   "comment":"Quick, who was carted off the field with a left arm injury in the second quarter. The linemen who went down were guard Rodger Saffold, center Scott Wells and left tackle Jake Long. The latter could be done for the year with a torn ACL. It's amazing how unfortunate the Rams have been. They've had injury issues to their linemen for years. They've missed Sam Bradford over the past couple of seasons. Chris Long has been out this year. And now this. Perhaps it'll be a blessing in disguise, as it'll help the Rams land either Marcus Mariota or James Winston in the 2015 NFL Draft (go here for my 2015 NFL Mock Draft).    Davis couldn't do anything without 4 key players, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 92 yards in the second half.

Keenum was even worse than those stats indicate. He was wildly inaccurate, had numerous other picks dropped, showed zero pocket awareness - he ran into multiple sacks - and he constantly threw short of the first-down marker on third down. He is garbage, and he needs to be benched in favor of Jared Goff. There's no point in starting this middling backup anymore.    Austin, despite his mistakes, caught 10 passes for 57 yards and the early touchdown. Quick (4-92) led the Rams in yardage, while Kenny Britt (3-43) predictably disappointed because, well, he's Kenny Britt.

   "comment":"Quick wide open in the end zone on 1 occasion, but wasn't even close on his throw. Goff took numerous sacks because he held on to the ball too long, showing no pocket awareness. He also had a deer-in-the-headlights look far too often. Goff was ultimately knocked out of the game with a concussion when he was blasted by Richard Sherman on an attempted run into the end zone that wouldn't even count because of a penalty. Goff probably deserves a C- for this performance, so I guess he could've been much worse. Goff just doesn't look anywhere close to being ready to be called a franchise quarterback. This was the consensus of Goff heading into the 2016 NFL Draft, so it's still mind-boggling that the Rams used so many resources to acquire him. Goff probably should've been a second-round pick.    The Rams' miserable offensive line affected Todd Gurley as well. Gurley was limited to just 38 yards on 14 carries. He was blown up in the backfield far too often, as the Seahawks, like the other teams, were playing closer to the line of scrimmage because they didn't respect the Rams' passing game. Gurley was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 in the red zone in the opening quarter.    Just 2 Rams accumulated more than 20 receiving yards: Kenny Britt (4-50) and Brian Quick (3-46).   "

   "comment":"Quick for 31 yards. It was a perfectly thrown ball despite the fact that he was under pressure, and that really gave the team momentum. The next play was another perfect throw to Josh Doctson, who had a step on his man. Doctson rolled to a stop at the 1-yard line. After Rob Kelley punched the ball in on the next play, that was all she wrote. Cousins was able to do this despite having 4 missing offensive line starters. He did this despite the pressure. He really delivered when it mattered. Though his final stat line may look only decent, 21-of-31 for 247 yards, he really helped to carry the Redskins to victory at the end of the day. Cousins deserves a lot of credit for this surprising win.    Cousins' top targets on Sunday were Vernon Davis (6-72) and Josh Doctson (3-59). Davis filled in admirably for Jordan Reed and showed that he still has the athletic ability that once made him a major weapon. As long as Reed is out, Davis can be started as a low-end TE1. If he is available in your league, make sure to pick him up. Meanwhile, Doctson did most of his damage on the 38-yard pass on the final drive of the game, but it's clear that he's becoming a bigger part of the team's offensive system. Doctson can be added, and in certain matchups, he can be used as a FLEX. Elsewhere in the pass game, Terrelle Pryor (2-17) disappointed again, while Brian Quick (3-49) looked good when on the field. Pryor can be dropped in all leagues, while Quick is a player to monitor given his veteran status.    As mentioned earlier, the Redskins didn't do much on the ground. Kelley got 14 carries, but only managed 18 yards, though he did score twice. "
