The Texans' offense played flat throughout the early going, but the team's defense was so dominant, the offense didn't have to do much to have 24 points at the half. Houston controlled the ball in the third quarter. The defense played prevent to drain the clock in the 4.h quarter, and stopped Miami twice on 4.h-and-goal. Watt was an absolute animal for the Texans. He was a dominant force for 4 quarters and looks like he could be a NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate. All of Houston's defensive starters had good plays, including the secondary.    Houston entered this season having lost its 2011 starters on the right side of the offensive line, but right guard "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt, who took the ball back to the end zone for 6. The other sealed the victory for Houston on a horrible overthrow in the final minute of the game. Manuel also had several casual misfires. One that stood out occurred with a few minutes remaining in regulation. He had a receiver open on third-and-6, but launched the ball out of bounds. Manuel finished 21-of-44 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Buffalo's offense as a whole was a mess; the team was discombobulated, as it wasted timeouts and was flagged for procedural penalties early on and failed to block Watt throughout. It has to be completely embarrassing for the Bills that their first-round quarterback was outplayed by Fitzpatrick, who was run out of town after 4 pedestrian seasons. The humiliation showed when some lethargic Buffalo defenders didn't even bother touching "

He has now eclipsed the century mark in all 5 of his games this year. He also caught 6 balls for 56 receiving yards.

   "comment":"J.J. Watt were utterly dominant, while the Titans were incapable of stopping either player.    The Texans took the opening drive down the field for a touchdown, as Hopkins made some great catches, Arian Foster ran well and Fitzpatrick converted a 4.h down with a 14-yard run. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick threw to tight end Ryan Griffin for an 8-yard score. Promptly, Mettenberger overthrew Justin Hunter, and the pass was picked off by Johnathan Joseph with a return to the Titans' 20-yard line. A 7-yard touchdown pass to Foster (19-79 rushing, 5-26 receiving) then put the Texans in firm control. Starting at their 1-yard line, Fitzpatrick engineered a field goal drive. A sack by J.J. Watt then forced a punt. Fitzpatrick then took advantage with pretty 58-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins after he beat "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt and company in the second half. Arian Foster and Ryan Fitzpatrick managed the game to get points, as head coach Bill O'Brien had a superb performance as a play-caller. The Jaguars had a 13-10 lead at the half, but the final 2 quarters were all Houston.    Jacksonville got on the board first with a short drive aided by some Houston penalties and a 16-yard run by Denard Robinson (10-30). To finish the possession, Bortles rolled out and found Allen Hurns (5-36) in the end zone for a short touchdown pass. The Texans responded with Foster breaking off a 51-yard run to set up a field goal for Houston. Jacksonville quickly got the ball back and took advantage with a nice pass to Andre Johnson (4-17), and another run of about 20 from Foster. Fitzpatrick finished the drive by running into the end zone on a quarterback sweep. The Jaguars responded with a 3.point drive that was spurred by Toby Gerhart (5-19) running a first first down on a third-and-8 and a good gainer to tight end Marcedes Lewis (3-69). Clay Harbor dropped a long reception downfield, but landed a penalty via a late hit from D.J. Swearninger. On the Jaguars' next drive, Marqise Lee (5-67) made a great leaping catch over A.J. Bouye for 31 yards. A screen to Gerhart moved the ball inside Houston's 30, but Watt batted a pass on a third down to force a field goal. The Texans marched down the field during the third quarter with some great play calls by Bill O'Brien. To close out the drive, Alfred Blue (9-15) plunged into the end zone. Bortles promptly made a terrible decision on an interception to Swearinger to set up the Texans at Jacksonville's 26. A 25-yard pass to tight end Ryan Griffin went to the 1-yard line. On 4.h-and-goal from the 1, Foster made a great run after getting bounced back that saw him maintain his balance and dart to the outside for the score. After a 3.and-out by the Jaguars, the Texans drove for a field goal to ice the game.    Foster carried the Texans with 127 yards on 24 carries and 2 receptions for 21 yards. Fitzpatrick was 13-of-19 for 135 yards and 19 rushing with a score. DeAndre Hopkins had 49 yards on 4 catches.    Bortles finished 20-of-39 for 205 yards with a touchdown and interception. He also had a few picks dropped. Bortles really struggled in the second half, and the rush seemed to get in his head as his accuracy fell part.    Once again, J.J. Watt was dominant. The Jaguars' offensive tackles, "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt isn't voted MVP. Eh, I don't think so. Watt is incredible, and he's in the conversation, but how valuable can he be if he couldn't lead his team into the playoffs? He's not even the most valuable player in his own division. That would be Andrew Luck.    The Texans needed a win over the Jaguars - with Cleveland beating Baltimore and San Diego losing to Kansas City - to make the playoffs. The Texans and Chiefs did their part, but the Ravens' comeback win sent the Texans home for the winter. Still, Houston improved from 2 wins in 2013 to 9 wins this year while having a rash of injuries at quarterback and dealing with poor play at times from the signal-caller. Bill O'Brien and his coaching staff did a tremendous job and have the Texans going in the right direction.    Houston got the scoring started on its first possession. The Texans had a beautiful drive that started with Case Keenum hitting Andre Johnson on a slant for a gain of 29 yards. Damaris Johnson (3-33) then took a shovel pass for a gain of 34 yards. A screen pass to Foster (5-23) from 10 yards out went for a touchdown. The Jaguars answered with a nice drive led by runs from Jordan Todman and Blake Bortles. J.J. Watt put an end to that by burning "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt and Whitney Mercilus were awesome, as they destroyed Tennessee's offensive line and teed off on the statue in the pocket known as Zach Mettenberger.    The Titans' first possession produced a field goal after runs from Dexter McCluster and Antonio Andrews, a 12-yard pass to Dorial Green-Beckham, and a Brian Cushing roughing-the-passer penalty moved the ball in for a 35-yard opportunity. The Texans' defense then locked it down and started to win the field-position punt exchange between the offenses. Houston started a drive around midfield and a few passes moved the ball to Tennessee territory before DeAndre Hopkins made a tremendous leaping catch in the corner of the end zone for a 21-yard score. Bishop Sankey promptly fumbled the ball to the Texans on the kickoff. The Houston offense didn't move the ball though, and Nick Novack kicked a field goal. After trading punts, Dexter McCluster made a 37-yard return to the Texans' 28, but Whitney Mercilus had a sack, which along with a 15-yard penalty on Byron Bell, moved the ball out of field goal position. Houston took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Titans got going when Antonio Andrews put together a 28-yard run. A great play by Texans rookie corner Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt dominated the Jets' offensive line, and DeAndre Hopkins destroyed the New York cornerbacks to lead Houston to maintain a tie for first place in the AFC South. The Texans' defense entered this game having not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters, the longest streak of any team in the NFL this season, and they were going against former teammate Ryan Fitzpatrick 9 days after surgery on his hand. They extended the streak to 12 quarters before the Jets scored a touchdown, but Houston's defense still locked down New York to lead the Texans to their third-straight victory and a 5-5 record. The Jets have lost 4 out of 5 to fall to 5-5 as well.    Early in the first quarter, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates missed DeAndre Hopkins on an overthrow for what would have been a 70-yard touchdown after he burned Darrelle Revis running down the sideline. Houston got on the board first as its second drive netted a field goal. The Texans were moving the ball again before a blindside blitz by Marcus Williams led to a strip-sack that was recovered by New York. Houston's defense limited the Jets to a field goal. In the second quarter, Yates didn't miss again as Hopkins beat Revis on a deep post for a 61-yard touchdown. The Texans took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, a 44-yard pass interference penalty on Quintin Demps set up the Jets inside the Texans' 30-yard line. Fitzpatrick hit Brandon Marshall with a 21-yard touchdown pass after he got open against Kevin Johnson to tie the game at 10. Yates answered with 2 receptions to Cecil Shorts for 50 yards as he beat Revis for 15 yards and Antonio Cromartie for 35 yards. The Texans pulled out some trickeration with a throwback pass to Shorts, and he lofted in a 21-yard touchdown to Alfred Blue. J.J. Watt terrorized Fitpatrick and quickly got the ball back for Houston. The Texans' next drive was led by Blue running well, and it ended with Yates throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. In the 4.h quarter, Fitzpatrick led a touchdown drive with a quarterback draw from 5 yards out to cut the Texans' lead to 24-17 with just over 4 minutes remaining. The Jets' defense forced a 3.and-out, but on a 4.h-down play, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by "

Watt did as the Texans clinched the AFC South Championship with a win over the Jaguars. Watt was absolutely dominant, and the Jaguars' weak offensive line was incapable of blocking Watt. Houston's defense was utterly suffocating against a Jacksonville offense that has been a steady point-machine this season. The Jaguars finished 5-11 in 2015, and "

That was the case in this game, as Spencer Ware was given just 12 touches. It made no sense after last week's brilliant performance. And it's not like Ware didn't do much; he had 57 yards on 10 carries and 2 catches for 48 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"J.J. Watt suffered injuries, it was over. Mercilus' chest malady was bad enough, but the life was sucked out of the stadium when Watt suffered a knee injury. Watt had to be carted into the locker room and was eventually taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a fracture in his knee, though it's unclear how severe something like that is. What we do know is that Watt couldn't put any sort of pressure on his leg, so he will certainly miss several games. Hopefully he's not out for the year because he was enjoying a terrific season. Watt is the heart and soul of the team, and the Texans looked lost without him. They just couldn't get off the field, as their defense surrendered 35 points (7 more came on a punt return touchdown). The offense struggled early, but got moving eventually. That didn't even matter because the Chiefs converted third down after third down, as Houston had no push up front with Watt and Mercilus out of the lineup.    "
