Houston controlled the ball in the third quarter. The defense played prevent to drain the clock in the 4.h quarter, and stopped Miami twice on 4.h-and-goal. Watt was an absolute animal for the Texans. He was a dominant force for 4 quarters and looks like he could be a NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate. All of Houston's defensive starters had good plays, including the secondary.    Houston entered this season having lost its 2011 starters on the right side of the offensive line, but right guard "

No. 1 overall-pick Jadeveon Clowney was disruptive in the first half and played well before a sprained MCL knocked him out at halftime. Even with a new coaching staff, it was a similar story for the Redskins, as crushing mistakes and turnovers gave the game away. Robert Griffin III had no time to throw the ball, and turnovers inside the Texans 10-yard line took away critical points from Washington.    In the first quarter, both teams struggled to move the chains. After a good 26-yard punt return from Andre Roberts, the Redskins got some good Alfred Morris runs that took Washington from midfield to the goal line, and that set up a short touchdown run for fullback Darrel Young. Houston came back right back as DeAndre Hopkins (4-89) got wide open in busted coverage for a 76-yard touchdown. A few plays later, Texans rookie running back Alfred Blue blocked a punt and scooped it up to return it a few yards for a touchdown. Houston was up 14-6 at the half.    The Redskins self-destructed during the third quarter. Morris (14-91) fumbled a handoff inside the Texans 10-yard line and Watt recovered the ball. Shortly later, Washington had a pass play of 47 yards to "

   "comment":"Watt came in as a tight end and released off the line to get wide open in the back of the end zone for a touchdown catch. The next drive, it was all Foster as he rolled down the field and into the end zone. Oakland got a splash play with a 41-yard run by Derek Carr that caught Houston completely by surprise, but Carr ended the drive by throwing a pick to Kareem Jackson that was returned deep into Oakland territory to set up a field goal. The Raiders had a funny blooper-reel play as James Jones caught a pass downfield and was stripped by Kendrick Lewis. Jones then picked up his own fumble and ran it 20 yards inside the 10-yard line before fumbling again after getting hit by Jonathan Joseph. D.J. Swearinger recovered the ball for Houston. After halftime, the Raiders had a good drive going before Mychal Rivera fumbled the ball away after a hit from Swearinger. Joseph picked up the ball and returned it 50 yards. That set up a 12-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins (3-22). Oakland finally scored with a short touchdown run from Darren McFadden (12-37 rushing, 2-31 receiving) early in the 4.h quarter. Late in the game, Watt blasted Carr and forced a deflection that was caught by Brooks Reed for an interception."

Manuel finished 21-of-44 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Buffalo's offense as a whole was a mess; the team was discombobulated, as it wasted timeouts and was flagged for procedural penalties early on and failed to block Watt throughout. It has to be completely embarrassing for the Bills that their first-round quarterback was outplayed by Fitzpatrick, who was run out of town after 4 pedestrian seasons. The humiliation showed when some lethargic Buffalo defenders didn't even bother touching "

In addition to recovering that fumble, Watt had a sack, forced a fumble, had several tackles for losses, single-handedly screwed up a Cleveland drive that went 18 yards in the wrong direction, and even caught another touchdown. Watt's aggression backfired on a couple of instances when he committed 2 roughing-the-punter penalties.    On the offensive side of the ball for Houston, all eyes were on "

The Texans took the opening drive down the field for a touchdown, as Hopkins made some great catches, Arian Foster ran well and Fitzpatrick converted a 4.h down with a 14-yard run. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick threw to tight end Ryan Griffin for an 8-yard score. Promptly, Mettenberger overthrew Justin Hunter, and the pass was picked off by Johnathan Joseph with a return to the Titans' 20-yard line. A 7-yard touchdown pass to Foster (19-79 rushing, 5-26 receiving) then put the Texans in firm control. Starting at their 1-yard line, Fitzpatrick engineered a field goal drive. A sack by J.J. Watt then forced a punt. Fitzpatrick then took advantage with pretty 58-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins after he beat "

Jacksonville got on the board first with a short drive aided by some Houston penalties and a 16-yard run by Denard Robinson (10-30). To finish the possession, Bortles rolled out and found Allen Hurns (5-36) in the end zone for a short touchdown pass. The Texans responded with Foster breaking off a 51-yard run to set up a field goal for Houston. Jacksonville quickly got the ball back and took advantage with a nice pass to Andre Johnson (4-17), and another run of about 20 from Foster. Fitzpatrick finished the drive by running into the end zone on a quarterback sweep. The Jaguars responded with a 3.point drive that was spurred by Toby Gerhart (5-19) running a first first down on a third-and-8 and a good gainer to tight end Marcedes Lewis (3-69). Clay Harbor dropped a long reception downfield, but landed a penalty via a late hit from D.J. Swearninger. On the Jaguars' next drive, Marqise Lee (5-67) made a great leaping catch over A.J. Bouye for 31 yards. A screen to Gerhart moved the ball inside Houston's 30, but Watt batted a pass on a third down to force a field goal. The Texans marched down the field during the third quarter with some great play calls by Bill O'Brien. To close out the drive, "

   "comment":"Watt and Whitney Mercilus were awesome, as they destroyed Tennessee's offensive line and teed off on the statue in the pocket known as Zach Mettenberger.    The Titans' first possession produced a field goal after runs from Dexter McCluster and Antonio Andrews, a 12-yard pass to Dorial Green-Beckham, and a Brian Cushing roughing-the-passer penalty moved the ball in for a 35-yard opportunity. The Texans' defense then locked it down and started to win the field-position punt exchange between the offenses. Houston started a drive around midfield and a few passes moved the ball to Tennessee territory before DeAndre Hopkins made a tremendous leaping catch in the corner of the end zone for a 21-yard score. Bishop Sankey promptly fumbled the ball to the Texans on the kickoff. The Houston offense didn't move the ball though, and Nick Novack kicked a field goal. After trading punts, Dexter McCluster made a 37-yard return to the Texans' 28, but Whitney Mercilus had a sack, which along with a 15-yard penalty on Byron Bell, moved the ball out of field goal position. Houston took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Titans got going when Antonio Andrews put together a 28-yard run. A great play by Texans rookie corner Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by "

   "comment":"Watt dominated the Jets' offensive line, and DeAndre Hopkins destroyed the New York cornerbacks to lead Houston to maintain a tie for first place in the AFC South. The Texans' defense entered this game having not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters, the longest streak of any team in the NFL this season, and they were going against former teammate Ryan Fitzpatrick 9 days after surgery on his hand. They extended the streak to 12 quarters before the Jets scored a touchdown, but Houston's defense still locked down New York to lead the Texans to their third-straight victory and a 5-5 record. The Jets have lost 4 out of 5 to fall to 5-5 as well.    Early in the first quarter, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates missed DeAndre Hopkins on an overthrow for what would have been a 70-yard touchdown after he burned Darrelle Revis running down the sideline. Houston got on the board first as its second drive netted a field goal. The Texans were moving the ball again before a blindside blitz by Marcus Williams led to a strip-sack that was recovered by New York. Houston's defense limited the Jets to a field goal. In the second quarter, Yates didn't miss again as Hopkins beat Revis on a deep post for a 61-yard touchdown. The Texans took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, a 44-yard pass interference penalty on Quintin Demps set up the Jets inside the Texans' 30-yard line. Fitzpatrick hit Brandon Marshall with a 21-yard touchdown pass after he got open against Kevin Johnson to tie the game at 10. Yates answered with 2 receptions to Cecil Shorts for 50 yards as he beat Revis for 15 yards and Antonio Cromartie for 35 yards. The Texans pulled out some trickeration with a throwback pass to Shorts, and he lofted in a 21-yard touchdown to Alfred Blue. J.J. Watt terrorized Fitpatrick and quickly got the ball back for Houston. The Texans' next drive was led by Blue running well, and it ended with Yates throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. In the 4.h quarter, Fitzpatrick led a touchdown drive with a quarterback draw from 5 yards out to cut the Texans' lead to 24-17 with just over 4 minutes remaining. The Jets' defense forced a 3.and-out, but on a 4.h-down play, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Watt strip-sacked Zach Mettenberger and Houston recovered.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 117 yards and a score. What he's done this year with Houston's 4 different starting quarterbacks is truly remarkable.    Weeden was 15-of-24 for 200 yards with 2 touchdowns and a running score. Daniels was used as a read-option quarterback with 6 carries for 6 yards and 1 completion for 7 yards on 2 pass attempts.    David Cobb had 7 carries for 18 yards and Bishop Sankey had 2 for 11. Sankey also caught 3 passes for 43 yards.    Titans tight end Delanie Walker had 9 receptions for 59 yards. Harry Douglas led Tennessee's receivers with 6 catches for 79 yards. Kendall Wright snagged 3 passes for 18 yards before leaving with a knee injury. Dorial Green-Beckham was held without a catch.    The Titans maintain the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft with this loss. Tennessee leads the NFL with 50 sacks allowed, and building around Marcus Mariota will be critical. Thus, Ole Miss left tackle Laremy Tunsil is making all kinds of sense. On a related note, Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan left the game with a concussion.    The Texans got a good game out of their secondary with nice performances by their trio of first-round cornerbacks Johnathan Joseph, Kevin Johnson and Kareem Jackson. Watt had 4 tackles with his strip-sack and drew 2 holding penalties. In the 4.h quarter, however, "

   "comment":"Watt suffered injuries, it was over. Mercilus' chest malady was bad enough, but the life was sucked out of the stadium when Watt suffered a knee injury. Watt had to be carted into the locker room and was eventually taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a fracture in his knee, though it's unclear how severe something like that is. What we do know is that Watt couldn't put any sort of pressure on his leg, so he will certainly miss several games. Hopefully he's not out for the year because he was enjoying a terrific season. Watt is the heart and soul of the team, and the Texans looked lost without him. They just couldn't get off the field, as their defense surrendered 35 points (7 more came on a punt return touchdown). The offense struggled early, but got moving eventually. That didn't even matter because the Chiefs converted third down after third down, as Houston had no push up front with Watt and Mercilus out of the lineup.    "
