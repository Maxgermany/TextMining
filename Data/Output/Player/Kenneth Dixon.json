He needs to be used more down the stretch, as he's the best running back on the roster.    Moving on to the Browns, I've always defended Hue Jackson, as I liked what he accomplished in Oakland, and he had the Browns playing hard this year. What he did in this game proves that he doesn't have what it takes to be a head coach in the NFL. Rookie quarterback "

Miami, as mentioned, scored its only points following Pitta's fumble. The Dolphins simply couldn't get anything going the entire afternoon. Whenever they'd have a positive drive going, they'd either take a sack, commit a penalty or turn the ball over. They were very sloppy, and I have to imagine that Mike Pouncey's absence had something to do with it. Still, that doesn't excuse "
