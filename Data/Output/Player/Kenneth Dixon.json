If you're wondering how the Bengals went from 12 to 14 at the very end, John Harbaugh brilliantly had his punter remain in the end zone as the clock expired, while all of his linemen intentionally held. A game can't end on a defensive penalty, but it can on an offensive penalty, and Harbaugh took advantage of the loophole. The NFL rules committee should think about making some changes this offseason.   "

   "comment":"Dixon and Terrance West split carries almost evenly, but the former was predictably so much more effective. Dixon had 12 attempts compared to West's 10, but the rookie outgained the veteran, 57-27. On 1 occasion, Dixon converted a third-and-1 with a great power run. It's very evident that he's infinitely superior compared to West, and it's fair to wonder if the Ravens would've made the playoffs had they given the talented Dixon way more touches than the ineffective West in the second half of the season.
