   "comment":"Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out. Troy Niklas (2-12) had 2 scores.    Josh McCown was 18-of-34 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The Browns had no running game. McCown led them with 18 yards on 5 carries. Isaiah Crowell (10-14) was ineffective, and for some reason, the explosive Duke Johnson had only 1 carry for 3 yards despite catching 2 passes for 68 yards.    Gary Barnidge led the Browns with 7 receptions for 53 yards. Taylor Gabriel (4-32) and Travis Benjamin (3-26) were ineffective.    Arizona's defense got a strip-sack out of Dwight Freeney and put a lot of heat on McCown in the second half. Surprisingly, the Cardinals' secondary had an underwhelming game against Cleveland.    After being beaten by Floyd on the long touchdown, Haden went into the locker room with a head injury. Armonty Bryant and Karlos Dansby played well for the Browns.   "

   "comment":"Dansby. Savage finished 18-of-29 for 176 yards. Credit O'Brien for sticking with his young quarterback, as moving back to Osweiler might have been crushing for the team. Still, Savage needs to improve for the Texans not to get blown out of the water in their opening-round playoff matchup.    Hopkins had a rough evening. He led his team with 43 receiving yards, but he dropped a pass and was flagged twice for offensive pass interference. "

   "comment":"Dansby to clinch the win for the Cardinals.    Peterson totaled 159 yards on 37 carries for Arizona. The Cardinals wisely leaned on him rather than the pedestrian Stanton. Stanton was 15-of-30 for 201 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Fitzgerald caught 5 passes for 70 yards.    Beathard was 24-of-51 for 294 yards with an interception. He was pounded as the 49ers' offensive line really struggled to keep defenders from hitting their quarterback. Hyde had 41 yards on 12 carries with 9 receptions for 84 yards before getting ejected.
