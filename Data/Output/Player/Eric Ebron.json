Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards.

Jim Caldwell didn't challenge a potential fumble by Hopkins that was ruled incomplete and recovered by the Lions. A 23-yard pass to Will Fuller (1-23) set up a Houston field goal. Stafford answered by moving into Texans territory with 2 passes to Theo Riddick for almost 30 yards and a third-down conversion to Ebron. A pass interference on Corey Moore on Ebron in the end zone put the ball at the 1-yard line. A short touchdown pass to Theo Riddick cut the Texans' lead to 17-10 early in the 4.h quarter. Houston put a clock-eating drive together led by Miller and Alfred Blue running the ball into the red zone. However, guard Xavier Su'a-Filo ruined the drive with a holding call and then allowed a sack on third down, so the Texans settled for a Nick Novack field goal. Detroit got a good return to midfield and with quick passes to Tate (7-42) and Riddick, and moved the ball to Houston's 21-yard line. The Texans' defense a stopped the Lions there, and Prater hit a short field goal to cut it to 20-13 with just under 3 minutes remaining. Surprisingly, Detroit went for an onside kick with 2:52 remaining and all 3 timeouts available. The Texans easily recovered the ball, and that set them up in Detroit territory. It made more sense to kick it deep and make the Texans drive the ball while aiming for getting the ball back in better field position. In the end, it didn't matter because Miller ran well to get a few first downs and run out the clock on the Lions.    Stafford was 27-of-41 for 240 yards with a touchdown. The Texans have 1 of the best pass defenses in the NFL, and they proved it against the Lions, who were red hot entering this game. Cornerback A.J. Bouye played well against for Houston, while veteran cornerbacks Kareem Jackson and Johnathan Joseph had bounce-back performances and were very good in coverage.

Stafford finished 24-of-39 for 273 yards and a late, desperation interception. His longest pass was a 67-yard bomb, as Golden Tate beat Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie with a double move. Rodgers-Cromartie would end up having the last laugh because he was the 1 who picked off Stafford. I'd say Stafford has to be disappointed with his performance. His finger didn't hinder his passes, and he's going to be regretting missing Tate in the end zone. Stafford also couldn't take advantage of Janoris Jenkins' absence, as Jenkins also got hurt in the first half. Stafford could've posted a better stat line - Golden Tate ran a bad route to negate a completion of 25 yards, and Eric Ebron dropped a pass in the red zone - but he didn't play his best game.    Perhaps the most important play of this contest occurred at the end of a seemingly successful Detroit drive. Following Tate's long catch, the Lions fed the ball to Zenner, who rushed inside the New York 5-yard line. However, he fumbled, and the Giants recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback.
