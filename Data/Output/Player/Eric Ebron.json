This isn't a mistake, but the offense couldn't do a single thing after Calvin Johnson aggravated his ankle injury in the third quarter. Lions' beat reporter Tim Twentyman said Megatron would be more than a decoy in this contest, but the monstrous wideout caught just 1 pass for 7 yards. Despite the additions of Ebron and Golden Tate, who had a big game (7 catches, 134 yards, TD), Stafford simply looked lost without his top option."

He needed just 1 more drive to get the tie, but a possession was disrupted because of a couple of sacks. Taylor Decker was responsible for both of those. He had a rough afternoon.    Marvin Jones had a huge performance. He kicked things off with a great catch on an underthrown pass and ultimately finished with 6 grabs for 205 yards and 2 touchdowns.

He's been a colossal bust and will need to be replaced soon. Stafford struggled as a result of some of his horrible teammates, and the offensive line didn't help matters, surrendering a ton of pressure to a defense in shambles.

   "comment":"Ebron open in the flat. Stafford also underthrew Golden Tate in the end zone by a bit in the first quarter, allowing Eli Apple to recover and break up the pass, though I don't think Stafford's finger was a factor on that pass. Stafford finished 24-of-39 for 273 yards and a late, desperation interception. His longest pass was a 67-yard bomb, as Golden Tate beat Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie with a double move. Rodgers-Cromartie would end up having the last laugh because he was the 1 who picked off Stafford. I'd say Stafford has to be disappointed with his performance. His finger didn't hinder his passes, and he's going to be regretting missing Tate in the end zone. Stafford also couldn't take advantage of Janoris Jenkins' absence, as Jenkins also got hurt in the first half. Stafford could've posted a better stat line - Golden Tate ran a bad route to negate a completion of 25 yards, and Eric Ebron dropped a pass in the red zone - but he didn't play his best game.    Perhaps the most important play of this contest occurred at the end of a seemingly successful Detroit drive. Following Tate's long catch, the Lions fed the ball to Zenner, who rushed inside the New York 5-yard line. However, he fumbled, and the Giants recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. Zenner didn't get much work on the ground (3-12), though he did catch 4 passes for 52 yards. "
