Buffalo quickly responded with O'Leary (2-58) and the second coming on Taylor scrambling to convert a third-and-10. The Bills also settled for a field goal. Tampa Bay responded with another field goal drive. Buffalo quickly responded with LeSean McCoy ripping off 23 yards.

The Bills recovered the ball, but a missed field goal bailed out Tampa Bay.

Taylor to move the ball through the Bucs' defense, connecting with O'Leary for 32 yards to convert a third-and-long. That set up Stephen Hauschka, who, this time, was good on a 52-yard field goal. Tampa Bay responded with Winston finding Howard wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. The Bills left Howard completely uncovered after a boot action. Taylor soon snatched 23 yards with "
