However, he could still be out for at least 1 game, and another banged-up player is the last thing Green Bay needs right now, considering how much of the team's personnel is sidelined. The Packers played this contest without James Jones and Randall Cobb, but "

  "comment":"Tashaun Gipson ran back for a touchdown, but after replay review, it was ruled that Gipson was down by contact. It didn't seem like he was down by contact, so it was very curious that they changed the call on the field. Still, Gordon (16-27) wasn't doing much on the ground, but it was still extremely puzzling as to why Ekeler (10-42) was getting the touches in such an important situation. Ekeler was a big factor in the passing game - 5 catches, 77 receiving yards, 2 touchdowns - but he's obviously not the talented runner Gordon has to be.    There was a ",
