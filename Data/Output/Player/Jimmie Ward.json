   "comment":"Ward had fits trying to do so. Fitzgerald looks like a low-end WR1 moving forward in fantasy. Aside from Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd (5-101) had a strong game. Floyd made a couple of nice, high-point catches where he outjumped his defender. Floyd had a rough start to the season, but maybe he will come on moving forward. John Brown (2-30) and J.J. Nelson (2-29) counteracted each other and did not make much of an impact.    Perhaps the most surprising part of this contest was the performance of David Johnson. The 49ers have the worst rush defense in the league, and many expected that Johnson would have a huge performance against them. However, Johnson had some trouble getting through San Francisco's defensive line. He ran the ball 19 times for just 55 yards and a touchdown. He also had an impact in the receiving game, catching 5 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown. Johnson is still the workhorse back, and he will rebound. Being without left tackle Jared Veldheer certainly had an impact on Johnson today.    Defensively, Chandler Jones continues to be 1 of the better pass-rushers in the NFL. Jones had another 2 sacks against the hyper-mobile Colin Kaepernick. It really makes you wonder why the Patriots decided to deal Jones.    For the 49ers, this was a really nice showing. As mentioned earlier, the team was not expected to compete with the Cardinals, but the 49ers were able to do so. Colin Kaepernick had an OK performance. As a passer, he continued to be as mediocre as ever. He went 17-of-30 for 210 yards and a touchdown. Kaepernick avoided making too many mistakes, and while some of his throws were inaccurate, he got the job done. He led the game-tying drive with poise and proves that he at least belongs in the NFL. Kaepernick made more of an impact on the ground, per usual. He ran the ball 10 times for 55 yards, and he did run for the touchdown on the game-tying drive. That run was particularly nice, as the coaching staff designed it so Kaepernick would have a 1.on-one matchup. Kaepernick still 10.s to scramble too early, but for the most part in this game, he only did it when necessary. The 49ers have to be happy with his performance on Sunday.    Kaepernick was virtually the only impactful member of San Francisco's ground game. Carlos Hyde carried the ball 13 times and only totaled a measly 14 yards. He was stopped behind the line on many tackles, and he did not look agile. The Cardinals' defense was able to really clog the lanes though, so perhaps that was part of his problem. Hyde also is coming off of an injury, so he might be shaking off some rust. Regardless, he will continue to be the primary back while DuJuan Harris (5-14) works as the backup.    In terms of receiving, Kaepernick heavily targeted Jeremy Kerley (7-71, 1 TD) and Quinton Patton (3-52). Kerley was solid all around and was able to get open against Arizona's secondary. Without Tyrann Mathieu, the unit struggled to contain the speedy Kerley, and he produced as a result. Kerley could be worth a speculative add, but he is too inconsistent to be relied on in fantasy. Patton, meanwhile, only caught 3 of his 9 targets. He could become a producer, but for now, he is just a mediocre option on a team with quarterback questions. Tight end Vance McDonald (4-50) was able to make an impact on the game as well.    The 49ers' defensive line played well in this matchup. Rookie DeForest Buckner looks like a future star, and Quinton Dial was able to make some plays too. In the secondary, Jimmie Ward broke up 4 passes, though he had a so-so performance. "
