Brady, however, was unstoppable following intermission, going 14-of-19 for 146 yards and a touchdown. He did have help from Julian Edelman, however, who broke out of a tackle to score from 69 yards out. It helped Brady that the Chargers struggled to punt, as Scifres was knocked out of the game as a result of that block. Bill Belichick brilliantly had 2 punt returners on the field, just in case Scifres' replacement hit a bad boot, which proved to be the case on several occasions.    Edelman and Gronkowski both tied for the team lead with 8 receptions for 141 and 87 yards, respectively. Both scored once. "
