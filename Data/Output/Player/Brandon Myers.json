   "comment":"Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by "
