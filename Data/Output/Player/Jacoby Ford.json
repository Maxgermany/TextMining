   "comment":"Ford out. It turned out to be a blessing. Denarius Moore, a star of the preseason, caught 5 balls for 146 yards including a jaw-dropping 50-yard score down the middle with Leodis McKelvin and Gibril Wilson on him like 2 pieces of bread. Derek Hagan was also solid, catching 5 passes for 61 yards.    Unfortunately for the Raiders, their defense was not up to the task in the second half. When Fred Jackson and C.J. Spiller weren't breaking off big runs (19 rushes for 180 yards, 2 touchdowns) wide receivers Stevie Johnson and David Nelson were picking up first downs in the passing game (18 receptions for 179 yards, 2 touchdowns). Right now there are 2 people named Chris Johnson in the NFL. That might not be the case for long.    Another footnote of sorts is the poor kickoff returns by Oakland's Nick Miller, who repeatedly took the ball out of the end zone and failed to reach the 20. Ford was sorely missed in that area, and when he is healthy, Miller might be looking at a pink slip.   "

Later, Oakland was trying to pile on, and appeared ready to, when Campbell lunged toward a first down. He was a yard short and suffered what early reports are saying could be a season-ending injury.

Bush (19-96) picked up 14 yards on the next play to put the ball in the red zone. He also wrecked Brian Dawkins, but the grisly veteran would soon return to the game. The drive would stall from there, and Sebastian Janikowski hobbled on for a 48-yard field goal to make it 3-0. Left tackle Ryan Clady had a tough game, starting with wrecking Denver's next drive with a holding penalty leading to a quick punt. Oakland punted right back though, and Tebow really made his presence known even as the crowd chanted his name followed by a word that rhymes with ducks. He faked the handoff to McGahee, a regular play on the afternoon, and ran for 32 yards. Two plays later, he hit Eric Decker over the middle for a 27-yard touchdown and 7-3 lead. After trading punts, the Raiders got their offense in motion as the second quarter started thanks to the Broncos failing to get their punt off. Britton Colquitt wound up throwing incomplete after bumbling the snap. On third down, Palmer hit Bush who did the rest, leaping for his first career touchdown reception and the 10-7 advantage. After another Denver punt, Oakland started running Bush, 3 times in a row in fact, before a pass to Moore put them in plus territory. Then, they tested Champ Bailey and found out he is still an elite player. Bailey intercepted Palmer. In the first half, Oakland's defense was holding up and forced a quick punt. The offense showed some explosion on their next possession. Ford (5-105, TD) picked up 31 yards down the sideline at the 2-minute warning. Three plays later, Reece proved why he is the matchup nightmare, making a tough catch down the middle on a well thrown ball by Palmer for a 40-yard touchdown to give Oakland a 17-7 lead. Head coach John Fox made a regrettable call during the final drive of the half, taking points off the board when "
