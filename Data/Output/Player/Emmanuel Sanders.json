Give Jacksonville credit for coming back, but this contest was much more lopsided than the final score indicates.    Gabbert finished 12-of-26 for 109 yards and an 18-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Emmanuel Sanders couldn't hold on to the ball on what would've been a tough reception.    Roethlisberger had a solid game, going 28-of-44 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. Despite all of the injuries to the offensive line, he wasn't sacked on a single occasion. He had some vintage Big Ben plays where he navigated the pocket amid pressure and still managed to connect with 1 of his targets downfield. However, he was ultimately betrayed by Sanders (6-43, TD), who had 3 drops, including 2 in the end zone.    Bell also scored once and nearly had a second touchdown on the play in which he suffered a concussion. He actually crossed the goal line, but replay ruled that he was short because his helmet popped off beforehand. Bell finished with 73 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 63 receiving yards. Again, the concussion looked pretty bad, but he'll have 10 days to get cleared for Week 14.    "

The Steelers blocked a Green Bay field goal, but the Packers were able to maintain possession with a free first down because of a batted ball. However, the Steelers should have been down by contact before then, so Tomlin looked like he was losing his mind while yelling at the refs. Tomlin later had Bell score a touchdown when he should have taken a few knees and kicked a chip-shot field goal. The Packers let Bell score so they could have 1 final possession, so Tomlin essentially did what Green Bay was planning all along. It ultimately didn't matter, but the Steelers were so close to seeing their season come to an end.   "

   "comment":"Emmanuel Sanders and Julius Thomas overwhelmed the Oakland secondary, while Derek Carr and the Raiders' offense had no chance.    On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to "

Even if you don't like Manning, this had to be painful to watch. He's a shell of his former self, and he can't use a bogus leg injury for an excuse this time. If you own him for some reason - he was on my bust list all summer - I would unload him immediately.    Manning's futility was the primary story of this game. Another very significant event was "

   "comment":"Emmanuel Sanders. The third, which occurred in overtime, was a soft pass that was way underthrown. Manning, for whatever reason, doesn't realize that he's done. He keeps trying to force the issue despite having nothing left in his arm. Perhaps he refuses to see the truth - likely, given that he's always been an ego maniac - but if the Broncos had a worse record, they'd have to consider switching to Brock Osweiler. However, because they are undefeated, their fate will be getting blown out in the playoffs against a strong opponent. Until then, Manning (26-of-48, 290 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions) will continue to struggle while his defense continues to carry him.    Despite Manning's woes, both of his receivers posted great numbers. Demaryius Thomas caught 10 passes for 111 yards, while Emmanuel Sanders had 4 receptions go for 109 yards and a touchdown. However, both players had dark clouds over their performances. Thomas had major issues hanging on to the ball, as he was guilty of several drops, including 1 on what could've been the game-winning drive in regulation. Thomas also dropped a pass in overtime, but was fortunate that the Browns were flagged for 12 men on the field. Sanders, meanwhile, appeared to injure his shoulder at the very end of the 4.h quarter. Sanders seemingly caught a deep pass, but celebrated too much while grabbing his shoulder. As a result, time expired, ruining a chance at a field goal. However, it was eventually ruled that Sanders never completed the catch.    You can say that "

Going back to the Packers, Rodgers' official stat line was 14-of-22 for just 77 yards, a career-low YPA of 3.5. He also was strip-sacked for a safety. As mentioned, he was rattled in the pocket, and this forced him into some inaccurate passes, including some overthrows.    With Rodgers' low passing total, his leading receiver, "

   "comment":"Emmanuel Sanders for a downfield touchdown, but completely missed him. Manning went just 5-of-9 for 69 yards. Not terrible, but not great. Simms gushed about Manning's ability to set up correct runs, but the Chargers have been surrendering big gains on the ground all season, and they didn't even have their top defender, Eric Weddle, on the field for this game. It's not exactly impressive that Manning was able to help his team run on the Chargers.    Speaking of the rushing attack, Ronnie Hillman both had 15 carries and touchdowns. They both posted terrific numbers, with Hillman outgaining Anderson, 117-95. Anderson lost a fumble deep in his own territory, prompting the Broncos to make the switch from Osweiler to Manning for some reason. I don't know what Anderson's fumble had to do with Osweiler, but I'm sure Simms and his 1800Flowers.com disagrees.    Demaryius Thomas led the Broncos in receiving, catching 5 balls for 117 yards and a touchdown. Most of his production came with Osweiler, as the young quarterback found Thomas for a 72-yard score on the opening drive. The Chargers missed a whopping 4 tackles on the play.    More than half of Emmanuel Sanders' production came occurred with Osweiler as well. Sanders (5-99) made a big mistake early on, losing a fumble inside San Diego's 5-yard line at the end of a big gain. Sanders could've scored a touchdown later, but as mentioned, Manning overthrew him.    Meanwhile, the Chargers only have themselves to blame for this loss. They were able to force 5 turnovers, yet they turned the first 4 into just 3 points. They blew it, but then again, perhaps it was for the best as the loss helped their draft position. Unfortunately for them, Laremy Tunsil figures to be off the board, as you can see in the . So, why couldn't San Diego take advantage of all the Denver give-aways? "

Thomas was very strong during the day, making many nice catches, including a couple where he rose up to perfectly catch the ball at its high point. Sanders was every bit as good as Thomas, though he saw 13 targets and appears to be a favorite of the Broncos' quarterbacks. Both receivers were able to score a touchdown and should continue to be great plays in fantasy.    Denver's running game was surprisingly ineffective against the Buccaneers. "

That changed in the second half as Siemian was able to heat up, and both receivers eclipsed the century mark. Thomas caught 10 balls for 126 yards. Sanders, meanwhile, reeled in 11 catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. He dropped a pass in the 4.h quarter.    The Broncos haven't been able to run the ball since C.J.

   "comment":"Emmanuel Sanders (2-16). Thomas was quiet for most of the contest, but he exploded in the 4.h quarter and was a key factor on the Broncos' final touchdown drive. As long as the Broncos lack a quality starting quarterback, Thomas is no more than a WR2 at best. Meanwhile, Sanders saw 8 targets, but he wasn't able to do much with them, totaling only the 16 yards. He should bounce back in the near future. Elsewhere, "
