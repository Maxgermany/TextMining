Despite all of the injuries to the offensive line, he wasn't sacked on a single occasion. He had some vintage Big Ben plays where he navigated the pocket amid pressure and still managed to connect with 1 of his targets downfield. However, he was ultimately betrayed by Sanders (6-43, TD), who had 3 drops, including 2 in the end zone.    Bell also scored once and nearly had a second touchdown on the play in which he suffered a concussion. He actually crossed the goal line, but replay ruled that he was short because his helmet popped off beforehand. Bell finished with 73 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 63 receiving yards. Again, the concussion looked pretty bad, but he'll have 10 days to get cleared for Week 14.    "

The Steelers blocked a Green Bay field goal, but the Packers were able to maintain possession with a free first down because of a batted ball. However, the Steelers should have been down by contact before then, so Tomlin looked like he was losing his mind while yelling at the refs. Tomlin later had Bell score a touchdown when he should have taken a few knees and kicked a chip-shot field goal. The Packers let Bell score so they could have 1 final possession, so Tomlin essentially did what Green Bay was planning all along. It ultimately didn't matter, but the Steelers were so close to seeing their season come to an end.   "

No. 509 was a bit of a journey. Manning threw behind Julius Thomas in the end zone and then tripped over Orlando Franklin's leg and took a sack. However, on third down, Manning found Demaryius Thomas, who tapped both feet in before falling out of bounds. Thomas, for good measure, also reeled in 510, which was a 40-yard rainbow. Manning's final stat line looked like this: 22-of-26, 318 yards and the 4 touchdowns. He was on fire, and 1 of his 4 incompletions was dropped. It's impressive that he did this against a strong defense (albeit 1 that was missing Patrick Willis), and if he continues to play this way, no 1 will be able to beat him.    Demaryius Thomas, who found the end zone twice, logged 8 yards for 171 yards.

   "comment":"Sanders, who had a brilliant game, committed his sole blunder when he fumbled in his own territory. The Chargers appeared to have recovered the ball, but it bounced around and fell into Wes Welker's arms. That was a chance for San Diego to get back into the game, down 14 at that point, but the Broncos maintained possession, bled the clock and pulled through with the spread-covering victory.    The Broncos were very lucky in this game, but they didn't need all of that great fortune to prevail. They were the better team on the field, outgaining San Diego by 119 net yards and averaging 1.2 more yards per play. The Chargers were competitive for a while, but Denver ultimately ran away with this victory in the second half. San Diego simply couldn't do anything about Peyton Manning. The NFL's career touchdown record-holder was an unstoppable force, going 25-of-35 for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had that 1 interception that should've stood, but was otherwise flawless. He simply took advantage of a secondary that was missing its top 2 cornerbacks. Brandon Flowers was out with a concussion, while Jason Verrett was in the lineup to begin the contest, but didn't last the entire 60 minutes, as he aggravated his shoulder injury.    All 3 of Manning's scores went to Sanders, who reeled in all 9 of his targets for 120 yards. "

   "comment":"Sanders and Julius Thomas overwhelmed the Oakland secondary, while Derek Carr and the Raiders' offense had no chance.    On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to "

   "comment":"Sanders. It was a perfect pass - a surprising 1. at that, considering how putrid he was all night. It was bittersweet for Manning fans; the score helped win the game, but it was 1 of Manning's final great passes.    Of course, this all wouldn't have happened if the Chiefs were so careless with the football all afternoon. Jamaal Charles opened the game with a lost fumble inside the Denver 5-yard line. There was also a fumble on a kickoff return. Alex Smith threw 2 picks, 1 of which was his fault. The first interception was a telegraphed pass, but the other was tipped into the air. The second was a killer because it occurred in the red zone, nullifying a scoring opportunity. The real killer, however, was Charles' late-game fumble. Following Manning's third touchdown, the Chiefs were content just to run the clock out and go to overtime. However, Charles fumbled, and Bradley Roby scooped up the ball and scored. And just like that, Denver prevailed in a game it definitely did not deserve to win. It's a shame for Charles, as the 2 cough-ups ruined what was otherwise a brilliant evening; he gained 125 yards and a score on 21 carries.    Why didn't the Broncos deserve to win? Outside of Manning's ineptitude, the team made so many horrible mistakes. They had 3 penalties on Kansas City's first drive alone. They converted a 4.h-and-1 on a later possession, but there was a strange timeout that negated it. Late hits, missed tackles and unsportsmanlike penalties were prevalent throughout the evening. The Broncos were the sloppier team, and yet Kansas City had 4 more turnovers!    While Manning's struggles were predictable, the surprising aspect of this game was how poorly Denver's running game functioned. Both C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman struggled to find rushing room. Anderson mustered just 27 yards on 12 carries, while Hillman tallied 34 yards on 9 attempts. Hillman's YPC figure looks nice, but most of his yardage came on a 16-yard burst. Anderson still remains a weekly play for now, but Denver's blocking is awfully sketchy. Maybe Kansas City's run defense is that good, but I'm beginning to have doubts.    Both of Manning's primary receivers hauled in 8 passes, with Sanders securing 2 of the touchdowns. Sanders (8-87) is worth selling high in fantasy right now, given Manning's struggles. The same can be said for Thomas (8-116).    Manning's third score went to Virgil Green. "

   "comment":"Sanders. The third, which occurred in overtime, was a soft pass that was way underthrown. Manning, for whatever reason, doesn't realize that he's done. He keeps trying to force the issue despite having nothing left in his arm. Perhaps he refuses to see the truth - likely, given that he's always been an ego maniac - but if the Broncos had a worse record, they'd have to consider switching to Brock Osweiler. However, because they are undefeated, their fate will be getting blown out in the playoffs against a strong opponent. Until then, Manning (26-of-48, 290 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions) will continue to struggle while his defense continues to carry him.    Despite Manning's woes, both of his receivers posted great numbers. Demaryius Thomas caught 10 passes for 111 yards, while Emmanuel Sanders had 4 receptions go for 109 yards and a touchdown. However, both players had dark clouds over their performances. Thomas had major issues hanging on to the ball, as he was guilty of several drops, including 1 on what could've been the game-winning drive in regulation. Thomas also dropped a pass in overtime, but was fortunate that the Browns were flagged for 12 men on the field. Sanders, meanwhile, appeared to injure his shoulder at the very end of the 4.h quarter. Sanders seemingly caught a deep pass, but celebrated too much while grabbing his shoulder. As a result, time expired, ruining a chance at a field goal. However, it was eventually ruled that Sanders never completed the catch.    You can say that "

   "comment":"Sanders for a downfield touchdown, but completely missed him. Manning went just 5-of-9 for 69 yards. Not terrible, but not great. Simms gushed about Manning's ability to set up correct runs, but the Chargers have been surrendering big gains on the ground all season, and they didn't even have their top defender, Eric Weddle, on the field for this game. It's not exactly impressive that Manning was able to help his team run on the Chargers.    Speaking of the rushing attack, Ronnie Hillman both had 15 carries and touchdowns. They both posted terrific numbers, with Hillman outgaining Anderson, 117-95. Anderson lost a fumble deep in his own territory, prompting the Broncos to make the switch from Osweiler to Manning for some reason. I don't know what Anderson's fumble had to do with Osweiler, but I'm sure Simms and his 1800Flowers.com disagrees.    Demaryius Thomas led the Broncos in receiving, catching 5 balls for 117 yards and a touchdown. Most of his production came with Osweiler, as the young quarterback found Thomas for a 72-yard score on the opening drive. The Chargers missed a whopping 4 tackles on the play.    More than half of Emmanuel Sanders' production came occurred with Osweiler as well. Sanders (5-99) made a big mistake early on, losing a fumble inside San Diego's 5-yard line at the end of a big gain. Sanders could've scored a touchdown later, but as mentioned, Manning overthrew him.    Meanwhile, the Chargers only have themselves to blame for this loss. They were able to force 5 turnovers, yet they turned the first 4 into just 3 points. They blew it, but then again, perhaps it was for the best as the loss helped their draft position. Unfortunately for them, Laremy Tunsil figures to be off the board, as you can see in the 2016 NFL Mock Draft. So, why couldn't San Diego take advantage of all the Denver give-aways? "

   "comment":"Sanders helped by grazing it. An interception there in Denver territory would've all but sealed the victory for Pittsburgh, but the Broncos were given second life. They took advantage of it and drove down the field. They scored a touchdown, converted the 2.point conversion, and then stopped the Steelers, who called a couple of dumb plays that went no where. A front-door covering field goal and a back-door pushing kick later, and the Broncos walked away with a 7.point victory. I say the Broncos were fortunate to prevail because Manning and his receivers struggled immensely. Manning had a couple of nice passes, but most of his attempts were wobblers that either sailed out of bounds or bounced in front of his targets. Meanwhile, his supporting cast was guilty of a whopping 5 drops. Also, Manning's longest pass, a 34-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders, should've never happened. Manning, who was about to be sacked, gave himself up to avoid a hit, like he usually does. However, he realized he wasn't touched, so he got up and fired a shot to an open Sanders despite the fact that some Steelers stopped playing. An irate Mike Tomlin tried to challenge the call, but it was ruled unreviewable for some reason. Manning's final numbers weren't terrible, but they resembled his other playoff choke-job performances. He went 21-of-37 for 222 yards and no touchdowns. Again, Manning was extremely lucky to get away with a victory and no turnovers, and a big chunk of his yardage was a complete fluke. If the Steelers hadn't fumbled deep in Denver territory, he would've been 1.and-done once again.    Of the 5 drops, "

   "comment":"Sanders and Demaryius Thomas. I don't want to get carried away with Siemian yet. It's still a small sample size, and teams could figure him out. However, he's playing better than the decrepit Manning ever had this past season. The Bengals actually did a good job of pressuring Siemian, but his pocket presence was impressive, as he slid around in the backfield very well.    Sanders complained to the media during the week that he wasn't being used properly. He won't be upset about that after this performance. Sanders caught 2 of Siemian's touchdowns, racking up 9 grabs for 117 yards in the process. Thomas also had a big game, snatching 6 balls for 100 yards and a score. Tight end "

   "comment":"Sanders open for a deep touchdown in the first quarter, but overshot him. There were other passes he should've converted, including a gain of 15 or so to Demaryius Thomas that would've moved the chains on a third down, but Siemian just missed him. He also nearly threw an interception, but the ball was dropped.    Mistakes killed the Broncos all evening. For instance, C.J. Anderson rushed for only 37 yards and was outgained by Devontae Booker (5-46), but he had runs of 15 and 12 negated by holds by Max Garcia (who was responsible for the safety) and Matt Paradis. Plus, as mentioned, Anderson's impressive touchdown reception was nullified by another hold. The Broncos racked up 103 penalty yards, indicating that they simply weren't prepared to play, as a result of Kubiak's absence.    Both of Denver's receivers disappointed their fantasy owners. Thomas saw 10 targets, but caught 5 balls for only 35 yards. He also lost the aforementioned fumble. Sanders (4-40) was only slightly better. Sanders sustained some sort of injury in the second half, but was able to return to action. Both wideouts would've done much better if Siemian didn't struggle with accuracy issues.    Phil Simms, as usual, was horrible. Here were some of his quotes from tonight: To get 66 percent of any people to agree on anything is next to impossible. Simms said this about the Chargers' stadium deal. What's funny about this is that 3 days ago, the Las Vegas stadium passed at a 76.2-percent rate. Nice 1. Phil. In golf terms, Jim, it's just like a golf swing keeping that arm straight with his swing. I have no idea what this means. I guess that was for the 10 golf fanatics watching Thursday Night Football. Simms also poked fun at fantasy football at some point in the first half. He did the same thing last week, according to Matthew Berry, who went savage on Simms on Twitter. Simms, proving that he's completely out of touch, needs to understand that most people were watching this game because they're fantasy football owners checking out what their players were up to. The completely arrogant Simms just offended most of his viewer base instead. Why the hell is CBS still employing this guy!? Besides, it's not like Simms has many fans. Check out these tweets that I found:   "

   "comment":"Sanders (5-54) to lead the way. Thomas was particularly good on the day, and he made a nice 1.handed catch on an early drive. Thomas was able to catch a critical touchdown as well, and he used his size to jump over the New Orleans defensive back who was covering him. Thomas should be a high-end WR2 in most weeks, though he could have issues if Siemian struggles. Meanwhile, Sanders had some nice catches, but he played second fiddle to Thomas today. Sanders is still a strong option in fantasy, but occasionally, he will underproduce depending on the matchup.    The running game for the Broncos was not particularly strong. "

Part of the problem happened to be poor mechanics; Lynch's footwork was awful on a pass that was way high toward Jordan Norwood on another third down. Lynch was hurt by a substantial drop by Virgil Green, but his positive throws were few and far between. Despite this, Gary Kubiak showed an unbelievable amount of trust in Lynch, calling for passes on numerous plays while his team was attempting to run out the clock, including on a second-and-12 with 4:30 remaining, up only 7. Lynch actually scrambled twice in these instances, and he almost picked up the first down on a third-and-4.    With Lynch struggling, only 2 Bronco receivers accumulated more than 10 yards, which is just sad. Thomas led the way with 6 grabs for 61 yards, including a diving catch to put the team into field-goal range at the end of the first half.

Siemian's accuracy was so poor that he actually hurled an interception when he was trying to throw the ball out of bounds. He was picked on another occasion because he made a poor decision to force a throw in a close game.    Demaryius Thomas led the Broncos in receiving, as he registered 6 catches for 98 yards. Sanders nearly held that distinction, however, but a deep reception of his was wiped out by replay review. Sanders caught the ball, but apparently didn't complete the process of the catch, whatever that means. It appeared as though Sanders had the reception, but the NFL's rules are way too cryptic.    "
