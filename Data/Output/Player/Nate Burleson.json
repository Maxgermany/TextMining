   "comment":"Burleson for a 39-yard score to tie the game. I immediately felt that the Lions scored too quickly, leaving a minute for an Oakland defense known for scoring late in halves this season. Palmer threw on 6 consecutive plays, completing 4 throws for 45 yards. Bush picked up 6 more yards on a run right up the middle, and Janikowski's 46-yard field goal put the Raiders up 17-14 at halftime. The third quarter was a mess for both offenses. Oakland struggled to convert third downs (1-of-9) the entire game, and even though Detroit was effective (8-of-17), they did most of their damage on big scoring plays. Kevin Smith (15 rushes for 43 yards) took the rock on 4 of the next 5 plays during 1 drive. He was unable to find room the entire game and was stuffed on 3rd- and 4th-and-1 for a turnover on downs. The Raiders were ready to seize on the change of field position as a 13-yard gain to Kevin Boss putting them in plus territory. Heyward-Bey caught a pass over the middle and looked like he would shake tackles and possibly score until Justin Durant forced a fumble that Alphonso Smith recovered. Once again a scoring opportunity went by the boards. After forcing a punt, the Oakland offense chipped away with a feisty drive featuring a handful of short Bush runs and 2 modest pass plays to get Janikowski close enough for a 51-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter for a 20-14 lead. Backed up and trailing, Detroit was in passing mode. Stafford threw incomplete twice and then lost a fumble when Kelly got to him. Aaron Curry picked it up and ran in for what looked like the proverbial dagger. Then, an inexplicable coaching decision changed the course of the game. Hue Jackson sent the kicking team on with a 26-14 lead and 8:04 left in the game. Apparently he was worried about the Lions scoring a touchdown and 2 field goals in that span to beat him. Instead of trying the 2-point conversion to take a 2-touchdown advantage, the lead was 27-14. On the subsequent possession, the only run was a Stafford scramble. He was only 4-for-9 on the drive, but put the ball in the end zone to Titus Young, trimming the Raiders lead to 27-21. Oakland tried to run it out with Bush, who had gains of 12, 3, 15, 5 and 2 yards to chew up 2:19 off the clock and eat up precious timeouts. Faced with a 3rd-and-3, the call was a play-action pass down the sideline for Chaz Schilens. It fell incomplete, leaving plenty of time for a final Detroit drive. This time Stafford, who did nothing for the third and most of the fourth quarter, was white hot. He connected with Brandon Pettigrew and Burleson then twice to Johnson on 4 consecutive plays to pick up 85 yards in a flash. The 48-yard bomb to Megatron was stunning because he was able to beat a secondary protecting a lead deep. After a holding penalty on left tackle "

   "comment":"Burleson to the San Diego 3-yard line. A play later, Stafford tossed a short touchdown pass to Kevin Smith. Just before halftime, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 14-yard score. The first half ended with the Detroit up 24-0. It was utter domination on both sides of the ball by the Lions. The Chargers' offense couldn't get into any rhythm. The line was allowing some pressure while the receivers weren't getting open for Philip Rivers. San Diego's pass rush stank, and Stafford had good time to throw all afternoon. The Chargers' secondary was pitiful with receivers running wide open constantly. Apparently, Norv Turner turned over a table or 2 in the locker room, because the Chargers played with better execution and a sense of urgency in the third quarter. Their offense was finally able to move down the field. A beautiful 1-handed catch by Antonio Gates was called back by a penalty, but Rivers kept advancing the ball. He finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. San Diego then caught the Lions' special teams napping with an onside kick that was recovered by Eric Weddle. Rivers hit Floyd for a gain of 30 to the Detroit 3-yard line after he beat Chris Houston running downfield. Houston bounced back to break up a pass in the end zone on third-and-goal so the Chargers had to settle for a field goal. The Lions answered by moving the ball down the field and Smith running into the end zone from 6 yards out. Detroit was up 31-10 entering the fourth quarter. San Diego followed up with another promising drive, moving the ball down the field. However, Houston had another good pass breakup in the end zone. The Lions' stand forced a fourth-and-goal from the 3 that fell incomplete. Houston would kill another drive by intercepting a jump ball at the goal line. He returned it 43 yards and the pick sealed the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished the afternoon 29-of-36 for 373 yards and 3 touchdowns. Pettigrew (9-80), Johnson (4-102) and Nate Burleson (6-83) all had good games. For San Diego, Rivers completed 28-of-53 passes for 299 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Floyd (6-95) led the Chargers in receiving with Gates (4-40) contributing. He became the franchise's all-time receptions leader in this loss, passing Charlie Joiner.    It was a huge win for the Lions as they clinched their first playoff appearance since 1999. Congratulations to the long-suffering Lions fans who finally get to see their team play in the postseason after a long drought.   "

Matthew Stafford went 25-of-42 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that was returned for 6 by DeAngelo Hall. The pick was the byproduct of a miscommunication between Stafford and Calvin Johnson in the first half. Stafford and Megatron were able to hook up often after that. Johnson caught 7 balls for 115 yards and a touchdown, though he missed out on another score because Stafford overthrew him. Megatron didn't even lead his team in receiving. Burleson held that distinction, hauling in 6 passes for 116 yards.    Stafford's other score went to undrafted rookie tight end "
