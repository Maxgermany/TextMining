   "comment":"Thomas, who was on the field for 1 snap, could've run some read-options, at the very least. Thomas also should've been used on a Hail Mary try at the end of the first half; instead, Lindley's noodle arm was only able to get the ball to the Carolina 25 from his own 42. It was 1 of the worst deep attempts you'll ever see on any level of football. Thomas has a better arm and should've thrown the pass. Arians simply screwed up.    Lindley would've sucked anyway, but part of the reason why he struggled was because Arians insisted on running the ball so frequently on first down. The Cardinals weren't getting anything on the ground - "
