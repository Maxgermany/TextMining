Manning, who only trails Brett Favre by 5 career scores now, generated a career-high 479 yards. He also added 4 touchdowns to his total, bringing him up to 503. Manning wasn't the only 1 who passed significant numbers. Demaryius Thomas set a Broncos' single-game record for receiving yardage with 226, as he accumulated those on his 8 catches. He also scored twice. Meanwhile, "

It was 1 of the worst deep attempts you'll ever see on any level of football. Thomas has a better arm and should've thrown the pass. Arians simply screwed up.    Lindley would've sucked anyway, but part of the reason why he struggled was because Arians insisted on running the ball so frequently on first down.
