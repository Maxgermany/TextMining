   "comment":"Isaac Seumalo, who is a natural guard. Seumalo got banged up in the game, as he was slow to get up on Wentz's interception.    Ertz was great on the final drive, and he played well overall, catching 6 passes for 80 yards. In fact, Ertz was the only Eagle with more than 30 receiving yards. "
