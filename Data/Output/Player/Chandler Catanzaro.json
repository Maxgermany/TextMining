I need to mention the officials because they were terrible. Jerome Boger and his staff were absolutely clueless. The officials, on 1 occasion, didn't know whom a neutral-zone infraction penalty was on, so they huddled for what seemed like 5 minutes. They also took forever to review a Miami fumble. It was evident that Ajayi recovered the fumble, and the FOX announcers agreed, but Boger ruled Arizona possession. Boger's decision-making took years, and at 1 point, it seemed like this game was going to end at 5 p.m.   "
