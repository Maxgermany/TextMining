It shouldn't shock you to learn that Fitzgerald led the Cardinals in targets. He saw 13 of them, catching 8 balls for 90 yards. However, the player next on the target list was surprising. It wasn't Michael Floyd, who was sidelined with an injury. It wasn't John Brown either, though Brown did catch a touchdown on his 3 receptions for 43 yards. None of the running backs held that distinction. Speedy rookie J.J. Nelson was that player, as he snatched 4 of his 6 targets for a whopping 142 yards and a touchdown. Nelson's 64-yard score tied the game in the third quarter. He caught a deep pass and made an amazing juke on the defender, then used his elite speed to fly into the end zone.    The Cardinals didn't run the ball very well. The Bengals did a great job of bottling up Chris Johnson, limiting him to 63 yards on 18 carries. David Johnson vultured a receiving touchdown.    The 1 dark cloud over this victory was that cornerback Patrick Peterson had to sit out the final couple of drives because he couldn't put any weight on his ankle. It's unknown how serious this injury is, but the Cardinals couldn't stop Cincinnati when he wasn't on the field.    As for the Bengals, they made the mistakes in the second half when the Cardinals stopped shooting themselves in the foot. They dropped several passes, while Andy Dalton lost a fumble that led to an Arizona field goal. The most egregious blunder occurred at the end of the game when the Bengals were flagged for simulating the snap. Suddenly, Catanzaro's 44-yard field goal attempt turned into an easy 32-yarder.    Dalton finished 22-of-39 for 315 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble. Unlike Palmer, he was less effective following intermission, going 14-of-28 for 188 yards and the fumble in the second half. Drops were part of the reason for his regression, but Dalton also sailed some passes out of bounds, much like he did in Monday night's loss to the Texans. Dalton's 2 touchdowns went to "
