   "comment":"Catanzaro for the game-winning field goal.    It shouldn't shock you to learn that Fitzgerald led the Cardinals in targets. He saw 13 of them, catching 8 balls for 90 yards. However, the player next on the target list was surprising. It wasn't Michael Floyd, who was sidelined with an injury. It wasn't John Brown either, though Brown did catch a touchdown on his 3 receptions for 43 yards. None of the running backs held that distinction. Speedy rookie J.J. Nelson was that player, as he snatched 4 of his 6 targets for a whopping 142 yards and a touchdown. Nelson's 64-yard score tied the game in the third quarter. He caught a deep pass and made an amazing juke on the defender, then used his elite speed to fly into the end zone.    The Cardinals didn't run the ball very well. The Bengals did a great job of bottling up Chris Johnson, limiting him to 63 yards on 18 carries. David Johnson vultured a receiving touchdown.    The 1 dark cloud over this victory was that cornerback Patrick Peterson had to sit out the final couple of drives because he couldn't put any weight on his ankle. It's unknown how serious this injury is, but the Cardinals couldn't stop Cincinnati when he wasn't on the field.    As for the Bengals, they made the mistakes in the second half when the Cardinals stopped shooting themselves in the foot. They dropped several passes, while Andy Dalton lost a fumble that led to an Arizona field goal. The most egregious blunder occurred at the end of the game when the Bengals were flagged for simulating the snap. Suddenly, Catanzaro's 44-yard field goal attempt turned into an easy 32-yarder.    Dalton finished 22-of-39 for 315 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble. Unlike Palmer, he was less effective following intermission, going 14-of-28 for 188 yards and the fumble in the second half. Drops were part of the reason for his regression, but Dalton also sailed some passes out of bounds, much like he did in Monday night's loss to the Texans. Dalton's 2 touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Catanzaro hit the left upright on a 24-yard try, though he was bothered by pressure from Richard Sherman and Bobby Wagner. On the ensuing possession. Steven Hauschka whiffed on a 28-yard attempt, though I bet he wishes he hit the post because his kick wasn't even close. The game ended in a senseless tie, something that the NFL should've abolished long ago. Ultimately, this tie hurts the Cardinals more; they were at home, and they needed to rebound off their 3-3 start, while the Seahawks were 4-1 and had a greater margin for error.    Going into this game, I spent some time writing about how I was confused about why the top entrants in the Supercontest and the sharps all were wagering on the Cardinals. During this contest, I spent the majority of the evening wondering how they possibly knew that Russell Wilson wasn't nearly 100 percent in terms of his passing ability. Wilson, of course, has been dealing with some knee problems, he had been able to throw the ball well in his past 3 games. That was not the case in this contest, as he struggled throughout most of the evening. This almost went down as 1 of Wilson's worst games ever. Sure, the offensive line didn't do him any favors; they surrendered constant pass rushes to Chandler Jones and Markus Golden. The latter proved to be a huge problem for the Seahawks. The Seattle blockers also were constantly flagged for holding penalties. By the time the second half commenced, I was shocked when there was an offensive play in which 1 of the linemen wasn't guilty of a hold. However, Wilson was way off the mark on most of his passes, even on the rare occasions in which he had time to throw. He definitely did not look right, and I was wondering if he's dealing with some new, undisclosed injury. I noted that Wilson was horrible for most of the evening. Things somehow changed in overtime. Wilson made a great touch pass to Jermaine Kearse for 31 yards, and then he hit Doug Baldwin for a 27-yard toss in which Baldwin got away from Tyrann Mathieu. This set up Hauschka's 28-yard try, but he ruined Wilson's sole positive drive with a miss. Wilson finished 24-of-37 for 225 yards. Those aren't horrible numbers, but keep in mind that he had a big chunk of his yardage in overtime. Wilson definitely did get better as the evening progressed, as he was 5-of-14 for 34 yards in the opening half. Maybe he doesn't have a new, undisclosed injury, but the offensive line is definitely a big problem. I was thinking Seattle's coaching staff would be able to remedy this issue during the bye as it has been able to in previous years, but apparently, that was not the case.    Wilson's targets didn't have quality numbers as a result of his struggles. Baldwin caught 6 balls for 69 yards, with 27 of those yards coming in overtime. His only blemish was a drop with 4 minutes remaining in regulation. Jimmy Graham (5-53) also dropped a pass. Tyler Lockett, meanwhile, was a disappointment with just 2 receptions for 13 yards.    Christine Michael was also affected by Seattle's poor offensive line. Michael had a nice run in overtime, but he was limited to 52 yards overall on 16 carries.    The main advantage Arizona had in this contest, aside from its ability to refrain from committing stupid penalties throughout the evening, was the rushing attack. The Seahawks were able to clog rushing lanes pretty well, and yet, David Johnson still picked up decent gains. Most of his attempts ended with Johnson twisting or pushing forward to pick up extra yardage, and all of those high-effort plays added up, as they put Carson Palmer in some favorable down-and-distance situations. Johnson gained 113 yards on 33 carries to go along with 8 catches for 58 receiving yards. He also had a gain of about 30 negated by a hold. Johnson appeared to win the game in overtime, but he was tackled twice short of the goal line, prompting Arizona to try a 24-yard kick with Catanzaro, and the rest was history.    Palmer finished 29-of-49 for 342 yards. I've been trashing Palmer all year because he hasn't looked the same, but he was better in this contest. He still missed on some throws he ordinarily would've made, but he was battling a tremendous secondary, albeit 1 without Kam Chancellor. Palmer did have an interception negated by a Sherman hold, and he nearly threw a pick-six that was dropped by "

   "comment":"Catanzaro had yet another rough outing. He missed an extra point and a 41-yarder early on, and then had an extra try blocked and returned for 2.    I need to mention the officials because they were terrible. Jerome Boger and his staff were absolutely clueless. The officials, on 1 occasion, didn't know whom a neutral-zone infraction penalty was on, so they huddled for what seemed like 5 minutes. They also took forever to review a Miami fumble. It was evident that Ajayi recovered the fumble, and the FOX announcers agreed, but Boger ruled Arizona possession. Boger's decision-making took years, and at 1 point, it seemed like this game was going to end at 5 p.m.   "

   "comment":"Catanzaro tried to kick the game winner. His 43-yarder was good, and that ended the contest. Though the win will hurt their draft positioning, the Cardinals have to be happy with their performance. They played a complete game against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL, and Carson Palmer put together a solid showing.    Palmer compiled 1 of the best games of his entire season. He went 16-of-26 during the contest for 284 yards and a touchdown. Palmer was very accurate and was able to succeed despite seeing a lot of pressure. For the first time all year, he looked entirely comfortable in the pocket, and he was able to show his arm strength as well. Perhaps the best trait about Palmer is that he knows when to target certain players. He did not try to force anything today, and that was apparent by the fact that he did not log any turnovers. Palmer should build on this skill for next season, and perhaps he will be able to do that and get the Cardinals back to the postseason.    In the receiving corps, it was clear that the Cardinals were missing Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the 4.h quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback "
