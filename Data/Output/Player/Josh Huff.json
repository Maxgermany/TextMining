   "comment":"Huff and behind the up men. No 1 knew what was going on, and Dallas recovered the loose ball to set themselves up in the red zone right away. The team found the end zone, which was the beginning of the early onslaught.    Give Philadelphia credit for coming back. Part of the Eagles' revival came when Mark Sanchez found Jeremy Maclin for a 72-yard gain in which Brandon Carr made a poor decision of biting for a potential interception. Maclin was tackled at the 1-yard line, setting up Chris Polk for the score. Following the ensuing, aforementioned Romo fumble, the Eagles took the lead. Sanchez had a meltdown after that. He was picked off twice late. One was a wide throw that bounced off Zach Ertz, which subsequently led to a touchdown. Another was underthrown, sealing the victory for Dallas. A Brent Celek lost fumble in between didn't help. Sanchez finished 17-of-28 for 252 yards and the 2 picks. He had some nice moments, but made too many mistakes. In addition to the interceptions, he overthrew LeSean McCoy on a third-and-long and once again passed too high toward Huff. He also took some bad sacks.    There's not much to note from Philadelphia's receiving corps. Maclin led the way with 98 yards off 4 receptions, but 72 of those yards came on the aforementioned big play. Ertz (3-32) disappointed yet again, while "
