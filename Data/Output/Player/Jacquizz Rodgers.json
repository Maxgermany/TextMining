   "comment":"Rodgers. The Buccaneers pulled out a gadget play with Mike Williams (3-28) throwing a 28-yard pass to Vincent Jackson (5-96) to set up a Tampa Bay field goal. The Bucs had some blown opportunities of their own. Freeman missed a wide open Jackson and Williams in the end zone in the third quarter. Tampa Bay took a 13-10 lead, but it lasted only a few seconds as Ryan dropped in a beautiful 80-yard touchdown pass to Jones (6-147). The Bucs took the lead on the first play of the 4.h quarter with Martin plunging into the end zone. Tampa Bay's defense came up with a big play as E.J. Biggers had a sack-fumble on Ryan that was recovered by the Bucs. The play was completely Ryan's fault as he didn't diagnosis the free blitzer and held onto the ball too long. That led to another Barth field goal and a 23-17 Tampa Bay lead. Atlanta won the game on a short touchdown run by the decrepit Michael Turner (13-17).    Jacquizz Rodgers came up huge for the Falcons. He had 2 splash plays to help set up the game-winning touchdown run in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers got the drive started with a 42-yard kick return and then added a 32-yard reception to move the ball deep into the Buccaneers' territory. Atlanta should've given the majority of Turner's carries to Rodgers (10-49 on the ground, 2-30 in the air), since he was giving Tampa Bay's defense problems. Ryan completed 26-of-32 passes for 353 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Freeman was 19-of-30 for 256 yards but left points on the field. "

He didn't get the yardage we grew accustomed to over the last 2 contests, but finally got into the end zone. The bad news is that he hurt his foot and couldn't finish the game.    Oakland's penalty woes became comical near the end of regulation as Tampa Bay drove while down 17-16. On 2 plays during the drive, the Raiders lined up with 12 men on the field. It is, of course, an inexcusable penalty, but they happen and you move on, but for it to happen twice on the Buccaneers' final drive of the game, which could have been the game winner, it's beyond stupid. Then to top off the comedy of errors, after Tampa Bay had scored, the Bucs went for 2 to make it a 7.point game, and got it on a pass to "
