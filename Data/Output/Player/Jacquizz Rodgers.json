He didn't get the yardage we grew accustomed to over the last 2 contests, but finally got into the end zone. The bad news is that he hurt his foot and couldn't finish the game.    Oakland's penalty woes became comical near the end of regulation as Tampa Bay drove while down 17-16. On 2 plays during the drive, the Raiders lined up with 12 men on the field. It is, of course, an inexcusable penalty, but they happen and you move on, but for it to happen twice on the Buccaneers' final drive of the game, which could have been the game winner, it's beyond stupid. Then to top off the comedy of errors, after Tampa Bay had scored, the Bucs went for 2 to make it a 7.point game, and got it on a pass to "
