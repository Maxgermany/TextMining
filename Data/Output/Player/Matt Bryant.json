Bryant missed it to leave New Orleans up 10-6 at the half. The Saints felt a similar sting when their first drive of the second half ended in a failed field goal. Robert Meachem turned in a 36-yard reception to get them down the field, but Pierre Thomas was locked up in the backfield and Darren Sproles got nothing on a screen to stop the march. This rivalry has been marked by tight games, and this was no exception. The Falcons started working the ball to Douglas who would have more success later in the half, but nevertheless kept the chains moving. They didn't have to worry about blowing it in the red zone because a dump pass to Jason Snelling turned into a 21-yard touchdown when he refused to be tackled, putting Atlanta ahead 13-10. New Orleans immediately answered, and they were, as usual, very aggressive on offense. Drew Brees found Marques Colston for gains of 15 and 19 then capped the drive with a deep ball to Meachem for a touchdown. The final play of the third quarter turned out to be crucial. Matt Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control. Up against it, Matt Ryan (29-of-52 351 yards 2 TD 1 INT) came out firing from the shotgun, connecting with Gonzalez (6 receptions for 71 yards) to start the drive picking up 18 yards and to finish it with a 20-yard score. New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6.point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line. Forced to third down, "
