   "comment":"Williams for a 26-yard reception, and on a fourth-and-goal, Osweiler ran the ball into the end zone to cut the lead to 24-17 with just over 3 minutes remaining. Derrick Henry ran the clock down, and Osweiler was unable to engineer a touchdown drive in the final minute.    Savage was 5-for-8 for 25 yards before leaving the game. Osweiler was 21-of-40 for 253 yards with a touchdown passing and another 1 rushing.    DeAndre Hopkins made 7 receptions for 123 yards. The Texans pulled him early to protect him for their playoff game.    Cassel was 16-of-26 for 150 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Henry led Tennessee in rushing with 65 yards on 15 carries. "
