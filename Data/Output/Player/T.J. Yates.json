   "comment":"T.J. Yates? Leinart suffered a broken collarbone just prior to intermission. He finished 10-of-13 for 57 yards and a touchdown. Leinart was used in many bootlegs and tossed mostly checkdowns. The offense was just really limited with him. A penalty forced them into a 1st-and-20 at some point, and it was evident that they didn't stand a chance to convert the first down. Not that it matters though because Leinart is likely out for the year. Yates looked great on his first drive in the 2-minute drill, but was dreadful after the break. Finishing 8-of-15 for 70 yards, Yates converted only 1 first down in the second half. With Houston unable to run the ball, the team just hung on for its life. Fortunately for them, the Jaguars were so inept on offense that it didn't matter.    "

He finished 26-of-44 for 300 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception to along with 36 rushing yards on 5 scrambles (including a 17-yard gain on the final drive).

   "comment":"T.J. Yates then had an awful interception on the next drive The Panthers, meanwhile, went up 21-0 on a crazy Fumblerooski play that caught the Texans completely unawares.    Houston's defense sucked the entire afternoon, but I'm not sure if it's because this game meant nothing to them, or if it was because Phillips was missing. Cam Newton basically did what he wanted, finishing 13-of-23 for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 55 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The Texans brought him down just twice.    DeAngelo Williams (15-61, TD) and Jonathan Stewart (11-43) combined to rush for about 4 yards per carry. Prior to this contest, the Texans hadn't allowed more than 100 rushing yards to an opponent since Week 6.    Newton's scores went to Steve Smith (5-82) and Jeremy Shockey (2-35). When the latter scored, he did a little too much celebrating. As this happened, I posted on the forum, Shockey TD. Begins trash talking. Forgets that he sucks.    The Panthers were up 21-0 at the break, but given how terrible they've been at maintaining leads, this contest was far from over. T.J. Yates' ineptness made the victory possible for Carolina, however. Yates (19-of-30, 212 yards, 2 INTs) made a few good throws and was betrayed by his receivers at times, but 2 mistakes really cost him. I already mentioned the first pick. The second occurred when the score was 28-13 with 8 minutes remaining. Houston was in the red zone with a chance to draw within 1 score. Yates felt phantom pressure, scrambled right and tossed a hideous pick late across his body. Yates still has talent and has the supporting cast to win a playoff game, but this game was a reminder for Houston fans that he's just a fifth-round rookie with only a handful of starts.    Most of Yates' completions were of the short variety to his running backs. Foster paced the team with 5 catches and 58 receiving yards. Daniels (2-29) had a poor outing.    Foster was great outside of that initial fumble, rushing for 109 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries to go along with the aforementioned receiving yardage. I'd say it's a shame the Texans couldn't run more because they were in a hole early, but they screwed themselves with dumb mistakes. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"T.J. Yates nor Case Keenum could give Houston a realistic shot of advancing deep into the playoffs. Schaub doesn't exactly have the greatest postseason history himself, but he's the best quarterback on the roster. Well, watching the first half, I changed my mind. Schaub didn't even play poorly or anything - he was 11-of-14 for 153 yards prior to intermission - but he had such horrible body language that it looked like he was negatively impacting his teammates. As the Texans continued to kill themselves with mistakes, all Schaub did was pull on defenders' legs (he literally did this when he was on the ground), shake his head and appear as if he wanted to cry. I was going to argue that Yates should replace Schaub - and that's exactly what happened, but not because of a coach's decision. Schaub injured his leg in the third quarter and had to leave the game. The crowd cheered while he was on the ground, which infuriated the players afterward. Yates then ran onto the field to a standing ovation - but that was very short-lived because Yates fired an interception in the red zone, which was taken back for a touchdown. It was the fifth time in as many games that Houston had been guilty of a pick-six. Yates then proceeded to heave a second interception. While Schaub went 15-of-21 for 186 yards, Yates was 12-of-17 for 91 yards and the 2 picks. So, umm... Case Keenum?    I mentioned earlier that the Texans repeatedly shot themselves in the foot. It was terrible. Despite outgaining St. Louis by intermission, 248-115, the Texans were losing because of a lost fumble in the red zone by "
