   "comment":"Dede Westbrook, making his pro debut, hauled in 3 balls for 35 yards, but he made some mistakes. He dropped a pass in the second quarter and then fumbled on the very next play. Fortunately for Westbrook, his team retained possession because the Browns couldn't recover the ball before it trickled out of bounds.    As for the Browns, Kizer took a big step backward from last week. He had a decent performance versus the Lions, but he managed to complete only half of his passes in this affair, going 16-of-32 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He was actually picked on his very first pass attempt, and he had the aforementioned lost fumble on the strip-sack at the end.
