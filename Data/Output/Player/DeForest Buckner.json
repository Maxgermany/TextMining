The 49ers answered again with a Buckner had a clutch sack to force the Cardinals into settling for a field goal. The 49ers answered again with a Robbie Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the 4.h quarter. Palmer used Ellington and Chris Johnson as receivers before the 49ers' pass rush stepped up to keep the Cardinals to 3 points. Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining. However, Ray Ray Armstrong notched a sack and Elvis Dumervil recorded the 100th sack of his career to get the ball for the 49ers' offense. Hoyer couldn't do anything with it, forcing the 49ers to punt again. Dumervil added another sack, and that basically forced overtime. A pass interference on Patrick Peterson in overtime helped get San Francisco on the move. The 49ers advanced the ball with an 11-yard pass to Pierre Garcon (4-36), a third-down conversion with an 8.yard run by Kyle Juszcyk, and a pass to Hyde for 9 yards to get inside the 10-yard line. The drive stalled, and Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. Because it was the opening possession of overtime, Arizona got a chance to score. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for receptions of 17 and 25 yards. A holding on Jimmie Ward gave Arizona some more life, and Palmer took advantage. The Cardinals got a walk-off winer with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald as the future Hall of Famer got open to sky above the defender for a tremendous game-winning catch with only 38 seconds left in overtime.    Palmer completed 33-of-51 passes for 357 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Fitzgerald had 4 catches for 32 yards to go with the only touchdown in the game.    Chris Johnson (13-32) and Ellington (5-18) didn't do much on the ground. But Johnson had 3 catches for 31 yards while Ellington had 9 receptions for 86 yards.    Hoyer was 24-of-49 for 234 yards with an interception. Hyde ran for 68 yards on 16 carries with 5 receptions for 27 yards.    Defensively, both teams played well on that side of the ball. The 49ers took advantage of the Cardinals' weak offensive line to record 6 sacks. Buckner was superb with 4 tackles and a sack. He looks like a Pro Bowler this year. 49ers rookie "
