Despite what the final score may say, this contest was a blowout dominated by the host. Jacksonville was 9-of-16 on third downs and out-gained Kansas City, 426-301. The Jaguars also won the time-of-possession battle by 16 minutes.    Jacksonville ran easily on the Chiefs. On most plays, the offensive line completely blew up Kansas City's defensive front. It looked like professionals were trying to open up holes against Sun Belt college players. "
