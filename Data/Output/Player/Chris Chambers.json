Despite what the final score may say, this contest was a blowout dominated by the host. Jacksonville was 9-of-16 on third downs and out-gained Kansas City, 426-301. The Jaguars also won the time-of-possession battle by 16 minutes.    Jacksonville ran easily on the Chiefs. On most plays, the offensive line completely blew up Kansas City's defensive front. It looked like professionals were trying to open up holes against Sun Belt college players. Maurice Jones-Drew rushed for 97 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries, while Rashad Jennings vultured away a score on a 28-yard scamper. It's good to see that Jack Del Rio and Dirk Koetter actually remembered to run the ball this week.    The star for the Jaguars was Mike Sims-Walker, who rebounded off a poor week by catching 6 balls for 147 yards and a touchdown. David Garrard went 18-of-27 for 264 yards and that score.    The Backdoor Bandit II's numbers look solid (23-of-39, 262 yards, 2 TDs), but a lot of that was junk yardage at the end when the Chiefs were down 24-6. Backdoor Bandit II took 3 sacks as well. That doesn't sound like a lot, but remember that the Jaguars had just 5 sacks on the year coming into this contest.    As mentioned, Chambers caught both touchdowns. That was very fluky, as Chambers (3 catches, 70 yards) had only 4 targets, most of which were late in the game.    "
