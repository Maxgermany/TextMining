   "comment":"Colt McCoy and Dick LeBeau's Pittsburgh defense just didn't sound fair. I had the Steelers winning this game, 30-0. But even though Pittsburgh covered, I have to say that I was really impressed with McCoy. The rookie out of Texas went 23-of-33 for 281 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (1 of the picks was deflected). He also rushed for 22 yards on 4 scrambles. He didn't just throw short junk either; he stood in the pocket amid a ferocious pass rush (5 sacks) and completed some intermediate and deep balls.    As expected, McCoy threw a bunch of passes to "

On 1 occasion in the red zone, McCoy escaped pressure from multiple New England blitzers, scrambled out to the right and found Joshua Cribbs for a first down. Much later, McCoy ran in for a 16-yard touchdown, which looked very Steve Young-like. It's only been 3 starts, and I hate to make rush judgments, but the McCoy era in Cleveland looks really promising.   "

   "comment":"Colt McCoy took a sack for a big loss. However, Luck was able to rebound from that poor start, ultimately torching the Colts for 5 touchdowns. Luck was on fire during the final 3 quarters, though he got some help from Washington's secondary, which blew coverages and left open players downfield all afternoon. It was astonishing how many huge gains the Colts had because the Redskins' clueless defensive backfield had no idea what was going on. Luck finished 19-of-27 for 370 yards, 5 touchdowns and the early interception. Three of Luck's scores came from 79, 73 and 48 yards out, and he should've had another deep touchdown to Coby Fleener, who committed a terrible drop on what would've been an 80-yard touchdown. Fleener, however, made up for it by finding the end zone twice, catching 4 balls for 127 yards.    Two of Luck's other touchdowns went to rookie Donte Moncrief, who reeled in 3 balls for 134 yards. Both of his scores were from 48-plus, and they came right when it appeared as though the Redskins were going to have a chance to creep back into the game during the second half. Luck's fifth touchdown went to T.Y. Hilton (5-62). Reggie Wayne (4-31) struggled again.    The Indianapolis receivers weren't the only 1. scoring long touchdowns. Dan Herron found the end zone from 49 yards out. Herron split carries evenly with Trent Richardson, with Herron predictably outgaining him by a wide margin, 88-12. If the Colts didn't trade a first-round pick for Richardson, the former Brown wouldn't be getting any touches right now. Herron is superior, though he did lose a fumble near midfield in the opening half.    The dark cloud over this victory for the Colts was that stud corner Vontae Davis left the game in the second half with a concussion.    As for the Redskins, their decision to turn to Colt McCoy didn't exactly backfire, as McCoy wasn't responsible for this loss. After all, it's not his fault that the defense allowed so many big gains with blown coverages. McCoy actually performed quite well, going 31-of-47 for 392 yards and 3 touchdowns. He showed a ton of heart on 1 of his scores, somehow getting out of 2 potential sacks to find "

The football gods did Daniel Snyder a favor, as McCoy aggravated his neck injury early on, forcing Griffin into the game. Griffin performed well for the most part, but he made a couple of mistakes. He was nearly picked in the second quarter, but the big error came when he appeared to scamper into the end zone for a touchdown. The play went to review, to the confusion of the FOX announcers, and the officials ruled that he fumbled the ball before reaching the goal line, so it resulted in a touchback instead of 6 points. The Redskins were completely irate. Gruden barked at the officials, while "
