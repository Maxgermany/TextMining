   "comment":"McCoy.    Aside from succumbing to several trick plays, how did the Saints lose this contest? Well, it was more of the same at first. They couldn't take advantage of opportunities in the red zone. A touchdown to Lance Moore was called back because of a penalty early on. Afterward, it just seemed like Brees got frustrated and began forcing passes. He ended up with 4 interceptions, 2 of which were returned for touchdowns by linebacker David Bowens. Coincidentally, Brees' new baby son is named Bowen.    Marques Colston finally scored a touchdown, though it came very late in garbage time. Still, Colston finished with 10 grabs for 112 yards.    Chris Ivory was started by many after his great performance last week. However, the Browns are very good against the run, and limited Ivory to just 48 yards on 15 carries.    McCoy wasn't as good in this contest as he was at Pittsburgh. He went 9-of-16 for 74 yards, and seemed to settle for a ton of checkdowns. On a positive note, McCoy didn't turn the ball over. That's more impressive than it sounds because playing in the Superdome is a major challenge for any quarterback, especially a rookie.    Hillis rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts.    The star for the Browns defensively - aside from Bowens, of course - was linebacker "

On 1 occasion in the red zone, McCoy escaped pressure from multiple New England blitzers, scrambled out to the right and found Joshua Cribbs for a first down.

   "comment":"McCoy's pass intended for Ben Watson was dropped and picked off by Troy Polamalu. On the next play, Ben Roethlisberger put his team on the board with a 56-yard bomb to Mike Wallace.    Pittsburgh looked great, but Cleveland really helped them clinch the AFC North by playing stupid football throughout the afternoon. On defense, they constantly left Steelers receivers wide open. On 1 play, the middle of the field was abandoned, allowing Roethlisberger to move the chains on a third down. Later, 2 players committed encroachment on a third-and-long, which led to a Pittsburgh touchdown. On offense, the Browns allowed the Steelers to beat McCoy into the ground. I'm not exaggerating when I say that McCoy (20-of-41, 209 yards, 1 TD, 3 INTs) was hit on almost every play. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"McCoy on third down to force a punt. On Oakland's first offensive play, Darren McFadden (20 carries, 91 yards, TD) hit a hole on the left side and sprinted 24 yards. The longest play on the rest of the 15-play drive covered 12 yards, but 13 snaps went for positive yardage. It ended with a short McFadden touchdown run and 7-0 lead. Their drive chewed 7:48 off the game clock, which was a theme for the day. Long drives (others went 3:58, 5:40 and 7:34) took away any hope for Cleveland to get into a rhythm offensively. Peyton Hillis could be suffering from a bit of the Madden Curse. The Browns ran him 4 consecutive times to start their second drive, but he would carry the ball just once more, finishing with 6 rushes for 14 yards. There was speculation on Twitter about a hamstring injury keeping him out of the lineup, but he did return late in the game in pass protection. The rushing duties were mostly the responsibility of Montario Hardesty (11 carries for 35 yards), who was not up to the task against a defense that came in getting gashed on the ground. A gift gave Cleveland hope on Oakland's next possession. Quarterback Jason Campbell fell on his face on a scramble and fumbled, setting up the Browns at the Raiders' 46-yard line. Key passes to Joshua Cribbs and rookie Greg Little set up a 1-yard touchdown to tight end Alex Smith. Any momentum built up by tying the score was quickly extinguished when Jacoby Ford housed the kickoff return to put the Raiders ahead 14-7. Cleveland's offense showed a little life, converting on third down twice, but an 11-play drive covered just 34 yards and died with no points after consecutive incompletions. Later, Oakland was trying to pile on, and appeared ready to, when Campbell lunged toward a first down. He was a yard short and suffered what early reports are saying could be a season-ending injury. Again, Jackson showed the guts to roll the dice and trotted out backup Kyle Boller, who converted the 4.h down with a sneak. Even if it did not lead to any points, the confidence Jackson shows in his team matters to the players. The half ended with Oakland up 14-7. An exchange of punts opened the second half. Boller, who finished 8-of-14 for 100 yards, completed a 27-yard pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey, which was all they needed to reach field goal range for Sebastian Janikowski. He connected from 48 yards out to put the Raiders ahead 17-7. Cleveland quickly let the game get away when McCoy fumbled the exchange on a running play and turned the ball over. Even a failed drive on this possession resulted in a positive for Oakland because a 53-yard attempt was faked. Punter and holder "

   "comment":"McCoy (22-for-34 241 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT) was greeted by Amhad Brooks, who lost his helmet along the way. The sack caused a fumble recovered by Isaac Sopoaga, who was not done making plays on the afternoon. San Francisco's offense from the 20 was pretty simple. On the 3 productive plays, they handed it to Frank Gore who gained 14 yards and scored the touchdown. Other than not catching a single pass, he was leaned on heavily with 31 rushes for 134 yards and that score for an early 7-0 lead. From time to time, McCoy did some damage with his legs, finishing with 8 scrambles for 30 yards. He had 1 such run for a first down on the next drive, but the Browns stalled and punted. The 49ers were pinned at the 1-yard line when Gore made it outside and picked up 23 yards. Almost all of his effective runs were away from the 2 Hutts in the middle, "

Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.

   "comment":"McCoy took a sack for a big loss. However, Luck was able to rebound from that poor start, ultimately torching the Colts for 5 touchdowns. Luck was on fire during the final 3 quarters, though he got some help from Washington's secondary, which blew coverages and left open players downfield all afternoon. It was astonishing how many huge gains the Colts had because the Redskins' clueless defensive backfield had no idea what was going on. Luck finished 19-of-27 for 370 yards, 5 touchdowns and the early interception. Three of Luck's scores came from 79, 73 and 48 yards out, and he should've had another deep touchdown to Coby Fleener, who committed a terrible drop on what would've been an 80-yard touchdown. Fleener, however, made up for it by finding the end zone twice, catching 4 balls for 127 yards.    Two of Luck's other touchdowns went to rookie Donte Moncrief, who reeled in 3 balls for 134 yards. Both of his scores were from 48-plus, and they came right when it appeared as though the Redskins were going to have a chance to creep back into the game during the second half. Luck's fifth touchdown went to T.Y. Hilton (5-62). Reggie Wayne (4-31) struggled again.    The Indianapolis receivers weren't the only 1. scoring long touchdowns. Dan Herron found the end zone from 49 yards out. Herron split carries evenly with Trent Richardson, with Herron predictably outgaining him by a wide margin, 88-12. If the Colts didn't trade a first-round pick for Richardson, the former Brown wouldn't be getting any touches right now. Herron is superior, though he did lose a fumble near midfield in the opening half.    The dark cloud over this victory for the Colts was that stud corner Vontae Davis left the game in the second half with a concussion.    As for the Redskins, their decision to turn to Colt McCoy didn't exactly backfire, as McCoy wasn't responsible for this loss. After all, it's not his fault that the defense allowed so many big gains with blown coverages. McCoy actually performed quite well, going 31-of-47 for 392 yards and 3 touchdowns. He showed a ton of heart on 1 of his scores, somehow getting out of 2 potential sacks to find "

   "comment":"McCoy was terrible, and the offense as a whole averaged just 3.7 yards per play. Washington would've been limited to fewer than 200 net yards had Robert Griffin not entered the game and generated some garbage yardage at the very end. The defense, meanwhile, was just as bad. The Rams moved the chains with ease, and they would've scored way more than 24 points had they not killed themselves with mistakes. They took a pair of 10-yard penalties on 1 early drive to put themselves out of kicking range, and then the once-promising Greg Zuerlein whiffed from 28 and 38 yards. He eventually converted from 34, though at first glance, it appeared as though the field goal would miss. Washington also screwed up on special teams, making this a complete loss. The team stupidly tried a fake punt in their own territory when this game was still close. The decision was curious, given that the Redskins were attempting this against a team that practices fake punts so frequently. The Rams seemed to troll Washington with a fake extra-point try later on (not the first time they trolled; more on that later). They also scored on a Tavon Austin punt return.    Shaun Hill was nearly perfect in this game, going 16-of-22 for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns. Both of his scores went to Jared Cook, who led the team with 61 receiving yards on 4 catches.    Elsewhere in the receiving corps, Kenny Britt (2-52) and Stedman Bailey (2-47) disappointed their fantasy owners. The latter's performance was especially painful, given that he was tackled just short of the goal line in the second half.    Tre Mason didn't run as well as he did last week, though he was battling a tough ground defense. He mustered 66 yards on 20 carries. Austin did some work as a runner, gaining 46 rushing yards on 5 carries.    As for Washington's running game, McCoy pathetically led the Redskins in rushing with 11 yards on 2 scrambles. St. Louis put the clamps on "

The football gods did Daniel Snyder a favor, as McCoy aggravated his neck injury early on, forcing Griffin into the game. Griffin performed well for the most part, but he made a couple of mistakes. He was nearly picked in the second quarter, but the big error came when he appeared to scamper into the end zone for a touchdown. The play went to review, to the confusion of the FOX announcers, and the officials ruled that he fumbled the ball before reaching the goal line, so it resulted in a touchback instead of 6 points. The Redskins were completely irate. Gruden barked at the officials, while "
