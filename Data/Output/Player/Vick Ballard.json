As previously mentioned, Wayne missed out on a touchdown. He would end up disappointing his fantasy owners with just 3 catches for 14 yards. Luck's scores were thrown to TY Hilton (3-78) and "

   "comment":"Ballard also had a drop.    I don't want to completely discredit Baltimore's defense for stiffening in the red zone, but this was mostly about the Colts showing inexperience and screwing up. Despite the 9 points allowed and Ray Lewis playing his final home game in his Hall-of-Fame career, the Ravens did not look good defensively, and they're going to be in deep trouble next week against Peyton Manning, who routinely torches them. But watching Lewis do his pre-game (and post-game) dance was great. Seeing him during live action? Not as great, as he inexplicably dropped a gimme interception. He did manage to lead the team with 13 tackles, however.    With the defense reeling, Joe Flacco made enough plays to lead the team to victory. He barely completed half of his passes (12-of-23) and got away with 2 dropped Vontae Davis interceptions early on, but he threw for 282 yards and 2 touchdowns, torching any Colt corner not named Davis. Flacco converted 8 passes of 18 yards or more, though his second-longest completion, a 47-yarder to Ray Rice, was all on the running back, who took a short screen down to the 2-yard line. Vonta Leach punched the ball into the end zone 1 play later to break a 3-3 tie in the second quarter.    Rice had a forgettable game otherwise. He was outgained by Bernard Pierce on the ground, 103-70. More importantly, he coughed up 2 fumbles in Indianapolis territory.    Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, was the star skill-position player for the Ravens. He caught 5 balls for 145 yards and a touchdown, with his only blemish being an offensive pass interference in the third quarter. Flacco's other score went to Dennis Pitta (2-27). As for Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.    Wayne naturally was Luck's top target, snagging 9 balls for 114 yards. TY Hilton also had a decent performance, catching 8 passes for 66 yards, though he dropped a key reception.    The Colts ran on the Ravens successfully, as most teams have this year. Vick Ballard tallied 91 yards on 22 carries.    The officiating was terrible in this contest. There were 4 blown calls in the first quarter alone. Mike Carey's crew whistled the Colts for a terrible pass interference, then incorrectly ruled who recovered the ball on Rice's first fumble. The ensuing drive saw 2 missed face mask penalties. Later on, Carey failed to blow a play dead when Baltimore had 12 men on the field.   "
