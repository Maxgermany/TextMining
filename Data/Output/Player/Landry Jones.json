   "comment":"Landry Jones. Jones had never shown much ability in his 3 years with Pittsburgh, and just the fact that he hadn't taken over for Vick already showed exactly what coaches thought of Jones. But he came to play this week. After Vick went down in the third quarter, Jones quickly showed he should have been in the game the whole time with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant, which put the Steelers up 12-10 after having barely moved the ball all game. And it wouldn't be the last time Jones found Bryant for a touchdown. With a 5.point lead and 2:15 left in the game, Jones hit Bryant on a crossing pattern that he took 88 yards to pay dirt.    Bryant ended up catching 6-of-8 targets for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns in his first game back from suspension/injury, while "

   "comment":"Landry Jones, might be able to do some damage as he hit Martavis Bryant on the first pass for 19 yards and then almost connected with him on the sideline on a deeper play, but then Jones settled in as the game manager and was off-target when he did throw the ball. By halftime, Jones had the ugly line of 5 completions on 12 attempts for 73 yards and an interception.    Alex Smith, on the other hand, was moving the ball with 160 yards at halftime, but no touchdowns and 3 Cairo Santos field goals. This has been a familiar refrain for this Kansas City offense.    After half, Kansas City found the end zone as Charcandrick West saw 3 goal-line attempts, but was able to get in for his first touchdown of his career and the first rushing touchdown the Steelers had allowed this season. West had a bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but overall played a nice game, rushing for 110 yards on 22 carries for 5 yards per attempt. This comes against a Steelers' defense that had been giving up just 3.5 yards per carry on the season.    West's touchdown was then matched when Jones hit Bryant again, but this time for a 19-yard touchdown, bringing the Steelers within 6 points just before the third quarter ended. Bryant now has 3 touchdown receptions in his first 2 games back and amazingly, Bryant caught all of those touchdown passes from Landry Jones. When Ben Roethlisberger returns, this offense could be special.    The Steelers then made another push, aided by "

   "comment":"Landry Jones to hold for a 45-yard field goal. As a side note, Jones is not their regular holder, so the jig was up before any of these shenanigans started. The Steelers then got out of field-goal formation and Jones took a shotgun snap, then commenced to throwing to a covered lineman, 25-foot tall offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva. You can guess what happened after that, but I'll tell you anyway. Cornerback Jeremy Lane caught the easy interception then ran it back 54 yards to Pittsburgh's 24-yard line. Wilson and company capitalized on that turnover with a 16-yard touchdown to Jermaine Kearse. That turned a 13-7 Steelers lead into a 14-10 Seattle lead.    Ben Roethlisberger also put up big numbers, as you would expect with all these yards and touchdowns to go around, as he threw for 456 yards, but only connected for 1 touchdown and added 2 interceptions before leaving the game with a concussion with 2 minutes left.    A huge chunk of those yards went to Markus Wheaton, who became a huge part of the game plan as Richard Sherman shadowed Antonio Brown, and Heath Miller left the game with a rib injury. Wheaton, before this game, had never caught more than 5 passes or accumulated more than 97 yards in his 38 games. On Sunday, he caught 9-of-13 targets for 201 yards and a touchdown, the 4.h of his career. Over the first 10 games of 2015, Wheaton had caught 16-of-32 targets for 273 yards and a touchdown.    On the other side, all 5 of Wilson's touchdown passes went to 2 of his wide receivers, Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse. Baldwin's 6 receptions on 8 targets for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns was his career game in both yardage and touchdowns. He's now had 2 huge games in his last 3. Wilson and Baldwin can look like this 1 game and then do very little the next game, but we know they have it in them. It will be interesting to see if they open up this passing game more as the season closes.    One problem with going more pass heavy is the season-ending injury Jimmy Graham suffered. He tore his right patellar 10.on after putting together a nice game, with 4 receptions for 75 yards. This injury is a tough 1 to recover from, and it has taken some players completely out of the NFL. Graham had not put up the numbers he had in New Orleans, but still had been an integral part of the Seattle offense, averaging 4.4 receptions for 55 yards per game. Luke Willson of The Royal Tenenbaums' fame, will take over as the starter.    As this game went back and forth, with little defense to speak of, Tomlin made a curious decision after Roethlisberger drove the ball down to the 3.yard line, down by 5 points with 3:02 left on the clock. Instead of going for the touchdown on 4.h down, Tomlin opted for a field goal to make the score 32-30 Seattle. Tomlin is known for not playing conservatively, and with his defense giving up yards in fat chunks, the odds of the Steelers getting the ball back, still down just 2.points, was slim. Some have pontificated that he went for the field goal because Roethlisberger was feeling concussion-like symptoms, but if Pittsburgh knew Landry Jones was going to be the quarterback, then why not go for it at the 3. rather than hoping the Steelers' defense could stop Wilson and then hoping some more that Jones could then move them into "

   "comment":"Landry Jones, the Steelers' backup quarterback, relieved Roethlisberger for a series before halftime and did his usual, which was zero, but Roethlisberger, as he is wont to do, limped back on the field in the second half.    The Dolphins looked okay in the first half, and they even scored a touchdown along with 3 field goals - a 1-yard punch-in for running back Damien Williams - to make it 16-8 at half, but their offense didn't really get rolling until the second half when Jay Ajayi went to work. Ajayi was a healthy scratch for Week 1 and, obviously, has spent much of his time in head coach Adam Gase's doghouse, but Ajayi has also been the healthiest and most productive back for the Dolphins, even if the numbers didn't amount to much. Arian Foster returned this week from his hamstring injury, so the prevailing thought was that he would be the lead back, but instead it was Ajayi, who fended off the committee to take over as the bell-cow back in the second half. Ajayi looked strong all game, but as the Steelers had trouble moving the ball, their defense spent too much time on the field, allowing Ajayi and Miami's offensive line beat them down to the tune of 25 carries for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 62-yard scoring scamper that iced the game.    The Dolphins played inspired ball at times, but you can't devalue the injury to Roethlisberger. After returning to the field, he quickly floated a pass right to the Dolphins and just never looked right without his mobility. The Steelers are no doubt a much better team than the way they played in Miami, but they also very much need Roethlisberger healthy, much like last season. That begs the question, why is Landry Jones still Pittsburgh's backup? He is awful and should be on a scout team at best. I understand there is a huge dearth of quality quarterbacks in the league, but a decent backup should have been a major priority after their offense tanked when Roethlisberger was out last season.    This was a weird game. It's hard to tell how much better the Dolphins were due to Roethlisberger's injury, but 222 yards on the ground at 6.2 yards per carry against the Steelers, who had allowed just 70 yards per game to running backs. And to heap some more crazy statistical insults, the Dolphins had come into this game averaging 58 yards rushing per game.    Roethlisberger will get an MRI on his knee, and then the Steelers take on the red-hot Patriots at home. Pittsburgh will need Roethlisberger healthy, or it will be a massacre. The Dolphins, on the other hand, also face a red-hot team as the Buffalo Bills head into Miami, coming off 4 straight wins.   "

And in the end, the Patriots did handle the Roethlisberger-less Steelers and showed just how good they can be, but the Steelers also showed that they aren't completely dead without their star quarterback, as Landry Jones and company were able to move the ball on a strong New England defense.

   "comment":"Landry Jones.    The Browns got off to a fast start and a 14-0 lead behind 2 Robert Griffin III touchdown passes, 1 to Seth DeValve and the other to Gary Barnidge. Griffin showed some of his better traits early, making short, high-percentage passes and causing confusion with his legs, which gave running back Isaiah Crowell more running lanes. Griffin did throw a pick inside the red zone to kill a drive and then had a snap go over his head on the very next possession, which led to the Steelers' first score, an 11-yard touchdown pass from Jones to DeAngelo Williams with just 31 seconds left in the first half. That brought the Steelers within a touchdown, down 14-7 at halftime.    Jones had a good statistical day, completing 24-of-37 targets for 277 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, but the Browns' mistakes are what gave the Steelers a chance to win. In the third quarter, Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun picked off Jones and wended his way all the way back for a touchdown, or what appeared to be a touchdown, until review showed he fumbled into the end zone and out of bounds before crossing the goal line, causing a touchback. The Steelers then went 80 yards down the field and scored on a 1.yard touchdown run by DeAngelo Williams. The Browns went from what should have been a 2.touchdown lead to a tie game. The Browns then had a chance to win the game with a minute in regulation, when Isaiah Crowell fumbled the ball away, sending the game into overtime. At this point, you wouldn't think the Browns could mess up anymore than that, but overtime brought some more miscues. Griffin moved his team down the field in the extra session, which was topped by a 43-yard completion to Terrelle Pryor. Then, with a first-and-goal from the 2.yard line, Cleveland proceeded to lose 13 yards on a wide receiver screen and ended up kicking a 34-yard field goal, which Landry Jones then answered with his own drive, but his finished with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Cobi Hamilton for the win."
