   "comment":"Landry Jones. Jones had never shown much ability in his 3 years with Pittsburgh, and just the fact that he hadn't taken over for Vick already showed exactly what coaches thought of Jones. But he came to play this week. After Vick went down in the third quarter, Jones quickly showed he should have been in the game the whole time with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant, which put the Steelers up 12-10 after having barely moved the ball all game. And it wouldn't be the last time Jones found Bryant for a touchdown. With a 5.point lead and 2:15 left in the game, Jones hit Bryant on a crossing pattern that he took 88 yards to pay dirt.    Bryant ended up catching 6-of-8 targets for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns in his first game back from suspension/injury, while "

  "comment":"Landry Jones.    The Browns got off to a fast start and a 14-0 lead behind 2 Robert Griffin III touchdown passes, 1 to Seth DeValve and the other to Gary Barnidge. Griffin showed some of his better traits early, making short, high-percentage passes and causing confusion with his legs, which gave running back Isaiah Crowell more running lanes. Griffin did throw a pick inside the red zone to kill a drive and then had a snap go over his head on the very next possession, which led to the Steelers' first score, an 11-yard touchdown pass from Jones to DeAngelo Williams with just 31 seconds left in the first half. That brought the Steelers within a touchdown, down 14-7 at halftime.    Jones had a good statistical day, completing 24-of-37 targets for 277 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, but the Browns' mistakes are what gave the Steelers a chance to win. In the third quarter, Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun picked off Jones and wended his way all the way back for a touchdown, or what appeared to be a touchdown, until review showed he fumbled into the end zone and out of bounds before crossing the goal line, causing a touchback. The Steelers then went 80 yards down the field and scored on a 1.yard touchdown run by DeAngelo Williams. The Browns went from what should have been a 2.touchdown lead to a tie game. The Browns then had a chance to win the game with a minute in regulation, when Isaiah Crowell fumbled the ball away, sending the game into overtime. At this point, you wouldn't think the Browns could mess up anymore than that, but overtime brought some more miscues. Griffin moved his team down the field in the extra session, which was topped by a 43-yard completion to Terrelle Pryor. Then, with a first-and-goal from the 2.yard line, Cleveland proceeded to lose 13 yards on a wide receiver screen and ended up kicking a 34-yard field goal, which Landry Jones then answered with his own drive, but his finished with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Cobi Hamilton for the win.",
