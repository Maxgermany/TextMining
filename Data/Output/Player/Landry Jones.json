   "comment":"Jones, the Steelers' backup quarterback, relieved Roethlisberger for a series before halftime and did his usual, which was zero, but Roethlisberger, as he is wont to do, limped back on the field in the second half.    The Dolphins looked okay in the first half, and they even scored a touchdown along with 3 field goals - a 1-yard punch-in for running back Damien Williams - to make it 16-8 at half, but their offense didn't really get rolling until the second half when Jay Ajayi went to work. Ajayi was a healthy scratch for Week 1 and, obviously, has spent much of his time in head coach Adam Gase's doghouse, but Ajayi has also been the healthiest and most productive back for the Dolphins, even if the numbers didn't amount to much. Arian Foster returned this week from his hamstring injury, so the prevailing thought was that he would be the lead back, but instead it was Ajayi, who fended off the committee to take over as the bell-cow back in the second half. Ajayi looked strong all game, but as the Steelers had trouble moving the ball, their defense spent too much time on the field, allowing Ajayi and Miami's offensive line beat them down to the tune of 25 carries for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 62-yard scoring scamper that iced the game.    The Dolphins played inspired ball at times, but you can't devalue the injury to Roethlisberger. After returning to the field, he quickly floated a pass right to the Dolphins and just never looked right without his mobility. The Steelers are no doubt a much better team than the way they played in Miami, but they also very much need Roethlisberger healthy, much like last season. That begs the question, why is Landry Jones still Pittsburgh's backup? He is awful and should be on a scout team at best. I understand there is a huge dearth of quality quarterbacks in the league, but a decent backup should have been a major priority after their offense tanked when Roethlisberger was out last season.    This was a weird game. It's hard to tell how much better the Dolphins were due to Roethlisberger's injury, but 222 yards on the ground at 6.2 yards per carry against the Steelers, who had allowed just 70 yards per game to running backs. And to heap some more crazy statistical insults, the Dolphins had come into this game averaging 58 yards rushing per game.    Roethlisberger will get an MRI on his knee, and then the Steelers take on the red-hot Patriots at home. Pittsburgh will need Roethlisberger healthy, or it will be a massacre. The Dolphins, on the other hand, also face a red-hot team as the Buffalo Bills head into Miami, coming off 4 straight wins.   "

And in the end, the Patriots did handle the Roethlisberger-less Steelers and showed just how good they can be, but the Steelers also showed that they aren't completely dead without their star quarterback, as Landry Jones and company were able to move the ball on a strong New England defense.

   "comment":"Jones.    The Browns got off to a fast start and a 14-0 lead behind 2 Robert Griffin III touchdown passes, 1 to Seth DeValve and the other to Gary Barnidge. Griffin showed some of his better traits early, making short, high-percentage passes and causing confusion with his legs, which gave running back Isaiah Crowell more running lanes. Griffin did throw a pick inside the red zone to kill a drive and then had a snap go over his head on the very next possession, which led to the Steelers' first score, an 11-yard touchdown pass from Jones to DeAngelo Williams with just 31 seconds left in the first half."
