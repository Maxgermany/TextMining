   "comment":"Henery missed field goals on consecutive drives sandwiched around forcing a San Francisco punt. Suddenly, the 49ers had the ball with the outcome in doubt and 6:28 left. They got big plays from Hunter and the physically limited Frank Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper. The icing on the cake was Akers striking the extra point to make it 24-23. Still, the Dream Team had a full 3 minutes to answer the bell. Short passes put them just inside San Francisco territory. A pass to Maclin had them at the 32 and pretty much in field goal range, assuming Henery was up to it. One problem - "

I've constantly asked why the Lions haven't brought back Kickalicious, but there is a better option available now in the wake of Dennver inexplicably getting rid of Matt Prater. The Lions will be making a huge mistake if they don't sign him by Monday afternoon. Having said that, the Lions wouldn't have needed those field goals if they didn't commit their other unforced errors. For instance... - Matthew Stafford threw a terrible interception. The pass was way behind "
