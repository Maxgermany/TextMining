   "comment":"Witherspoon was even worse; he doesn't look like he belongs on an NFL roster at this point.    The Rams came into the season with so much hype as a popular playoff sleeper pick that they were no longer a sleeper in that regard. They disappointed some in the season opener, but scratched and clawed their way to a victory against the Cardinals. They looked much worse the following week at Atlanta, but some fluky things happened in that contest, so excuses were made for them. But now? They have to be regarded as 1 of the worst teams in the NFL. It's almost inexplicable how they've regressed every single week. As mentioned, Bradford compiled a bunch of junk yardage at the end of the game. He finished 29-of-48 for 240 yards, but those numbers are a farce; he was just 6-of-12 for 43 yards by halftime. Again, Bradford didn't have much of a chance behind his terrible offensive line, so it's hard to tell how much blame he deserves for this loss. Bradford also had no running game to work with. "
