   "comment":"Giovani Bernard also had success when rushing the ball (13-62), though he did lose a fumble with 3:20 remaining in regulation as Cincinnati was trying to run out the clock. It was raining at the time, so perhaps Bernard coughed the ball up because it was soaked. It's not much of an excuse, but the wet conditions had a huge impact late in the game.    While it was raining throughout the second half, the skies really opened up when the Patriots obtained possession with about 2 minutes remaining in regulation. It was pouring so hard that it was difficult to see the players on TV. Brady's receivers dropped almost every single ball thrown to them, and it didn't help that "

   "comment":"Giovani Bernard carried Cincinnati's offense. Green caught 11 passes for 128 yards despite going up against Grimes. His only mistake was dropping a pass on third down that would've moved the chains. Bernard, meanwhile, rushed for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 9 carries to go along with 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. One of Bernard's scores, a 35-yarder, was unbelievable. If you didn't catch it on <i>SportsCenter</i>, make sure you do; Bernard broke out of 3 tackles, including 1 sure 1 by Grimes, and then reversed field. He then sprinted forward and juked several more Dolphins - including Grimes again - and somersaulted into the end zone. It was absolutely breathtaking. But staying with Bernard, I have an issue with how Cincinnati used him. It's inexcusable that Bernard received 9 carries when "

The Vikings were absolutely demolished, but this might be the best thing that could've happened to them. Not only did their draft positioning improve; they also could be forced into selecting a quarterback in the first round. Cassel had played well entering this contest, so there was some speculation that they could draft a signal-caller on Day 2 while Cassel held down the fort until the rookie was ready. However, Cassel was finally exposed by a great defense. His final numbers (13-of-27, 114 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble) don't describe how poorly he played in this contest.

   "comment":"Giovani Bernard, who had a crushing lost fumble inside the San Diego 5-yard line at the end of the first half. Bernard screwed the Bengals out of a potential touchdown, which would've put them up by 7 heading into halftime. This game might have gone much differently had Bernard not coughed it up. After Dalton and Bernard, A.J. Green deserves the most criticism. It's not entirely Green's fault that Dalton couldn't get the ball to him, but the stud wideout needs to do better than 3 catches for 34 yards. Green had a chance to haul in a reception of about 50 yards to set up Cincinnati inside San Diego's 10-yard line, but the ball simply fell out of his hands. Dalton spent most of the afternoon overthrowing his wideouts, but this was a perfect pass that Green should have been able to reel in.    But enough about the losers. The Chargers, who will move on to play the Broncos next week, were able to prevail with Philip Rivers attempting just 16 passes. Rivers was very good - he went 12-of-16 for 128 yards and a touchdown - but San Diego was able to pick up big chunks of yardage on the ground. Danny Woodhead (15-54, TD) and Ryan Mathews (13-52) both were able to move the chains quite effectively, though Ronnie Brown actually led the team in the stat sheet, thanks to a late 58-yard scoring scamper in garbage time. Mathews aggravated his ankle injury, which is why Brown was on the field.    Rivers was just 5-of-6 in the first half, which would explain why neither Antonio Gates nor Keenan Allen caught a pass prior to intermission. However, both hauled in receptions on the opening drive of the third quarter, though they ultimately didn't do much (Allen: 2-21; Gates: 1-5). In fact, the only Charger who caught more than 2 passes was also the only 1 to haul in Rivers' sole touchdown, Ladarius Green (3-34).    Credit San Diego's offensive line for keeping Rivers upright. Rivers took a sack on a blitz during the opening drive, but that was the only other time he was brought down behind the line of scrimmage. Center Nick Hardwick exited the game with a concussion, but replacement Rich Ohrneberger played very well as a replacement.    Some stats/notes for the Bengals: - Bernard made mistakes, but he led the team in rushing yardage (12-54) and was second in receiving yards (6 receptions, 70 yards), trailing only Marvin Jones, who hauled in 8 balls for 130 yards. - BenJarvus Green-Ellis ran well, mustering 42 yards on 8 carries. He did a good job of pushing some piles. - Dalton's lone aerial score went to Jermaine Gresham (7-64). <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

He was sharp early, but began throwing passes wide and short of the mark. His final numbers weren't terrible - 28-of-42, 263 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception, 22 rushing yards, 1 rush touchdown - but some of that came in garbage time, and he had so much trouble maintaining drives after that initial possession.

   "comment":"Giovani Bernard did more with less, gaining 72 yards on 13 tries. Both backs caught 1 pass.    Moving on to the Browns, Manziel went 15-of-33 for only 168 yards and a touchdown. That's not the whole story, however. Manziel had a very solid first half - 11-of-18, 128 yards, 1 score - as he escaped the pocket well and did a great job of moving the chains. And I'm saying this as 1 of the biggest Manziel haters on the planet. The guy is a scumbag, but I'll admit when he's performing well. Manziel, however, self-destructed after intermission. It hurt him that "
