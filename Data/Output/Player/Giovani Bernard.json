It was raining at the time, so perhaps Bernard coughed the ball up because it was soaked. It's not much of an excuse, but the wet conditions had a huge impact late in the game.    While it was raining throughout the second half, the skies really opened up when the Patriots obtained possession with about 2 minutes remaining in regulation. It was pouring so hard that it was difficult to see the players on TV. Brady's receivers dropped almost every single ball thrown to them, and it didn't help that "

   "comment":"Bernard carried Cincinnati's offense. Green caught 11 passes for 128 yards despite going up against Grimes. His only mistake was dropping a pass on third down that would've moved the chains. Bernard, meanwhile, rushed for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 9 carries to go along with 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. One of Bernard's scores, a 35-yarder, was unbelievable. If you didn't catch it on SportsCenter, make sure you do; Bernard broke out of 3 tackles, including 1 sure 1 by Grimes, and then reversed field. He then sprinted forward and juked several more Dolphins - including Grimes again - and somersaulted into the end zone. It was absolutely breathtaking. But staying with Bernard, I have an issue with how Cincinnati used him. It's inexcusable that Bernard received 9 carries when "

   "comment":"Bernard was also stacked up beind the line of scrimmage. Baltimore took over in decent field position, and thanks to 2 Flacco conversions, the clutch Justin Tucker was able to drill the decisive 46-yard field goal, preserving my sanity.    The Ravens had success moving the chains early on with some creative plays - a flea flicker helped draw a pass interference on Reggie Nelson, while Tyrod Taylor even saw some action with an 18-yard rush - but the team struggled after establishing the 17-0 lead. The offensive line was completely inept yet again, failing to open up any sort of running lanes for Ray Rice, mustering only 30 yards on 18 carries, though he helped his PPR owners with 6 catches for 26 receiving yards.    Flacco's scores went to Torrey Smith (5-46) and Dallas Clark, who made amends for dropping a pass in the first quarter that would've moved the chains. The Clark score gave the Ravens their first lead since Week 5.    As for the Bengals, Andy Dalton failed to complete half of his passes, going 24-of-51 for 274 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He was woeful early on - 8-of-21, 47 yards, interception in the first half, with plenty of overthrows - but did a better job later on, leading his team back with the help of Baltimore's ineptitude. Dalton's offensive line didn't do him any favors, as it surrendered 5 sacks. Elvis Dumervil, who had 2.5 sacks, collected a pair on consecutive plays in the second half.    Dumervil didn't have the most sacks in this contest. That distinction belonged to third-year linebacker Vincent Rey, who recorded 13 tackles, 3 sacks and an interception. Carl Dunlap chipped in with 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    Bernard was stuffed on that overtime loss, but he made some big plays, gaining 58 yards on just 14 carries to go along with 8 catches for 37 receiving yards and a touchdown. The man who brought the Bengals into overtime obviously had the other score. Green had 8 catches for 151 yards and the Hail Mary touchdown. All but 1 of his receptions came after intermission.   "

The 1 thing Cincinnati was able to do offensively - remember, most of its scores came via the defense and special teams - was run the ball with both BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Bernard. The 2 backs had 16-62 and 10-45 lines, respectively. Bernard, who also had 4 catches for 41 receiving yards, aggravated his rib injury in the second quarter, but was able to gut it out.    The Browns, meanwhile, couldn't run very well, which really hurt them in the second-half monsoon conditions. Ogbonnaya broke a 43-yard run in the first quarter, but he finished with just 26 yards on his other 7 carries. "

The play was reviewed and overturned, with official Jeff Triplette stating that Green-Ellis wasn't touched. Both CBS announcers were irate about this, as they believed it was clear that nose tackle Josh Chapman tripped the runner.    I mentioned Bernard's 99 rushing yards.

The Vikings were absolutely demolished, but this might be the best thing that could've happened to them. Not only did their draft positioning improve; they also could be forced into selecting a quarterback in the first round.

Green dropped a touchdown, so he could've had an even bigger day. Jones, meanwhile, made a great, acrobatic catch with 1 hand while falling down.   "

   "comment":"Bernard Pierce was a huge disappointment. He absolutely bombed in his chance to take over as the starting running back; 2 strong performances against the Bengals and Steelers may have convinced the coaching staff to roll with him instead of Ray Rice. Instead, Pierce was benched after fumbling in the first half. He finished with 14 yards on just 6 carries.    As for the winners, this was a bit of a Pyrrhic victory for the Bengals, as they lost Tyler Eifert in the first half with a very nasty elbow injury. Eifert dislocated it, so he'll be out for a while. The Bengals struggled to score following intermission without Eifert. They let a 15-0 advantage completely slip away, but Andy Dalton managed to hit A.J. Green with a 77-yard bomb. Green snagged it off a deflection and ran into the end zone for what turned out to be the decisive score. Dalton finished 25-of-38 for 301 yards and that touchdown, though he was just 7-of-14 following intermission. Green, meanwhile, made 6 catches for 131 yards and the score.    Giovani Bernard rushed for 48 yards on 14 carries, and he also paced the team with 10 targets, catching 6 of them for 62 receiving yards. His fantasy owners must have been thrilled to see "

Sanu also hurled a 50-yard pass to Brandon Tate. Meanwhile, Bernard and Hill both found the end zone. Bernard rushed for 90 yards on 27 carries and caught 5 balls for 79 receiving yards. Hill, meanwhile, rumbled for 74 yards on 15 tries.    Dalton's supporting cast was able to carry him to victory. Dalton made some nice throws, but left points off the board when he overthrew his receivers twice in the end zone. Dalton is responsible for the Bengals' red-zone woes, which didn't play a factor in this contest because the Falcons simply couldn't score.    Atlanta's offense was awful. The team mustered just 98 net yards of offense in the first half, and most of what it did after intermission was artificial because the Bengals were in prevent since they were up by so much. "

   "comment":"Bernard, who was available for a big gain in the opening half, but his targets let him down. Mohamed Sanu and Jermaine Gresham dropped multiple balls, and the latter allowed a ball to slip through his hands in the end zone. Dalton went 15-of-24 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his numbers would've been so much better if his supporting cast hadn't capsized.    Dalton's scores went to Green, who lost a fumble, and Sanu (5-70). Bernard probably should've been utilized more in the passing game, as he caught just 2 passes. He finished with 62 rushing yards on 13 carries.    I have to vent about Jerome Boger, who is easily the worst official in the NFL. Boger and his crew committed numerous blunders throughout the evening, including: - A horrible illegal contact what wiped out a Revis interception. - Gronkowski was whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty followed a routine helmet tap that you see about 20 times per game. - There was an awful pass interference call on the Bengals following a Brady pass to Danny Amedola. There wasn't even any contact while the pass was in the air. - The Bengals lobbied for an intentional grounding and won their argument about a minute after the play was over. I've never seen an official so easily influenced by players. - Boger flagged the Patriots for a blindside block even though he called the play dead beforehand. That infraction made absolutely no sense. - Boger botched a play toward the end of the first half when he misunderstood the difference between a forward fumble and a lateral during a Patriots' defensive return. - Boger incorrectly ruled a Green touchdown when it was obvious the star wideout was bobbling the ball while falling out of bounds. There were other errors I didn't list. Roger Goodell needs to remove Boger because he's an embarrassment to the NFL.   "

   "comment":"Bernard didn't find much running room, but managed to score once. He gained 45 yards on 16 carries otherwise. Unfortunately, he left the game with a hip injury. Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker Emmanuel Lamur. The second was a weird 1. as Torrey Smith appeared to have suffered a concussion and screwed up on the play. Flacco had some other near-picks, including 1 where a Cincinnati defender bobbled 1 of his passes in the first half. Having said that, this loss wasn't all on Flacco. Smith, as mentioned, suffered a concussion. He also lost 2 starting offensive linemen - Eugene Monroe and Marshal Yanda; 2 of his best - to injuries. Some of Flacco's receivers dropped passes as well. This includes Kamar Aiken, who let the ball fall through his hands on 4.h-and-goal during the opening half. Despite this ineptitude, it appeared as though Flacco won this game when he fired a deep bomb to Steve Smith, who caught the pass and ran into the end zone. However, the officials called offensive pass interference and negated the play. Smith did appear to push off a bit, but the CBS color analyst was skeptical, calling safety George Iloka a flopper. Tony Dungy agreed later Sunday evening.    Smith's nullified touchdown ruined his fantasy day. He saw 9 targets, but snared only 3 of them for 35 yards. Only Lorenzo Taliaferro (2 catches, 42 yards) and Michael Campanaro (3-40) had more yardage. Torrey Smith didn't log a single reception before leaving the game with a concussion.    Bernard Pierce was a healthy scratch in this game. Taliaferro worked as the short-yardage back, scoring twice while tallying 27 yards on 7 carries. It's a shame for "

   "comment":"Bernard, were the only 3 Bengals who had more than 30 receiving yards. I still can't get over how open Green was on certain occasions. It's as if the Rams had never heard of him. The effort didn't appear to be there, despite what Fisher said afterward.    As mentioned, the Bengals pounded the ball well. Jeremy Hill burst for 86 yards on just 16 carries. He left the game on a couple of occasions with some foot problems. Bernard didn't have much success on the ground (10-16), but he did break free for a 45-yard reception. He actually fumbled at the end of it, but Eifert was able to recover the ball.    As for the Rams, they predictably had another terrible showing from "

Cincinnati fans, who were furious, began launching debris onto the football field. I don't blame them at all for doing that. The officials, clearly favoring Pittsburgh, had screwed them twice on the same play.

   "comment":"Bernard (15-49) was better than Jeremy Hill (13-38), and he was also a greater factor as a receiver, catching 4 balls for 45 receiving yards. Cincinnati's usage of Hill is embarrassing, as it seems like a wasted down every time he touches the ball. Hill also whiffed on a block during Dalton's safety.    Dalton didn't have a bad performance, going 21-of-31 for 254 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). However, he missed out on a second aerial score because he underthrew A.J. Green in the end zone. Dalton didn't play as well in the second half, as his center, Russell Bodine, was carted off with a leg injury.    Green had an extremely difficult matchup, as Bill Belichick often takes away the opposing offense's best weapon. Green still managed to catch 6 passes for 88 yards, but he missed out on a touchdown because Malcolm Butler made a great pass break-up. Butler played out of his mind in this game.    The Bengals once again struggled in the red zone. They were stopped at the 1-yard line, with Bernard being stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a 4.h-down try. I keep saying this, but Cincinnati's red-zone offense will improve once Tyler Eifert returns from injury, whenever that may be.   "

The team needed a touchdown to have a chance at winning, but as a result of the play-calling, the Bengals were only able to have enough time to try a 30-yard Hail Mary. They were unable to convert as time expired.    Sunday was a bad day for kickers, and "

   "comment":"Bernard rotated on drives in that order. Hill had a nice burst of 12 to open the afternoon, but didn't do much after that. He finished with 26 yards on 6 attempts. He had a 17-yard gain nullified by a Jake Fisher hold. Mixon, meanwhile, was a colossal disappointment, tallying 9 yards on 8 attempts, and all but 1 of his yards came on 1 try. He also caught 3 passes for 15 receiving yards. Bernard was the most-productive player, registering 40 yards on 7 carries, though 23 of his yards came on 1 carry. Bernard also had a 39-yard reception. This situation is a mess for fantasy football purposes. It's a legitimate 3.headed time share, and the Bengals can't consistently open up lanes for any of the runners.    "

Dalton was extremely sharp, going 25-of-30 for 286 yards and 4 touchdowns. It helped that he was battling a defense missing its 2 best linemen, Myles Garrett and Danny Shelton, so his putrid blocking unit wasn't tested at all. Dalton was able to torch Cleveland's abysmal secondary with ease.    Cincinnati's poor blocking was apparent in the ground game. Many fantasy prognosticators expected a big game from Joe Mixon, but he let them down despite getting 17 carries. He turned those attempts into 29 yards, tying Dalton for the team's rushing lead. He also caught 4 balls for 19 receiving yards. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hill mustered only 16 yards on 6 tries, fumbling once in the process.    Two of Dalton's touchdowns were thrown to Tyler Kroft, who exposed Cleveland's Jamie Collins-less linebacking corps. Kroft caught 6 balls for 68 yards and the 2 scores, with his longest gain, a 21-yarder, coming on a busted coverage. Bernard (3-67) and A."
