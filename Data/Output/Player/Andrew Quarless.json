   "comment":"Quarless on a short slant for the score. Datone Jones and Clay Matthews sacked Romo on a third down just in front of the end zone. A punt return by Micah Hyde set up Green Bay at the Dallas 22-yard line. The drive finished with a middle screen to James Starks for a score. The Packers looked ready to take the lead when a pass deflected off Witten and was intercepted by Tramon Williams. He returned the pass inside the Dallas 10, but the review ruled Williams had trapped the ball. Romo took advantage of the opportunity and hit another big gainer down the seam to Witten. To end the drive, Bryant made a miraculous catch over 2 defenders for a touchdown. Flynn got a big completion to Jarrett Boykin (6-83) to move the ball inside the 10-yard line. A short toss to Jones (3-49) went for the score. The Cowboys had some questionable play-calling as they continued to throw rather than run the ball with Murray (18-134). Sam Shields soon made a superb interception to give Green Bay the ball at mid-field down by 5 with about 3 minutes remaining. A completion to Quarless (6-66), a pass-interference penalty and runs from Lacy moved the ball to the goal line. Lacy then dived over the top to grab the lead. The 2-point conversion was incomplete. To end the game, Romo had a pass off the mark and Williams made a diving interception to clinch the victory for Green Bay.    Romo completed 29-of-48 passes for 358 yards for 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Bryant was a beast with 11 catches for 153 yards and a score.    Flynn was 26-of-39 for 299 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He really struggled in the first half, but made some clutch throws in the final 2 quarters. Lacy (21-141) was phenomenal for Green Bay.    Defensively, "

Minnesota answered with a nice drive that featured a critical holding call drawn by Cordarraelle Patterson (2-18) and a fourth-and-short conversion by Jerick McKinnon (15-54). Bridgewater found an open Charles Johnson (3-52) for a 22-yard score after he ran by Tramon Willims to get open. After Green Bay punted, Bridgewater made a bad mistake throwing a pass up for grabs off his back foot. Packers safety Micah Hyde went up to intercept the pass close to midfield. A great run by Lacy was taken away by a penalty, but Rodgers hit Andrew Quarless for a 34-yard reception to the 1-yard line. For the next play, Rodgers lobbed a pass to a wide open "
