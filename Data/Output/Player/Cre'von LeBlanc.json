Stafford engineered a touchdown drive on the following possession, capped off with his own rushing score. Stafford's late-game heroics were great, as they'll make everyone but his fantasy owners forget about his middling passing numbers (21-of-35, 223 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions). He also rushed for 15 yards and another touchdown. However, his hand injury, which was ruled a dislocated middle finger, has to be a concern. The Lions rely so much on him, so it'll be difficult for them to win if he's not 100 percent.    Stafford didn't have Theo Riddick available as a receiving option.
