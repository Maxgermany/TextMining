Marshall showed up to his post-game interview in a full Colorado Rockies uniform (with the helmet too). It's only a matter of time before he punches another TV.    Moreno started this game with Correll Buckhalter out and got most of the carries. Moreno rushed 21 times for 88 yards. He also caught 4 balls for 36 yards. Unfortunately, Moreno lost a fumble early on and subsequently carried the ball with both hands on every touch.    Tom Brady went 19-of-33 for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had a chance to win the game late in the 4.h quarter, but fumbled the ball away. The story here is that while Brady had tons of protection early in the contest, he was pressured late after "

This game stopped for about 10 minutes because someone in the stands had a laser pointer and was flashing it in the eyes of some of the players. The police did a good job of locating that douche bag and removing him from the crowd. Let's hope this idiot rots in prison for 50 years.   "

If the Dolphins keep winning and Tony Sparano keeps his job, they may decide to keep rolling with Moore next year.

His concentration and focus are terrible. If Marshall could get his head straight, he would be a much better receiver. Moore blew a scoring chance in the third quarter when he fumbled the ball away deep in Buffalo territory. A bit later, Marshall made up for his drops with a 65-yard touchdown on a go route. The pass was thrown in perfectly by Moore to Marshall, who made a nice over-the-shoulder catch while burning cornerback "

Brady was damn near unstoppable after the break, finishing 27-of-46 for 304 yards and 3 touchdowns (1 pass, 2 rush). Brady's sole aerial score went to Deion Branch (3-37). Wes Welker (12-138) and Rob Gronkowski (7-78) were the big yardage producers. Chad Ochocinco, meanwhile, had 1 catch for 15 yards. The crowd gave him a standing ovation when he came up with the grab.    New England's backfield is worth noting because Stevan Ridley finally had the bulk of the workload. He ran tough, gaining 64 yards on 13 attempts. BenJarvus Green-Ellis (3-10) was nowhere to be found.    Meanwhile, Moore finished 17-of-33 for 294 yards, 3 touchdowns and an ugly pick which he hung in the air. His scores went to Brandon Marshall (7-156), Davone Bess (3-39) and Charles Clay (1-1)."

As a consequence, Cutler started the game just 4-of-9 for 40 yards and an interception... But something clicked in the second half.

He was picked off on a 2.point conversion attempt, but those can't be returned in the NFL for some strange reason.

That would set up a short touchdown toss for the duo. Cutler hit a 48-yard completion to Jeffery in the third quarter and a gain of 18 yards to Martellus Bennett (5-56) set up a field goal. Late in the game, Cutler lofted in a pass to Jeffery for 58 yards after he beat Kenny Vaccaro to the Saints' 2-yard line. A quick out to Brandon Marshall for 6 and a 2.point run by Matt Forte pulled the Bears within 8. but Chicago couldn't get the ball back with enough time. Cutler was 24-of-33 on the afternoon for 358 yards with 2 scores. He also ran for 27 yards on 4 carries.    The Bears' defense did a nice job of holding the Saints to field goals, but Chicago was unable to generate any takeaways. "

The 15th pick, which occurred on New York's final offensive drive of the evening, was a slight overthrow. Manning is now on pace to heave 40 interceptions this year. The single-season record is held by George Blanda, who tossed the ball to the other team 42 times for the Houston Oilers in 1962. Aside from the 3 give-aways, Manning looked very sharp. That sounds silly considering the amount of turnovers, but as an example, Manning went 8-of-9 for 132 yards and a touchdown for the duration of the opening half following the second pick. Manning's final numbers were 14-of-26 for 239 yards, 1 score and the 3 interceptions.    The silver lining in the Giants' loss is that the team was finally able to establish a solid ground attack. Brandon Jacobs was partying like it was 2007, as the big back registered 106 yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 attempts. Jacobs did this against a depleted defensive line that was missing Stephen Paea in addition to Henry Melton, but the big back broke lots of tackles and carried defenders around.    Hakeem Nicks (4-70) and Victor Cruz (4-68) tied for the team lead in receptions, but they both were guilty of crucial drops. Rueben Randle (3-75) had the lone aerial touchdown, but got away with what would've almost certainly been the biggest bone-headed move of the week. Randle went down untouched in the red zone. He slammed the ball down on the ground in frustration, which was really should've been ruled a fumble because Chicago alertly pounced on it. Trestman tried to challenge, but official John Parry incorrectly ruled that Randle gave himself up, which was very shady on his part. Randle absolutely did not give himself up.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler had a terrific performance. He went 24-of-36 for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns. His receivers were constantly open, while he didn't have to deal with any pressure. Cutler didn't take a single sack; he was able to sit back in the pocket and dissect New York's secondary with ease on most plays. Cutler also scrambled thrice for 20 more yards. This is noteworthy because Giants' safety Will Hill, who was responsible for 1 of Marshall's scores, was penalized for tapping Cutler's helmet as the quarterback was sliding. Hill literally tapped his helmet - Mike Mayock quipped that it would barely be a legal stop in 2.hand touch - yet Parry threw a flag for a personal foul. As I wrote on the forum, Football is no longer football if that's a penalty.    Both of Cutler's scores went to Brandon Marshall (9-87), who wore green shoes to promote mental-health awareness. This is against the league dress code, so Marshall will be fined for this. Marshall, in turn, said that he'll match the league fine with a donation. This is a cool move by Marshall, and it would be in Roger Goodell's best interest to eschew penalizing Marshall - especially during a month in which all players are encouraged (forced?) to wear pink. It's a bit hypocritical on Goodell's part if he allows the fine to stand.    Cutler's other targets didn't post big numbers. "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall on a third-and-7. A few plays later, Cutler hit an open Josh Morgan for a short touchdown. Cutler then led a field goal drive just before the half, and the Bears' offense was moving the ball consistently. In the third quarter, Matt Ryan hit Antone Smith (2-5 rushing, 4-64 receiving) in the flat, and he exploded down the field for a 41-yard touchdown. Another Atlanta drive led to a tie score after Matt Bryant drilled a 54-yard field goal. After blowing a game at Carolina a week ago in the 4.h quarter, the Bears showed some heart by turning the momentum in their direction after Atlanta came out strong following halftime. Cutler and his offense were continuing their trend of struggling in the second half until a 74-yard bomb to Alshon Jeffery (5-136) turned everything around. On the next play, Matt Forte squirted into the end zone from 6 yards out. Falcons' defensive tackle Ra'Shede Hageman blocked the extra point. Cutler kept moving the ball and threw a short touchdown pass to Jeffery, but the big wideout stepped out of bounds before the reception. Forte finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown run up the middle. Cutler threw a fastball to Martellus Bennett (4-52) for the 2.point conversion. To close out the game, the Falcons had 2 possessions to do something. The first 1 ended when Jared Allen and Willie Young combined for a sack. Ryan was under pressure on 4.h-and-14, and he threw into triple coverage for Julio Jones (4-68), but the pass picked off by Damontre Hurst. On Atlanta's final possession, Young sacked Ryan again before Will Sutton batted a pass on 4.h down to end the game.    Ryan finished 19-of-37 passes for 271 yards with a touchdown and an interception. His supporting cast really let him down, as the offensive line struggled, especially tackles Jake Matthews and Gabe Carimi. Levine Toilolo had an awful game with 3 dropped passes. The Falcons dropped a total of 7 passes versus Chicago. Roddy White (3-40) and Steven Jackson (6-25) were non-factors for Atlanta.    Cutler completed 26-of-38 for 381 yards with a touchdown and zero interceptions. Brandon Marshall had 6 receptions for 113 yards. Forte was excellent as usual with 17 carries for 80 yards and 2 scores on the ground with 10 receptions for 77 yards through the air.    Chicago's defense really stepped up with a big game.

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall for Ryan Fitzpatrick to work with. As a result, the Jets achieved their second first down of the game after the 2-minute warning right before halftime. Fitzpatrick went 35-of-58 for only 283 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. All of Fitzpatrick's picks came in the second half, as he was trying desperately to lead his team back. One interception made by second-round rookie Eric Rowe, who had fantastic coverage. Fitzpatrick was also betrayed by some drops from Quincy Enunwa, but he needs to be blamed, as he missed several opportunities, including 1 where he had Devin Smith wide open for a touchdown in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick simply missed him.    With Decker out, it's not a surprise that Brandon Marshall dominated the targets. Fourteen balls went his way, and he caught 10 of them for 109 yards and a touchdown. Marshall, however, had 1 of the dumbest plays of the year, when he foolishly tried to lateral to no 1 in particular while being tackled. Marshall was charged with a fumble as a consequence. Toward the end of the game, he dropped a pass that was tipped and intercepted. Marshall's stat line was great, and he'll continue to produce, but he cost his team a potential victory with those 2 errors.    Other notables in the New York passing game: "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall for Ryan Fitzpatrick to work with. As a result, the Jets achieved their second first down of the game after the 2-minute warning right before halftime. Fitzpatrick went 35-of-58 for only 283 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. All of Fitzpatrick's picks came in the second half, as he was trying desperately to lead his team back. One interception made by second-round rookie Eric Rowe, who had fantastic coverage. Fitzpatrick was also betrayed by some drops from Quincy Enunwa, but he needs to be blamed, as he missed several opportunities, including 1 where he had Devin Smith wide open for a touchdown in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick simply missed him.    With Decker out, it's not a surprise that Brandon Marshall dominated the targets. Fourteen balls went his way, and he caught 10 of them for 109 yards and a touchdown. Marshall, however, had 1 of the dumbest plays of the year, when he foolishly tried to lateral to no 1 in particular while being tackled. Marshall was charged with a fumble as a consequence. Toward the end of the game, he dropped a pass that was tipped and intercepted. Marshall's stat line was great, and he'll continue to produce, but he cost his team a potential victory with those 2 errors.    Other notables in the New York passing game: "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall was also banged up, leaving the contest on 2 separate occasions. His knee popped awkwardly the second time, so it wouldn't surprise me if he missed a game or 2. though it's also possible that he couldbe fine for Week 9. Marshall saw 18 targets and reeled in 9 balls for 108 yards. "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall made a phenomenal, diving, 20-yard touchdown catch. Quickly, Bortles ripped the ball down the field before throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Walters. Marshall recovered the onside kick. Ivory fumbled a third-down run, but was extremely lucky that Marshall recovered that loose ball as well. With a minute remaining, the Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, but Bortles threw a pick to Marcus Williams to end the game.    Blake Bortles completed 24-of-40 passes for 381 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Bortles played well with a lot of excellent reads and throws. He's vastly improved this season.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 64 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 37 yards. His offensive line struggled to open holes.    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 121 yards, and Allen Hurns logged 5 catches for 122 yards and a score. Robinson and Hurns outplayed New York's veteran corner tandem of Revis and Cromartie. Julius Thomas (3-14) didn't do much for Jacksonville.    Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-34 for 272 yards with 2 touchdowns. At less than 100 percent with his hand injury, Fitzpatrick was a huge upgrade for New York compared to last week.    Chris Ivory had only 26 yards on 23 carries with 2 touchdowns on the ground and 3 receptions for 22 yards. The Jaguars' front 7 was excellent against the run.    Eric Decker tallied 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars really struggled to cover Decker. Brandon Marshall (4-44-1) had some clutch plays in the 4.h quarter to lift the Jets to a win.    Jets safety Marcus Williams was huge with his 2 interceptions and half of a sacks.

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall kept screwing up - a big drop over the middle and a false start - and that was followed by Geno Smith getting knocked out. Smith held on to the ball too long, as he is wont to do, and took a sack as a result. He left the game after getting shaken up, and he was knocked out on a permanent basis. With Ryan Fitzpatrick under center, and Mangold out of the lineup, I didn't have much hope for the Jets, who were trailing when Smith left the game. And yet, the Jets prevailed. The Ravens, as it turned out, had way too many injuries to be competitive. And this includes the shoulder problem that apparently is really bothering Joe Flacco. Flacco didn't look right whatsoever. Some expected him to torch the Jets' miserable secondary, but he couldn't because he obviously wasn't 100 percent. He threw 2 interceptions; 1 pass was telegraphed, while the other was made because he heaved the ball off his back foot, prompting a high pass. Flacco actually seldom stepped into his passes in this contest. His mechanics were horrible, which might be a sign that he wasn't feeling well. Flacco finished 25-of-44 for 248 yards and those 2 picks. It wasn't all on him, as he didn't get much help from both his offensive line and receiving corps, missing stud guard Marshal Yanda and Steve Smith, respectively.    Only 3 Ravens accumulated more than 11 receiving yards: Mike Wallace (10-120), Kamar Aiken (3-55) and Dennis Pitta (4-40). Wallace caught a 53-yard bomb in the first half to set up a field goal.    The Jets have a strong run defense, so it's not surprise that Terrance West was limited to just 10 yards on 8 carries. West got banged up on the opening drive, so perhaps that had something to do with his limited production as well. Another factor is that he had a gain of about 50 wiped out by an Alex Lewis hold; Lewis was in the lineup because of Yanda's injury.    New York managed to run the ball much better than Baltimore. Matt Forte hadn't done anything since Week 2, but he hit the century mark in this contest, though he had 30 opportunities to do so. He also scored a touchdown. Sixty-eight of Forte's yards came in the second half, though he was extremely lucky at 1 point. Forte fumbled inside the 5-yard line. Baltimore lineman Timmy Jernigan picked up the ball, but then fumbled it himself, which the Jets recovered to preserve the scoring opportunity.    As for the Jets' passing attack, I wrote that things seemed extremely bleak when Fitzpatrick took over, but he actually redeemed himself, playing better than Smith. The latter went 4-of-8 for 95 yards and a touchdown, with 1 of those incompletions being a drop by Charone Peake on third down. Fitzpatrick, however, finished 9-of-14 for 120 yards and a score. He made some mistakes - he took a sack to knock the team out of field-goal range and was whistled for a delay of game - but he was uncharacteristically sharp. It should be noted that the Ravens didn't have half of their defense on the field and couldn't generate any sort of pass rush as a result, so it's not like the Jets should suddenly have hope in Fitzpatrick. Still, it would be a surprise if Fitzpatrick didn't start the next game.    One key Baltimore defender who was still on the field despite coming into the game as very questionable was cornerback Jimmy Smith, who shadowed Brandon Marshall on most snaps. Marshall, as a result, caught only 3 passes for 39 yards, though he hurt his stat line with a deep drop. "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall for a touchdown on a slant on the first possession. He was later strip-sacked deep in his own territory, but was lucky that a teammate was in the area to recover the potential turnover. Fitzpatrick at least didn't throw an interception in the opening half, but was guilty of 2 following intermission. The first occurred when he didn't see Jordan Phillips dropping into coverage. The second was more egregious. Fitzpatrick lofted a pass into the end zone despite there being nothing but multiple Dolphins in the area. It was so utterly careless that if you didn't know any better, you'd think Fitzpatrick had an IQ of zero. He made up for it with the aforementioned touchdown, but his mistakes were definitely 1 of the reasons the Jets lost yet again. Fitzpatrick finished 17-of-28 for 193 yards, 1 score and the 2 picks. He missed 1 drive with an apparent concussion, but was cleared rather quickly. Bryce Petty threw 2 passes in his absence, completing both short tosses to his running backs for 19 yards.    Fitzpatrick's leading receiver wasn't Brandon Marshall; Jalin Marshall caught 3 passes for 59 yards and what appeared to be a game-winning touchdown."

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall for a touchdown on a slant on the first possession. He was later strip-sacked deep in his own territory, but was lucky that a teammate was in the area to recover the potential turnover. Fitzpatrick at least didn't throw an interception in the opening half, but was guilty of 2 following intermission. The first occurred when he didn't see Jordan Phillips dropping into coverage. The second was more egregious. Fitzpatrick lofted a pass into the end zone despite there being nothing but multiple Dolphins in the area. It was so utterly careless that if you didn't know any better, you'd think Fitzpatrick had an IQ of zero. He made up for it with the aforementioned touchdown, but his mistakes were definitely 1 of the reasons the Jets lost yet again. Fitzpatrick finished 17-of-28 for 193 yards, 1 score and the 2 picks. He missed 1 drive with an apparent concussion, but was cleared rather quickly. Bryce Petty threw 2 passes in his absence, completing both short tosses to his running backs for 19 yards.    Fitzpatrick's leading receiver wasn't Brandon Marshall; Jalin Marshall caught 3 passes for 59 yards and what appeared to be a game-winning touchdown."

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall. The declining receiver had a ball fall through his hands for what should've been a long gain. There was a ton of hoopla surrounding the Marshall signing when it happened, and it was clear that people were being irrational about it, as Marshall was decaying with the Jets last season. Marshall has just 1 catch in each of his first 2 games with the Giants. New York should consider trading Marshall immediately to a team that doesn't recognize that he's done yet. Odell Beckham Jr., meanwhile, wasn't much of a factor. He caught 4 balls for 36 yards, and he had a drop at the very end. Beckham wasn't on the field all the time, and he probably should've sat this 1 out to continue healing. Engram, meanwhile, was New York's leading receiver with 4 grabs for 49 yards and a touchdown.    The Giants attempted to run the ball, but they've never had success doing so. They kept it on the ground far too often in the second half, pounding the rock on crucial second-and-long situations, which were effectively wasted downs. Paul Perkins couldn't find any lanes whatsoever, as he was limited to just 10 yards on 7 carries.    The Lions didn't have the best pass protection either, as Greg Robinson struggled against Olivier Vernon. The talented Ricky Wagner was also beaten by Jason Pierre-Paul on a couple of occasions. Because of this, Matthew Stafford had to be a game-manager in this contest, and he handled that role very well. He misfired on just 6 attempts, going 15-of-21 for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had several completions negated by numerous holds, including a 19-yard connection to Ameer Abdullah.    Speaking of Abdullah, he had a 34-yard burst that helped him gain 86 yards on 17 carries. He didn't catch a pass, but as mentioned, he had a 19-yard grab wiped out by 1 of countless hold.    Stafford's touchdowns went to Eric Ebron (5-42) and Marvin Jones (1-27). Ebron was able to have plenty of opportunities because the Giants were missing their only talented linebacker, B.J. Goodson. Jones and Golden Tate (4-25) were stymied by a talented secondary. Kenny Golladay (1 catch, 8 yards) took a step backward from his brilliant debut.    Besides Ansah, some Detroit defenders enjoyed outstanding performances. Rookie linebacker Jarrad Davis made some clutch tackles to bring down defenders short of the line to gain, but he left with an apparent concussion in the 4.h quarter, thanks to an uncalled block in the back by Beckham. Meanwhile, Quandre Diggs shut down the Giants' hopes with a terrific tackle on 4.h down. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Brandon Marshall. The declining receiver had a ball fall through his hands for what should've been a long gain. There was a ton of hoopla surrounding the Marshall signing when it happened, and it was clear that people were being irrational about it, as Marshall was decaying with the Jets last season. Marshall has just 1 catch in each of his first 2 games with the Giants. New York should consider trading Marshall immediately to a team that doesn't recognize that he's done yet. Odell Beckham Jr., meanwhile, wasn't much of a factor. He caught 4 balls for 36 yards, and he had a drop at the very end. Beckham wasn't on the field all the time, and he probably should've sat this 1 out to continue healing. Engram, meanwhile, was New York's leading receiver with 4 grabs for 49 yards and a touchdown.    The Giants attempted to run the ball, but they've never had success doing so. They kept it on the ground far too often in the second half, pounding the rock on crucial second-and-long situations, which were effectively wasted downs. Paul Perkins couldn't find any lanes whatsoever, as he was limited to just 10 yards on 7 carries.    The Lions didn't have the best pass protection either, as Greg Robinson struggled against Olivier Vernon. The talented Ricky Wagner was also beaten by Jason Pierre-Paul on a couple of occasions. Because of this, Matthew Stafford had to be a game-manager in this contest, and he handled that role very well. He misfired on just 6 attempts, going 15-of-21 for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had several completions negated by numerous holds, including a 19-yard connection to Ameer Abdullah.    Speaking of Abdullah, he had a 34-yard burst that helped him gain 86 yards on 17 carries. He didn't catch a pass, but as mentioned, he had a 19-yard grab wiped out by 1 of countless hold.    Stafford's touchdowns went to Eric Ebron (5-42) and Marvin Jones (1-27). Ebron was able to have plenty of opportunities because the Giants were missing their only talented linebacker, B.J. Goodson. Jones and Golden Tate (4-25) were stymied by a talented secondary. Kenny Golladay (1 catch, 8 yards) took a step backward from his brilliant debut.    Besides Ansah, some Detroit defenders enjoyed outstanding performances. Rookie linebacker Jarrad Davis made some clutch tackles to bring down defenders short of the line to gain, but he left with an apparent concussion in the 4.h quarter, thanks to an uncalled block in the back by Beckham. Meanwhile, Quandre Diggs shut down the Giants' hopes with a terrific tackle on 4.h down. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "
