   "comment":"Michael Mauti echoed the memories of Steve Gleason, blocking the ball and falling on it in the end zone. The crowd, which already cheered Gleason, who was in the building to be honored, was ignited even more. Though the Falcons snugged up the margin to 1 touchdown, the Saints eventually exploded out to a 3.score lead to keep their season alive. They now stand at 2-4, so they're not dead - at least not yet. The Falcons, meanwhile, sustained their first loss. It was a mistake-filled night for them, as they constantly killed themselves with turnovers.

   "comment":"Michael Mauti on the goal line, and it appeared as though he sustained a concussion. Newton actually went into the locker room for a bit, but returned to the field shortly afterward; he didn't miss a snap. However, Newton caught fire after that, as he was 15-of-22 for 224 yards and 4 touchdowns in the second half. He missed Olsen for a first down at 1 point, but was able to engineer a game-winning touchdown drive at the very end to achieve the team's 12th victory.    Newton actually could've enjoyed a much better day had Ted Ginn not disappointed him. That may sound strange after looking at Ginn's stat line - 5 catches, 80 yards, 2 scores - but Ginn dropped 2 long passes, both of which would've gone for touchdowns. They were long bombs, but both balls fell right into Ginn's lap. Any quality receiver would've reeled them in.    Ginn wasn't the only productive Panther play-maker who made mistakes. Olsen caught 9 passes for 129 yards, but lost a fumble in the red zone. As mentioned, he could've had a greater performance had Newton not missed him a couple of times. He didn't find the end zone.    Newton's other touchdowns went to Mauti on the goal line, and it appeared as though he sustained a concussion.
