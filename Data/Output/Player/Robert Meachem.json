He could have easily run into the end zone had he came up with the grab, and that might have been the game-winning score because the Browns struggled to move the chains in the second half. Meachem didn't catch a single pass, further proving that he's a colossal waste of money - something that was incredibly obvious when the signing was made.    Rivers went 18-of-34 for 154 yards. Meachem screwed up on that 1 play, but Rivers made mistakes of his own. He made some poor decisions with some of his throws and was lucky he wasn't picked off a couple of times, though the wind and rain didn't help. Making matters worse, most of Rivers' yardage came on short dump-offs to "
