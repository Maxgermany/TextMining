   "comment":"Robert Meachem that the wideout turned down the field for a 44-yard gain. The drive ended with a short touchdown pass to tight end Meachem that the wideout turned down the field for a 44-yard gain. The drive ended with a short touchdown pass to tight end Josh Hill. New Orleans' defense was doing a superb job of getting off the field in the first quarter. The Saints breathed some life into the 49ers when they muffed a punt at their own 11-yard line and San Francisco recovered the ball. A couple plays later, Colin Kaepernick threw a perfect pass on a back-shoulder fade to Anquan Boldin (6-56) to tie the game at 7. Kaepernick got extremely lucky in the second quarter after Saints cornerback Corey White picked off him and raced down the sideline. As White tried to extend the ball over the goal line, he lost control and fumbled the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. Frank Gore (13-48) then ripped off a 24-yard run to help set up a 55-yard field goal for Phil Dawson. New Orleans responded with Travaris Cadet taking the kickoff back 82 yards. Fullback Jed Collins powered into the end zone from a yard out and the Saints were up 14-10 at the half. In the third quarter, 49ers' linebacker Ahmad Brooks made a great play to record a leaping interception when Brees tried to float a ball over the linebacker to Jimmy Graham (6-41). Brooks' pick set up San Francisco's offense just outside the 20. The 49ers took the lead with Kaepernick rolling to his right to hit Vernon Davis (4-33) in the middle of the end zone. San Francisco had a drive go inside the Saints 20 with a critical 14-yard reception by Boldin on a third down, but the Saints' defense stepped up to force another 49er field goal. Brees answered with a 34-yard pass to Meachem (2-78) and dropped in a beautiful 26-yard touch pass to Marques Colston (5-80)."
