It's almost a lock at this point that he'll catch 5 passes each week. He's 1 of the most consistent fantasy receivers.    Jordan Cameron hauled in 3 for 62. He sustained a groin injury and didn't return. Cameron is talented, but it's not a good idea to rely on him, given his injury history.    Blake Bortles completed 18-of-33 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played better than the numbers illustrate, as his offensive line allowed a lot of pressure in the pocket. He's not much of a fantasy option, however.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 70 yards on 25 carries to lead Jacksonville. The Dolphins have a stout front, so those numbers are more impressive than they might appear at first glance.    Allen Robinson was the offensive star for the Jaguars with 6 receptions for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. Robinson struggled in the opener, but he bounced back and played to his talent level.

Jay Ajayi ran in the score shortly afterward. Having said all of this, Tannehill made some mistakes. He should've thrown an interception, but it was dropped. He also was guilty of taking a bad sack to move his team out of field-goal range in the third quarter.    Parker missed out on having a monster day. He had a touchdown wiped out because his forearm landed out of bounds before his second foot was planted in the end zone. He also had a 32-yard leaping grab along the sideline wiped out by another review. As a result, Parker caught 3 passes for 64 yards, but he easily could've eclipsed the century mark and scored a touchdown. Adding injury to insult, Parker was knocked out of the game with a back injury. Elsewhere in Miami's receiving corps, "

   "comment":"DeVante Parker fell down in the end zone. This would be a trend for the Dolphins throughout the early stages of the afternoon, as Cutler tossed 3 picks in the opening half. The second 1 was definitely his fault, as he foolishly threw the ball across his body. The third was on Parker again, as he had the ball bounce off his hands. These interceptions, as well as a crushing penalty on Jermon Bushrod to negate a 48-yard reception by Jarvis Landry, allowed the Buccaneers to operate on short fields. They took advantage, notching 20 points in the opening half. They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit.
