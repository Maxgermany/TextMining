   "comment":"DeVante Parker being too raw, Ryan Tannehill will have to throw to someone else besides Jarvis Landry.    Jarvis Landry had 8 receptions for 110 yards. It's almost a lock at this point that he'll catch 5 passes each week. He's 1 of the most consistent fantasy receivers.    Jordan Cameron hauled in 3 for 62. He sustained a groin injury and didn't return. Cameron is talented, but it's not a good idea to rely on him, given his injury history.    Blake Bortles completed 18-of-33 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played better than the numbers illustrate, as his offensive line allowed a lot of pressure in the pocket. He's not much of a fantasy option, however.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 70 yards on 25 carries to lead Jacksonville. The Dolphins have a stout front, so those numbers are more impressive than they might appear at first glance.    Allen Robinson was the offensive star for the Jaguars with 6 receptions for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. Robinson struggled in the opener, but he bounced back and played to his talent level. He can be started each week. Allen Hurns (4-68) and "

   "comment":"DeVante Parker for 56 yards with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Corey Liuget tacked on to put the Dolphins at the 10-yard line. Miami had to settled for a field goal though, but that still tied the game at 24. A run by Gordon of 13 yards and a screen to him of 20 yards moved the ball across midfield, but then disaster struck for Rivers as Kiko Alonso undercut a route to pick off the pass and return it 60 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Rivers had 1 minute remaining, but Tony Lippett added his second interception to clinch the Miami victory.    Philip Rivers completed 23-of-44 passes for 326 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Tyrell Williams led San Diego with 5 receptions for 125 yards and a score.    Melvin Gordon was contained by the Dolphins' talented defensive line. He had 70 yards on 24 carries, but also contributed 5 receptions for 62 yards.    Ryan Tannehill completed 17-of-24 for 240 yards on 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't illustrate that Tannehill made some phenomenal throws, and he threw the deep ball better than any game I've ever seen from him.    Jay Ajayi (19-79) was contained by the Chargers' defense. DeVante Parker (5-103) led Miami in receiving.    "

   "comment":"DeVante Parker fell down in the end zone. This would be a trend for the Dolphins throughout the early stages of the afternoon, as Cutler tossed 3 picks in the opening half. The second 1 was definitely his fault, as he foolishly threw the ball across his body. The third was on Parker again, as he had the ball bounce off his hands. These interceptions, as well as a crushing penalty on Jermon Bushrod to negate a 48-yard reception by Jarvis Landry, allowed the Buccaneers to operate on short fields. They took advantage, notching 20 points in the opening half. They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit. Parker was awful in this contest, as he was responsible for 2 interceptions. "
