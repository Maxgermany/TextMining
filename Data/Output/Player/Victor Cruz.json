The Giants' defense took over and started putting a lot of heat on Moore. New York's defensive line was overwhelming the Dolphins' front. Osi Umenyiora beat Jake Long for a sack. Mathias Kiwanuaka got by Vernon Carey for a sack on the next play. That ended up putting Moore in a 4th-and-23 just after the 2-minute warning. He threw downfield and was intercepted by Corey Webster. Jason Pierre-Paul, Linval Joseph and Justin Tuck also got into the sack column in the game. Moore finished 13-of-22 for 138 yards and 1 interception. Earlier in the week, Bush admitted that he and his team have been terrible this year. Well, Bush tried to do something about it as he ran for 103 yards on 15 carries. Wide receiver Brandon Marshall had 55 yards on 4 catches. Manning had a fabulous performance. He was 31-of-45 for 349 yards and 2 touchdowns. Bradshaw ran for 50 yards on 13 carries and had 5 receptions for 38 yards. The Giants wide outs all had solid games.

   "comment":"Cruz and Jake Ballard. That set up a field goal for New York. On the next New England possession, Brady got hit as he reared back to throw the ball and it came loose. The sack-fumble was recovered by the Giants at the Patriots' 10-yard line. The next play saw Brandon Jacobs run up the gut into the end zone, virtually untouched. Special teams became a liability for both teams in the second half. First, a muffed punt by Giants cornerback Aaron Ross was recovered by New England. That set up the Patriots for a field goal. A short time later, New England committed their fourth turnover when Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich forced a fumble from Julian Edelman in punt coverage. On the drive, Manning moved the ball with a couple of good passes along the sideline. The Giants got inside the 10-yard line when Manning hit Michael Clayton in the back of the end zone. His catch was tossed because he had stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, Manning threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone after throwing off his back foot. Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington spun off of his man and made a leaping interception to negate scoring chance. It was Arrington's fifth interception of the season. Brady answered with a big 27-yard toss to Welker in the middle of zone coverage. They hooked up again for 28 yards to get inside the 20. Brady finished the drive with a touchdown strike to Hernandez. He caught the ball short of the end zone and made a few defenders miss before charging in for the game-tying score. Brady led another a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead in the fourth quarter. The Giants came up with a big answer. Manning made a few good throws to move the ball down the field. He was aided by a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Arrington. On 3rd-and-5, Manning made a perfect throw to Mario Manningham, who got by Arrington running through the end zone. The 10-yard score gave the Giants a 17-13 lead. A penalty on Manningham after the play helped give the Patriots good field position. Brady got to work with a good pass to Deion Branch, and then a 19-yard pass to Gronkowski brought it to the Giants' 15 yard-line. A few plays later, and Brady had a 4th-and-8 at the Giants' 14-yard line. He threw a strike to Gronkowski in the front of the end zone for the lead. To start the game-winning drive, Manning got a huge gain to Ballard. Manning tossed a ball down the seam, and Ballard made a leaping catch for 28 yards. Manning then scrambled for 12 yards. On the next play, he threw incomplete for Victor Cruz in the end zone but pass interference was called. That put the ball on the Patriot's 1-yard line. Manning threw incomplete for Ballard. Jacobs got stuffed on the next play. On third-and-goal, with 19 seconds remaining, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Ballard running an out route in the end zone. That completed New York's massive road win and saw the Giants improve to 6-2 on the season. For the night, Manning was 20-of-39 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacobs ran for 72 yards on 18 carries, while Cruz led the Giants in receiving with 6 receptions for 91 yards. Ballard caught 4 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28-of-49 passes for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Giants had a good rush, but Brady missed some open receivers whom he normally hits. Brady seemed off against New York. Welker led New England in receiving with 9 receptions for 136 yards. Gronkowski had 8 grabs for 101 yards and 1 touchdown.   "

   "comment":"Cruz who beat Nnamdi Asomugha to get open in the back of the end zone for a 24-yard score. If it weren't for his dumb interceptions, Young would have had a perfect game against New York. In the fourth quarter, he led Philadelphia on a balanced 18-play drive that took 9 minutes off the clock. On third-and-goal, Young threw a bullet to Riley Cooper running across the back of the end zone. The Giants got the ball with about 3 minutes left in the game. On a critical third down, Manning hit Cruz who broke down the field for a 47-yard gain. On the next play, Eagles defensive end "

   "comment":"Cruz to set up a field goal. In the second quarter, each defense stepped up with some interceptions. Green Bay struck first as Clay Matthews jumped a pass in the flat and promptly returned the pick 38-yards for a touchdown. Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn then victimized Rodgers and that set up a short touchdown run from Brandon Jacobs. The Packers struck back as Rodgers put together a drive where he moved the ball with his arm and legs. He capped it by tossing an easy touchdown pass to Donald Driver. He was wide open because of busted coverage, and no defender was within 15 yards of him. Matthews put the Packers in position for more points on a sack-fumble of Manning that was recovered by teammate B.J. Raji. Mason Crosby missed a 43-yard field goal, but Green Bay was up 21-17 at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Rodgers out-executed the New York defense on another drive. He moved the ball down the field with some superb passes. To finish the series, Rodgers lofted in a 20-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1-handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1, 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches.

   "comment":"Cruz for a 99-yard touchdown in the second quarter on what should have been a 10-yard gain or so. Two defenders whiffed on tackles. On the others side of the ball, Dustin Keller was clearly focused on some hot female in the stands because he had a ball hit him in the helmet and then dropped another pass. Nick Folk, meanwhile, whiffed on a 44-yard field goal that was way wide right as the first half concluded.    Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer also deserves a ton of blame. He didn't run the ball at all against a weak ground defense, with Shonn Greene getting just 14 carries for 58 yards. Instead, Mark Sanchez attempted a career-high 59 passes, finishing 30-of-59 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, however. Sanchez could have easily been picked off 5 times. He took a safety and had 2 lost fumbles overturned by replay. I don't know what Schottenheimer was thinking, but he easily solidified his status as 1 of the worst offensive coordinators in the NFL. He got Sanchez sacked 5 times, twice by Jason Pierre-Paul.    While Sanchez was pretty inept, he didn't really get any help from his receivers. I already mentioned Keller's drops. Santonio Holmes had 1 as well on a 3rd-and-9 that would have converted a first down at the end of the third quarter. Burress was whistled for offensive pass interference on a touchdown. Keller at least finished with quality numbers (8-77). Holmes disappointed his fantasy owners (4-50), as did Burress (3-34).    Cruz was definitely the top producer on both sides of the ball. In fact, he was the only Giant with more than 1 reception. He logged 3 grabs for 164 yards and a touchdown. Hakeem Nicks (1-20) did nothing.    It's hard to believe that Eli Manning was able to win by 15 points despite only 9 completions. He went 9-of-27 for 225 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception; his yardage obviously inflated by that 99-yard Cruz strike.    "

   "comment":"Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7-point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible. His final numbers look decent - 22-of-35, 291 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks - but most of the yardage, save for a 62-yard touchdown bomb to Josh Gordon, came in garbage time. On 1 instance, Weeden was whistled for an illegal forward pass because he tossed the ball into the end zone after the ball was batted back to him. Immediately afterward, Weeden heaved an interception into the end zone. Weeden was mostly awful, which has to be especially discouraging for Cleveland fans because the Giants were missing half of their back 7.    Both of Weeden's scores went to Gordon, who caught just those 2 balls for 82 yards. Meanwhile, Jordan Norwood hauled in 9 passes for 81 yards.    While Richardson ran very well, that's nothing compared to what Ahmad Bradshaw was able to accomplish. He fumbled on his first carry because his own lineman hit him and then committed a chop block, but he rebounded and was able to finish with a whopping 200 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. Meanwhile, Andre Brown suffered a concussion.    Manning, meanwhile, went 25-of-37 for 259 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception despite not having Hakeem Nicks and losing Martellus Bennett to an injury for a stretch. He wasn't sacked a single time.    All 3 of Manning's scores went to Victor Cruz, who caught 5 balls for 50 yards otherwise. "

   "comment":"Cruz. I said save for a couple of plays because both Griffin and Manning had some poor turnovers. Manning, who went 26-of-40 for 337 yards and a touchdown, tossed 2 poor interceptions. The first was an overthrow in Washington territory, which took a potential score off the board. The second led to a Redskin field goal. As for Griffin, he tossed an interception and fumbled twice. At 1 point in the second half, the Redskins committed turnovers on 3 consecutive possessions. They were back-breakers, as they all occurred in New York territory. Washington left points off the board in those instances. It also did so in the first quarter when a Griffin-to-Josh Morgan touchdown was wiped out by a mysterious illegal shift that had the FOX announcers befuddled. Having said all of this, the turnovers that these quarterbacks committed were overshadowed by the clutch plays they made. Griffin was awesome in his first divisional game. He converted multiple fourth downs, including 1 in his own territory where he danced around to avoid pressure and found his tight end for a 19-yard gain. He then scrambled for a 24-yard run and capped off the drive with a beautiful 30-yard lob to Santana Moss for a touchdown, finishing 20-of-28 for 258 yards, 2 scores and an interception along with 89 rushing yards on 9 scrambles - stats that would've been much better had Leonard Hankerson not short-armed a deep pass. Manning, meanwhile, hit Cruz for the 77-yard game-winner and was also extremely sharp on third downs, going 8-of-12 on those situations.    Cruz caught 7 balls for 131 yards. Two other Giants snagged more than 4 passes: "

   "comment":"Cruz that was not a blow to the helmet - so give the Steelers credit for hanging in despite flying in that morning and having to deal with the emotion the Giants would be playing with in the wake of Super Hurricane Sandy. Pittsburgh did a great job of sticking with the running game despite falling behind early. Isaac Redman, starting because both Rashard Mendenhall and Jonathan Dwyer were out, rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries.    Ben Roethlisberger had a very good game overall despite the bogus strip-6. He finished 21-of-30 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in which he felt phantom pressure and uncharacteristically forced a pass into double coverage. He was especially sharp in the final quarter, going 6-of-8 for 99 yards and a score despite not having the services of Antonio Brown, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the opening period.    With Brown out, Mike Wallace (3-66, TD), Jerricho Cotchery (4-50), Heath Miller (4-48) and Emmanuel Sanders (2-20, TD) did a good job of picking up the slack.    Brown wasn't the only high-profile receiver who got hurt. Cruz took that illegitimate personal-foul penalty and was down on the ground for some time. He left, but reentered the contest later to lead the team in receiving; he caught 5 passes for 67 yards. In fact, Cruz was just 1 of 2 Giants to log more than 1 catch; the other was "

   "comment":"Cruz. The Giants struggled to pass protect yet again, as Lamarr Houston, who barely did anything against the Eagles, came alive and hounded Manning all afternoon. The Raiders had a 20-14 lead in New York territory. They were set up to go up by at least 9 points, but that's when things fell apart for them. Terrelle Pryor telegraphed an interception that was returned by Terrell Thomas to the Oakland 3-yard line. Left tackle Khalif Barnes also ruined 3 drives with penalties. Pryor then had another turnover when he was strip-sacked after holding on to the ball forever. It's amazing how much Pryor has regressed since getting off to his hot start. He was just 11-of-26 for 122 yards and an interception, though he did help out his fantasy owners with 19 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Pryor had a nice play in this game when he broke out of a sack and found a receiver downfield, but he struggled throughout (2-of-12 on third down!) and hasn't played well since that weird, 11:30 p.m. San Diego contest. To give you an idea, here's a cool stat that the Associated Press' Josh Dubow came up with: Pryor has gone 112 passes without a touchdown pass (8 interceptions). JaMarcus Russell's longest drought was 104 attempts (5 picks).    Manning, meanwhile, wasn't much better. He went 12-of-22 for 140 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-6. His 1 score went to Rueben Randle (3-50), while Hakeem Nicks (4-49) and Cruz (3-37) were the only other Giants to catch more than 1 pass. Nicks nearly had a score, but he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone instead.    The difference for the Giants was "

Dallas answered with DeMarco Murray (14-86 rushing, 3-40 receiving) as he ripped off a few chunk runs including a 30-yarder. A screen to Lance Dunbar set up Romo to throw a rope to Jason Witten (4-37) for a 20-yard touchdown. A ridiculous penalty on Brandon Carr took away a fumble that Dallas recovered, and the Giants took advantage of the break. Brandon Jacobs (9-75) took the ball to the 5-yard line on a 36-yard run, but the Giants had to settle for a field goal. The Cowboys fumbled the ball away during the third quarter, but a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on Mathias Kiwanuka negated the fumble. A few plays later, Romo threw a short touchdown pass to Witten. The Giants quickly answered with a 27-yard touchdown to Brandon Myers (3-39). He made a leaping catch along the sideline and was on the ground. but neither Bruce Carter or Heath tagged him down. Myers got up and ran 10 yards into the end zone. Manning moved the ball down the field as the fourth quarter wound down. A 22-yard pass to Cruz (2-27) set up the Giants inside the 10. Manning hit "

   "comment":"Cruz had the ball bounce out of his hands and into a Seattle defender's. The second was foolish, as Manning tried to challenge Richard Sherman for some reason. Manning threw right to Sherman, who had great coverage. The third, right at the end of the opening half, was on a Hail Mary, so that shouldn't be on Manning either. The fourth pick was Manning's fault, however, as he threw behind his target. The fifth was in desperation mode. Manning, who went 18-of-31 for 156 yards and the quintet of picks, also fumbled twice, but was lucky enough to have David Diehl recover on both occasions. Had Diehl not pounced on both loose balls, Manning's afternoon would have been much worse. Manning was under heavy pressure all afternoon. He was sacked 4 times, but that number isn't indicative of the amount of heat he faced throughout this contest. - Key injury: Victor Cruz (2-25) suffered a concussion at the beginning of the third quarter after what looked to be a 16-yard reception. However, Pete Carroll pulled a Cobra Kai-type maneuver, challenging the play while Cruz was down on the field and barely moving. The Giants already had issues moving the chains, but they had no hope of doing so without their top play-maker. New York had just 54 net yards of offense in the first half with just 2 first downs. Yes, that's right - the Giants had more turnovers than first downs in the opening half! They ultimately converted just 1-of-10 attempts on third down. - Superior play by the opponent: The Seahawks couldn't muster much offense early because of a great effort by the New York defense. However, "

   "comment":"Cruz gain. Damontre Moore followed that up by holding on a nice punt return. The Giants tried their best to lose this game, but Fitzpatrick wouldn't let them. Fitzpatrick was disgraceful. Don't let the final stats fool you. He finished 20-of-34 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions, but almost all of that positive yardage came in garbage time. By halftime, Fitzpatrick was just 4-of-13 for 39 yards and 2 picks. He couldn't do anything when this game was still in doubt, as the Texans mustered just 83 yards of offense by the time the third quarter began. One of his interceptions was laughable; he heaved a dying ball to no 1 in particular, and the Giants were able to take possession on a short field and score more points. If Fitzpatrick keeps playing like this, we'll be seeing Ryan Mallett quite soon.    It hurt Fitzpatrick that he didn't have Arian Foster at his disposal. Bill O'Brien gave Foster too much of a workload in the first couple of weeks, so he wasn't able to go. Alfred Blue posted solid numbers in his absence - 13 carries, 78 yards - but as with Fitzpatrick, most of his yardage came after halftime.    Fitzpatrick couldn't connect at all with Andre Johnson. He threw the ball to Johnson 11 times, but the veteran wideout came away with just 4 catches for 24 yards. DeAndre Hopkins (6-116) paced Houston in both grabs and receiving yardage.    Eli Manning was the far superior quarterback in this matchup. Shaking off his preseason struggles, Manning went 21-of-28 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He targeted Rueben Randle more than anyone else, but the former LSU product managed just 5 catches for 27 receiving yards. Meanwhile, Manning's scores went to Victor Cruz (5-107) and Daniel Fells."

   "comment":"Cruz dropped a pass on third down of the opening drive. However, the Redskins were the ones that capsized, repeatedly making errors all evening. The Giants, as a consequence, improved to .500. New York probably didn't even need Washington's blunders to win this game. Eli Manning struggled during the exhibition and preseason opener, but he has improved since and was razor sharp in this matchup. Out of 23 first-half passes, he had only 1 incompletion that wasn't dropped compared to 3 touchdowns. He converted first down after first down, moving the sticks on 7-of-9 on third downs prior to intermission. The Redskins, missing DeAngelo Hall, had no answer for New York's aerial attack, and couldn't get any sort of pass rush going. This was puzzling, as Brian Orakpo, Ryan Kerrigan and Jason Hatcher were battling an offensive line with some glaring holes. Manning finished 28-of-39 for 300 yards, 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception. His pick wasn't his fault at all, as Rueben Randle seemed to secure a touchdown, but had the ball knocked out of his hands. It probably would've been ruled a score if the NFL's rules made any sense.    All but 1 of Manning's aerial touchdowns went to upstart tight end Larry Donnell, who caught 7 balls for 54 yards. As my LVH SuperContest partner Matvei put it, What a fantasy season! Jimmy Graham (ADP 1.08) is behind Larry Donall (ADP who the hell is that?)    Manning's top options on the evening were Cruz (6-108) and Randle (8-89), who saw 10 targets each. Both committed errors that would've cost their team in a close game, but the Redskins just weren't competitive.    "

   "comment":"Cruz dropped a potential touchdown in the third quarter, and he immediately fell to the ground, clutching his knee. He screamed in agony while lying on the grass and being placed on the cart. He was immediately diagnosed with a torn patellar tendon, which is an injury that has derailed many careers. It's a shame, but Cruz may never be the same player again. Watching the Giants was almost as painful, especially given that they were 1 of my top plays of the week. It's inexplicable how unprepared they were for this game. They made countless mistakes, which I will detail rather than focus on their fantasy numbers: - Drive 1: Manning (13-of-23, 151 yards) was strip-sacked because he held the ball too long. - Drive 2: Manning was sacked thrice, ruining a possession in which Odell Beckham (2-28) had a great, leaping catch. Manning was in a long-yardage situation on 2 of the sacks because of a delay of game. The Giants also false started on their punt attempt. - Drive 3: Manning was credited with a 1-yard run on a play that was effectively a sack. This happened after 2 ineffective runs by "

The Giants were clearly the better team, but despite the coaching change, they made their typical mental errors and had to squeak out a victory. New York outgained New Orleans, 417-288, and averaged more yards per play (5.6-4.9), but crushed themselves with some blunders. It started early when Victor Cruz dropped a third-down pass on the opening drive. "

Had Church hung on, the Cowboys would've been set up in field-goal range, which would've allowed Dallas to tie the game. Manning also fumbled twice. He was a mess, and he's extremely fortunate that the defense once again bailed him out.    Beckham (4-94) was the offensive hero for New York. He was struggling prior to his 61-yard score, as he caught 3 balls for 33 yards otherwise, thanks to Carr's great coverage. Beckham also hurt himself with 2 drops inside the red zone. Outside of Beckham, New York's leading receiver was Sterling Shepard, who caught 3 balls for 39 yards. Victor Cruz (1-4) barely did anything.    The Giants struggled to run the ball once again. "
