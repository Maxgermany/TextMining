   "comment":"Victor Cruz and Jake Ballard. That set up a field goal for New York. On the next New England possession, Brady got hit as he reared back to throw the ball and it came loose. The sack-fumble was recovered by the Giants at the Patriots' 10-yard line. The next play saw Brandon Jacobs run up the gut into the end zone, virtually untouched. Special teams became a liability for both teams in the second half. First, a muffed punt by Giants cornerback Aaron Ross was recovered by New England. That set up the Patriots for a field goal. A short time later, New England committed their 4.h turnover when Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich forced a fumble from Julian Edelman in punt coverage. On the drive, Manning moved the ball with a couple of good passes along the sideline. The Giants got inside the 10-yard line when Manning hit Michael Clayton in the back of the end zone. His catch was tossed because he had stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, Manning threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone after throwing off his back foot. Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington spun off of his man and made a leaping interception to negate scoring chance. It was Arrington's fifth interception of the season. Brady answered with a big 27-yard toss to Welker in the middle of zone coverage. They hooked up again for 28 yards to get inside the 20. Brady finished the drive with a touchdown strike to Hernandez. He caught the ball short of the end zone and made a few defenders miss before charging in for the game-tying score. Brady led another a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead in the 4.h quarter. The Giants came up with a big answer. Manning made a few good throws to move the ball down the field. He was aided by a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Arrington. On 3rd-and-5, Manning made a perfect throw to Mario Manningham, who got by Arrington running through the end zone. The 10-yard score gave the Giants a 17-13 lead. A penalty on Manningham after the play helped give the Patriots good field position. Brady got to work with a good pass to Deion Branch, and then a 19-yard pass to Gronkowski brought it to the Giants' 15 yard-line. A few plays later, and Brady had a 4th-and-8 at the Giants' 14-yard line. He threw a strike to Gronkowski in the front of the end zone for the lead. To start the game-winning drive, Manning got a huge gain to Ballard. Manning tossed a ball down the seam, and Ballard made a leaping catch for 28 yards. Manning then scrambled for 12 yards. On the next play, he threw incomplete for Victor Cruz in the end zone but pass interference was called. That put the ball on the Patriot's 1-yard line. Manning threw incomplete for Ballard. Jacobs got stuffed on the next play. On third-and-goal, with 19 seconds remaining, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Ballard running an out route in the end zone. That completed New York's massive road win and saw the Giants improve to 6-2 on the season. For the night, Manning was 20-of-39 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacobs ran for 72 yards on 18 carries, while Cruz led the Giants in receiving with 6 receptions for 91 yards. Ballard caught 4 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28-of-49 passes for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Giants had a good rush, but Brady missed some open receivers whom he normally hits. Brady seemed off against New York. Welker led New England in receiving with 9 receptions for 136 yards. Gronkowski had 8 grabs for 101 yards and 1 touchdown.   "

   "comment":"Victor Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7.point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible. His final numbers look decent - 22-of-35, 291 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks - but most of the yardage, save for a 62-yard touchdown bomb to Josh Gordon, came in garbage time. On 1 instance, Weeden was whistled for an illegal forward pass because he tossed the ball into the end zone after the ball was batted back to him. Immediately afterward, Weeden heaved an interception into the end zone. Weeden was mostly awful, which has to be especially discouraging for Cleveland fans because the Giants were missing half of their back 7.    Both of Weeden's scores went to Gordon, who caught just those 2 balls for 82 yards. Meanwhile, Jordan Norwood hauled in 9 passes for 81 yards.    While Richardson ran very well, that's nothing compared to what Ahmad Bradshaw was able to accomplish. He fumbled on his first carry because his own lineman hit him and then committed a chop block, but he rebounded and was able to finish with a whopping 200 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. Meanwhile, Andre Brown suffered a concussion.    Manning, meanwhile, went 25-of-37 for 259 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception despite not having Hakeem Nicks and losing Martellus Bennett to an injury for a stretch. He wasn't sacked a single time.    All 3 of Manning's scores went to Victor Cruz, who caught 5 balls for 50 yards otherwise. "

   "comment":"Victor Cruz had the ball bounce out of his hands and into a Seattle defender's. The second was foolish, as Manning tried to challenge Richard Sherman for some reason. Manning threw right to Sherman, who had great coverage. The third, right at the end of the opening half, was on a Hail Mary, so that shouldn't be on Manning either. The 4.h pick was Manning's fault, however, as he threw behind his target. The fifth was in desperation mode. Manning, who went 18-of-31 for 156 yards and the quintet of picks, also fumbled twice, but was lucky enough to have David Diehl recover on both occasions. Had Diehl not pounced on both loose balls, Manning's afternoon would have been much worse. Manning was under heavy pressure all afternoon. He was sacked 4 times, but that number isn't indicative of the amount of heat he faced throughout this contest. - Key injury: Victor Cruz (2-25) suffered a concussion at the beginning of the third quarter after what looked to be a 16-yard reception. However, Pete Carroll pulled a Cobra Kai-type maneuver, challenging the play while Cruz was down on the field and barely moving. The Giants already had issues moving the chains, but they had no hope of doing so without their top play-maker. New York had just 54 net yards of offense in the first half with just 2 first downs. Yes, that's right - the Giants had more turnovers than first downs in the opening half! They ultimately converted just 1-of-10 attempts on third down. - Superior play by the opponent: The Seahawks couldn't muster much offense early because of a great effort by the New York defense. However, "

   "comment":"Victor Cruz gain. Damontre Moore followed that up by holding on a nice punt return. The Giants tried their best to lose this game, but Fitzpatrick wouldn't let them. Fitzpatrick was disgraceful. Don't let the final stats fool you. He finished 20-of-34 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions, but almost all of that positive yardage came in garbage time. By halftime, Fitzpatrick was just 4-of-13 for 39 yards and 2 picks. He couldn't do anything when this game was still in doubt, as the Texans mustered just 83 yards of offense by the time the third quarter began. One of his interceptions was laughable; he heaved a dying ball to no 1 in particular, and the Giants were able to take possession on a short field and score more points. If Fitzpatrick keeps playing like this, we'll be seeing Ryan Mallett quite soon.    It hurt Fitzpatrick that he didn't have Arian Foster at his disposal. Bill O'Brien gave Foster too much of a workload in the first couple of weeks, so he wasn't able to go. Alfred Blue posted solid numbers in his absence - 13 carries, 78 yards - but as with Fitzpatrick, most of his yardage came after halftime.    Fitzpatrick couldn't connect at all with Andre Johnson. He threw the ball to Johnson 11 times, but the veteran wideout came away with just 4 catches for 24 yards. DeAndre Hopkins (6-116) paced Houston in both grabs and receiving yardage.    Eli Manning was the far superior quarterback in this matchup. Shaking off his preseason struggles, Manning went 21-of-28 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He targeted Rueben Randle more than anyone else, but the former LSU product managed just 5 catches for 27 receiving yards. Meanwhile, Manning's scores went to Victor Cruz (5-107) and Daniel Fells."

He screamed in agony while lying on the grass and being placed on the cart. He was immediately diagnosed with a torn patellar 10.on, which is an injury that has derailed many careers. It's a shame, but Cruz may never be the same player again. Watching the Giants was almost as painful, especially given that they were 1 of my top plays of the week. It's inexplicable how unprepared they were for this game. They made countless mistakes, which I will detail rather than focus on their fantasy numbers: - Drive 1: Manning (13-of-23, 151 yards) was strip-sacked because he held the ball too long. - Drive 2: Manning was sacked thrice, ruining a possession in which Odell Beckham (2-28) had a great, leaping catch. Manning was in a long-yardage situation on 2 of the sacks because of a delay of game. The Giants also false started on their punt attempt. - Drive 3: Manning was credited with a 1-yard run on a play that was effectively a sack. This happened after 2 ineffective runs by "

   "comment":"Victor Cruz. The Cowboys dropped a whopping 3 interceptions, including 1 by Barry Church, where the ball was thrown right to him. Had Church hung on, the Cowboys would've been set up in field-goal range, which would've allowed Dallas to tie the game. Manning also fumbled twice. He was a mess, and he's extremely fortunate that the defense once again bailed him out.    Beckham (4-94) was the offensive hero for New York. He was struggling prior to his 61-yard score, as he caught 3 balls for 33 yards otherwise, thanks to Carr's great coverage. Beckham also hurt himself with 2 drops inside the red zone. Outside of Beckham, New York's leading receiver was Sterling Shepard, who caught 3 balls for 39 yards. Victor Cruz (1-4) barely did anything.    The Giants struggled to run the ball once again. "
