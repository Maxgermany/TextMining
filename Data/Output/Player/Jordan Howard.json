He also drew a pass-interference flag near the goal line. Howard thrived in the preseason, so it's hardly a surprise that he looked so dynamic in his first start. If he keeps performing like this, Jeremy Langford won't be getting his job back.    As for the Bears' dynamic receivers, both are dealing with injuries, which would explain the meager stat totals. Jeffery caught 3 balls for 46 yards and didn't look like quite himself. White, meanwhile, had been enjoying a solid afternoon - 6 grabs, 55 yards - but left the game with an ankle injury and never returned.    It needs to be mentioned that "

   "comment":"Howard touchdown. The Bears would've only needed a field goal at the end had Connor Barth not whiffed on a 49-yard try. It was Barth's second chance after the Colts were guilty of running into the kicker. The decision to cut Robbie Gould looks dumber each week. Much later, the Bears, down just 3 points with about 3 minutes remaining, committed a fumble when Cameron Meredith lost possession. The Colts scooped up the ball right before it trickled out of bounds, which set up 1 of Adam Vinatieri's 5 field goals. Despite all of this, Chicago had a chance to win at the end. Hoyer once again drove the team down the field, but on a fourth down, he somehow didn't seen an open Alshon Jeffery in the end zone. Instead, he hurled an inaccurate ball toward 1 of his other targets, which fell incomplete.    As for Andrew Luck, he threw a number of beautiful passes against Chicago's injury-ravaged defense. He lofted a perfect touch pass to Phillip Dorsett on a third-and-12 right outside the red zone, which ultimately led to a touchdown thrown to Dwayne Allen. Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2-and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as Willie Young logged a trio of sacks. Luck took 6 sacks the week before by the Jaguars, who put no pressure on quarterbacks, so this is obviously an issue. Ryan Grigson discussed not being able to build a championship defense because of Luck's contract... so what about the offensive line?    Luck's 2 touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (10-171) and Dwayne Allen (6-50). They were the only Indianapolis players to eclipse the 30-yard mark. This includes Dorsett, who was once again disappointing. He caught 2 balls for 26 yards, only seeing 3 targets. He was expected to be a greater factor with Donte Moncrief out with an injury, but that hasn't been the case.    The Colts didn't run the ball very much, but when they did, they had success doing so. Frank Gore gained 75 yards on 14 carries. He had just 4 rushes in the opening half, which is puzzling, to say the least.    Moving back to the Bears, Meredith will be seen as the goat for losing that key fumble, so it's a shame that it spoiled such a terrific afternoon. He caught a whopping 9 passes for 130 yards and a touchdown. He served as Hoyer's favorite target, as Jeffery (5-77) once again didn't look 100 percent, though he was certainly improved. Remember, Jeffery should've had a game-winning score, but Hoyer didn't see him. Meanwhile, Eddie Royal and Zach Miller both caught 7 passes for 43 and 73 yards, respectively.    Jordan Howard also had a huge performance for Chicao. He burst for 118 yards on 16 carries, which includes a 57-yard gain. He also caught all 3 of his targets for 45 receiving yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, it appeared as though he had a second score, but a penalty nullified it. Howard is the real deal, and it's difficult to imagine him relinquishing his job whenever Jeremy Langford returns from injury.   "

   "comment":"Howard then plunged into the end zone from a few yards out to take 10-0 lead into the half. Jeffery abused Jacksonville rookie Jalen Ramsey in the first half to the tune of 6 receptions for 90 yards. After trading punts in the third quarter, the Bears got moving when they hit Cameron Meredith for 36 yards on a wide receiver screen. Ka'Deem Carey added a 16-yard run to set up a first-and-goal, but the Jaguars held Chicago to 3 points. Jacksonville got moving with passes of 25 and 29 yards to Allen Hurns to set up the Jaguars inside the Bears' 5-yard line to start the fourth quarter. Chris Ivory soon plunged into the end zone to cut the Bears' lead to 13-7. The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A Yannick Ngakoue sack held the Bears to another field goal. The Jaguars responded with a field goal drive of their own. They then got the ball with just over 3 minutes at their own 20. After a few completions got the ball to midfield, Bortles hit backup wide receiver Arrelious Benn, who made a sliding catch. Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay. With about 2 minutes left, Hoyer got moving with a crossing completion to Meredith (11-113), but on a fourth-and-10, Ramsey came back to break up a pass intended for Jeffery, letting the Jaguars get the ball back.    Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. Brian Hoyer was 30-of-49 for 302 yards, but Chicago really struggled in the red zone, and that ended up being the difference in this game.    Ka'Deem Carey (9-50) and Jordan Howard (15-34-1) split the workload for Chicago.    Blake Bortles was 20-of-33 for 271 yards with a score and an interception. Bortles got in a funk after his fluky interception and didn't snap out of it until late in the third quarter.    Chris Ivory (11-32-1) led the Jaguars on the ground, and "

   "comment":"Howard, who has dazzled in relief of Jeremy Langford, didn't have as many carries as Ka'Deem Carey. Both running backs had half of their yardage come on their longest burst. Howard (7-22) had a gain of 11, while Carey (10-48) made a burst of 24. I wouldn't cut Howard in fantasy just yet, though the declining usage is worrisome.    The silver lining for Chicago is that Leonard Floyd was terrific. The first-round rookie put together a strong performance, as he was a nuisance for Rodgers all evening. Floyd registered 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss Phil Simms and some of the strange things he said during the telecast. Simms opened the evening by saying that the Packers, due to a lack of their running game, were going to get the ball to Aaron Rodgers. Am I missing something, or were the Packers just planning on direct snapping to their running backs? What does he mean by getting the ball to Rodgers? Doesn't Rodgers always have the ball? Perhaps even more confusing, there was this: He was trying to go across the middle and it was not a person. If anyone can decipher what the hell that possibly means, you should probably be hired by the government as someone who can decript alien languages.   "

   "comment":"Howard on a screen on a third-and-15, for example. The Bears' chances quickly vanished, however, as the Titans stopped screwing up and established complete control of the game. Marcus Mariota engineered several successful drives; Derrick Henry proved to be too much to handle; and Matt Barkley finally began making mistakes. They led 27-7 and appeared to think that this game was over. Except, it wasn't. Thanks in part to Jurrell Casey's injury (sprained foot), the Bears roared back, trimming the lead to 27-21. They had a chance to win at the end and even had the game won, but Josh Bellamy dropped an easy catch in the end zone. This was 1 of countless drops Chicago was guilty of down the stretch. The Bears were able to get wide open against Tennessee's poor secondary, but couldn't prevent themselves from dropping lots of passes. Of course, this is what happens to a team missing 3 of its top weapons.    At any rate, Mariota finished 15-of-23 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well overall, especially in the first half, but he barely threw the ball following the break; he was just 5-of-9 for 87 yards after intermission. The Titans didn't need to throw much at first, and this appeared to ruin Mariota's rhythm. This was apparent when he overthrew a wide-open Kendall Wright for a long touchdown late in the game. Mariota, by the way, didn't have to do much running. He scrambled only 4 times, but picked up 46 yards in the process, which includes a 29-yard scamper.    Mariota's scores were thrown to Rishrd Matthews (3-64) and Delanie Walker (3-50). Neither Wright (0 catches) nor Tajae Sharpe (2-11) did much, though the former would've secured a long touchdown had Mariota not missed him.    It might be time for the Titans to give Henry a greater workload. DeMarco Murray couldn't do anything on the ground, mustering only 43 yards on 17 carries. Given how much of a workload he has shouldered, he appears to be worn down, though he did catch 5 passes for 41 receiving yards. Murray also fumbled in the red zone, but was fortunate that Anthony Fasano was able to fall on the loose ball. Henry, meanwhile, looked much fresher, accumulating 60 yards and a touchdown on just 8 attempts.    The best running back on the field, at least statistically, was Jordan Howard, who gained 84 rushing yards on 18 carries to go along with 3 catches for 43 receiving yards. Stats can be misleading, however, and that would be the case here, as Howard dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which was in the end zone. Also, 22 of Howard's 84 rushing yards came on 1 burst that caught the Titans off-guard.    Speaking of misleading stats, Matt Barkley was 28-of-54 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. However, Barkley was just 7-of-16 for 63 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick by halftime. Most of his positive stats came after halftime when the exhausted Titans, who haven't had a week off yet, forgot to cover the horrible Chicago receivers. They nearly paid the price, but managed to hold on. Now, they'll be able to enjoy their bye week before entering the final quarter of the season. If you're wondering about Barkley's interceptions, only 1 was his fault. His first was wrestled away by linebacker "

Late in the fourth quarter, Barkley made another drive deep into Green Bay territory, but on third-and-goal, Hyde made a tremendous diving breakup to force a game-tying field goal. With under a minute remaining on a third-and-long, Rodgers hit a 60-yard bomb to Jordy Nelson, who somehow got behind the Bears' coverage. On the final play of the game, Mason Crosby was true on a 32-yard field goal to give the Packers a tough road win.    Rodgers completed 19-of-31 passes for 252 yards, but he had a lot of dropped passes from Nelson and Adams that took points away from Green Bay's offense. Nelson led the Packers with 7 receptions for 124 yards. He had some bad drops on deep balls downfield, but redeemed himself in the clutch.    On the ground, wide receiver-turned-running back Montgomery had 16 carries for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Barkley was 30-of-43 for 362 yards with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.

   "comment":"Howard drop, Brooks Reed was able to record a game-ending sack to give the Falcons their first victory of the season. It was discouraging to see the Falcons post just 23 points against a Chicago defense missing its top cornerback. That said, Atlanta began its 2016 campaign sluggishly as well, losing to Tampa Bay at home. The Falcons at least won this contest, though they needed some late-game fortune to do so.    Matt Ryan finished 21-of-30 for 321 yards and a touchdown, though the numbers are a bit deceiving because his score, an 88-yarder, was a deep shot to Austin Hooper, who was wide open on a busted coverage. Ryan, who was 20-of-29 for 233 yards otherwise, didn't get the sort of pass protection he was used to receiving last year. Akiem Hicks, who signed a new contract Saturday, dominated the trenches. Plus, it didn't help that Atlanta players slipped on numerous occasions. The field was a mess, which is inexcusable for an NFL season opener.    The Bears' front 7 made sure the Falcons wouldn't run the ball very well. They did their job, limiting Devonta Freeman to just 37 yards on 12 carries, though he scored once. Tevin Coleman (8-16) didn't fare much better. As a result of this, Ryan was constantly in third-and-long situations.    Thanks to 2 long receptions of 88 and 40 yards, Hooper led the Falcons with 128 receiving yards with a touchdown. He nearly doubled up Julio Jones, who made 4 grabs for 66 yards. It was extremely disappointing to see Jones fail to take advantage of an extremely favorable matchup. Mohamed Sanu (6-47) continued to post mediocre numbers.    The Bears may have lost this game, but a silver lining is that a new star may have been a born. Tarik Cohen, whom I praised in my preseason recaps for his dazzling jukes and running ability, made some terrific plays in his professional debut. He didn't see as many carries as Jordan Howard (13-52, TD), but he outgained him, dashing for 66 yards on 5 tries, featuring a 46-yard, field-reserving run. Cohen also caught 8 of his 12 (TWELVE!!!) targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. He ran circles around Atlanta defenders, who had issues tackling him. He also made a crazy, 1-handed diving reception in the second half. Cohen is a freak, and the Bears will almost certainly find ways to get him involved on offense. Cohen isn't built to be an every-down ball-carrier - he's only 5-6, 179 - but he'll be a big-time fantasy producer, especially in PPR formats.    Cohen, with his 47 receiving yards, led the Bears in that category. "

It was a huge bounce-back effort by Howard, especially as he seemed to be feeling the effects of his shoulder and other nicks and twinges as the game went on. Howard's running mate, Tarik Cohen, looked great as well, rushing 12 times for 78 yards and catching all 4 of his targets for 24 more yards. Unfortunately for him and his fantasy backers, Cohen appeared to have made the walkoff run from 73 yards out, but he was ruled to have stepped out of bounds, which on review, was hard to agree with.

Fox is coaching like it's 1995, so he needs to understand that getting the ball to superior talents gives his team the best chance to win.   "
