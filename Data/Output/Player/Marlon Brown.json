   "comment":"Browns swarmed the backfield all afternoon. They had just 2 sacks - including 1 by Barkevious Mingo that helped push the Ravens out of field goal position - but that's misleading because they were dominant in the trenches. Flacco, however, willed his team to victory with a very strong second half. His overall numbers weren't very impressive - 22-of-33, 211 yards and a touchdown - but he misfired on just 2 attempts after intermission; he was 10-of-12 for 102 yards and the score in the third and 4.h quarters.    The big news for Baltimore's offense was Ray Rice's hip flexor strain. He had just 36 yards on 13 carries prior to exiting with the injury. Fortunately, Rice should be OK; it's sounding like there's a chance he could be active next week. If not, the Ravens will be happy to roll with Bernard Pierce again. The second-year back mustered 57 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries.    Smith was Baltimore's best wideout, as expected (7 catches, 85 yards), but promising rookie Marlon Brown hauled in Flacco's lone touchdown. He caught 4 balls for 45 yards. "

   "comment":"Brown on the opening possession, but the infractions would ruin that play. Having said that, Flacco can definitely be blamed for this loss because he transformed into a turnover machine. He tossed a whopping 5 interceptions. The first was carelessly heaved into double coverage. Another was underthrown in the end zone. Flacco had some nice throws in this contest, particularly when he targeted inept Bills' cornerback Justin Rogers, but he was mostly erratic. Flacco went 25-of-50 for 347 yards, 2 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. Aaron Williams and rookie linebacker Kiko Alonso had 2 each. The latter's second pick sealed the victory, as Flacco had a nice drive going for a potential go-ahead score. The ball was tipped into Alonso's arms.    Flacco's scores went to Torrey Smith and Brown. Smith had a huge game, especially when cornerback Aaron Williams exited with an injury, tallying 5 catches for 166 yards. Marlon Brown (4-34, TD) had a solid first half, but a thigh strain slowed him down after intermission.    It's hard to believe, but the Ravens ran the ball only 9 times. "

   "comment":"Browns' franchise. Little opened up with a difficult 32-yard reception on the second drive, which ultimately culminated with a touchdown that Bess caught as he was falling down. It was the same thing in the second quarter, as Little made another tough catch, but was whistled for taunting. Bess once again would find the end zone a bit later, as he broke Lardarius Webb's ankles. This pattern continued in the final quarter. Little hauled in a 46-yard gain, which was yet again followed by a Bess reception - this 1 he made diving as Jason Campbell threw late across his body. Unreal. Little finished with a team-high 7 catches for 122 yards, while Bess had 3 grabs for 24 yards and the pair of scores. It seemed like the Ravens' defense decided to ignore them because they sucked all year, instead concentrating on Josh Gordon (3-44) and Jordan Cameron (1-4). That obviously turned out to be a flawed strategy. With Little and Bess making circus catches the entire afternoon, Campbell finished 23-of-35 for 262 yards and 3 touchdowns (the other was to Gary Barnidge). He missed 1 drive with injured ribs that he sustained on a hit from Haloti Ngata, but he reentered the contest and was extremely effective.    The Cleveland coaches told the media during the week that they wanted to give more carries to Chris Ognonnaya and Fozzy Whittaker. Well, they didn't live up to their word, as the 2 combined for only 10 touches. By comparison, Willis McGahee gained only 31 yards on 21 carries. McGahee can barely move, so I have no idea why he's handling such a big workload.    Speaking of being unable to run the ball, Ray Rice managed just 17 yards on 11 carries. It's not only him; Bernard Pierce's numbers were also terrible (6-11). The offensive line simply can't open up any holes. The main culprit is the center. Ray Lewis and Ed Reed are gone, but Baltimore also really misses the retired Matt Birk.    Baltimore's front also struggled to pass protect, as Joe Flacco was under heavy pressure all afternoon. But despite taking 5 sacks, Flacco actually finished with decent numbers, going 24-of-41 for 250 yards, 2 touchdowns (though he also had an ugly interception that resembled a high punt). I was surprised by these numbers, as Flacco looked like he played much worse. Perhaps it was because of all the negative plays and a couple of other near-picks.    Both of Flacco's scores went to Marlon Brown (5-54), who also hauled in a 2.point conversion. "

It was Flacco's third and final touchdown of the afternoon, and it won the game for good. It was the fastest span of 5 combined touchdowns in the previous 50 years (2:01) breaking the old record (5:40) by a wide margin.    Flacco went 28-of-50 for 245 yards, the 3 scores and 3 interceptions along with a 22-yard run in which he somehow broke out of 4 potential sacks. Two of the picks were his fault. On the first, he had all day to throw, yet still hurled it up for grabs in Minnesota territory, negating at least 3 points. The second was also a poor force, but the third was the result of a Jones bobble. Jones, fortunately, redeemed himself with that kickoff return.    Flacco's touchdowns went to Brown (7-92), Pitta (6-48) and "
