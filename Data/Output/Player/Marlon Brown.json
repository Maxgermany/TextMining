   "comment":"Marlon Brown on the opening possession, but the infractions would ruin that play. Having said that, Flacco can definitely be blamed for this loss because he transformed into a turnover machine. He tossed a whopping 5 interceptions. The first was carelessly heaved into double coverage. Another was underthrown in the end zone. Flacco had some nice throws in this contest, particularly when he targeted inept Bills' cornerback Justin Rogers, but he was mostly erratic. Flacco went 25-of-50 for 347 yards, 2 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. Aaron Williams and rookie linebacker Kiko Alonso had 2 each. The latter's second pick sealed the victory, as Flacco had a nice drive going for a potential go-ahead score. The ball was tipped into Alonso's arms.    Flacco's scores went to Torrey Smith and Brown. Smith had a huge game, especially when cornerback Aaron Williams exited with an injury, tallying 5 catches for 166 yards. Marlon Brown (4-34, TD) had a solid first half, but a thigh strain slowed him down after intermission.    It's hard to believe, but the Ravens ran the ball only 9 times. "

   "comment":"Marlon Brown for 35 yards. Following an interception that was wiped out by a defensive hold, he went back to Brown for a 9-yard score that was reviewed and upheld. It was Flacco's third and final touchdown of the afternoon, and it won the game for good. It was the fastest span of 5 combined touchdowns in the previous 50 years (2:01) breaking the old record (5:40) by a wide margin.    Flacco went 28-of-50 for 245 yards, the 3 scores and 3 interceptions along with a 22-yard run in which he somehow broke out of 4 potential sacks. Two of the picks were his fault. On the first, he had all day to throw, yet still hurled it up for grabs in Minnesota territory, negating at least 3 points. The second was also a poor force, but the third was the result of a Jones bobble. Jones, fortunately, redeemed himself with that kickoff return.    Flacco's touchdowns went to Brown (7-92), Pitta (6-48) and "
