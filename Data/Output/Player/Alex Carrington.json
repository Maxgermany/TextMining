   "comment":"Alex Carrington. Fitzpatrick tied the game at 24 with a short touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson. The Bills' veteran signal caller threw a strike to the back shoulder as Johnson got some separation from Corey Webster. In the 4.h quarter, as the Bills were driving to take the lead, Webster intercepted a jump pass intended for Johnson at the 5-yard line. It was a critical play and a turning point that led to the Giants' win. Bradshaw led the drive to get New York in scoring position with a 37-yard run. The Bills produced a goal-line stand to hold the Giants to a field goal. New York's defense stopped Buffalo in short order to seal the game for the Giants. For the game, Manning played very well. He made good decisions and took care of the football. Manning completed 21-of-32 passes for 292 yards. Bradshaw led New York with 106 yards rushing on 26 carries and all 3 of the Giants' touchdowns. Ballard had an excellent game with 5 receptions for 81 yards. Nicks had 4 catches for 96 yards. Fitzpatrick finished the contest completing 21-of-30 passes for 244 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Jackson ran for 121 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 47 yards. Johnson had 5 catches for 39 yards and a score.   "
