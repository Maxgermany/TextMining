   "comment":"Roberto Aguayo, missed the extra point. After a good kick return, the Rams converted a third-and-17 with a draw run by Aguayo, missed the extra point. After a good kick return, the Rams converted a third-and-17 with a draw run by Benny Cunningham for 23 yards as the Bucs had a number of missed tackles. The Rams settled for a 53-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein. Tampa Bay came back as Jameis Winston hit Mike Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, "
