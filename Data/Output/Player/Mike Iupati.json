   "comment":"Iupati and safety Eric Reid were both knocked out of this contest, but the most prominent player who suffered an injury was Vernon Davis, who endured a concussion on a second-quarter reception. The 49ers couldn't muster a single point after Davis was knocked out. San Francisco was up 9-0 prior to Davis' injury, and they finished the game with a 10-9 loss. Colin Kaepernick simply looked lost without his favorite target. He went 6-of-9 for 43 yards when Davis was on the field and just 5-of-13 for 48 yards and a desperation interception following Davis' concussion. He had similar struggles earlier in the season when Davis was out, so when the Pro Bowl tight end was taken out of the game, it was pretty obvious that San Francisco would have major issues scoring. Of course, it didn't help that his teammates didn't assist him very much. Kendall Hunter lost a fumble in Carolina territory, while the receivers had tons of drops. In fact, 1 sequence in the second half looked like this: Mario Manningham drop, Vance McDonald deep drop, Anquan Boldin offensive pass interference negating a long gain, sack. And speaking of the latter item, the Iupati-less offensive line couldn't hold up for Kaepernick. The unit surrendered a whopping 6 sacks.    Kaepernick (11-of-22, 91 yards, INT overall) struggled for 2.and-a-half quarters - he also had a dropped interception ("

   "comment":"Iupati, left the game with injuries. Fortunately for the Cardinals, they have 10 days to get them, as well as Carson Palmer, back into the lineup.    San Francisco was the better team in the opening half, outgaining the Cardinals and posting a better yards-per-play average. However, their turnovers crushed them, and the defense eventually ran out of gas, as Arizona ran the ball down their throat on 1 soul-crushing drive in the 4.h quarter. Of course, the defense was on the field a lot because Blaine Gabbert was horrible. Gabbert had 1 nice drive in this contest, but floundered otherwise. He finished 18-of-31 for 162 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He was better than Stanton, but that's not really saing anything. One of the picks wasn't his fault, but he should've thrown another in the 4.h quarter. Gabbert did move around well - he scrambled 10 times for 70 rushing yards and a late touchdown - but that didn't make up for his other deficiencies. Gabbert did his usual thing where he threw way short of the first-down marker on numerous occasions, and he sailed balls on the rare occasions in which he hurled some shots downfield. He also took 7 sacks - including 1 for a safety - but some of those occurred because he ran out of bounds for a loss, which counts as a sack. The announcers are clamoring for Colin Kaepernick, but the 49ers' controversial backup is 20 pounds underweight and was benched in favor of Gabbert last year anyway. Kaepernick refuses to put work into the mental part of the game and will ultimately be a worse option. I'd say that's for the best, as it would help the 49ers' draft position - see my for more - but it doesn't matter at all. The 49ers are so devoid of talent, thanks to Trent Baalke's mismanagement, that it's going to be difficult for them to win more than 3 games regardless.    Want an idea of how horrible Gabbert was?
