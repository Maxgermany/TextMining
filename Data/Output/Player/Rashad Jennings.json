Henne was terrific, so he should get a chance to prove what he can do in this offense.    Henne's 4 touchdowns went to Blackmon (as mentioned), "

After missing a routine pass along the sideline in the red zone, Cousins underthrew an open Pierre Garcon in the end zone, allowing a defensive back to break up the pass. The special teams was flagged for a personal foul on a simple kickoff kneel-down. A holding call negated a 25-yard reception by Jamison Crowder. Cousins launched another interception, a pass that was late across the middle into tight coverage. Andre Roberts dropped a pass. And, to effectively end the game, Matt Jones fumbled the ball into the end zone, resulting in a touchback. As you can tell, this was a horrible coaching effort by the Redskins. They didn't seem prepared to play, as Tom Coughlin coached circles around Jay Gruden. The Giants, meanwhile, improved to 1-2. They could - not should, like Jim Nantz repeatedly said - be 3-0 right now had they not blown consecutive double-digit leads in the 4.h quarter. They managed to hold on this time, at least, albeit against an opponent they've dominated for years.    Kirk Cousins had an awful game. The final numbers weren't bad - 30-of-48, 316 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but most of his yardage came in garbage time. By the time the score was 25-6 late in the second half, Cousins was just 11-of-19 for 132 yards and the 2 picks. That means that nearly 200 yards and a touchdown occurred when the game was out of hand, and the Giants were playing a simple prevent defense. Cousins is most definitely not the long-term solution for the Redskins. Both picks were poor throws, including his first 1 that he telegraphed, which showed how 10.ative he was. He could've thrown multiple scores, but his passes were underthrown and/or late. He was hurt by some drops, but many of his long-range passes were off the mark, at least when the verdict of this game was still up in the air.    The Redskins were expected to run the ball well in this contest; New York's ground defense hasn't been very good, while Matt Jones and Alfred Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents. It looked like they'd have success doing that early on, as they opened up with 2 nice rushes, but then left guard Shawn Lauvao was carted into the locker room. Lauvao may not be a big name, but he and Trent Williams are the team's best run blockers by a wide margin. Washington 10.s to pound the ball left most of the time, so not having Lauvao on the field really hurt. Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the 4.h quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    Jordan Reed led the Redskins in receiving with 96 yards on 6 catches. He was targeted 9 times. Much of his yardage came in junk time, but he'll continue to serve as a TE1 as long as he stays healthy. Reed has been injury-prone in the past, but he has changed his diet, and it appears as though it's paying off.    No 1 else on Washington's roster stood out. Pierre Garcon had an inefficient evening, catching 5 of his 12 targets for 64 yards. Don't blame Garcon though; Cousins had him open for a touchdown, but the ball was underthrown.    You might notice that someone named Chris Thompson snatched 8 receptions for 57 yards and a touchdown. Thompson is the third-down back, and he was on the field so much because the team was so far behind in the second half. He's not worth owning in any league.    As for the Giants, Eli Manning was sharp for most of the night, going 23-of-32 for 279 yards and 2 scores. He nearly threw an interception to DeAngelo Hall, but the ball luckily skipped in front of the cornerback. Manning will continue to be a decent streamer versus bad defenses.    Manning's touchdowns went to Rueben Randle and Odell Beckham Jr. Each caught 7 balls each for 116 and 79 yards, respectively. Randle's score, a 41-yarder, came very late in which Manning surprised the Redskins with a pass on a third down as he was running out the clock. Randle wasn't even open; there was good coverage, but the ball bounced right into his hands after it was tipped. Beckham, on the other hand, is a legitimate stud receiver, and this sort of production will be typical for him going forward.    Larry Donnell caught 3 passes for 32 yards. He also dropped a pass. He's not worth owning in 12-team leagues that start only 1 tight end.    The Giants struggled to run the ball against Washington's stout front. Rashad Jennings, who contributed with a blocked punt, managed only 32 yards on 11 carries. "

   "comment":"Jennings, who had just TWO fumbles in his career entering this game, coughed up the ball at midfield, setting up the Panthers with a quick touchdown. How do you handicap something like this? It's ridiculous. The Giants had a chance to take complete control of this matchup, but they killed themselves with horrific mistakes, costing me my Pick of the Month in the process. The amount of bad luck I've had with my selections this year has been utterly appalling, and I don't know what to say anymore. After the comeback, I have just 2 words: holy balls.    The Carolina Panthers remained perfect - barely. The 14-0 Panthers squandered a 35-7 third-quarter lead as the Giants made a furious comeback to tie the game late in the 4.h quarter. But Carolina quarterback Cam Newton led a late drive to set up a game-winning field goal by Graham Gano. That was embarrassing the way we let those guys come back, Newton said. But Newton and the Panthers still came away with the win. Newton continued his campaign for the Most Valuable Player award with a huge day in fantasy and reality. Newton completed 25-of-45 passes for 340 yards and 5 touchdowns. He also was a big factor on the ground, running 8 times for 100 yards. With games remaining against the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Panthers have a chance to become only the third team in modern history to finish a regular season undefeated. For the Giants, their playoff hopes took a major hit. The Giants fell to 6-8 and are a game behind in the race for the NFC East championship.    Beyond the Panthers staying unbeaten, the other big story of the day was the matchup between New York wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Carolina cornerback Josh Norman. There was plenty of pushing, shoving and jawing between the 2 throughout the game. Beckham repeatedly lost his composure, getting flagged for 3 personal fouls. Norman had the upper hand in the matchup for most of the day. Beckham didn't have a catch until the third quarter. He did finish with 6 catches for 76 yards and a touchdown, but Norman had the upper hand in this matchup. Beckham also dropped what would have been an easy touchdown pass in the first quarter.    Carolina cornerback Charles Tillman forced the 44th fumble of his career late in the second quarter. That set up a touchdown pass from Newton to tight end Greg Olsen.    For the Panthers, Newton clearly had the biggest game from a fantasy perspective. But he wasn't the only Carolina player to deliver big fantasy numbers. Wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. had his third straight game with 2 touchdown catches. If Ginn isn't in your fantasy lineup, he should be.    With running back Jonathan Stewart sitting due injury, the Panthers didn't have a true feature back. Newton made up for a lot of that. Rookie Cameron Artis-Payne got the most work of Carolina's running backs with 14 carries for 59 yards. Artis-Payne might be a good pickup for your fantasy team over the next 2 weeks because the Panthers are likely to take a conservative approach with Stewart.    Olsen remains a guy you should be using in DFS each week. He had 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown.    Carolina rookie wide receiver Devin Funchess is worth a late-season pickup in fantasy. Funchess is getting more playing time, and he produced a touchdown catch.    For the Giants, quarterback Eli Manning was the fantasy star of the day. Manning completed 29-of-46 passes for 245 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. But Carolina's defense shut down Manning for much of the first half.    New York's Rashad Jennings remains a running back worth considering starting on your fantasy team now that Tom Coughlin has gotten comfortable with his running back rotation. Jennings finished with 107 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. However, he did have a costly fumble in the second quarter. "

   "comment":"Jennings the majority of the workload this season, but Jennings was actually out-touched by Vereen in this contest. Jennings was very ineffective, mustering only 27 yards on 13 carries against a woeful New Orleans front. Vereen was better (14-42), but had the aforementioned fumble. He also caught 3 balls for 24 receiving yards.    This game was expected to be a shootout. The Giants, as mentioned, shot themselves in the foot, but what about the Saints? The reason they couldn't do anything was that they were unable to pass protect at all. New York struggled to put pressure on the Cowboys last week, but were able to bring plenty of heat on Brees. The Saints, as a result, couldn't sustain drives. Brees got off to a slow start as a result, but was able to catch fire near the end of the game when the Giant pass-rushers were fatigued. Brees ended up finishing with a middling stat line of 29-of-44, 263 yards and 1 touchdown.    Brees' sole score went to "

Cutler threw another great pass to lead Miller down the seam for a gain of 34 yards, and that set up a 40-yard field goal for Barth. Chicago kept moving the ball with Jordan Howard running the ball well on New York and Jeremy Langford (6-8-1) plunging into the end zone from a yard out. Another 4.h-down conversion helped the Giants cross Chicago's 30-yard line, but New York settled for a field goal after the Bears' Adrian Amos dropped an interception. The Bears took a 16-9 lead into the half, but suffered a huge loss with Miller leaving the game due to an injury. The Giants took the opening possession of the second half down the field, and Manning threw a short touchdown pass to tight end Will Tye (2-12-1). New York got in position to take the lead as Victor Cruz (1-48) got behind the coverage for his only reception. To finish the drive, Shepard got wide open down the seam for a 15-yard score. Gould missed the extra point again. Late in the third, Cutler made a great play, escaping a sack and hitting Cameron Meredith (4-49) to convert a third down. A screen to Jordan Howard then moved the ball into New York territory. Barth, however, missed a long field goal. The Giants' defense did a good job of stopping Chicago on a few drives. Late in the 4.h quarter, Cutler made some great plays and threw some dimes to move the ball into New York territory, but Landon Collins intercepted Cutler to clinch the win for the Giants.    Manning completed 21-of-36 for 227 yards and 2 scores with zero interceptions. Beckham saw tons of double coverage and totaled 46 yards on 5 catches.    Rashad Jennings ran for 85 yards on 21 carries with a score.    Cutler played very well even though the numbers don't clearly indicate it. He completed 17-of-30 for 252 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception.    Jordan Howard ran for 77 yards on 17 carries. Meanwhile, Zach Miller (3-61-1) led the Bears in receiving even though he only played half the game.    Defensively, Landon Collins continued his breakout year with 6 tackles and an interception. "

The Giants took the opening possession of the second half down the field, and Manning threw a short touchdown pass to tight end Will Tye (2-12-1). New York got in position to take the lead as Victor Cruz (1-48) got behind the coverage for his only reception. To finish the drive, Shepard got wide open down the seam for a 15-yard score. Gould missed the extra point again. Late in the third, Cutler made a great play, escaping a sack and hitting Cameron Meredith (4-49) to convert a third down. A screen to Jordan Howard then moved the ball into New York territory. Barth, however, missed a long field goal. The Giants' defense did a good job of stopping Chicago on a few drives. Late in the 4.h quarter, Cutler made some great plays and threw some dimes to move the ball into New York territory, but Landon Collins intercepted Cutler to clinch the win for the Giants.    Manning completed 21-of-36 for 227 yards and 2 scores with zero interceptions. Beckham saw tons of double coverage and totaled 46 yards on 5 catches.    Rashad Jennings ran for 85 yards on 21 carries with a score.    Cutler played very well even though the numbers don't clearly indicate it. He completed 17-of-30 for 252 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception.    Jordan Howard ran for 77 yards on 17 carries. Meanwhile, Zach Miller (3-61-1) led the Bears in receiving even though he only played half the game.    Defensively, Landon Collins continued his breakout year with 6 tackles and an interception. "

   "comment":"Jennings that brought them within 7 ppints in the third quarter. The Steelers quickly struck back, however, with a touchdown to Green, making it 21-7.    The Giants' defense showed up and made some key turnovers, but Manning and company couldn't move the ball when they needed to, while the Steelers just had too much firepower and were able to overcome the turnovers.    With the win, the Steelers at 7-5 remain tied with the Ravens for the lead in the AFC North, but the Ravens currently own the tiebreaker. So, the Steelers are currently out of the playoffs, while the Giants at 8-4 are 3 games behind the Cowboys, but New York still has the fifth seed and the current wild-card spot. But the way these 2 teams looked today, it sure feels like both are moving in opposite directions.   "

   "comment":"Jennings and Paul Perkins moved the ball so well throughout the afternoon. This allowed Eli Manning to operate in short-yardage situations to avoid Detroit pass-rushers Ziggy Ansah and Kerry Hyder, who had great matchups versus a pair of weak New York offensive tackles. So what happened? Well, the return of stud guard Justin Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive. That happened to clinch the spread victory; Manning took advantage of Slay's absence by connecting to "

Johnson made a big impact right away, as the Eagles ran behind him very successfully on the opening touchdown drive.
