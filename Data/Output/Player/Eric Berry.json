   "comment":"Eric Berry got his hands on it. Berry grabbed the pass and returned it all the way for 2 points of his own. It swung the score in favor of the Chiefs, and they were able to run the clock out on their next possession. This result has to be disappointing for the Falcons, but the loss demonstrated a potentially fatal flaw in Dan Quinn's coaching style. Quinn has proven to be an aggressive head coach, but on Sunday, he may have gone a bit too far. In the third quarter, the Falcons were trailing 27-16 when they came up with a 4.h-and-1. The ball was on the Chiefs' 10-yard line. Quinn had plenty of time to get 2 scores, and his offense was doing well moving the ball into their opponent's territory. Quinn should have elected to take the points and make it a 1.possession game. Instead, he had Matt Ryan try to pass for the first down, to no avail. The ball was a bit low for Devonta Freeman, who could not make the catch.    Speaking of Ryan, he put together a good performance on Sunday, but he was far from perfect. Ryan went 22-of-34 on the day for 297 yards, 1 touchdown and a crucial interception. Early in the contest, Ryan was extremely sharp and was able to pick apart the Kansas City defense. He was able to repeatedly locate Julio Jones on the first drive, but after that, Ryan really slowed down. As the game went on, the Chiefs figured out ways to take Jones out. Marcus Peters was able to cover Jones relatively well, and then the stud receiver left due to an injury. After that, Ryan had to rely more on screens and gadget plays, solely because the other receivers are not too strong. Ryan was able to scramble for 23 yards on 3 carries though, and demonstrated a generally solid ability to evade the strong pass rush of the Chiefs.    As mentioned earlier, Jones was unsurprisingly the main target of Ryan. Jones led the team with 9 targets and caught 7 of them for 113 yards. He demonstrated great athleticism, and none of the Chiefs were able to cover him in the first quarter. Had he not gotten nicked up in the second half, he could have had an even better day. Elsewhere, Taylor Gabriel (5-44) looks to have replaced Mohamed Sanu (2-26) as Ryan's preferred No. 2 option. Gabriel was highly involved in the option, and he got an opportunity to catch a couple of screen plays. He has explosive ability that Sanu does not have, and he could be worth a speculative add in fantasy. Still, do not expect much from him.    One of the best offensive weapons on the day for the Falcons was Devonta Freeman. He took 15 carries for 56 yards and managed a couple of short-yardage touchdowns. He also made a big impact in the passing game, catching 4 passes for 49 yards. He is definitely the lead back in the formation, but Tevin Coleman will still split carries with him. Coleman saw 12 carries and managed 49 yards. He used his physicality to break through the Chiefs' front and generally looked impressive. If Jones is forced to miss time, you can expect the team to utilize a run-heavy offense.    For the Chiefs, this was yet another huge win. After a late overtime victory against the Broncos, they came back to get a critical win over a tough team. Part of the reason for their success was the performance of Alex Smith. Smith was as steady as ever in this contest. He went 21-of-25 for 270 yards and a touchdown. He actually displayed some decent deep accuracy and had a lot of success targeting Travis Kelce. He was able to find space in the porous Atlanta defense, and that helped the Chiefs' offense to keep moving. Of course, Smith's performance did come with a crucial flaw. Smith had a wide open Spencer Ware off of a wheel route and threw the ball to him. However, he put it too far out in front of the back, who could not reel it in. Had he put it on target, it would have almost certainly gone for a touchdown. Smith needs to make sure that he can make the big throws. Like I said earlier, his deep accuracy was better today, but that was a pass that could have changed the outcome of the game.    Thanks to Smith's solid performance, 3 Chiefs receivers were able to post great days. The best performance came from Travis Kelce (8-140). The tight end was absolutely stellar and created some great mismatches for the Chiefs. By halftime, he had 4 catches for 99 yards, and he could have had a bigger day. Kelce should continue to be the top option for Smith moving forward. The other top receivers were Tyreek Hill (5-53) and Albert Wilson (4-48). Hill is really emerging as a weapon in the Chiefs' offense, and he has done enough to earn a starting job even when Jeremy Maclin comes back. Hill is a must-own in dynasty formats, and he is worth adding in standard leagues as well. Wilson, meanwhile, played well, but he is too inconsistent to be considered in fantasy. He did have a nice 55-yard touchdown run on a fake punt, but he is not likely to score much week in and week out.    Spencer Ware once again was the lead back for the Chiefs. He surprisingly had some issues against the Falcons' run defense, carrying the ball 14 times for 29 yards. The line could not get a lot of push up front, and the team had more success in the passing game. Ware did catch 3 passes for 23 yards and a touchdown, and he could have had more if Smith had hit him on that long pass. Ware is a low-end RB1 in most formats moving forward.    Final Note: Having Justin Houston back will be great news for the Chiefs. He had another sack today, and he could post some big numbers down the stretch. Eric Berry is another player who will help the team. He had 2 interception returns, 1 for a touchdown and 1 for 2 points. The Chiefs should be in good shape on that side of the ball moving forward.   Berry got his hands on it. Berry grabbed the pass and returned it all the way for 2 points of his own. It swung the score in favor of the Chiefs, and they were able to run the clock out on their next possession. This result has to be disappointing for the Falcons, but the loss demonstrated a potentially fatal flaw in Dan Quinn's coaching style. Quinn has proven to be an aggressive head coach, but on Sunday, he may have gone a bit too far. In the third quarter, the Falcons were trailing 27-16 when they came up with a 4.h-and-1. The ball was on the Chiefs' 10-yard line. Quinn had plenty of time to get 2 scores, and his offense was doing well moving the ball into their opponent's territory. Quinn should have elected to take the points and make it a 1.possession game. Instead, he had Matt Ryan try to pass for the first down, to no avail. The ball was a bit low for "

   "comment":"Eric Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just 2 of his 6 targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. "
