   "comment":"Berry got his hands on it. Berry grabbed the pass and returned it all the way for 2 points of his own. It swung the score in favor of the Chiefs, and they were able to run the clock out on their next possession. This result has to be disappointing for the Falcons, but the loss demonstrated a potentially fatal flaw in Dan Quinn's coaching style. Quinn has proven to be an aggressive head coach, but on Sunday, he may have gone a bit too far. In the third quarter, the Falcons were trailing 27-16 when they came up with a 4.h-and-1. The ball was on the Chiefs' 10-yard line. Quinn had plenty of time to get 2 scores, and his offense was doing well moving the ball into their opponent's territory. Quinn should have elected to take the points and make it a 1.possession game. Instead, he had Matt Ryan try to pass for the first down, to no avail. The ball was a bit low for "

   "comment":"Berry to make a diving interception. Then, in the 4.h quarter, Roethlisberger took a sack on a rare occasion in which his excellent offensive line allowed heavy pressure. Roethlisberger finished 20-of-31 for 224 yards and the tipped interception. He played well, and was extremely clutch on a third-down pass to Antonio Brown at the very end to finish the game, but he and the rest of the offense needs to be better in the red zone against the Patriots.    Brown opened and concluded the game with big plays. He started by hauling in a 52-yard bomb, which Roethlisberger made after nearly getting tripped for a sack. At the end, Brown caught a third-down pass to move the chains and ice the game. Brown finished with 6 grabs for 108 yards. As mentioned, he nearly caught a touchdown, but Peters helped force a drop. Aside from Brown, only 3 Steelers caught multiple passes. Those were "

   "comment":"Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just 2 of his 6 targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. "
