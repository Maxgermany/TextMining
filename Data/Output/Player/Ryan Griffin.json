   "comment":"Ryan Griffin for a 10-yard touchdown. Houston's defense forced a 3.and-out, and the Texans' offense marched down the field again. Akeem Hunt ran for 13 yards inside the 5-yard line before Cecil Shorts took a stretch run into the end zone. Midway through the first half, the Saints were given some life when Hoyer threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Jairus Byrd. After trading some punts, New Orleans took advantage of good field position and had Mark Ingram rip off a run of 30 yards. Houston's defense kept New Orleans to a field goal. The Saints moved the ball before the half, and Kai Forbath hit a 57-yard field goal to cut the Texans lead to 14-6 at the intermission. In the third quarter, Houston's offense got back on track thanks to a 37-yard pass to Griffin after he was left uncovered by New Orleans' defense. Alfred Blue finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans quickly tacked on a field goal to expand their lead to 24-6. The Saints put a good drive together with Brees hitting Ben Watson for gains of 15 and 26 yards. However, Kareem Jackson made a diving interception at the 1-yard line and got up to return the ball to midfield. Another New Orleans drive moved the ball deep into Houston territory, but Quinton Demps broke up a 4.h-down pass in the end zone. That ended the game for the Texans.    Drew Brees completed 25-of-44 for 228 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. The Saints were led through the air by tight end Ben Watson with 4 catches for 53 yards. Willie Snead (4-50), Marques Colston (3-38) and Brandin Cooks (5-35) were held in check.    Mark Ingram had 52 yards on 9 carries and 6 receptions for 45 yards. The Saints had to abandon the run because they were way behind so early.    Brian Hoyer was 21-of-27 for 205 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He was yet another quarterback who torched New Orleans' defense.    DeAndre Hopkins was held to 36 yards on 5 receptions, disappointing his fantasy owners despite a great matchup. Tight end Ryan Griffin led the Texans in receiving with 4 catches for 72 yards and a score.    Alfred Blue ran for 77 yards on 16 carries with a touchdown.    The Texans' defense got another superb game from superstar "
