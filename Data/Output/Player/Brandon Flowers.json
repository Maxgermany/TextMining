He was looking for Moore again, this time on a deep ball and had linebacker Derrick Johnson in his face. The Chiefs got 2 key receptions each from Dwayne Bowe and Steve Breaston totaling 54 yards. Le'Ron McClain plunged in from a yard out and as the opening quarter came to a close, Kansas City led 14-0. The Raiders were apparently motivated to respond, and their offense got moving. Rookie running back Taiwan Jones kicked off the drive with a 14-yard run. The revitalized Darius Heyward-Bey caught a pass for another 14 yards, and Michael Bush rumbled down the middle for 35 more. Setting up camp at the Kansas City 5-yard line for first-and-goal, a touchdown seemed inevitable. Four Bush runs later, it was not to be. The final effort was from the Wildcat formation with Bush taking the snap in a shotgun formation. Punts dominated the rest of the second quarter. As time ran down, Boller got the offense going again on a drive that began on the 2-yard line. He connected on a 21- yard toss to Heyward-Bey, following it up with a scramble for 20 yards to the Kansas City 36. However, a deep ball to Heyward-Bey was intercepted by Brandon Carr, giving Boller the hat trick. Down 14-0 at the half, it appeared to be only a matter of time before Palmer was given his opportunity to lead the offense. However, Jackson stuck with Boller, who threw 3 incompletions to open the third quarter. The pressure was catching up to the Oakland defense, and 2 personal foul penalties catapulted Kansas City's offense down the field. Savvy runs from Jackie Battle (16 carries for 76 yards) surrounded those key mistakes, and Javier Arenas capped the march with a 7-yard touchdown run. At 21-0, there was no reason for Jackson not to turn to Palmer. Boller finished 7-for-14 passing with 61 yards and the 3 interceptions. On his first play, Palmer hit Heyward-Bey (5 receptions for 89 yards) for a gain of 18 and picked up another 15 thanks to a personal foul from Tamba Hali, who hit him low after the pass. One more first down was all they could muster however, and the absence of kicker Sebastian Janikowski was felt. He might have gotten them on the board with a long field goal. Instead the Raiders were forced to punt. After an exchange of punts, the Kansas City offense got going a bit, moving into Oakland territory until rookie DeMarcus Van Dyke intercepted Cassel. The Raiders countered by moving into Kansas City territory as the 4.h quarter began. Then Flowers put a stamp on any thoughts of a comeback by housing an interception of Palmer. "

Hilton, who blew by 2 San Diego defenders to score a 63-yard, go-ahead touchdown. The Chargers still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Hunter Henry fumbled near midfield, giving Indianapolis its first victory. Though the Colts prevailed, it didn't seem like they should have won. They made numerous mistakes throughout the afternoon. Frank Gore started by dropping a pass. Dwayne Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign."
