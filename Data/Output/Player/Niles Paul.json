   "comment":"Niles Paul for a gain of 30 yards. That play worked out, but was wasted after Billy Cundiff missed a 31-yarder.    After Tampa Bay took the lead, Griffin had 102 seconds to work with. He threw the ball downfield and ran for a good gain. That set up Cundiff to nail a 41-yard field goal to win the game for Washington. Griffin was 26-of-35 for 323 yards through the air and ran for 43 yards on 7 carries.    If the Redskins lost, it would've been Cundiff's fault. He missed 3 field goals including a 41-yarder and a 31-yarder. Washington should scout out available kickers and have a replacement in mind in case the team needs to cut Cundiff.    An odd event happened before the game. Redskins safety Brandon Meriweather and Aldrick Robinson collided in pre-game warmups and knocked each other out. Both were made inactive.   "
