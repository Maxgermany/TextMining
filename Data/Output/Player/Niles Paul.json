   "comment":"Paul for a gain of 30 yards. That play worked out, but was wasted after Billy Cundiff missed a 31-yarder.    After Tampa Bay took the lead, Griffin had 102 seconds to work with. He threw the ball downfield and ran for a good gain. That set up Cundiff to nail a 41-yard field goal to win the game for Washington. Griffin was 26-of-35 for 323 yards through the air and ran for 43 yards on 7 carries.    If the Redskins lost, it would've been Cundiff's fault. He missed 3 field goals including a 41-yarder and a 31-yarder. Washington should scout out available kickers and have a replacement in mind in case the team needs to cut Cundiff.    An odd event happened before the game. Redskins safety Brandon Meriweather and Aldrick Robinson collided in pre-game warmups and knocked each other out. Both were made inactive.   "

   "comment":"Paul, who was wide open as well. Paul was tackled inches short of the goal line, but the Redskins found the end zone anyway. These were just examples of how Cousins was able to beat Jacksonville downfield. Cousins finished 22-of-33 for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns. Griffin was off to a nice start (2-of-3, 38 yards; 2 carries, 22 rush yards), but as Joe Theismann mentioned in the preseason, Cousins is the better passer. Griffin is a walking injury, so Washington should strongly consider going forward with Cousins. Of course, it won't matter in the immediate future because Griffin will be out for a while.    Cousins helped introduce us to Niles Paul, who had a career performance. He snatched 8 balls for 99 yards and a touchdown. Keep in mind that Paul is the second tight end on the roster, so he won't be as big of a part of the offense once Jordan Reed returns. However, Reed, like Griffin, is always hurt, so Paul is worth adding in fantasy if you're in need of a tight end.    With Jackson out, it was surprising that Cousins targeted "
