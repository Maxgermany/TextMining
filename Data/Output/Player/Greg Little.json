Little can be dropped because Weeden appears to be complete garbage.    The Browns are a mess, but we knew that already. The bigger story in this game is how bad the Eagles looked. Their offensive line can't block, while their quarterback, who barely scrambles anymore, is just as inept against the blitz as ever. Philadelphia will be lucky to have a winning record this year. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Greg Little (3-71), who foolishly took 2 kickoffs out of the back of his own end zone. He fumbled 1 of the attempts, but Cleveland luckily recovered. Jordan Cameron was a disappointment (3-36). He was targeted once in the end zone, but Weeden overthrew him.    Browns' stud defense Desmond Bryant was yet another player who was knocked out of this game. He went to the hospital with shortness of breath, so hopefully he'll be OK.    There was some stupid stuff in this game: 1. The NFL officials now have pink flags. I know it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but pink flags are just way too much. It's a dumb idea that needs to go away. Not everything needs to be pink. We get it. 2. Bills' coach Doug Marrone appeared to challenge illegal contact in the first half. Yeah, I didn't understand it either. There was illegal contact in the end zone that gave Cleveland a first down. Marrone threw his flag, and the official had to announce that the Bills were charged with a timeout on a non-reviewable play. I have no idea what Marrone was trying to do. 3. Why didn't the Browns go for 2 after the pick-six? The touchdown made it 37-24 with about 1:50 remaining. Going for 2 would've made it a 14-point game. I know it ultimately didn't even come close to mattering, but this poor type of game management could come back to haunt Cleveland in the future. 4. NFL Network play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler doesn't know about any of the football players. I'm serious. He's said some weird stuff this year, this week called Greg Little Mr. Dependable. I thought I was hearing things, but couldn't rewind the game because my DVR wasn't functioning at the time. However, multiple forum members confirmed this. How the hell is Little worth the title of Mr. Dependable? He's been benched several times because of drops and fumbles. He's the opposite of dependable. Why in the world would Nessler call him that then? Is he just completely clueless, or is he trolling us? Also, Nessler said, We lost a valuable employee to breast cancer last summer, Natalie Parker. That's nice of him to say that, but her name flashed on the screen as Natalie Packer. Nessler obviously never even said a single word to her if he screwed up her name like that, so why would he say she's a valuable employee? How would he know she's valuable? Does he even know what she did? I'm just shocked he didn't just refer to her as Ms. Dependable.   "
