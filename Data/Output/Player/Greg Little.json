Their offensive line can't block, while their quarterback, who barely scrambles anymore, is just as inept against the blitz as ever. Philadelphia will be lucky to have a winning record this year.   "

Jordan Cameron was a disappointment (3-36). He was targeted once in the end zone, but Weeden overthrew him.    Browns' stud defense Desmond Bryant was yet another player who was knocked out of this game. He went to the hospital with shortness of breath, so hopefully he'll be OK.    There was some stupid stuff in this game: 1. The NFL officials now have pink flags. I know it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but pink flags are just way too much. It's a dumb idea that needs to go away. Not everything needs to be pink. We get it. 2. Bills' coach Doug Marrone appeared to challenge illegal contact in the first half. Yeah, I didn't understand it either. There was illegal contact in the end zone that gave Cleveland a first down. Marrone threw his flag, and the official had to announce that the Bills were charged with a timeout on a non-reviewable play. I have no idea what Marrone was trying to do. 3. Why didn't the Browns go for 2 after the pick-six? The touchdown made it 37-24 with about 1:50 remaining. Going for 2 would've made it a 14-point game. I know it ultimately didn't even come close to mattering, but this poor type of game management could come back to haunt Cleveland in the future. 4. NFL Network play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler doesn't know about any of the football players. I'm serious. He's said some weird stuff this year, this week called Greg Little Mr. Dependable. I thought I was hearing things, but couldn't rewind the game because my DVR wasn't functioning at the time. However, multiple forum members confirmed this. How the hell is Little worth the title of Mr. Dependable? He's been benched several times because of drops and fumbles. He's the opposite of dependable. Why in the world would Nessler call him that then? Is he just completely clueless, or is he trolling us? Also, Nessler said, We lost a valuable employee to breast cancer last summer, Natalie Parker. That's nice of him to say that, but her name flashed on the screen as Natalie Packer. Nessler obviously never even said a single word to her if he screwed up her name like that, so why would he say she's a valuable employee? How would he know she's valuable? Does he even know what she did? I'm just shocked he didn't just refer to her as Ms. Dependable.   "

Bess, meanwhile, has been even worse in terms of drops. He also muffed a punt last week that cost Cleveland a victory last week at Kansas City. However, both were inexplicably outstanding in this upset victory over the old Browns' franchise. Little opened up with a difficult 32-yard reception on the second drive, which ultimately culminated with a touchdown that Bess caught as he was falling down. It was the same thing in the second quarter, as Little made another tough catch, but was whistled for taunting. Bess once again would find the end zone a bit later, as he broke "

   "comment":"Little let the ball hit the ground despite getting a perfect pass thrown his way. Josh Gordon then dropped 2 touchdowns.    The Jets, meanwhile, couldn't get anything going early on because they were too busy trying stupid trick plays that didn't work. They eventually got their act together, and the spark may have been something that occurred late in the second quarter. Geno Smith ran out of bounds after a scamper, and a Cleveland player shoved him when he was well out of the field of play. The official nearest to the action initially didn't throw a flag, which drew the ire of Rex Ryan. The Jets' coach looked like he was going to have a heart attack as he barked at the ref, and upon seeing a flag come in from elsewhere, he then went to the Cleveland defender and yelled at him. This seemed to energize the Jets - Smith in particular, who went 10-of-16 for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. The rookie ultimately finished 20-of-36 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) to go along with 48 rushing yards on 10 scrambles.    Chris Ivory also ran well. He gained 109 yards on 20 carries. Bilal Powell chipped in with 54 yards on 7 totes, most of which came on a 39-yard burst in the second half.    As for the Browns, they had success early because Jason Campbell constantly targeted Gordon (6-97). I don't know what the Jets were thinking, but they elected to cover Gordon with Dee Milliner, who failed epically. However, Miller ultimately came away with an interception after he was switched to the pathetic Little (1 catch, 4 yards). Campbell finished 18-of-39 for 178 yards and 2 picks.    Cleveland's sole touchdown came on the ground with "

With Green out, all Dalton had to work with was Sanu, who stepped up with 5 grabs for 125 yards, though he was responsible for the interception. On the bright side, he also made an amazing, 1.handed catch. Dalton will need A.J. Green to return soon, as he had to rely on Greg Mr. Dependable Little to be his second receiver.
