   "comment":"James Jones didn't do much (2-55).    Mike McCarthy made a couple of questionable decisions in this contest. He tried a fake punt in the third quarter just over midfield that failed by about a yard. That wasn't too terrible, but with that attempt in mind, I had to wonder why he didn't go for it on 4.h-and-inches on his own 29 with 8:30 remaining, down 2 touchdowns. Lacy probably could've easily converted, but the Packers chose to punt instead, allowing the Giants to take a big chunk of the clock on the ensuing possession.   "

   "comment":"James Jones dropped touchdown in the first quarter - though it should be noted that Xavier Rhodes made a good break-up - but that was the only thing Tolzien could possibly point to if he wants to blame something else for his struggles. He was very ineffective in this contest against an awful Minnesota defense.    Flynn may have been on the field, but Eddie Lacy was the 1 who sparked Green Bay's offense in the 4.h quarter. The noodle-armed Flynn opted to check the ball down to Lacy much more frequently than Tolzien, and the results were tremendous. Lacy caught 6 balls for 48 receiving yards to go along with his 110 rushing yards and touchdown. Those numbers don't tell the whole story though, as Lacy ran extremely violently. In fact, 1 of the FOX announcers exclaimed, He's throwing Vikings defenders all over the place!    Four Packers had more than 3 catches. I already mentioned Lacy. The others were James Jones (7-80), Jarrett Boykin (5-60, TD) and Jordy Nelson (4-58)."

   "comment":"James Jones made a brilliant 16-yard reception. - Matthew Stafford was strip-sixed when Nick Perry beat Riley Reiff. - Stafford was picked off by Tramon Williams in Green Bay territory. As Stafford and company walked off the field, the crowd booed furiously. At that point in the game, the Packers were up 10-3 despite not doing anything on offense. Had they maintained any sort of competent scoring attack, they probably would've beaten the mistake-prone Lions. But Matt Flynn was the quarterback, so Green Bay ultimately had no chance. This game was so lopsided that by the time Detroit made this a 40-10 affair, it had outgained the Packers, 563-56. That's just mind-boggling. As a reference, no team since 1989 (as far back as my data goes) has outgained its opponent by 507 yards or more. Green Bay secured some garbage yardage to keep itself from setting a dubious historical mark.    After some early mistakes, Stafford was pretty sharp. He went 22-of-35 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns, 2 picks and the lost fumble. His completion percentage should have been even better; he endured a handful of drops from his receivers, 2 of which were Calvin Johnson's fault.    Speaking of Megatron, he caught 6 balls for 101 yards and 1 of Stafford's 3 scores. The others were secured by Kevin Ogletree and Jeremy Ross.    Both Detroit running backs found the end zone as well. Bush atoned for the lost fumble, compiling 117 rushing yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to go along with 5 catches for 65 receiving yards. Joique Bell, meanwhile, gained 94 yards and a score on the ground on 19 attempts.    The Lions made some mistakes after their initial blunders. Stafford tossed that second pick - an end-zone shot in which Sam Shields covered Megatron extremely well - while Martin placed a second kickoff out of bounds. David Akers also inexplicably whiffed on a 31-yard field goal at the end of the first half. Again, these errors didn't matter because Green Bay's offense couldn't do anything. Flynn was awful. He went 10-of-20 for 139 yards and an interception, but that doesn't tell the whole story. He had another pick dropped and lost 2 fumbles. He also took a safety in the third quarter. I must note that Flynn had no chance. Detroit's monstrous defensive front dominated Green Bay's offensive line. Flynn was sacked 7 times through 3 quarters, including the safety by Ndamukong Suh, who had a very strong outing. Ezekiel Ansah was also great, mustering 2 sacks in the first half. It didn't help that center Evan Dietrich-Smith left the game in the second quarter, but Green Bay couldn't block the Lions even when he was in the lineup. The Packers couldn't get anything going on the ground either. Eddie Lacy had zero running lanes, as he was able to generate just 16 yards on 10 carries. He also had just 2 catches for 23 receiving yards. He dropped a screen pass, though the game was out of hand at that point.    James Jones led the Packers in receiving with 3 catches for 79 yards, though his long gain (56 yards) came at the very end in garbage time. "

However, he didn't run as well as expected, given the matchup. He managed just 65 yards on 20 carries to go along with 3 catches for 25 receiving yards. The issue was the Falcons, like the Lions, stacked the line of scrimmage and dared Flynn to throw. Flynn made them pay.    There are some new defensive concerns for the Packers. A couple of inside linebackers sustained injuries in this contest. As if things couldn't get any worse for Green Bay's stop unit.    As for Ryan, he struggled in the second half, going 11-of-22 for just 121 yards and a pick following the break, though that interception was a desperation heave at the end of the game. His supporting cast let him down (6 drops), including Tony Gonzalez (3-25, TD) who had a huge 4.h-down drop on the penultimate drive of the game. Ryan's scores went to Gonzalez and "

   "comment":"James Jones for a touchdown. A bit later, Carr fumbled the snap, giving the Chiefs a short field, which allowed Alex Smith to find Travis Kelce for 6. A 70-yard score from Knile Davis later, and Kansas City suddenly found itself way in front of its divisional rival. The numbers say Smith had a strong performance, but that's far from the case. He finished 18-of-30 for 297 yards and 2 touchdowns, but 70 of those yards came on a short toss to Davis, who zoomed past the gassed Raiders and went the distance. Smith's other score, as mentioned, came off a Carr turnover. He otherwise didn't do much, outside of a nice, 48-yard completion to someone named Albert Wilson. Smith had an opportunity for another touchdown, but completely missed Dwayne Bowe in the red zone during the 2-minute drill.    Kelce was the only Chief who produced well from a fantasy perspective. In addition to his touchdown, he caught 5 of his 6 targets for 59 yards. Bowe and Wilson both reeled in 3 balls for an equal 69 yards. They would've tied for the Chiefs' team lead in receiving yards if it wasn't for Davis' 70-yard scamper.    Jamaal Charles hurt his fantasy owners, as Andy Reid, once again, inexplicably refused to run the ball. Charles gained 52 yards on just 12 carries. He was knocked out of the game with a head injury - he was cleared of a concussion - but that was at the end of the third quarter, so he still didn't see enough opportunities. I have no idea why Reid refuses to give his best player enough touches. It can't even be argued that he's saving him for the playoffs because there's no guarantee that Kansas City will even be there, given the frantic race for the AFC wild-card spots.    Speaking of not running the ball enough, the Raiders were guilty of that as well. At 1 point in the second quarter, Carr had 12 attempts compared to 5 runs from Latavius Murray, who tallied 40 yards on those attempts. Murray ultimately finished with just 59 yards on 12 attempts, as the Raiders did a poor job of taking advantage of Kansas City's league-worst run defense.    Carr had a terrible performance. His final numbers don't look that bad - 27-of-56, 222 yards, 1 touchdown - but those stats are strengthened by garbage time. Carr was just 12-of-25 for 81 yards heading into halftime. He was constantly under pressure, but struggled with accuracy while this game was still in doubt. He was extremely lucky to get away with several potential interceptions.    Carr's sole score was thrown to James Jones (8-57) at the very end of the game. "

   "comment":"James Jones made an amazing catch on a beautiful 38-yard throw from Rodgers. Jones stretched out to snatch the pass while tapping his feet in bounds despite good coverage. After a holding penalty, Rodgers took off on a 17-yard run to the 1-yard line to set up a third-and-goal. John Kuhn vultured the touchdown away from Eddie Lacy and Rodgers, but Green Bay went up 14-3. Rodgers expanded the Packers' lead with a field goal drive. The Packers' defense continued to dominate as they were constantly harassing and sacking Kaepernick. He heaved a desperation bomb that was picked off by Sam Shields. Kaepernick threw his best pass of the game for a 47-yard completion to Torrey Smith, but on a 4.h-and-5, Kaepernick was sacked by Mike Neal to finish off San Francisco.    Aaron Rodgers completed 22-of-32 passes for 224 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 33 yards. He played well, but he had trouble sustaining some drives because his offensive line surrendered lots of pressures and 3 sacks.    Randall Cobb had 5 receptions for 44 yards, while Richard Rodgers (5-45) and James Jones (5-98) contributed. Eddie Lacy totaled 90 yards on 18 carries. He ran well for Green Bay.    Colin Kaepernick was 13-of-25 for 160 yards with an interception. He ran for 57 yards on 10 carries, but Kaepernick's regression is in full-blown crisis mode for San Francisco.    "

The final drive stalled. As you can see, the Packers absolutely wrecked themselves with mental errors. They managed to outgain the Bears, 365-290, but no team could've overcame all of those horrible mistakes. So, what can the Packers do to improve this? I'm not sure there are any clear answers besides removing Adams from the lineup. He is absolute trash. He saw a team-high 11 targets, but caught only TWO passes for 14 yards. That's ridiculous! He might just be the least-efficient receiver in the NFL, taking that distinction from "
