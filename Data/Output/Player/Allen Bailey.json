   "comment":"Allen Bailey, Justin Houston and Tamba Hali were excellent for Kansas City. Both teams' offensive lines played ugly football, but Miami's ended up being worse.    After snoozing through the first quarter, Miami started to move the chains, as Ryan Tannehill hit consecutive passes to Mike Wallace (5-74) for 45 yards, but the drive was stifled and Caleb Sturgis missed a field goal. Kansas City then finally started to advance the sticks, and Knile Davis punched the ball into the end zone on a 21-yard run. An Alex Smith 26-yard pass to Joe McKnight and some runs by Davis set up a short dump-off pass from Smith to Travis Kelce (3-36), and the big tight end rumbled into the end zone from 20 yards out. Tannehill then led a drive inside the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but because of the clock, the Dolphins settled for a 22-yard field goal to get on the board for a 14-3 score at the half. In the third quarter, the Chiefs allowed their 4.h sack of the afternoon as Jared Odrick stripped Smith of the ball, which was recovered by Derrick Shelby. That set up the Dolphins at the Kansas City 20-yard line. A few plays later, Tannehill hit Brian Hartline (3-25) for a 1-yard touchdown pass. The Chiefs answered with a pretty drive. Smith and Davis had good runs with McKnight making 2 big catches, including an 11-yard touchdown. After some ugly plays earlier in the game, Jarvis Landry redeemed himself with a 73-yard kickoff return. Caleb Sturgis then drilled a 51-yard field goal after Miami couldn't move the ball. Randy Starks and Jelani Jenkins combined to sack Smith for a safety, but after that, it was all Kansas City. The Chiefs' defense held up thanks to some sacks of Tannehill, and Frankie Hammond had a 47-yard punt return. Davis ran it down Miami's throat, and McKnight caught another short touchdown. After Kansas City's defense had a great series, Knile Davis fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Brent Grimes. However, the Chiefs' defense shut the door, and running back Cyrus Gray (4-18) added a touchdown in garbage time.    Smith finished 19-of-25 for 186 yards with 3 touchdowns. Davis (32-132) and Joe McKnight (6-64) were the difference-makers for the Kansas City offense. Former No. 1-overall pick Eric Fisher had some bad plays in pass protection, but he progressively did better in run blocking as the game wore on.    Tannehill was 21-of-43 for 205 yards with a touchdown. Lamar Miller ran well for the Dolphins with 108 yards on only 15 carries. Joe Philbin let his team down by not calling more running plays for Miller and letting Tannehill drop back to pass far too often behind his weak offensive line.    Dontari Poe was awesome for the Chiefs, recording 1.5 sacks, 4 tackles, batting a pass and drawing a holding penalty. Hali and Houston (1 sack each) were very good. Allen Bailey, Dee Ford and cornerback Chris Owens also stood out for Kansas City.Bailey, Justin Houston and Tamba Hali were excellent for Kansas City.
