   "comment":"Reed pick-six. Don't get down on Kolb just yet. He had no reps during practice, so he wasn't prepared to battle a stout Baltimore defense. We'll get a better idea of Kolb's career prospects based on next week's performance, though Kolb will never have a real chance as long as Reid is calling nonsensical plays for him. The aforementioned Reed pick-six was a 108-yard return - the longest interception touchdown in NFL history. That play came on second-and-goal at the 1.inch line. So, instead of trying to sneak it in, Reid asked his rookie signal caller to drop back 7 yards in the pocket. The Eagles have been inept in short-yardage situations, but this is a completely different story. Earlier in the game, the Eagles launched a pair of Hail Marys instead of trying to run the ball or sneak to move the chains. On the first drive, the Eagles had a delay of game in the no-huddle. I repeat: They had a delay of game in the no-huddle! How does that happen!? Reid's grandchildren will live in shame in the wake of his play-calling in this game.    The other young quarterback in this game, "

Basically, if Flacco's name was Tim Tebow, ESPN buffoons like Bomani Jones, Merril Hoge and Cris Carter would be calling him the worst quarterback of all time after this performance. The difference between Flacco and Tebow though is that the Baltimore quarterback did have time to throw on some occasions, so his performance has to be more discouraging to Raven fans than what Denver supporters feel about their signal-caller. - It doesn't help that Flacco once again had awful play-calling. Cam Cameron idiotically forgot to involve Ray Rice early on. Rice finished with 21 carries, gaining 60 rushing yards in the process, but had just 4 catches. Even worse, Cameron was guilty of some really predictable play-calling at the goal line in the 4.h quarter. He did a good job with this in the first quarter, signaling in a play-action pass from Flacco to Kris Wilson, which resulted in a touchdown, so I don't understand why Cameron went back to stupidity when he could have sealed the deal. No, wait. I do understand what happened. Cameron is just that completely inept. - What happened to Baltimore's run defense? I figured it would be better with Ray Lewis healthy, but Arian Foster managed to rush for 132 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. This made things easier for T.J. Yates. Of course, Yates' turnovers made things easier for the Ravens. Yates went 17-of-35 for 184 yards and 3 interceptions. He could have been picked off on 5 occasions, but Ed Reed dropped 2 interceptions in the first half. Yates' problem wasn't accuracy; in fact, most of his throws were on the money. The issue was that he predetermined where he wanted to go on some of his attempts. He stared down "
