He finished 18-of-32 for 197 yards and 3 scores, as he showed pretty decent arm strength, which was not expected at all, given that he went undrafted because of a lacking arm. McGloin's 3 touchdowns all went to different players: "

The fifth turnover was a lost fumble on a strip-sack. My bad. This game was just ridiculous. When the Raiders had the ball, McGloin tried his best to sabotage his career, hurling hideous pick after hideous pick. When the Chiefs took over on short fields, they scored via Charles screens. It was unbelievable. The Chiefs continuously ran the same play over and over, yet Oakland's inept defensive coordinator was simply unprepared for it. Even on a third-and-19 in the first quarter, the Raiders decided to blitz like idiots, as if "

One wouldn't have thought that this game would throw the entire AFC playoff picture into a huge upheaval, but that was the case as MVP candidate Derek Carr suffered a nasty looking leg injury in the 4.h quarter. The Raiders were up 33-14 at the time of Carr getting his right leg turned and rolled up on by Colts edge rusher Trent Cole. Carr limped off while not putting any weight on the leg and then was carted into the locker room. He was diagnosed with a fractured fibula, so Oakland will have to count on Matt McGloin moving forward. For the Colts, this loss put a nail in the coffin to their slim playoff hopes.    In the first quarter, the Raiders snuffed out a fake field goal to take away points from the Colts. That stop went nowhere before a punt, but Oakland was set up near midfield after "
