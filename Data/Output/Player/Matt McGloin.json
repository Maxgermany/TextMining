He finished 18-of-32 for 197 yards and 3 scores, as he showed pretty decent arm strength, which was not expected at all, given that he went undrafted because of a lacking arm. McGloin's 3 touchdowns all went to different players: "

The fifth turnover was a lost fumble on a strip-sack. My bad. This game was just ridiculous. When the Raiders had the ball, McGloin tried his best to sabotage his career, hurling hideous pick after hideous pick. When the Chiefs took over on short fields, they scored via Charles screens. It was unbelievable. The Chiefs continuously ran the same play over and over, yet Oakland's inept defensive coordinator was simply unprepared for it. Even on a third-and-19 in the first quarter, the Raiders decided to blitz like idiots, as if "
