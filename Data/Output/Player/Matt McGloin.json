   "comment":"McGloin? But as odd as it sounds, the quarterback position was the least of either team's issues in this contest. The main reason Oakland lost this game was because Sebastian Janikowski whiffed on 2 field goals from 32 and 48 yards. Janikowski is highly paid and should be able to convert these sorts of kicks, but he cost his team a victory with these misses. The Titans, meanwhile, had issues with drops in the early going. They were guilty of 3 in the first half. Delanie Walker (5-46) had 1. while Kenny Britt let 2 balls fall through his hands. I have no idea why Britt's still even on the field. Even 1 of the CBS announcers called Britt a waste of talent. Despite Tennessee's drops, Fitzpatrick let the ball hit the ground only 12 times, finishing 30-of-42 for 320 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He also rushed for 26 yards on 5 scrambles. Fitzpatrick was especially effective in the second half, going 16-of-21 for 185 yards and his 2 scores after intermission.    Fitzpatrick's touchdowns were thrown to Justin Hunter (6-109) and Kendall Wright (6-103). It was nice to see Hunter break out, as the second-round rookie hadn't logged more than 2 receptions in any game before this 1. Wright's afternoon as highlighted by a great catch on a pass thrown way behind him in the red zone.    Chris Johnson couldn't find much running room, gaining just 3.7 yards per carry. He had 73 yards on 20 attempts. He also caught 3 passes, but couldn't get anything out of those, mustering just 8 receiving yards.    As for McGloin, the undrafted Penn State rookie went 19-of-32 for 260 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He had an issue with his throws being batted down at the line of scrimmage - this happened 4 times in the first half - but he made some very impressive passes. One that stood out was a throw that he gunned toward "

   "comment":"McGloin stepped in, the Raiders didn't have much of a chance. Of course, it didn't matter much because the Raiders couldn't stop anything Cincinnati was doing offensively. The star for the Bengals was Tyler Eifert, who was a welcome sight for Dalton after being out all last year. Eifert tallied 9 catches for 104 yards and 2 touchdowns. Because of Dalton's limitations, Eifert is going to be targeted heavily this season. Meanwhile, Green (5-63), could've enjoyed a better afternoon, but dropped a score.    Jeremy Hill found the end zone twice. He gained 63 yards on 19 carries, but wasn't used much late in the game when it was out of hand. Giovani Bernard (8-63) handled the workload once this was out of reach for the Raiders. Hill is going to have a huge season.    The Raiders, meanwhile, got some decent running out of Latavius Murray. The problem is that he couldn't carry the ball enough because the Bengals led throughout. Murray gained 44 yards on 11 attempts. Perhaps more impressively, he caught 7 balls for 36 receiving yards. He can be targeted for a trade from a fantasy owner who isn't really paying attention very much.    Cooper led Oakland in receiving, but managed 5 catches for just 47 yards. He was guilty of a drop early on, but Carr's inaccuracy and McGloin's incompetence ruined his afternoon. It's going to be a rough rookie campaign for Cooper until Carr gets his act together, perhaps in the second half of the season. Don't trade him yet; he'll get better as the year progresses.    A quick note on McGloin: His numbers don't look awful (23-of-31, 142 yards, 2 touchdowns, interception) because of the dual scores, but those came very late in garbage time. The Bengals were up 33-0 entering the 4.h quarter.   "

   "comment":"McGloin as your quarterback. Yes, the football gods are cruel, but I can sympathize, given that I lost like a billion units in Week 16.       One wouldn't have thought that this game would throw the entire AFC playoff picture into a huge upheaval, but that was the case as MVP candidate Derek Carr suffered a nasty looking leg injury in the 4.h quarter. The Raiders were up 33-14 at the time of Carr getting his right leg turned and rolled up on by Colts edge rusher Trent Cole. Carr limped off while not putting any weight on the leg and then was carted into the locker room. He was diagnosed with a fractured fibula, so Oakland will have to count on Matt McGloin moving forward. For the Colts, this loss put a nail in the coffin to their slim playoff hopes.    In the first quarter, the Raiders snuffed out a fake field goal to take away points from the Colts. That stop went nowhere before a punt, but Oakland was set up near midfield after "
