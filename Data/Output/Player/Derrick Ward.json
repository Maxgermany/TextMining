   "comment":"Derrick Ward (4). Williams' touches went for 56 yards. Ward helped with the passing attack, coming up with 3 grabs for 54 yards and a score.    This truly was a throwback day in Tampa. An old rivalry in the Bay of Pigs was revived. The Buccaneers wore their old creamsicle uniforms. And as mentioned, Green looked great, even ripping off a 26-yard scamper on 1 occasion. In this contest, Green became the Packers' all-time leading rusher. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Derrick Ward rushing touchdown. Collins then fumbled the snap on the initial play of the third drive, allowing Houston to find the end zone yet again (Ben Tate run). Now down 17-0, the Colts really needed to put a nice drive together and score at least a field goal to give themselves a chance. Collins moved the team to midfield and things were looking good until starting guard Joe Reitz committed a 15-yard face mask penalty. The infraction killed the drive and Indianapolis kicked the ball away, allowing Houston to score another touchdown. Game over.    In total, Collins lost 3 fumbles. You really have to wonder why the Colts didn't just start Curtis Finger Painter. I'm not sure it would have made a difference in the outcome, but at least Painter is familiar with Jeff Saturday and the receivers. Maybe this game would have been closer.    Reggie Wayne was the only Colt unaffected by Collins' presence. He caught 7 passes for 106 yards and a very impressive touchdown in which he inexplicably tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of play. He still has it.    As for the team that didn't give up, Ben Tate rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He looked great, as expected. The reason I had him so low in my Week 1 Fantasy Football Rankings was because I wasn't sure what Gary Kubiak would do with his running backs. Tate was amazing, but Derrick Ward (11-39, TD) was the 1 who started and scored the first touchdown. The 2 backs split carries evenly until Ward left with a minor injury. Tate drew heavy praise from Kubiak, so he'll probably be the main guy if Arian Foster misses Week 2.    "
