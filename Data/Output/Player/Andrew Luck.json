Luck responded with a strong showing in the first home start of his career. Luck went 20-of-31 for 224 yards and 2 touchdowns, abusing Minnesota's miserable secondary. He was on fire in the first half - he tallied 146 yards by intermission - but the Colts went conservative because they had a lead, though several overthrows after intermission didn't help.

   "comment":"Luck has been the primary reason why the Colts are in prime position for a playoff berth. Well, Luck wasn't at his best in this contest, but Indianapolis still prevailed because his teammates stepped up. Rookie receiver TY Hilton keeps improving every week. Though he caught only 3 passes, he was instrumental in this victory because he scored once as a receiver and on another occasion as a punt-returner. Hilton actually became the first player in franchise history to find the end zone in both situations in the same game. The defense was also great, especially on third down, holding Buffalo to just 4-of-13 conversions. The Bills were also just 1-of-3 in their red-zone trips. Emerging inside linebacker "

The ball sailed right into the arms of linebacker Will Witherspoon, who took it back for 6. However, replay showed that Luck's knee was down as he heaved the ball.

   "comment":"Luck went 14-of-28 for 191 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't seem very good overall, but he was brilliant on third downs, including a 3rd-and-23 situation where he hit TY Hilton down the seam in between 3 Texans for a 70-yard strike.    Hilton (4-111, TD) and Reggie Wayne (2-21) were the only Colts with more than 2 receptions. Just 6 Indianapolis players caught passes.    Vick Ballard gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. His 1 blunder was a seemingly key drop on a 3rd-and-3. The Colts ran extremely well as a whole, keeping the ball away from Houston for the final 9 minutes of the contest.    The Texans, meanwhile, continue to have issues coming from behind. They were down 14-6 at halftime and consequently couldn't run the ball as much as they wanted to. Matt Schaub had more than double the attempts compared to Arian Foster carries. Schaub went 24-of-36 for 275 yards and a pair of interceptions. One was on an underthrow, while the second came on a heave into the end zone.    Schaub targeted Andre Johnson almost exclusively. Johnson caught 12 balls for 141 yards, whereas no other Texan logged more than 3 receptions. He was mostly brilliant, though he did drop a touchdown.    As mentioned, Foster couldn't run the ball very much. He had just 16 carries for 96 yards and a touchdown. Houston fans have to be very concerned about their team's chances of winning a game in which Foster is unable to run as much as he'd want to.    J.J. Watt, who needed 2.5 sacks to break Michael Strahan's single-season record, didn't add to his total this afternoon. He actually managed to accumulate half a sack on a Luck strip-sack, but the call was overturned by an automatic replay. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Luck and Robert Griffin draw all of the acclaim as the elite quarterbacks from the 2012 NFL Draft class, but Ryan Tannehill would love to make the argument that he belongs in their company. He made a strong case in this contest, out-dueling Luck to improve to 2-0. Tannehill may have gone up against a miserable defense, but he was very sharp. He went 23-of-34 for 319 yards and a touchdown. He was especially accurate after intermission, misfiring on just 3 passes (10-of-13). The 1 blemish is that he fumbled twice, though he only lost 1. NFL.com credited Tannehill with 3 fumbles, but the third was a botched snap.    Making things even better for Tannehill, he won't have to hear "

Most of his production came after halftime, as he let his team down with a first-half drop on third down that would've moved the chains.    Luck, meanwhile, finished 18-of-40 for 271 yards and the 3 scores to Hilton. He was woeful in the first half - he completed just 3 passes - as he had issues getting anything out of the slot position. Pass protection was also an issue; he took 4 sacks and had to scramble around to avoid other hits. There was 1 sequence in which he took consecutive sacks and nearly lost a fumble in the process. He later took a sack in the red zone and then was hit as he threw on the following play. However, things really opened up for him following intermission, with Phillips focusing on managing the game, as mentioned.    Houston's quarterback actually had the superior statistical performance. Keenum's final numbers were 20-of-34 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cris Collinsworth remarked that Keenum reminded him of "

   "comment":"Luck launched an underthrown interception in the end zone. Luck was picked off again on an overthrow shortly afterward. He ultimately finished 29-of-47 for 353 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It's worth noting that 260 of his yards came after halftime when the Rams had already established a 28-0 lead, meaning that most of what he did in this contest was meaningless.    Aside from poor pass protection and a flawed game plan, Luck was hurt by the lack of a running attack. Luck actually led the team in rushing yards with 17. "

He was 11-of-15 for 124 yards and a rushing touchdown afterward (his final numbers were 23-of-36, 232 yards along with 31 rushing yards on 9 scrambles and the score). - Chris Johnson had 80 yards on 13 carries and 2 touchdowns in the first half. He finished with a 17-86-2 line. - The Colts barely ran the ball in the opening 2 quarters, accumulating just 35 yards on the ground. By the time the game was over, Donald Brown notched 80 yards and 2 scores on 14 carries. Trent Richardson, by the way, looked as sluggish as ever, gaining 22 yards on 8 carries to go along with 5 catches for 31 receiving yards. - The Titans had 189 net yards prior to intermission. They had just 71 yards afterward before the aforementioned back-door drive.    Some other numbers: Coby Fleener had a career night, catching 8 balls for 107 yards. T.Y. Hilton had 5 receptions for just 44 yards.    Fitzpatrick, who went 22-of-28 for 222 yards and a touchdown, remarkably threw to just 2 players until he targeted Craig Stevens in the 4.h quarter. Pretty crazy. Those 2 players were Delanie Walker (10-91, TD) and Kendall Wright (9-80). Only 1 other Titan ended up finishing with a reception (Nate Washington, 2-53). Washington and Wright both had crucial drops.    I like to poke fun of Brad Nessler. He's called Greg Little Mr. Dependable and referred Jay Feely as Jim Feely earlier in the season. He called Ryan Fitzpatrick Ryan Fitzgerald but quickly corrected himself. I'd be upset about not being able to make fun of him too much, but official Mike Carey picked up the slack. I thought Carey was corrupt, but the Colts covered, so he might just be terrible. He didn't see a challenge flag in the first quarter. He also made a mistake with the clock, as he advanced the first quarter to the second following a challenge. He also blew a roughing-the-passer penalty, stating that Fitzpatrick suffered a blow to the helmet when it wasn't even close. This was followed up by a weird personal foul penalty on Indianapolis that completely confused Mike Mayock. Carey then botched a Tennessee challenge on a Luck quarterback sneak.   "

   "comment":"Luck did his best to attempt a comeback, but simply didn't get the help from his offensive line. Luck was under siege throughout the afternoon. It was so strange because the Steelers struggled to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks all year. Luck was sacked just twice, but he was hit and pressured countless times. This was quite apparent on the deciding play of the game. Down just 8 points after tailing by 35-10, Luck was backed up near his own goal line. Pittsburgh brought heavy heat, and Luck tripped and fell. He fired a pass from the turf that sailed out of bounds, and he was flagged for an intentional grounding as a consequence. This resulted in a safety, putting the Steelers in control for good. Luck went 26-of-45 for 400 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, 1 of which was a pick-six that was telegraphed. He played mostly well otherwise considering the circumstances. He torched "

   "comment":"Luck must have been envious watching Gray pummel for big yardage, as his big back, Trent Richardson, did nothing. He literally did nothing, as he didn't gain a single yard on 7 carries. Richardson stinks, and the bad news is that the Colts may have to use him going forward; Ahmad Bradshaw, who wasn't much better with 4 yards on his 7 attempts, suffered a lower-leg injury and left the game. Bradshaw really cost his team early by dropping a pass that would've gone for a big gain.    Bradshaw wasn't the only injured player for the Colts, as Dwayne Allen went down early, which was huge because Luck loves to lean on him.

   "comment":"Luck had an extremely difficult time for a couple of reasons. The primary 1 was Cleveland's pass rush, which was unbelievable. I don't know if the Browns were just that good, or if the Colts simply couldn't block - an injury to the center didn't help - but Luck was under siege on almost every single drop-back. As a Luck fantasy owner, it was absurd and frustrating to watch. The pressure forced some mistakes from Luck. Following some incompletions on third down, Luck was guilty of a fumble amid a sack in the end zone. He was then pick-sixed on a pass he heaved with pressure in his face, and that was followed by another interception on a high throw that was tipped. It seemed like the Colts didn't have a chance, down 21-7 with no pass protection, but Luck came through in the end. On the game-winning drive, Luck found "

   "comment":"Luck and company were going to play. It ended up being a half, but it didn't matter because Tennessee was too incompetent to take advantage of the Indianapolis backups. The Colts still sustained some injuries despite being half-safe. Reggie Wayne, who was already nursing a triceps issue, hurt his groin. However, this could actually be a blessing in disguise, as Wayne has been extremely ineffective since getting banged up, so forcing him out of the lineup could be a good thing. A.Q. Shipley also went down with an injury, but he was just a backup prior to this week. He started at left guard for some reason though, so perhaps this ruined some future plan Pagano had for a questionable offensive front.    Andrew Luck went 10-of-16 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns in just 1 half of action, so he could've had a monstrous fantasy performance had this been a regular game. The Titans just had no answer for him, so on top of finding a franchise quarterback - which I have them addressing in my - they need to obtain defensive personnel who can generate a pass rush and also cover on the back end.    Prior to getting hurt, Wayne nearly scored on an 80-yard pass, as he was tackled just short of the goal line. The play featured something odd. If you watch the replay, "

   "comment":"Luck engineered an impressive opening touchdown drive, while all Dalton could do throughout the entire afternoon was heave inaccurate passes to his terrible supporting cast. If A.J. Green and Jermaine Gresham being out wasn't enough, the Bengals were hurt by injuries to 2 of their key defenders, Rey Maualuga and Dre Kirkpatrick. Maualuga was carted into the locker room in the second quarter, while Kirkpatrick got hurt right after halftime. The Bengals had limited Indianapolis to just 13 points in the opening half, but missing Maualuga and Kirkpatrick proved to be too much, as Luck moved the chains effortlessly following the break. Indianapolis generated 482 net yards of offense, moving the chains 22 times, and they would've won by much more if it wasn't for some miscues in the red zone.    Luck finished 31-of-44 for 376 yards and a touchdown. Despite the early scoring drive, Luck had issues connecting with "

   "comment":"Luck, who dissected Denver throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, the Broncos couldn't do anything offensively following the initial possession. Peyton Manning had yet another epic playoff choke job, as he spent the entire contest overthrowing players and heaving weak-armed throws. No 1 in the media wanted to mention it because they feared offending Manning, but the future Hall of Fame quarterback had a decaying arm down the stretch, beginning with the second half of the Kansas City contest. There was talk that Manning was healthier during the week, but that didn't appear to be the case at all.    I'd like to focus on Luck though, as he is the more significant quarterback in the NFL at this point. Luck, unlike Manning, has proven to be extremely clutch in his young career. He has made so many 4.h-quarter comebacks early on, and that type of play has transitioned to the playoffs. He was so sharp in this contest, beating the quarterback he displaced as the starter of the Colts. Luck finished 27-of-43 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The picks were both like punts on third-and-long situations where Luck just tried desperately to make something happen. He also had a 20-yard scramble. Some of Luck's best passes came on third downs. He fired a ball to "

Aqib Talib was flagged for poking a player in the eye, while Von Miller drove his knee into someone's throat. The Colt player was on the ground, yet Miller held his knee of that individual's throat and drove it down, suffocating him. It was a disgusting display, and if Roger Goodell had a soul, he would suspend the Denver linebacker. Speaking of Denver linebackers, DeMarcus Ware left the game early when he aggravated his back injury. He's expected to be out for the next week or 2.    Moving on, Manning's 2 touchdowns went to Owen Daniels (6-102) and Emmanuel Sanders (6-90). Yes, you read that right - Daniels caught 6 passes for 102 yards. Vernon Davis saw just 1 target, which he couldn't reel in. Sanders, by the way, dropped a pass.    Demaryius Thomas caught 5 passes for 50 yards. He saw 7 targets, a lesser amount than Sanders and Daniels.    Both C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman received 7 carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 34-1. Anderson was the better runner for the second-straight week, so the Broncos should think about moving back to him as the primary ball-carrier.    As for the winners, Andrew Luck continued his great momentum from his second-half surge at Carolina. Despite losing his offensive coordinator on a short week, Luck went 21-of-36 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 34 rushing yards on 6 scampers. There were reports earlier during the week that he was healthy, and that seemed apparent when he took off on a third-and-10 scramble and dived for the first down. Luck was nearly intercepted twice, but considering the caliber of defense he was battling, he had a terrific showing, and all Indianapolis fans should be optimistic going forward.

Shame on me for doubting Matthew Stafford and his fierce finger-pointing!    This game had shootout written all over it, and a missed extra point almost doomed the Lions, but Detroit had the ball last. With big-armed Matthew Stafford and a plethora of weapons, the papier mache Colts defense didn't stand a chance. Matt Prater redeemed himself, and Detroit escaped Indianapolis with a nice road victory to start the season. Indianapolis' offensive line showed some signs of improvement over last year, but the defense remains a huge liability. Andrew Luck is going to have to win shootouts on a weekly basis this season.    The Lions got on the board first as Stafford led a nice drive with completions to "

Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2.and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as "

   "comment":"Luck got crushed by 3 Raiders, leading to an errant throw that was intercepted by Nate Allen. Pass interference by the Colts near the end zone on a third down during the next drive set up Oakland for points, as Carr took advantage with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Andre Holmes (3-33-1). The Colts answered with a drive into Oakland territory that ended with Donte Moncrief (2-30-1) getting open in busted coverage for a 24-yard touchdown reception. Undaunted, the Raiders answered, as Carr threw a beautiful pass to Michael Crabtree (7-90) for 35 yards into Colts' territory. Clive Walford (2-20-1) caught a short pass a few plays later, and T.J Green missed the tackle to let Walford dart into the end zone for the a 5-yard score. The Colts moved back into Oakland territory, but Pro Bowl safety Reggie Nelson intercepted Luck in the end zone. Carr took advantage by lofting a pass into "

   "comment":"Luck threw a touchdown at the end of regulation to give Indianapolis its 8. victory of the year. Luck, however, did not play well in the early stages of the game. He seemed to panic when he was down 10-0, forcing a pass off his back foot near the red zone. He had accuracy issues throughout the opening half, going 7-of-17 for 88 yards and the pick by intermission. However, he caught fire in the second half. He was 17-of-23 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns after the break, leading a great comeback for the Colts that ultimately concluded with a victory in the final seconds. Luck's final numbers were 25-of-39 for 301 yards and a touchdown. He didn't have Donte Moncrief at his disposal, so he targeted "
