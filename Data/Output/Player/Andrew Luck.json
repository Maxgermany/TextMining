Luck responded with a strong showing in the first home start of his career. Luck went 20-of-31 for 224 yards and 2 touchdowns, abusing Minnesota's miserable secondary. He was on fire in the first half - he tallied 146 yards by intermission - but the Colts went conservative because they had a lead, though several overthrows after intermission didn't help.

   "comment":"Andrew Luck has been the primary reason why the Colts are in prime position for a playoff berth. Well, Luck wasn't at his best in this contest, but Indianapolis still prevailed because his teammates stepped up. Rookie receiver TY Hilton keeps improving every week. Though he caught only 3 passes, he was instrumental in this victory because he scored once as a receiver and on another occasion as a punt-returner. Hilton actually became the first player in franchise history to find the end zone in both situations in the same game. The defense was also great, especially on third down, holding Buffalo to just 4-of-13 conversions. The Bills were also just 1-of-3 in their red-zone trips. Emerging inside linebacker "

He ultimately finished 29-of-47 for 353 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It's worth noting that 260 of his yards came after halftime when the Rams had already established a 28-0 lead, meaning that most of what he did in this contest was meaningless.    Aside from poor pass protection and a flawed game plan, Luck was hurt by the lack of a running attack. Luck actually led the team in rushing yards with 17. "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck, seemed to be headed down that path. Luck tossed 2 early interceptions and had a third when the ball bounced out of his receiver's hands and into safety Husain Abdullah's. The Chiefs were up big - they maintained a 4.touchdown advantage at 1 point - and it appeared as though the Indianapolis faithful would wonder how long they'd have to wait for their new franchise signal-caller to achieve success in the postseason. Well, it wasn't very long. Thanks to a tremendous second-half surge, Luck engineered the second-greatest comeback in NFL history, prevailing even though his team was down 38-10 at some point. Luck was just unbelievable after intermission. Following a pick immediately after the break, also made by Abdullah, Luck was 17-of-23 for 314 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 1 interception that wasn't his fault in the second half. Kansas City simply had no answer for him.    Of course, the Chiefs had their own issues. They lost cornerback Brandon Flowers to a concussion and also saw outside linebacker Justin Houston get banged up. And that was just a fraction of the injuries they incurred. The rest came on offense, with disaster immediately striking when Jamaal Charles exited with a concussion of his own on the very first drive. Charles' absence didn't actually harm Kansas City's offense very much in the early going, as the team didn't even punt until the 5:58 mark of the third quarter. However, the injuries just kept piling up. Donnie Avery and Junior Hemingway both got hurt, but the major issue following Charles' concussion was Knile Davis' knee. Davis proved to be a solid replacement for Charles, but the Chiefs had nothing behind him. Someone named Cyrus Gray took the field after that and offered Kansas City nothing out of the backfield.    Despite all of these injuries, Alex Smith played to the best of his ability. He went 30-of-46 for 378 yards and 4 touchdowns. He didn't throw an interception either, but he made a couple of mistakes late. It started when he was strip-sacked by Robert Mathis, which set up an Indianapolis touchdown. Smith then missed an open Gray for a touchdown and followed that up with a poor intentional grounding penalty. Smith's touchdowns went to Dwayne Bowe (8-150), Avery (1-79), Davis and Anthony Sherman. Bowe had a gain of 63, thanks to pathetic tackling efforts by "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck did his best to attempt a comeback, but simply didn't get the help from his offensive line. Luck was under siege throughout the afternoon. It was so strange because the Steelers struggled to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks all year. Luck was sacked just twice, but he was hit and pressured countless times. This was quite apparent on the deciding play of the game. Down just 8 points after tailing by 35-10, Luck was backed up near his own goal line. Pittsburgh brought heavy heat, and Luck tripped and fell. He fired a pass from the turf that sailed out of bounds, and he was flagged for an intentional grounding as a consequence. This resulted in a safety, putting the Steelers in control for good. Luck went 26-of-45 for 400 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, 1 of which was a pick-six that was telegraphed. He played mostly well otherwise considering the circumstances. He torched "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck had an extremely difficult time for a couple of reasons. The primary 1 was Cleveland's pass rush, which was unbelievable. I don't know if the Browns were just that good, or if the Colts simply couldn't block - an injury to the center didn't help - but Luck was under siege on almost every single drop-back. As a Luck fantasy owner, it was absurd and frustrating to watch. The pressure forced some mistakes from Luck. Following some incompletions on third down, Luck was guilty of a fumble amid a sack in the end zone. He was then pick-sixed on a pass he heaved with pressure in his face, and that was followed by another interception on a high throw that was tipped. It seemed like the Colts didn't have a chance, down 21-7 with no pass protection, but Luck came through in the end. On the game-winning drive, Luck found "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck and company were going to play. It ended up being a half, but it didn't matter because Tennessee was too incompetent to take advantage of the Indianapolis backups. The Colts still sustained some injuries despite being half-safe. Reggie Wayne, who was already nursing a triceps issue, hurt his groin. However, this could actually be a blessing in disguise, as Wayne has been extremely ineffective since getting banged up, so forcing him out of the lineup could be a good thing. A.Q. Shipley also went down with an injury, but he was just a backup prior to this week. He started at left guard for some reason though, so perhaps this ruined some future plan Pagano had for a questionable offensive front.    Andrew Luck went 10-of-16 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns in just 1 half of action, so he could've had a monstrous fantasy performance had this been a regular game. The Titans just had no answer for him, so on top of finding a franchise quarterback - which I have them addressing in my - they need to obtain defensive personnel who can generate a pass rush and also cover on the back end.    Prior to getting hurt, Wayne nearly scored on an 80-yard pass, as he was tackled just short of the goal line. The play featured something odd. If you watch the replay, "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck.    The Texans needed a win over the Jaguars - with Cleveland beating Baltimore and San Diego losing to Kansas City - to make the playoffs. The Texans and Chiefs did their part, but the Ravens' comeback win sent the Texans home for the winter. Still, Houston improved from 2 wins in 2013 to 9 wins this year while having a rash of injuries at quarterback and dealing with poor play at times from the signal-caller. Bill O'Brien and his coaching staff did a tremendous job and have the Texans going in the right direction.    Houston got the scoring started on its first possession. The Texans had a beautiful drive that started with "

   "comment":"Andrew Luck. It got uglier as the game progressed, with many Broncos showing bad sportsmanship in their first defeat. Aqib Talib was flagged for poking a player in the eye, while Von Miller drove his knee into someone's throat. The Colt player was on the ground, yet Miller held his knee of that individual's throat and drove it down, suffocating him. It was a disgusting display, and if Roger Goodell had a soul, he would suspend the Denver linebacker. Speaking of Denver linebackers, DeMarcus Ware left the game early when he aggravated his back injury. He's expected to be out for the next week or 2.    Moving on, Manning's 2 touchdowns went to Owen Daniels (6-102) and Emmanuel Sanders (6-90). Yes, you read that right - Daniels caught 6 passes for 102 yards. Vernon Davis saw just 1 target, which he couldn't reel in. Sanders, by the way, dropped a pass.    Demaryius Thomas caught 5 passes for 50 yards. He saw 7 targets, a lesser amount than Sanders and Daniels.    Both C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman received 7 carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 34-1. Anderson was the better runner for the second-straight week, so the Broncos should think about moving back to him as the primary ball-carrier.    As for the winners, Andrew Luck continued his great momentum from his second-half surge at Carolina. Despite losing his offensive coordinator on a short week, Luck went 21-of-36 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 34 rushing yards on 6 scampers. There were reports earlier during the week that he was healthy, and that seemed apparent when he took off on a third-and-10 scramble and dived for the first down. Luck was nearly intercepted twice, but considering the caliber of defense he was battling, he had a terrific showing, and all Indianapolis fans should be optimistic going forward.

   "comment":"Andrew Luck had an up-and-down game, going 23-of-36 for 281 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He looked good in the 2-minute drill to close the first half, and also was able to waste some time near the end of regulation with a key third-down conversion. That really helped the Colts to finish strong and win. Luck, however, just was not sharp at times in this contest. He looked nothing like the highly touted, smart quarterback who was a sure-fire success coming out of Stanford. In fact, his football I.Q. was completely lacking. At 1 point, he underthrew Donte Moncrief on a play that could have resulted in a touchdown. It was a throw that the quarterback should have made, and it could have cost the Colts had the Packers completed the comeback. Luck threw 2 early interceptions, and both were avoidable. The first was the worst of the 2. He had a wide-open receiver in space, but instead of throwing a hard pass, he lofted it. That allowed Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to come over and get under the ball. The second pick came on a throw that should never have happened. Luck had quite a bit of time to throw before he was put under pressure. He did not get a pass off until he was getting hit. As a result, he overthrew Jack Doyle on the play and Clinton-Dix again was the beneficiary. Luck would have been better off taking the sack or lofting it out of bounds. He needs to improve his decision-making if he wants to be a truly elite quarterback.    For most of the day, Luck relied on 3 receivers to do a brunt of the work. T.Y. Hilton (6-81) led the team in both catches and yardage. The speedy top option is still not at full health as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Still, his big-play ability makes him a high-upside WR1 week in and week out in fantasy. After Hilton, Jack Doyle (5-61) and Donte Moncrief (3-55, 1 TD) were the major producers. Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9. and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.    In terms of the running game, Frank Gore was surprisingly strong. The Packers boast 1 of the league's best run defenses, but the 12-year veteran was able to do well on Sunday. Gore's numbers do not look great on paper - he had 19 carries for 60 yards - but he was elusive, shifty and able to make plays against Green Bay's defense. Also, Gore had 2 touchdown runs that helped to drive the Colts' offense. The first touchdown was a result of impressive blocking from the line on a pitch play. Gore was able to walk in untouched. On the second, he plowed through the offensive line and some Packers defenders to reach the end zone. It will definitely be interesting to see if Gore continues to be a red-zone threat for Indianapolis, especially given Andrew Luck's trouble with turnovers of late.    The Colts really started the game off on the right foot when "
