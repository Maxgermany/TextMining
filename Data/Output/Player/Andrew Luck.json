Andrew Luck was a beast for the Colts on Sunday and looked like a quarterback who is capable of leading his team to a wild-card berth in the weak AFC. Ryan Tannehill played really well, but wasn't good enough to keep pace with Luck. The rookies started the game on fire as they combined for 431 yards through the air by halftime. Luck kept it going in the second half and set the rookie record for passing yards in a single game.  Tannehill led an early field goal drive and Luck answered. Rookie tight end "

Well, Luck wasn't at his best in this contest, but Indianapolis still prevailed because his teammates stepped up. Rookie receiver TY Hilton keeps improving every week. Though he caught only 3 passes, he was instrumental in this victory because he scored once as a receiver and on another occasion as a punt-returner. Hilton actually became the first player in franchise history to find the end zone in both situations in the same game. The defense was also great, especially on third down, holding Buffalo to just 4-of-13 conversions. The Bills were also just 1-of-3 in their red-zone trips. Emerging inside linebacker "

Hilton (4-111, TD) and Reggie Wayne (2-21) were the only Colts with more than 2 receptions. Just 6 Indianapolis players caught passes.    Vick Ballard gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. His 1 blunder was a seemingly key drop on a 3rd-and-3. The Colts ran extremely well as a whole, keeping the ball away from Houston for the final 9 minutes of the contest.    The Texans, meanwhile, continue to have issues coming from behind. They were down 14-6 at halftime and consequently couldn't run the ball as much as they wanted to. Matt Schaub had more than double the attempts compared to Arian Foster carries. Schaub went 24-of-36 for 275 yards and a pair of interceptions. One was on an underthrow, while the second came on a heave into the end zone.    Schaub targeted Andre Johnson almost exclusively. Johnson caught 12 balls for 141 yards, whereas no other Texan logged more than 3 receptions. He was mostly brilliant, though he did drop a touchdown.    As mentioned, Foster couldn't run the ball very much. He had just 16 carries for 96 yards and a touchdown. Houston fans have to be very concerned about their team's chances of winning a game in which Foster is unable to run as much as he'd want to.    J.J. Watt, who needed 2.5 sacks to break Michael Strahan's single-season record, didn't add to his total this afternoon. He actually managed to accumulate half a sack on a Luck strip-sack, but the call was overturned by an automatic replay.   "

   "comment":"Luck had way more success downfield, torching Houston's secondary with multiple deep bombs to T.Y. Hilton. The second-year wideout had 7 catches for 121 yards and 3 touchdowns. Most of his production came after halftime, as he let his team down with a first-half drop on third down that would've moved the chains.    Luck, meanwhile, finished 18-of-40 for 271 yards and the 3 scores to Hilton. He was woeful in the first half - he completed just 3 passes - as he had issues getting anything out of the slot position. Pass protection was also an issue; he took 4 sacks and had to scramble around to avoid other hits. There was 1 sequence in which he took consecutive sacks and nearly lost a fumble in the process. He later took a sack in the red zone and then was hit as he threw on the following play. However, things really opened up for him following intermission, with Phillips focusing on managing the game, as mentioned.    Houston's quarterback actually had the superior statistical performance. Keenum's final numbers were 20-of-34 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cris Collinsworth remarked that Keenum reminded him of "

He ultimately finished 29-of-47 for 353 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It's worth noting that 260 of his yards came after halftime when the Rams had already established a 28-0 lead, meaning that most of what he did in this contest was meaningless.    Aside from poor pass protection and a flawed game plan, Luck was hurt by the lack of a running attack. Luck actually led the team in rushing yards with 17. "

He was 11-of-15 for 124 yards and a rushing touchdown afterward (his final numbers were 23-of-36, 232 yards along with 31 rushing yards on 9 scrambles and the score). - Chris Johnson had 80 yards on 13 carries and 2 touchdowns in the first half. He finished with a 17-86-2 line. - The Colts barely ran the ball in the opening 2 quarters, accumulating just 35 yards on the ground. By the time the game was over, Donald Brown notched 80 yards and 2 scores on 14 carries. Trent Richardson, by the way, looked as sluggish as ever, gaining 22 yards on 8 carries to go along with 5 catches for 31 receiving yards. - The Titans had 189 net yards prior to intermission. They had just 71 yards afterward before the aforementioned back-door drive.    Some other numbers: Coby Fleener had a career night, catching 8 balls for 107 yards. T.Y. Hilton had 5 receptions for just 44 yards.    Fitzpatrick, who went 22-of-28 for 222 yards and a touchdown, remarkably threw to just 2 players until he targeted Craig Stevens in the 4.h quarter. Pretty crazy. Those 2 players were Delanie Walker (10-91, TD) and Kendall Wright (9-80). Only 1 other Titan ended up finishing with a reception (Nate Washington, 2-53). Washington and Wright both had crucial drops.    I like to poke fun of Brad Nessler. He's called Greg Little Mr. Dependable and referred Jay Feely as Jim Feely earlier in the season. He called Ryan Fitzpatrick Ryan Fitzgerald but quickly corrected himself. I'd be upset about not being able to make fun of him too much, but official Mike Carey picked up the slack. I thought Carey was corrupt, but the Colts covered, so he might just be terrible. He didn't see a challenge flag in the first quarter. He also made a mistake with the clock, as he advanced the first quarter to the second following a challenge. He also blew a roughing-the-passer penalty, stating that Fitzpatrick suffered a blow to the helmet when it wasn't even close. This was followed up by a weird personal foul penalty on Indianapolis that completely confused Mike Mayock. Carey then botched a Tennessee challenge on a Luck quarterback sneak.   "

It was so strange because the Steelers struggled to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks all year. Luck was sacked just twice, but he was hit and pressured countless times.

This resulted in a safety, putting the Steelers in control for good. Luck went 26-of-45 for 400 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, 1 of which was a pick-six that was telegraphed. He played mostly well otherwise considering the circumstances. He torched "

   "comment":"Luck must have been envious watching Gray pummel for big yardage, as his big back, Trent Richardson, did nothing. He literally did nothing, as he didn't gain a single yard on 7 carries. Richardson stinks, and the bad news is that the Colts may have to use him going forward; Ahmad Bradshaw, who wasn't much better with 4 yards on his 7 attempts, suffered a lower-leg injury and left the game. Bradshaw really cost his team early by dropping a pass that would've gone for a big gain.    Bradshaw wasn't the only injured player for the Colts, as Dwayne Allen went down early, which was huge because Luck loves to lean on him. Luck went 23-of-39 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception - impressive numbers considering that a stalwart Patriot defense stymied "

I don't know if the Browns were just that good, or if the Colts simply couldn't block - an injury to the center didn't help - but Luck was under siege on almost every single drop-back. As a Luck fantasy owner, it was absurd and frustrating to watch. The pressure forced some mistakes from Luck. Following some incompletions on third down, Luck was guilty of a fumble amid a sack in the end zone. He was then pick-sixed on a pass he heaved with pressure in his face, and that was followed by another interception on a high throw that was tipped. It seemed like the Colts didn't have a chance, down 21-7 with no pass protection, but Luck came through in the end. On the game-winning drive, Luck found "

   "comment":"Luck and company were going to play. It ended up being a half, but it didn't matter because Tennessee was too incompetent to take advantage of the Indianapolis backups. The Colts still sustained some injuries despite being half-safe. Reggie Wayne, who was already nursing a triceps issue, hurt his groin. However, this could actually be a blessing in disguise, as Wayne has been extremely ineffective since getting banged up, so forcing him out of the lineup could be a good thing. A.Q. Shipley also went down with an injury, but he was just a backup prior to this week. He started at left guard for some reason though, so perhaps this ruined some future plan Pagano had for a questionable offensive front.    Andrew Luck went 10-of-16 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns in just 1 half of action, so he could've had a monstrous fantasy performance had this been a regular game. The Titans just had no answer for him, so on top of finding a franchise quarterback - which I have them addressing in my 2015 NFL Mock Draft - they need to obtain defensive personnel who can generate a pass rush and also cover on the back end.    Prior to getting hurt, Wayne nearly scored on an 80-yard pass, as he was tackled just short of the goal line. The play featured something odd. If you watch the replay, "

   "comment":"Luck engineered an impressive opening touchdown drive, while all Dalton could do throughout the entire afternoon was heave inaccurate passes to his terrible supporting cast. If A.J. Green and Jermaine Gresham being out wasn't enough, the Bengals were hurt by injuries to 2 of their key defenders, Rey Maualuga and Dre Kirkpatrick. Maualuga was carted into the locker room in the second quarter, while Kirkpatrick got hurt right after halftime. The Bengals had limited Indianapolis to just 13 points in the opening half, but missing Maualuga and Kirkpatrick proved to be too much, as Luck moved the chains effortlessly following the break. Indianapolis generated 482 net yards of offense, moving the chains 22 times, and they would've won by much more if it wasn't for some miscues in the red zone.    Luck finished 31-of-44 for 376 yards and a touchdown. Despite the early scoring drive, Luck had issues connecting with "

   "comment":"Luck, who dissected Denver throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, the Broncos couldn't do anything offensively following the initial possession. Peyton Manning had yet another epic playoff choke job, as he spent the entire contest overthrowing players and heaving weak-armed throws. No 1 in the media wanted to mention it because they feared offending Manning, but the future Hall of Fame quarterback had a decaying arm down the stretch, beginning with the second half of the Kansas City contest. There was talk that Manning was healthier during the week, but that didn't appear to be the case at all.    I'd like to focus on Luck though, as he is the more significant quarterback in the NFL at this point. Luck, unlike Manning, has proven to be extremely clutch in his young career. He has made so many 4.h-quarter comebacks early on, and that type of play has transitioned to the playoffs. He was so sharp in this contest, beating the quarterback he displaced as the starter of the Colts. Luck finished 27-of-43 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The picks were both like punts on third-and-long situations where Luck just tried desperately to make something happen. He also had a 20-yard scramble. Some of Luck's best passes came on third downs. He fired a ball to "

Shame on me for doubting Matthew Stafford and his fierce finger-pointing!    This game had shootout written all over it, and a missed extra point almost doomed the Lions, but Detroit had the ball last. With big-armed Matthew Stafford and a plethora of weapons, the papier mache Colts defense didn't stand a chance. Matt Prater redeemed himself, and Detroit escaped Indianapolis with a nice road victory to start the season. Indianapolis' offensive line showed some signs of improvement over last year, but the defense remains a huge liability. Andrew Luck is going to have to win shootouts on a weekly basis this season.    The Lions got on the board first as Stafford led a nice drive with completions to "

   "comment":"Luck getting hot, it almost seemed likely that Indianapolis was going to prevail.    This was essentially a playoff elimination game, and the Colts are very likely to be watching football in January because of this loss. The old adage of a good defense and a running game leading to wins was proven true; the Texans' defense forced 3 turnovers to keep the Colts under 20 points, while Houston's rushing offense was excellent, totaling 185 yards to move the ball enough for a field-goal offense to get the job done. By virtue of winning this game, the Texans swept the Colts to basically advance to be in a 2.team race for the AFC South with the Tennessee Titans.    Luck converted a third down on his first drive with a 31-yard zone read run. He connected with "
