   "comment":"Charcandrick West saw 3 goal-line attempts, but was able to get in for his first touchdown of his career and the first rushing touchdown the Steelers had allowed this season. West had a bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but overall played a nice game, rushing for 110 yards on 22 carries for 5 yards per attempt.

West's touchdown was then matched when Jones hit Bryant again, but this time for a 19-yard touchdown, bringing the Steelers within 6 points just before the third quarter ended. Bryant now has 3 touchdown receptions in his first 2 games back and amazingly, Bryant caught all of those touchdown passes from Landry Jones. When Ben Roethlisberger returns, this offense could be special.    The Steelers then made another push, aided by "

It was an impressive performance from the young running back, who also led the team in rushing with 58 yards on 16 carries. He did a good job of filling in for the injured Spencer Ware.    One of the biggest plays of the game for the Chiefs came on a punt return. Hill fielded the ball at his own 5-yard line. Hill decided to bring the ball out, and he got some strong blocks as the play developed. He made it down the sideline and scampered to the end zone for the 95-yard score. That gave the Chiefs a 34-17 lead, and really helped to cement their lead.    For the Chargers, this loss was not all too surprising. The team came limping into the final game, dealing with countless injuries. Because of this, their team struggled to keep pace with the Chiefs. "

   "comment":"Charcandrick West than Hunt, but West suffered a possible concussion and wasn't available, so Hunt took over as the primary receiving back and caught 5-of-6 targets for 89 yards to help bring his team back. The rookie was stifled on the ground, but ran hard and should continue to be a strong performer moving forward. In the end, it was an untackle-able Bell and a heads-up play by Brown that led the scoring, but the Steelers' defense deserves a big chunk of the credit for this win. Roethlisberger was again not at his best, but was much better than last week and showed signs of his old self at times.    Smith played 1 of his worst games of the season, but still gave his team a chance to win. I don't think you can knock him and this team too far down the power rankings, as the Steelers have always played well at Arrowhead and were highly motivated after an embarrassing loss.    The Chiefs have a short turnaround, as they play the Raiders on Thursday night, which may make it tough for both Tyreek Hill and Charcandrick West to be cleared to play after suffering concussions in this game.    The Steelers return home to face their division rival the Cincinnati Bengals, who should be an easier opponent than Kansas City, but a division rival after a big win isn't the best recipe for a top-notch game. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
