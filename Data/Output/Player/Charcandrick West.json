   "comment":"West fumble on Kansas City's penultimate drive, and Alex Smith went 4-and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision. Bridgewater looked good overall, but he'll need to clean up these sloppy errors when he starts playing better opponents.    It was odd to see Adrian Peterson struggle so much. The Chiefs had a terrific performance from Jaye Howard again, who helped clog the trenches. Peterson, as a result, was limited to 60 yards on 26 carries, and much of that came on a 23-yard burst. Peterson just didn't have any room to run. For instance, on 1 play, he was forced into foolishly reversing field, which resulted in a 6-yard loss.    Bridgewater targeted 2 receivers 9 times each. One was Mike Wallace, who continued to be very inefficient, hauling in just 2 passes for 23 yards. He dropped a pass in the early going. Fifth-round rookie Stefon Diggs, on the other hand, was so much better, logging 7 receptions for 129 yards. Diggs is definitely worth adding in fantasy.    Kyle Rudolph caught Bridgewater's sole touchdown. However, he did nothing otherwise, catching 2 passes for only 9 yards.    As for the Chiefs, they were just very inconsistent on offense. Jamaal Charles was clearly missed, while West definitely did not serve as an effective replacement. Adding injury to insult, "

Ware nearly scored again, but was stuffed on a goal-line carry.    Going back to the Raiders, Carr looked great at times, finishing 31-of-48 for 283 yards and 2 touchdowns. He endured some drops as well, so he could've had a much better performance. However, those 3 interceptions were absolute killers and single-handedly (triple-handedly?) swung the game in Kansas City's favor.    Both Cooper and Crabtree had games to forget. Cooper, who caught 4 passes for 69 yards, dropped a fourth-down reception early on and then was responsible for Carr's pick-6. Crabtree, on the other hand, logged 5 catches for 45 yards and a touchdown, but was guilty of several drops.    "

   "comment":"West. They failed to do claim the division because of the Broncos' victory, but it's still remarkable that they concluded their year on a 10-0 run after beginning the season with a sluggish 1-5 start. Having said that, there's still definitely cause for concern for the Chiefs, and that's because of Alex Smith. The limited quarterback struggled once again to throw the ball. He heaved 2 interceptions, which would've killed his team against a better opponent. The first was a poor decision, which was a hurl into double coverage. The second was more about his limitations, as a pass of his was pick-sixed, thanks to his noodle arm being unable to connect on an outside throw. Smith didn't play poorly overall, going 14-of-24 for 156 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. He also picked up 61 rushing yards with his 9 scrambles, albeit with some help from the officials who missed some obvious holding calls. However, this performance in general was a reminder of why Kansas City will have incredible difficulty advancing deep into the playoffs. Smith can't make all of the throws, and his team will be punished as a result.    There was a scary moment in this game when Jeremy Maclin had to be taken into the locker room for tests on what appeared to be a hip injury. Fortunately for the Chiefs, he was able to re-take the field after missing only a bit of action. Maclin led the team in receiving, catching 3 balls for 54 yards and a touchdown.    Aside from Maclin, no Kansas City player accumulated more than 24 receiving yards. Travis Kelce was barely used; he saw just 2 targets and caught 1 pass for only 10 yards.    Charcandrick West shouldered a bigger workload than Spencer Ware last week, but things were different in this contest."

   "comment":"West, the best division in the NFL. The Chiefs were playing without starting quarterback Alex Smith or running backs Jamaal Charles and Spencer Ware, plus wide receiver Jeremy Maclin quickly went out of the game with a groin injury. Backup quarterback Nick Foles wasn't impressive, but he didn't need to be as Kansas City's defense carried the team to victory. After being beaten by the Titans in Week 8, the Jaguars made offensive coordinator Greg Olson the fall guy and the sacrificial lamb for the incompetence of head coach Gus Bradley and general manager David Caldwell. Olson saved Bradley and Caldwell's jobs a year ago. Despite the change, however, Jacksonville's offense produced a whopping 14 points after 10 days to prepare for Kansas City. The attempt to save face was proven to be pathetic by the Chiefs, as the Jaguars turned the ball over 4 times - and 2 easy interceptions were dropped by the Chiefs. Clearly, the wrong people were fired, as Bradley and Caldwell have proven all they produce is losing for Jacksonville.    Early in the first quarter, the Jaguars had a hilarious blooper play as Prince Amukamara ran under a terrible pass from Foles that looked like a punt down the middle of the field to get an interception, but Amukamara's teammate, Tashaun Gipson, ran into him to break up the catch. Late in the first quarter, Jaguars punt returner Bryan Walters fumbled the ball away to set up the Chiefs inside Jacksonville's 25-yard line, which set up Foles to hit Albert Wilson for a 23-yard touchdown pass a couple of plays later. Early in the second quarter, Bortles threw a terrible interception right into the hands of Ramik Wilson, and then Bortles was called for a personal foul going for the knees of a defender. That set up Kansas City at the Jaguars' 14-yard line, but the Chiefs were held to a field goal. Late in the first half, Jacksonville moved the ball with passes to Marcedes Lewis for 17 yards and Allen Robinson for 20 yards to get into Kansas City territory. A 25-yard pass to Marqise Lee then moved the Jaguars to inside the 10-yard line. Bortles lucked out with an easy interception dropped by Ron Parker in the end zone, and on the next play, Bortles threw a 1-yard strike to Robinson, who had managed to separate from Parker. The Chiefs took a 10-7 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, T.J.Yeldon fumbled the ball away to Kansas City and Cairo Santos drilled a 51-yard field goal. Bortles continued to struggle as Stephen Nelson dropped an interception, and Bortles also missed Robinson running wide open for a would-have-been 60-yard touchdown. A 37-yard punt return from Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and a penalty on the Jaguars started the Chiefs' offense at the 30-yard line, but Foles' struggles once again led to Kansas City settling for a field goal. Jacksonville put of a bit together in response, but Jason Myers missed on a 54-yard field goal attempt. The Chiefs got moving on a third-down completion to Travis Kelce to move deep into Jaguars territory. But a few plays later after getting interfered with in the end zone, Kelce lost his cool at the officials, who hadn't thrown any flags, and his temper tantrum landed him 2 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and ejection. The 30-yard loss killed the drive, but Santos hit a field goal to produce a 19-7 lead. The Jaguars got close to the end zone with a long pass to Marqise Lee (4-84) for 51 yards. However, 2 plays later, Chris Ivory fumbled the ball into the end zone, and it was recovered by Marcus Peters. The Jaguars got the ball back and were able to get points with a 14-yard scoring pass to Yeldon. Soon afterward, Sen'Derrick Marks got a third-down sack to get the ball back for Jacksonville with 3 minutes remaining. Bortles took off on a 27-yard run to get into Kansas City territory, but Dontari Poe blew up a Yeldon run on third down and Stephen Nelson broke up a fourth-down pass intended for Bryan Walters to clinch the win for Kansas City.    The change in coordinators didn't make a difference for Bortles, as he was 10-of-19 for 90 yards at halftime. He finished completing 22-of-41 passes for 252 yards with 2 scores and an interception, but he was inaccurate and careless with the football. He didn't look any better this week. In fact, you could say Bortles was less effective in the second half than he typically is.    Ivory (18-107) led the Jaguars in rushing, but had a critical fumble and picked up almost half of his yards on 1 carry. T.J. Yeldon (7-33 rushing, 5-32-1 receiving) chipped in but also had a turnover.    Allen Robinson notched 7 receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown, but it could have been much bigger if Bortles had been more accurate. Allen Hurns didn't record a catch, while Julius Thomas (2-21) continues to show that he was a waste of a big contract by Jacksonville. Hurns left the game with a concussion.    Foles was 20-of-33 for 187 yards with a touchdown. He wasn't impressive, but he avoided turnovers despite the lack of weapons. One can't expect a lot more than that from a backup quarterback.    Charcandrick West (13-39) led Kansas City in rushing with Ware and Charles out.    Kelce was the Kansas City's leading receiver with 5 catches for 58 yards, but his getting kicked out of the game hurt his team, and he has to know better than that.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"West because of an inexplicable defeat to the Buccaneers despite being touchdown favorites. The story of this game was how efficient the Buccaneers were on third down in this contest. They converted 11-of-15 third-down chances Sunday afternoon, which includes a crucial conversion on a third-and-3 to Mike Evans at the very end as they were attempting to run down the clock. That gave them the victory after the Chiefs scored on a touchdown on the preceding drive.    Jameis Winston finished 24-of-39 for 331 yards and a touchdown. The result may surprise many, but Marcus Peters wasn't playing in this game, which was a big factor. The Chiefs lost Sean Smith this offseason, but still had a great corner in Peters. He was set to cover Evans, but wasn't around to do so. As a result, Evans had a big performance, catching 6 of 13 targets for 105 yards. He didn't reach the end zone, but came very close; Steven Nelson knocked a potential touchdown out of Evans' hands at the last second in the opening half.    Despite Evans having a big performance, Winston was able to spread the ball around very well, as he had a strong afternoon following a weird fumble on the opening drive in the red zone, where the ball inexplicably slipped out of his hands. Winston was almost picked off in the end zone as well, but improved as the afternoon progressed. Including Evans, 5 Buccaneers reeled in at least 3 receptions. Cecil Shorts (5-62) and Russell Shepard (3-54) were next on the receiving list, followed by Adam Humphries (4-47) and Doug Martin (3-42).    Speaking of Martin, he had a tough time finding any running room, gaining 63 yards on 24 carries, and this includes a gain of 12, meaning his other 23 attempts went for only 51 yards. Martin at least helped his team as a receiver, but he dropped a pass on what appeared to be a very promising screen.    Moving on to the Chiefs, Alex Smith had a solid afternoon except for 1 glaring error. That occurred in the second half, as he entered the red zone. Smith threw a pass into the end zone, but he telegraphed it, and the Buccaneers were able to snatch the interception and return it to midfield. This was a crushing blow for the Chiefs, who may have won the game had they just settled for a field goal on that drive. Smith finished 24-of-31 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and that interception. He also found the end zone on a second occasion on the ground, though he scrambled just twice for 10 yards.    Smith's 1 aerial score didn't go to the usual suspects, as Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill - playing the No. 1 receiver role with Jeremy Maclin out of the lineup - were held out of the end zone. Albert Wilson (4-19) hauled in Smith's sole aerial score. Kelce (7-108) was a big contributor even though he sustained an injury on the opening possession. Kelce managed to stay in on the game on the drive, but failed to haul in a catchable pass inside the 5-yard line. He later drew a holding penalty in the end zone. Hill, meanwhile, caught 4 balls for 53 yards.    Spencer Ware shouldered the entire workload for backfield rushes, as he gained 69 yards on 17 attempts. Ware couldn't muster much because the Buccaneers happen to be very good against the run. Charcandrick West was knocked out with a concussion.   "

   "comment":"West in the wake of this victory, thanks to their season-sweep tie-breaker over the Raiders. However, they can't be feeling too good right now because of Derrick Johnson's injury. Johnson went down on no contact toward the end of the second quarter and had to be helped off the field. It was ruled that he he ruptured his problematic Achilles and will be out for the year and possibly a portion of 2017. It's a huge blow, as Johnson is the heart and soul of Kansas City's defense.    Alex Smith was terrific in the first half, as he looked like the quarterback in the running for the MVP. Smith was 11-of-16 for 202 yards and a touchdown in the opening half alone. He converted on an early third-and-10, as Chris Conley beat David Amerson. He then hit Travis Kelce for a gain of 28 yards from deep in his own territory, and followed that up with a nifty play in which he danced around the pocket and connected to Conley for a 31-yarder, as Conley beat Amerson again. Smith came back down to Earth after halftime, as he was just 6-of-10 for 62 yards, a telegraphed interception and a lost fumble (Khalil Mack strip-sack) following intermission. A regression to the mean was bound to happen for Smith, though in fairness, Andy Reid didn't seem interested in passing whatsoever, opting to just feed Spencer Ware instead. Overall, Smith finished 17-of-26 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and the lost fumble.    The Raiders came into this game struggling against tight ends, so it's no wonder that Kelce went off. Kelce caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 1-handed grab thrown behind him for a gain of 34. Meanwhile, Tyreek Hill (6-66) scored twice; once on offense when he beat Amerson (notice a theme here?), and once via a punt return. Jeremy Maclin (1-16) was barely heard from upon his return. He was targeted on Smith's interception.    Ware had a disappointing evening. He was limited to just 56 yards on 20 carries, and he was vultured in the second quarter by Charcandrick West, who found the end zone on 1 of his only 2 attempts.    Moving back to the Raiders, there might be another hand injury that they have to worry about. That's what "

   "comment":"West. Step 1 was defeating the Broncos, and they managed to do that in blowout fashion. This game was never close. Kansas City ripped through Denver's declining defense with some great running and well-timed screens. The trouble really began when the Broncos, down 7-0 early on, surrendered a 70-yard run to Tyreek Hill. Later in the opening quarter, Alex Smith threw a bubble screen to Travis Kelce. The Broncos looked like they had never seen 1 before, and Kelce took advantage of terrific blocking to scamper 80 yards into the end zone. Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault. In fact, Smith's first poor throw of the night came on his 10th attempt when he made an errant throw to Spencer Ware. Smith later blew a field-goal chance by hurling a poor toss downfield instead of converting a sure thing for about 7 yards or so to give Cairo Santos a chance.    Kelce put together 1 of the best games of his career. He caught 11 of his 12 targets for a whopping 160 yards and a touchdown. In addition of sprinting 80 yards into the end zone, he also had so many key conversions on third down. The Chiefs were 9-of-17 on third downs, compared to Denver's 4-of-15 figure. I know the Broncos have had their issues against tight ends this year, but you'd think Wade Phillips would've devised a scheme to restrict Kelce. Denver will have to find an inside linebacker upgrade this offseason. I have the team doing this in my 2017 NFL Mock Draft.    Kansas City's 2 receivers were disappointments in regard to their actual catching stats. Jeremy Maclin caught just 3 passes for 9 yards, and was nearly responsible for an interception when he ran the wrong route on 1 play. Hill, meanwhile, failed to haul in any of his 5 targets. However, Hill was effective on the ground, gaining 95 rushing yards and the aforementioned touchdown on his 70-yard sprint.    Ware had some nice carries as well, gaining 62 yards on 13 attempts. He lost late-game touches to Charcandrick West (14-35), as Andy Reid wanted to preserve his primary running back.    Speaking of Reid, he made a questionable decision late in the game. Up 27-10 with 2 minutes remaining, he had nose tackle "

   "comment":"West. He totaled 58 yards on 5 catches and also had a couple of receiving touchdowns. West caught both on plays where he flared out of the backfield to the front pylon. It was an impressive performance from the young running back, who also led the team in rushing with 58 yards on 16 carries. He did a good job of filling in for the injured Spencer Ware.    One of the biggest plays of the game for the Chiefs came on a punt return. Hill fielded the ball at his own 5-yard line. Hill decided to bring the ball out, and he got some strong blocks as the play developed. He made it down the sideline and scampered to the end zone for the 95-yard score. That gave the Chiefs a 34-17 lead, and really helped to cement their lead.    For the Chargers, this loss was not all too surprising. The team came limping into the final game, dealing with countless injuries. Because of this, their team struggled to keep pace with the Chiefs. "

The rookie was stifled on the ground, but ran hard and should continue to be a strong performer moving forward. In the end, it was an untackle-able Bell and a heads-up play by Brown that led the scoring, but the Steelers' defense deserves a big chunk of the credit for this win. Roethlisberger was again not at his best, but was much better than last week and showed signs of his old self at times.    Smith played 1 of his worst games of the season, but still gave his team a chance to win. I don't think you can knock him and this team too far down the power rankings, as the Steelers have always played well at Arrowhead and were highly motivated after an embarrassing loss.    The Chiefs have a short turnaround, as they play the Raiders on Thursday night, which may make it tough for both "
