The Redskins won the time-of-possession battle, 38:27 to 21:33. As of a matter of fact, the Seahawks were so brutal early on, that excluding a fluke 44-yard Maurice Morris run, their longest play was a 6-yard gain midway through the second quarter. Matt Hasselbeck began the game 1-of-7 for 6 yards.    Hasselbeck finished the contest 12-of-24 for 103 yards, 2 scores and a pair of picks. Excluding Morris, no 1 on the team had more than 2 receptions or 34 receiving yards.    For whatever reason, Washington couldn't contain Morris, who ran for 103 yards on 14 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 10 yards and a touchdown.    Speaking of the inability to stop the rush, Clinton Portis gained 143 yards on 29 attempts. Unfortunately, he was banged up on the team's final drive, which allowed the aptly named Betts to fumble the cover away. Betts unjustly vultured a touchdown earlier in the contest.    Capitalizing off Portis' running ability, "
