Wilson hit Graham on a crossing route, and he broke a tackle from Brock Vereen to charge into the end zone for Seattle. With a 20-0 lead, the game was essentially over. The Seahawks' offense found their groove with Rawls running for 18 yards, Kearse hauling in an 18-yarder, and Wilson running for 13 yards. That led to another Seattle field goal. A 4.h-and-short pass to Graham moved the chains, and that set up a final 48-yard field goal for "

Rawls has played in limited action this year, but there's no doubt that the Seahawks' offense has looked better with him compared to Marshawn Lynch. Of course, Lynch has been 1 of the league's best runners throughout the years, but he hasn't been the same this season. He hasn't maintained the same sort of burst. Rawls, meanwhile, is an explosive, powerful runner who deserves to be featured even when Lynch returns.    With a strong running game aiding him, "

   "comment":"Rawls was swallowed up at the line of scrimmage by Aaron Donald, and Seattle, as a result, was constantly stuck in long-yardage situations. That changed after intermission, as the Seahawks opened things up aerially. This should've been the strategy in the first place, as the Rams had 3 missing defensive backs entering this contest and eventually lost a 4.h. Russell Wilson consequently posted a terrific stat line. Wilson misfired just 7 times, going 19-of-26 for 229 yards, 3 touchdowns and a late, careless interception. Wilson's sole mistake, save for that play, was earlier in the red zone, when he lofted an underthrown pass to Jimmy Graham. The ball appeared to be picked off, but it was ruled incomplete on the field and also upon a replay review. It should've been changed to an interception, and I'm saying this as someone who had a wager on the Seahawks. The officials were completely incompetent in this game, blowing numerous decisions and spots.    Rawls, meanwhile, managed just 34 yards on 21 carries. He had a nice, 12-yard burst in the second half, but couldn't find any running room otherwise. Rawls is a decent back, but the Seahawks will be thrilled to have C.J. Prosise back in the lineup soon.    Wilson's scores went to 3 different players: "

I do think we'll see more of Collins in the playoffs, as Rawls just hasn't looked like the same runner after his injuries.    This Seattle team is very talented, but also flawed. The Seahawks' offensive line is not putting it together, and their running game is a shadow of it once was. This season, the 49ers hadn't held a team under 51 rushing yards through 3 quarters all season, but they restricted the Seahawks to just 20 in this game, and 3 quarters were how long the starters played.    The 49ers will get the No. 2 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and hopefully they get a good general manager set up quickly for that pick, because they need it to hit.    Seattle will go into the playoffs as the No. 3 seed, which does give the team a home game against the Lions. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Rawls ran poorly at the end of the regular season because he was still getting over an injury. Well, he's certainly healthy now. Rawls ripped through the Lions' defense with ease, gaining 161 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. Rawls picked up a 4.h-and-1, and he also had a burst of 26 yards, thanks to a terrific spin move on Ziggy Ansah. There was a slight scare late in the third quarter when Rawls had to leave the game to be checked for a concussion, but he only missed a couple of plays.    While the Seahawks made numerous circus catches throughout the evening, the Lions were guilty of dropping routine passes. "

He has explosive play-making ability, so he may have a chance to earn a bigger role with the team. ,li&gt; For the Giants, they deserve praise for keeping pace with the Seahawks early on. But it's clear that their offense is not going to be able to keep the team competitive this year. Eli Manning had a poor performance against the Seahawks. The veteran quarterback has regressed, and he's looking like 1 of the worse signal-callers in the NFL. At halftime, Manning only had 17 passing yards despite the Giants having the lead. Manning's arm strength is no longer there, and his downfield accuracy has suffered as a result. Of course, Manning has been operating without his top-three passing options in the past couple weeks, but the Giants still had no chance against the Seahawks. Manning was dinking and dunking against a defense known for solid tackling and pursuit abilities. That was not a recipe for success. Overall, Manning went 19-of-39 for 134 yards and 1 touchdown. He also fumbled. Manning's numbers are indicative of his declining ability. Manning isn't capable of leading the Giants to the playoffs, so they need to think about replacing him this offseason.    The top target for Manning on Sunday was far and away "

Watson then had a critical mistake as he was pressured and threw off the mark, leaving Richard Sherman to pick him off deep in Houston territory. Seattle took the lead with a field goal to go up 27-24. The Texans came back with Watson hitting Hopkins for 34 yards and then Fuller for 36 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson made a phenomenal play to break a sack and throw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Miller. That put Houston up 31-27 with 9 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. Wilson came right back, hitting Lockett for 55 yards to the Houston 20. The drive ended with Jimmy Graham getting wide open for a 1-yard touchdown. That put Seattle up 34-31 with 5 and half minutes remaining. The Texans caught Seattle in a great play call with a screen to Hopkins, and he exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. That gave the Texans a 38-34 with 4:49 remaining. Wilson quickly moved the ball across the midfield with a few completions and a 21-yard scramble to put Seattle inside the 30.
