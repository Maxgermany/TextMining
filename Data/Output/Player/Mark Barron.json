Doug Martin (16-67 rushing, 4-24 receiving) had a big run up the middle to the 1-yard line and Glennon hit a fade to Vincent Jackson (9-114) for his second touchdown. The Bucs' opening drive of the second quarter ended when Glennon had an inaccurate pass picked off by Bradley Fletcher. A few plays later, Foles rainbowed in a bomb to the end zone for a 47-yard touchdown pass to Cooper (4-120), who beat Johnthan Banks running down the sideline. After the Tampa Bay managed a field goal, Foles hit Cooper on a quick throw. Cooper then broke a tackle from Banks to race down the field for 44 yards. The next play saw Foles loft in a 36-yard touchdown pass after DeSean Jackson (6-64) beat Dashon Goldson and Mark Barron in zone coverage. The running of McCoy (25-116 rushing, 2-55 receiving) set up a field goal to ice the win for the Eagles.    Foles completed 22-of-31 passes for 296 yards with 3 touchdowns and a running score. He was superb, so Philadelphia has no reason to rush the other signal-caller back to the field.    Glennon didn't play poorly for Tampa Bay and was improved in his second start. He completed 26-of-43 passes for 273 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. The breakout star for the Buccaneers was tight end "
