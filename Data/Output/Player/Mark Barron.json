Just before halftime with Tampa Bay down by 4, Doug Martin (16-67 rushing, 4-24 receiving) had a big run up the middle to the 1-yard line and Glennon hit a fade to Vincent Jackson (9-114) for his second touchdown. The Bucs' opening drive of the second quarter ended when Glennon had an inaccurate pass picked off by Bradley Fletcher. A few plays later, Foles rainbowed in a bomb to the end zone for a 47-yard touchdown pass to Cooper (4-120), who beat Johnthan Banks running down the sideline. After the Tampa Bay managed a field goal, Foles hit Cooper on a quick throw. Cooper then broke a tackle from Banks to race down the field for 44 yards. The next play saw Foles loft in a 36-yard touchdown pass after DeSean Jackson (6-64) beat Dashon Goldson and Mark Barron in zone coverage. The running of McCoy (25-116 rushing, 2-55 receiving) set up a field goal to ice the win for the Eagles.    Foles completed 22-of-31 passes for 296 yards with 3 touchdowns and a running score. He was superb, so Philadelphia has no reason to rush the other signal-caller back to the field.    Glennon didn't play poorly for Tampa Bay and was improved in his second start. He completed 26-of-43 passes for 273 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. The breakout star for the Buccaneers was tight end "

   "comment":"Barron, who had a great game for the Buccaneers. A horrible pass interference call took away a great leaping interception from Earl Thomas, and a few plays later, Glennon hit Tim Wright (4-58) in the back of the end zone for a touchdown. On the next drive, Glennon drilled the ball down the field and Glennon found Tiquan Underwood (2-29) wide open in the end zone. On the ensuing kickoff, Seattle's Jermaine Kearse fumbled the ball to Tampa Bay, so the Bucs were set up at the Seahawks 31-yard line. Glennon threw a bullet to Wright for 27 yards for the next play. On the following snap, Mike James threw a jump pass to Tom Crabtree for a touchdown. Filling in for Doug Martin, James (28-158) was awesome for the Bucs. He ripped up the Seattle defense all day, while Tampa Bay's offensive line had a superb performance in run blocking against the Seahawks' front 7. Down 21-0, Seattle woke up with a 16-yard run from Wilson. A facemask on Gerald McCoy and a pass interference on Michael Adams moved the ball inside the 20. Wilson hit Kearse (2-43) for a 16-yard touchdown and cut the Bucs lead to 21-7. Glennon and James kept things going early in the third quarter to lead Tampa Bay on a field goal drive. After that, the Seahawks' defense shut down the Bucs' offense. Wilson responded with some of his highlight-reel scrambling plays. He made a big throw to convert a third down to Golden Tate (3-29) for 19 yards. Wilson dodged a sack and got 19 more yards on a completion to Doug Baldwin (6-75). Wilson then ran the ball into the end zone on 10-yard run off the read option. At the end of the third quarter, Tate fielded a punt inside the 5-yard line and broke a bunch of tackles to rip off a 71-yard return into Tampa Bay territory. That led to a field goal and cut the Bucs' lead to 24-17. Wilson soon burned a blitz for a 28-yard reception to Baldwin. Kearse made a phenomenal leaping catch for 27-yards to Tampa Bay's 3-yard line, but Wilson threw an ill-advised pass into a crowd that was picked off by Keith Tandy. The Seattle defense forced a 3-and-out, so Wilson had another shot. He hit Zach Miller (3-49) for 26 yards. That set up a 10-yard touchdown strike to Baldwin to tie the game at 24 with just under 2 minutes remaining. The Seahawks' defense then did their job to force overtime. After a Bucs' punt to start the extra period, Marshawn Lynch (21-125) had some good runs including a 14-yarder to convert a third down. He powered the ball down to the 6-yard line, and that set up the game-winning 27-yard field goal for Seattle.    Wilson finished the day 19-of-26 for 217 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He ran for 36 yards and a score. Wilson had some mistakes but was clutch as usual.    Barron had an excellent game for Tampa Bay. McCoy went down with a leg injury in overtime, which could be serious. Once again, the Bucs' defensive line was held without a sack and the lack of pass rush without blitzing continues to hurt Tampa Bay.    Glennon completed 17-of-23 for 168 yards with 2 touchdowns. He protected the ball well and was excellent in the first half, but seemed to get gun shy late in the game. "
