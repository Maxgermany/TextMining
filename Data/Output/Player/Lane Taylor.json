   "comment":"Lane Taylor went out when the game was still in doubt, while T.Taylor Gabriel, meanwhile, didn't do much; he caught 2 passes for 24 yards, and he was responsible for a drop of about 15 yards.    The Falcons had a couple of nice runs, but otherwise didn't do very much on the ground. Freeman gained 42 yards on 14 carries, while Coleman managed just 29 yards and a score on 11 attempts. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    As for the Packers, Rodgers' stat line looks nice, but he'll be disappointed with this performance. Rodgers finished 27-of-45 for 287 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but all of his scores came in the second half when Atlanta was already winning in a blowout. Rodgers was uncharacteristically off the mark on some of his throws. He also saw more pressure than he's used to. Rodgers didn't recognize what Atlanta was doing with its blitzes, and it also didn't help that the Packers lost both guards in this contest. Lane Taylor went out when the game was still in doubt, while T."
