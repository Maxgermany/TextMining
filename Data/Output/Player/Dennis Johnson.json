   "comment":"Johnson took over and gained 74 yards on 13 carries. - Case Keenum is not a legitimate starter. Going up against a dreadful secondary, Keenum went 18-of-34 for 169 yards and an interception that was really Keshawn Martin's fault. However, Keenum took another 1 of his trademark horrible sacks, losing a ridiculous 19 yards on 1 take-down. He was also extremely inaccurate throughout the entire afternoon.    Some noteworthy stats: - Chad Henne went 23-of-32 for 239 yards. A big chunk of his yardage came early on when he hit Ace Sanders (4-61) for a gain of 51. - Cecil Shorts logged 8 catches for 71 yards. He nearly scored a touchdown in the opening quarter, but was brought down inches short of the goal line as he was falling out of bounds. The CBS announcers actually thought Shorts scored and urged Gus Bradley to challenge the call, but they were wrong. - Andre Johnson was a disappointment, catching just 2 passes for 36 yards. "

   "comment":"Johnson (4-63) for a touchdown in the first half. One of his picks was completely lazy, as he tried to force something that just wasn't there while rolling out of the pocket. He also fumbled following intermission, but his tight end, Ryan Griffin (5-66), pounced on the ball.    Manning wasn't the only player to make history in this game. Andre Johnson became just the second player in NFL history to log 100-plus receptions in 5 or more seasons. Wes Welker was the first.    The Texans couldn't run the ball at all without Ben Tate. "
