   "comment":"Dennis Johnson (3-13). Tate actually limped off the field in the second quarter, but remained in the game.   Johnson didn't score, but he still had a big game, tallying 8 catches for 121 yards. He was the only Texan with more than 3 receptions, though DeAndre Hopkins logged a decent amount of yardage (77) because of a 66-yard grab in the 4.h quarter, beating Kyle Arrington who inexplicably quit on the play.    Ben Tate hogged all but 1 of the touchdowns for the Texans. He found the end zone on 3 occasions, collecting 102 yards on 22 carries in the process. This was 1 week after he was benched in favor of Dennis Johnson (3-13). Tate actually limped off the field in the second quarter, but remained in the game.   "

Some stats/facts for the Broncos: - Manning wasn't picked, but Houston safety Johnson (4-63) for a touchdown in the first half. One of his picks was completely lazy, as he tried to force something that just wasn't there while rolling out of the pocket. He also fumbled following intermission, but his tight end, Ryan Griffin (5-66), pounced on the ball.    Manning wasn't the only player to make history in this game. Andre Johnson became just the second player in NFL history to log 100-plus receptions in 5 or more seasons. Wes Welker was the first.    The Texans couldn't run the ball at all without Ben Tate. "
