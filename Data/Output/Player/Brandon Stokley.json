Jacksonville went on to outscore the Broncos, 24-3, until Denver had a late touchdown in the fourth quarter.    Denver's defense was up to its old tricks, as it failed to stop both the run and the pass. David Garrard had his second solid outing of the year (including the preseason), finishing 25-of-34, 276 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Maurice Jones-Drew totaled 125 yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 carries. Matt Jones led the squad in receiving yet again, notching 7 catches and 69 yards.    Cutler was 7-of-7 for 67 yards on his first drive, so it should be a surprise that his final numbers were so pedestrian (21-of-37 for 192 yards, 2 touchdowns, a pick and a fumble). I guess Cutler needs Eddie Royal and Tony Scheffler more than we thought. Brandon Marshall was the only 1 in Denver's receiving corps to do anything; he had 9 catches and 98 yards. Stokley left the game in the second quarter.    Another Bronco who was missing was Selvin Young, though it's not like the Broncos struggled to run the ball in his absence. "

He was 9-of-15 on third downs, leading Denver to 457 net yards. His passing numbers could have been even better, but the Broncos took the air out of the ball with such a huge second-half lead.
