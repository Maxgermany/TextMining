I'll never underestimate what a victory like this can do for a team, but looking at facts for a second, Orton was pretty pedestrian. He was 17-of-28 for 243 yards and a touchdown. Taking away that 87-yard score, however, Orton had just 156 yards on 27 attempts, giving him a YPA of 5.8. No surprise there - the Broncos struggled to move the chains all afternoon, converting 3-of-12 of their third downs.    "
