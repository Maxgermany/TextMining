   "comment":"Jatavis Brown. This wasn't the only time that a Siemian pick was dropped, as he tossed an ugly duck in the second quarter because of some horrible mechanics. Siemian finished 25-of-35 for 207 yards, a stat line that was helped by garbage time; Siemian was 11-of-17 for only 89 yards by halftime. He actually turned the ball over twice, tossing a horrible pass on a desperation 4.h-down attempt and also getting strip-sacked to ruin a solid drive in the third quarter. There's going to be a lot of chatter about removing Siemian as the quarterback, and the discussion needs to happen. Siemian sucks. However, he didn't have much of a chance because of his poor pass protection.    Siemian wasn't the only 1 making mistakes. Tight end "
