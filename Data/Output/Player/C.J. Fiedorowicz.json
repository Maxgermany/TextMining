Ryan Grigson deserves a trophy for putting this abomination of a defense together.    Speaking of horrible defense, the Colts couldn't stop Miller on the ground. Miller gained 149 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. That's saying a lot, as the Texans were down 2 starting offensive linemen, and Miller hadn't produced very much prior to this contest.    "
