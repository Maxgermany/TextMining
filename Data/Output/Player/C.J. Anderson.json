   "comment":"Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were Demaryius Thomas, C.J. Anderson and Wes Welker."

   "comment":"Anderson. Manning reentered the game in the third quarter, and even though he was limping around on occasion, he still played well, converting some key third downs to keep the Chargers off the field. In fact, Manning was more accurate in the second half, misfiring just twice on 8 attempts. He had some trouble early on, getting strip-sacked twice by Melvin Ingram, who had his way with Ryan Clady. Manning, however, was fortunate. Clady recovered the first fumble, while the second was negated by a defensive hold. Manning finished with meager numbers by his standards, going 14-of-20 for 233 yards and a touchdown. The issue was that Manning missed a valuable chance for a 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter, and then the Denver coaching staff called a ton of rushing plays in the second half. Manning obviously didn't have much of a chance to post great fantasy numbers with just 8 passes in more than a half of action.    The Broncos ran the ball a whopping 35 times. Anderson led the way again, though he didn't find much room against San Diego's improved front, gaining just 85 yards on 29 carries. He appeared to score once, but the officials ruled he was short of the goal line following a replay. Anderson also suffered what seemed like a serious injury after a big hit at 1 point, but he was able to reenter the game after a brief absence.    Only 1 of Manning's targets had a decent outing. "

Maybe Kansas City's run defense is that good, but I'm beginning to have doubts.    Both of Manning's primary receivers hauled in 8 passes, with Sanders securing 2 of the touchdowns. Sanders (8-87) is worth selling high in fantasy right now, given Manning's struggles. The same can be said for Thomas (8-116).    Manning's third score went to Virgil Green. "

Anderson was the better runner for the second-straight week, so the Broncos should think about moving back to him as the primary ball-carrier.    As for the winners, Andrew Luck continued his great momentum from his second-half surge at Carolina. Despite losing his offensive coordinator on a short week, Luck went 21-of-36 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 34 rushing yards on 6 scampers. There were reports earlier during the week that he was healthy, and that seemed apparent when he took off on a third-and-10 scramble and dived for the first down. Luck was nearly intercepted twice, but considering the caliber of defense he was battling, he had a terrific showing, and all Indianapolis fans should be optimistic going forward.

   "comment":"Anderson even began warming up. Newton stayed on the field, however, and even had the Panthers in a position to kick the game-winning field goal, but Graham Gano went wide left from 50 yards.    The big story to come out of this game will be Trevor Siemian, who was not intimidated whatsoever to be going up against Luke Kuechly and Carolina's Super Bowl defense despite never attempting a pass in the regular season before. Siemian was very competent, making smart decisions (for the most part) and tossing precise passes, all while mixing in timely runs. He kind of looked like Alex Smith, if I had to make a comparison. Granted, he was battling a secondary that really looks like it's missing Josh Norman, but Siemian still had to deal with Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Kawann Short and the rest of Carolina's prolific front 7. Siemian finished 18-of-26 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and he also jogged for 20 rushing yards on 5 carries. Both picks occurred inside the Carolina 30-yard line - 2 of Denver's 3 give-aways took place there - as 1 was tipped at the line of scrimmage, while the other 1 transpired as Siemian was under pressure and threw off his back foot. I won't blame Siemian for the first pick, but the second 1 was inexcusable. That was 3 easy points off the board, which would've made a huge difference had Gano nailed that field goal. Siemian also got lucky on 1 occasion, when he had an open Virgil Green in the end zone, but underthrew him with a pass that was nearly picked off. It's too bad that Siemian is just a bridge to Paxton Lynch, because I think there's something there. Siemian is a smart, gritty quarterback who, at the very least, proved that he can be a viable backup quarterback in this league.    C.J. Anderson looked like Denver's best offensive player at times. He ran extremely well with great power and burst, gaining 92 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. He also caught 4 passes for 47 receiving yards and a second score. Anderson has gotten off to slow starts the past 2 years, thanks in part to conditioning, but he appears to be in terrific shape right now.    Siemian connected with "

Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips was knocked out of the game in the second quarter on a collision with Gordon during Rivers' interception. Phillips was down for a while and had to be taken to a hospital, but all reports indicate that he's fine. The Broncos deserve major credit for still playing well defensively without their legendary play-caller.   "

   "comment":"Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a 4.h touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground. Replay showed that Gronkowski made the reception, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to overturn the call.    Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.    In addition to scoring on his kickoff return, Lewis found the end zone on offense, dashing for 55 yards on 14 carries. Rex Burkhead (10-36), who had the aforementioned blocked punt, also scored as a receiver, catching 3 balls for 27 yards. James White did the same. Mike Gillislee, meanwhile, was inactive. He has been in Bill Belichick's dog house ever since fumbling a few weeks ago.    Quarterback play has been a huge problem for the Broncos, but that wasn't the case tonight, despite the mere 16 points for Denver. Brock Osweiler was just fine, as he went 18-of-33 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which occurred very late in the game when Osweiler desperately was trying to make stuff happen. Osweiler did a good job of moving the chains in between the 20s, but the offense stalled in the red zone.    Emmanuel Sanders is clearly healthy again, as he had a huge performance, catching 6 of his 11 targets for 137 yards. Demaryius Thomas found the end zone, but was limited to 5 grabs for 44 yards. Stephon Gilmore returning from injury, did a great job of limiting Thomas. It's clear that the film work that Gilmore put in during his time off has clearly paid off, as the Patriots didn't have nearly as many miscommunications in this contest as they did earlier in the year.    The Broncos, who trailed the entire evening, couldn't run the ball very much. C.J. Anderson was limited to just 10 carries, though he managed to turn those into 54 yards, thanks to a 21-yard burst in the opening half. Anderson, as mentioned, scored a touchdown, but Bolles' hold negated it.   "
