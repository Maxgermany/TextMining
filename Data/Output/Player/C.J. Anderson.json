   "comment":"C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were Demaryius Thomas, C.J. Anderson and "

The Ravens have a ferocious run defense, so don't be concerned for that reason if you drafted Anderson in the first round. Anderson sprained his toe, but he's fine, according to head coach Gary Kubiak.    Manning didn't throw a touchdown, so the Denver receivers also underwhelmed their fantasy owners. Sanders led the way with 8 catches for 65 yards, while Thomas (7-60) was right behind him. As with Manning, try to trade these guys because they won't be as productive with Manning and his decaying arm.   "

He also caught 4 passes for 47 receiving yards and a second score. Anderson has gotten off to slow starts the past 2 years, thanks in part to conditioning, but he appears to be in terrific shape right now.    Siemian connected with Anderson even began warming up. Newton stayed on the field, however, and even had the Panthers in a position to kick the game-winning field goal, but Graham Gano went wide left from 50 yards.    The big story to come out of this game will be Trevor Siemian, who was not intimidated whatsoever to be going up against Luke Kuechly and Carolina's Super Bowl defense despite never attempting a pass in the regular season before. Siemian was very competent, making smart decisions (for the most part) and tossing precise passes, all while mixing in timely runs. He kind of looked like Alex Smith, if I had to make a comparison. Granted, he was battling a secondary that really looks like it's missing Josh Norman, but Siemian still had to deal with Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Kawann Short and the rest of Carolina's prolific front 7. Siemian finished 18-of-26 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and he also jogged for 20 rushing yards on 5 carries. Both picks occurred inside the Carolina 30-yard line - 2 of Denver's 3 give-aways took place there - as 1 was tipped at the line of scrimmage, while the other 1 transpired as Siemian was under pressure and threw off his back foot. I won't blame Siemian for the first pick, but the second 1 was inexcusable. That was 3 easy points off the board, which would've made a huge difference had Gano nailed that field goal. Siemian also got lucky on 1 occasion, when he had an open Virgil Green in the end zone, but underthrew him with a pass that was nearly picked off. It's too bad that Siemian is just a bridge to Paxton Lynch, because I think there's something there. Siemian is a smart, gritty quarterback who, at the very least, proved that he can be a viable backup quarterback in this league.    C.J. Anderson looked like Denver's best offensive player at times. He ran extremely well with great power and burst, gaining 92 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. He also caught 4 passes for 47 receiving yards and a second score.

Anderson also had an amazing spin move to advance the chains on third down.    It's hard to say whether the Colts are worse off in the secondary or the offensive line. Indianapolis' blocking unit couldn't protect Luck at all, and the Colt quarterback barely completed half of his passes in the process. He finished 21-of-40 for only 197 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned 2 turnovers.

   "comment":"C.J. Anderson appeared to score yet another touchdown, but 1 of a half-a-dozen holds nullified what was a heroic effort by Anderson in which he broke 4 tackles to reach the end zone on a would-be 20-yard reception. Following a sack, Trevor Siemian hit Demaryius Thomas for a big gain, but the star receiver lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and following a late scare that involved an onside kick recovery, they finally sealed their first victory since they beat the Jaguars in Week 2.    Philip Rivers set the tone for this victory by torching the Broncos on the initial 2 drives. Rivers was absolutely on fire, slinging precise throws on nearly attempt. In fact, his second possession went for 10 minutes, which was the longest drive of the season for any team. He began 14-of-18 for 148 yards and a touchdown. However, Denver's defense clamped down on the Chargers after that. Rivers was just 4-of-11 for 30 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 18-of-29 for 178 yards and a score. His overall numbers would've been better had Antonio Gates not dropped 2 passes, 1 of which would've moved the chains on a third down. Rivers played a great game despite the injuries he's been dealing with up front; Joe Barksdale was the latest blocker to get hurt, though he did return to action eventually. Rivers passed Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time passing leader in terms of yards.    Gates caught only 2 passes for 16 yards, and he played second fiddle to Hunter Henry. The rookie tight end was terrific, catching 6 balls for 83 yards and a touchdown. He was dominant, and the struggling Denver linebackers didn't have any sort of answer for him.    Excluding Henry and Gates, only 3 Chargers caught multiple passes: Tyrell Williams (3-28), Travis Benjamin (3-17) and Dexter McCluster (2-15). Benjamin muffed a punt in the opening half, setting up a Denver field goal. However, he made up for it by drawing a pass-interference flag on Aqib Talib.    Melvin Gordon struggled to find running room for the most part, but finally broke free for a 48-yard gain in the third quarter. Gordon dashed for 94 yards on 27 carries.    Before moving on to the Broncos, I have to say that this was definitely a feel-good moment for Mike McCoy, who was set to be fired if the Chargers lost this game. A teary-eye McCoy addressed the media, which called for his firing during the week, and he told them that he met with his daughter right after the game.    Denver struggled to move the chains until garbage time at the end that nearly turned into an improbable comeback. The Broncos were limited to 60 net yards of offense in the opening half. Part of this was because the Chargers controlled the clock, holding the ball for 20:27 of 30 first-half minutes. The other part was that the entire offense was both ineffective and mistake-prone. Trevor Siemian struggled. His final numbers don't look horrible - 30-of-50, 230 yards, 1 touchdown - but at the end of the third quarter, he was just 10-of-19 for only 58 yards. He didn't have any significant yardage, as most came with the Broncos down 2 or 3 scores and the Chargers turning into a prevent defense that nearly lost them the game. It's unknown why they changed their strategy, but it nearly clost them. Siemian had chances to score points in meaningful action, but missed throws. He had Emmanuel Sanders open for a deep touchdown in the first quarter, but overshot him. There were other passes he should've converted, including a gain of 15 or so to Demaryius Thomas that would've moved the chains on a third down, but Siemian just missed him. He also nearly threw an interception, but the ball was dropped.    Mistakes killed the Broncos all evening. For instance, C.J. Anderson rushed for only 37 yards and was outgained by "

   "comment":"C.J. Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a 4.h touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground. Replay showed that Gronkowski made the reception, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to overturn the call.    Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.    In addition to scoring on his kickoff return, Lewis found the end zone on offense, dashing for 55 yards on 14 carries. Rex Burkhead (10-36), who had the aforementioned blocked punt, also scored as a receiver, catching 3 balls for 27 yards. James White did the same. Mike Gillislee, meanwhile, was inactive. He has been in Bill Belichick's dog house ever since fumbling a few weeks ago.    Quarterback play has been a huge problem for the Broncos, but that wasn't the case tonight, despite the mere 16 points for Denver. Brock Osweiler was just fine, as he went 18-of-33 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which occurred very late in the game when Osweiler desperately was trying to make stuff happen. Osweiler did a good job of moving the chains in between the 20s, but the offense stalled in the red zone.    Emmanuel Sanders is clearly healthy again, as he had a huge performance, catching 6 of his 11 targets for 137 yards. Demaryius Thomas found the end zone, but was limited to 5 grabs for 44 yards. Stephon Gilmore returning from injury, did a great job of limiting Thomas. It's clear that the film work that Gilmore put in during his time off has clearly paid off, as the Patriots didn't have nearly as many miscommunications in this contest as they did earlier in the year.    The Broncos, who trailed the entire evening, couldn't run the ball very much. C.J. Anderson was limited to just 10 carries, though he managed to turn those into 54 yards, thanks to a 21-yard burst in the opening half. Anderson, as mentioned, scored a touchdown, but Bolles' hold negated it. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
