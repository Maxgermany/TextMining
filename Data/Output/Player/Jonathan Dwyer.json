   "comment":"Dwyer lost a fumble at the end of the first half, but the Browns couldn't take advantage of it. - Chris Rainey lost a fumble with 2:36 remaining in the game near midfield, ruining a potential game-winning drive. - Mendenhall and Rainey both fumbled on another occasion, but Cleveland did not recover. These weren't the only mistakes the Steelers made. They had 9 penalties, 1 of which was a ticky-tack hold that negated a 33-yard Heath Miller reception. Meanwhile, Mike Wallace had the ball pop out of his hands and into the arms of a Cleveland player. This was 1 of 3 interceptions that Charlie Batch threw. Batch went 20-of-34 for 199 yards and the 3 picks. He had some very ugly passes, but wasn't as bad as some media members are making him out to be. Had he gotten some help from his teammates, he may have pulled off a victory.    Batch's preferred targets were Emmanuel Sanders (5-75), Heath Miller (6-63) and Rainey (4-15). Wallace caught 1 pass for 9 yards, which was the final play of the game. He was thrown to 8 times.    Plaxico Burress, who was signed this week, didn't catch a pass, but drew a pass-interference flag on Sheldon Brown in the end zone.    It would've been difficult to believe heading into this game, but Pittsburgh's leading rusher (Dwyer) had 19 yards. Mendenhall gained just 6 yards on 4 attempts. The Steelers have to upgrade this position after the season.    As for the victor, "

   "comment":"Dwyer, who failed to convert. Mike Tomlin even challenged the spot, but the call wasn't overturned.    This victory came at a price for Pittsburgh. Nose tackle Steve McClendon was knocked out of the game with an ankle injury. He left in the first quarter and didn't return. He's expected to be out for a few weeks.    Some numbers for Cleveland: - "

   "comment":"Dwyer to find the end zone. The score was almost Stanton's, as a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown was negated because his knee was ruled down inches shy of the goal line. Stanton did struggle a bit in the second half, going 5-of-13 for 52 yards following intermission. He also nearly had a pick when he heaved the ball into double coverage. The problem was that the Giants continuously screwed themselves over with mistakes. There was 1 killer sequence. Ted Ginn returned a kickoff for a touchdown, and this was followed by a lost fumble on New York's kickoff (leading to a field goal) and then Rashad Jennings followed that up with an unforced fumble of his own (resulting in another field goal).    Perhaps the 1 positive for the Giants is that Eli Manning actually played well. Manning was a mess during the exhibition and in the season opener, but he was sharp for the most part in this contest, going 26-of-39 for 277 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. One of the picks wasn't his fault because the ball was tipped, but he was responsible for a strip-sack because he didn't recognize the blind-side pressure and held on to the ball too long. Manning's play-makers screwed him over. There were several dropped passes, including 1 by Rueben Randle on what would've been a big gain with 3 minutes remaining in regulation. Andre Williams also dropped a pass after Jennings seemed to be temporarily benched following his fumble. This was typical, Tom Coughlin stubbornness, and it ended up costing him because he put an inferior player on the field.    Some random stats from this game: - Larry Fitzgerald caught 6 balls for 51 yards, but it could've been a much bigger day. Fitzgerald was tackled inches short of the goal line on the opening drive, as mentioned, and he also had a big gain nullified by a Jared Veldheer penalty. - Michael Floyd didn't do as much, hauling in just 1 pass for 19 yards. He was thrown to 6 times. - Andre Ellington rushed for 91 yards on 15 carries, but wasn't much of a factor in the passing game, catching 1 ball. He also lost a goal-line carry to Dwyer. - "
