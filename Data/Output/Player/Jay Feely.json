   "comment":"Jay Feely hit the decisive field goal on the next play, which made me extremely happy because Cleveland still covered the 6.point spread. Skelton has now performed well in consecutive games. It might be worth it for Arizona to continue sitting Kevin Kolb so it can see if Skelton can be the starter next year. Kolb is owed $10.5 million in 2012, so it's conceivable that he could be a cap casualty prior to March if his backup continues to outplay him.    The Browns could also be making a quarterback change this offseason. Pat Shurmur said prior to kickoff that he would be using this contest as a litmus test to see how the offense would operate with a different signal-caller under center. Well, "

He went 28-of-49 for 407 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. He was especially sharp in the second half, misfiring on just 1 pass. He was a ridiculous 18-of-19 for 292 yards and a score following intermission. Palmer's touchdown went to ",
