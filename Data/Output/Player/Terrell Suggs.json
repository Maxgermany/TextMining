   "comment":"Suggs and other Ravens chasing after him. Smith was sacked a whopping 9 times in this contest. I know the 49ers had a tough preparation task traveling across the country on 3 days rest, but this was just inexcusable. Despite all the pressure, Smith did a pretty decent job at times. He went 15-of-24 for 140 yards and had a long touchdown to Tedd Ginn wiped out by a chop block. However, he also was guilty of a terrible interception at the end of the half where he forced a deep pass into the end zone that took a field goal opportunity off the board.    Only 2 of Smith's targets had more than 2 receptions: Michael Crabtree (6-54) and Vernon Davis (4-38). Ginn caught 2 balls (21 yards), but had an easy drop at the end of the game that turned the ball over on downs.    Both teams did a great job shutting down the run. Frank Gore (14-39) and Ray Rice (21-59) were both limited to worse than 3 yards per carry. Rice was also a factor in the passing attack with 3 receptions for 24 yards, finishing behind only Anquan Boldin (4-63) in each category.    Joe Flacco went 15-of-23 for 161 yards and a touchdown. Those stats don't look great, but he was able to convert 7-of-15 third downs against 1 of the NFL's top defenses. This was a good rebound performance for Flacco, who struggled at Seattle and was inconsistent last week against the Bengals. For whatever reason, Flacco plays down to his competition but steps up against elite opposition. I guess that can be a good thing.    As mentioned earlier, the Ravens notched 9 sacks. Suggs had 3 of them with a forced fumble. "

   "comment":"Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Suggs, were able to harass him quite frequently. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh's secondary was worse than Baltimore's beleaguered defensive backfield. The Steelers couldn't cover the Baltimore wideouts, as Joe Flacco was able to dissect Pittsburgh's stop unit, including on third-and-long situations; Flacco converted several of those with impressive passes, keeping Roethlisberger off the field. The Steelers definitely have to address the secondary early and often, which is what I have happening in my .    Flacco finished 18-of-29 for 259 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was sharp for most of the game, with his only blemish being a dropped interception in the second half. As mentioned, Flacco was fantastic on third-and-long situations, and he even converted a key 4.h-and-1 near midfield with a sneak.    Steve Smith must have wanted revenge on someone on Pittsburgh in a rubber match, so he was in 1 of his psychopathic modes. Smith was snatching everything out of the air and spinning the ball with fervor after being tackled. He caught 5 balls for 101 yards and just missed out on a touchdown when Flacco overthrew him in the second quarter. Torrey Smith, meanwhile, snatched just 2 passes for 28 yards, but came down with 1 of Flacco's scores. He nearly had a second when he got just 1 foot inbounds in the end zone. The other touchdown was passed to Crockett Gillmore.    With Bell out of the game, Justin Forsett was the top runner on the field. Forsett struggled down the stretch of the regular season, but that's because he was injured. Forsett managed just 36 yards on 16 carries, but had some nice bursts. He lost a fumble, however, which appeared to give the Steelers some life early in the 4.h quarter, as they capitalized with a touchdown. Forsett was vultured on the goal line by Bernard Pierce.    Speaking of running backs, Harris and Tate combined with 44 yards on the ground. Tate (5-19) ran well on the first drive, but fumbled the ball near midfield. He was fortunate Antonio Brown managed to jump on the ball and keep the possession alive. Harris (9-25) saw most of the workload after that, but save for 1 8.yard burst, he didn't do much with his opportunities.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, had a mixed outing. He finished 31-of-45 for 334 yards and a touchdown, but also threw 2 interceptions. He was under pressure more than he's used to, and he made some nice plays, including 1 in which he muscled out of sack and found Heath Miller (6-76) for a big gain on third-and-10. However, Roethlisberger was brought down 5 times, and 1 Baltimore defender was able to hit him as he was releasing the ball, which resulted in a tipped pick by Suggs, who somehow caught the ball in between his legs. On the very next Pittsburgh drive, Suggs forced a hold that nullified a Roethlisberger touchdown to "

   "comment":"Suggs as he released the ball, but his throwing motion is slower than Kessler's. McCown's second possession featured a near-interception and then a fumble, which he was lucky to recover. On the third drive, McCown launched a careless interception into double coverage. He was guilty of a strip-sack on the 4.h drive, as he showed zero awareness in the pocket. His fifth drive featured a tipped pass that was inches away from being a pick-six. McCown did not look ready to play, and the stats demonstrate it. He was 6-of-13 for 59 yards and 2 picks. He was infinitely worse than Kessler, and the Browns didn't have a chance to stay competitive with McCown under center. Again, it was a 13-7 contest when Jackson yanked a healthy Kessler. Perhaps Kessler would've been able to engineer some drives, and it's likely that he would've been more careful with the ball than McCown was. There's really no excuse for Jackson's abysmal decision-making, and if the Browns want to fire him as a result of this embarrassing performance, I couldn't blame them at all.    Only 2 Browns accumulated more than 25 receiving yards: "
