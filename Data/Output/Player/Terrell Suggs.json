Roethlisberger went 22-of-38 for 253 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was immobile early on and often lined up in the Pistol formation. However, as Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth noted, Roethlisberger's ankle loosened up as the game went on, and Big Ben regained some of his mobility.

   "comment":"Terrell Suggs and other Ravens chasing after him. Smith was sacked a whopping 9 times in this contest. I know the 49ers had a tough preparation task traveling across the country on 3 days rest, but this was just inexcusable. Despite all the pressure, Smith did a pretty decent job at times. He went 15-of-24 for 140 yards and had a long touchdown to Tedd Ginn wiped out by a chop block. However, he also was guilty of a terrible interception at the end of the half where he forced a deep pass into the end zone that took a field goal opportunity off the board.    Only 2 of Smith's targets had more than 2 receptions: "

   "comment":"Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Terrell Suggs as he released the ball, but his throwing motion is slower than Kessler's. McCown's second possession featured a near-interception and then a fumble, which he was lucky to recover. On the third drive, McCown launched a careless interception into double coverage. He was guilty of a strip-sack on the 4.h drive, as he showed zero awareness in the pocket. His fifth drive featured a tipped pass that was inches away from being a pick-six. McCown did not look ready to play, and the stats demonstrate it. He was 6-of-13 for 59 yards and 2 picks. He was infinitely worse than Kessler, and the Browns didn't have a chance to stay competitive with McCown under center. Again, it was a 13-7 contest when Jackson yanked a healthy Kessler. Perhaps Kessler would've been able to engineer some drives, and it's likely that he would've been more careful with the ball than McCown was. There's really no excuse for Jackson's abysmal decision-making, and if the Browns want to fire him as a result of this embarrassing performance, I couldn't blame them at all.    Only 2 Browns accumulated more than 25 receiving yards: "
