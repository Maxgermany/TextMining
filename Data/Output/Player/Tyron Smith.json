   "comment":"Tyron Smith had a hold on the Cowboys' penultimate drive that wiped out a big gain. - On 1 play, Smith had a hold on the Cowboys' penultimate drive that wiped out a big gain. - On 1 play, Kevin Ogletree dropped a touchdown and Felix Jones committed a chop block penalty. - Dez Bryant, who caught 13 balls for 95 yards and 2 touchdowns, dropped the game-tying 2.point conversion. - One of the aforementioned play-clock issues forced the Cowboys to call a timeout on their final drive. This forced a long, game-winning attempt for Dan Bailey, which sailed wide left. Game over. I'm sure I forgot to list some other pretty bad errors, but despite them, the Cowboys were still in position to come away with a win because they moved the ball at will against Baltimore's defense. They completely gashed the Ravens, as both DeMarco Murray (14-93) and Felix Jones (18-92, TD) ran right at Ray Lewis, who was terrible yet again when he was in the game (more on this later). Murray would've enjoyed a monstrous afternoon if he didn't leave with a foot sprain. It's just a reminder of how brittle Murray is.    Murray wasn't the only star player who got hurt. Haloti Ngata was banged up and limping around, while Lardarius Webb suffered a torn ACL. Oh, and then there was Lewis, who tore his triceps. Lewis could be out for the year.    As for the Ravens, they had success throwing the ball against Dallas' struggling secondary. Joe Flacco went 17-of-26 for 234 yards and a touchdown. His score went to Torrey Smith (2-24), but Anquan Boldin was the bigger factor."
