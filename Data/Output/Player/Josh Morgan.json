Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender.

Having said all of this, the turnovers that these quarterbacks committed were overshadowed by the clutch plays they made. Griffin was awesome in his first divisional game. He converted multiple 4.h downs, including 1 in his own territory where he danced around to avoid pressure and found his tight end for a 19-yard gain. He then scrambled for a 24-yard run and capped off the drive with a beautiful 30-yard lob to "

   "comment":"Morgan attempted a pass downfield to Griffin, who strangely was whistled for offensive pass interference. Why Washington didn't run a basic play with its stud quarterback is beyond me, but the result was zero points on 2 of the first 3 drives. The Steelers, meanwhile, scored on nearly all of their chances to establish a 20-6 halftime lead.    I mentioned Griffin's poor numbers; the Steelers took away his scrambling ability and forced him to throw exclusively. He was plagued by 10 drops - that's T-E-N drops - affecting his completion percentage. In fact, Leonard Hankerson and Dezmon Briscoe each had the ball sail through their hands in the end zone. Santana Moss had a couple of drops as well. Griffin was also pressured frequently, though his elusiveness limited Pittsburgh's defense to just 1 sack.    Griffin's lone touchdown went to Moss (4-21), who was 1 of only 3 Washington players to catch more than 1 pass. The others were Morgan (5-46) and Logan Paulsen (4-43)."
