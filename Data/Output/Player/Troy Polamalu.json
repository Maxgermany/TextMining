   "comment":"Troy Polamalu was able to pick the ball up and score a touchdown for perhaps the worst cover in NFL history. The entire forum was freaking out; check the Live In-Games Thread to see this. As the players were running off the field, with the score 17-10, someone upstairs called for a review. The official spent what seemed like 5 minutes in the replay booth. When he finally emerged, he ruled that there was an illegal forward pass. It seemed as though the touchdown would stand, but then he took the touchdown off the board, quelling the anger from San Diego bettors everywhere. I'm happy about this, but this was the shadiest turn of events I've ever seen. The official spent hours looking at a play that seemed obvious - seriously, the pass in question was backward by about 7 yards - and then mysteriously took the touchdown off the board. I'm willing to bet - and I'm dead serious here - that someone from Vegas (or another outfit that had major interest in San Diego covering) told the official to leave the game as an 11-10 final. So, as I was saying earlier, thank you, Vegas! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!    The 11-10 final is the first of its kind in NFL history. The Steelers managed 3 field goals and a safety.    Pittsburgh won this game at the last second, which was a miracle if you look at the penalty differential. San Diego was whistled twice for 5 yards. Pittsburgh had 13 penalties for 115 yards.    The Steelers also surrendered their first rushing touchdown since Week 5, though they did a good job bottling up "

He also picked up a big chunk of yardage on a long pass interference, though official Walt Coleman blew that call because there was no chance the Cleveland receiver was going to catch Lewis' underthrown attempt. Lewis at least proved that he can be a capable backup in this league. His backfield mate didn't have as much success, however. Montario Hardesty had just 37 yards on 14 carries. He ripped off a 16-yarder, so he gained just 21 yards on his 13 other attempts.    The Steelers struggled for most of the afternoon because they once again couldn't get out of their own way. They continued to kill themselves with dumb mistakes. For instance, they had 2 consecutive fails on 3rd-and-1 in the first quarter. After that, a 43-yard "
