   "comment":"Griffin is likely coming back next week anyway, but even if that weren't the case, Washington would likely to continue to roll with McCoy instead of Cousins. Cousins was atrocious. He misfired on just 6 first-half attempts, going 10-of-16 for 139 yards. However, he committed 2 turnovers prior to intermission. The first was a strip sack that Derrick Morgan forced, while the second was an awful interception that was underthrown by about 10 yards. Cousins displayed awful body language while he was in the game, which he has sported ever since that ugly Thursday night loss to the Giants. He has lost all confidence, while Washington lost all opportunity to trade him while his value was at its highest. McCoy was better, but only by default. His first pass was a 70-yard touchdown, but it was a short throw in which Pierre Garcon (5-87, TD) eluded the inept Blidi Wreh-Wilson and Michael Griffin. McCoy misfired only once throughout the second half, going 11-of-12 for 128 yards and the touchdown. However, he threw nothing but checkdowns, managing the game. Again, this is better than anything Cousins did, but McCoy is not anywhere close to being a starting-caliber quarterback. The Redskins need Griffin to return, but he'll probably just get hurt again anyway.    Like Cousins, "
