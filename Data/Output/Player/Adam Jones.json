  "comment":"Adam Jones also did a good job of tracking Brown most of the day.    Dalton was at his worst in the red zone. After getting a pass-interference call down 17-6 in the third quarter to take the Bengals down to Pittsburgh's 1-yard line, Dalton and company couldn't do anything on 3 tries at the goal line. Cincinnati ended up settling for a field goal to leave the team down 17-9, and that was the crux of the game.    The Bengals did make a late run down 8 points, but rookie Tyler Boyd fumbled after making a 6.yard reception, ending a good drive. The call was close, but Boyd's knee did appear to be down before the ball came out.    The good news for the Steelers, besides getting a divisional win, is that they won without a strong game from Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown. The Steelers' defense is of course their weakness in most games, but it came up big in big situations this week.   "
