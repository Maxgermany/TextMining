Cassel went 16-of-25 for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those numbers look good, but again, Pittsburgh's slow defense was mostly responsible for that. Outside of those 2 long gains, Cassel had just 2 completions longer than 13 yards, and just 1 that went beyond 16. Having said that, I don't want to take away everything from Cassel because he did good job of avoiding turnovers.    I'm sure the Minnesota faithful was pleased to see "
