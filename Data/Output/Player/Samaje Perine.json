The scary thing is Thompson could have been better had he not dropped a pass when he was wide open over the middle of the field. He is worth adding in PPR leagues, as he appears to be 1 of Cousins' preferred targets and a legitimate touchdown threat.    The Redskins suffered a lot of injuries in this game.

   "comment":"Samaje Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score. Cousins finished the day 25-of-37 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick. The interception was his only mistake, as he telegraphed a downfield throw to his receiver. However, Cousins' downfield accuracy improved in the second half, so that was a positive for him.    In terms of his receiving corps, Cousins was able to spread the ball around a lot. In fact, no player had more than 5 targets. The team's leading receiver was Chris Thompson (4-105). Thompson did a lot of his damage out of the backfield and was very elusive in space. He continued his breakout season, and he can be trusted as a FLEX play. As for the receivers, none really stood out. Josh Doctson (1-11) caught a touchdown. Terrelle Pryor (3-23) was mostly a non-factor. Jordan Reed (4-37) had a nice drive that saw him notch a few catches. Rigth now, there is no de facto top receiver, so it's hard to recommend any as a fantasy option. Doctson probably has the most upside, but even he is inconsistent.    With Robert Kelley out, the Redskins relied on Thompson to carry the load. He received 16 carries but was only able to get 33 yards. Thompson was bottled up in the second half for the most part. Samaje Perine also got a fair amount of action, and he was marginally better, gaining 23 yards on 9 carries. The team will be better off when Kelley is back to action, as the Redskins need a true power back for their offense.    In the first half, the San Francisco offense was completely lifeless. Under Brian Hoyer, the unit was barely able to accomplish anything. The 49ers were down 17-0 and Hoyer was 4-of-11 for just 34 yards before Kyle Shanahan chose to remove Hoyer from the game and play Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score.
