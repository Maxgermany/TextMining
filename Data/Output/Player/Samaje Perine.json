   "comment":"Samaje Perine (21 carries, 67 yards) will be the man to add. He looked decent in a lot of late action, but he hasn't fully adapted to the NFL yet. Thompson was absolutely electric for the Redskins. He had a couple of touchdowns on 3 carries, and that included a 61-yard burst on a delayed handoff. The scary thing is Thompson could have been better had he not dropped a pass when he was wide open over the middle of the field. He is worth adding in PPR leagues, as he appears to be 1 of Cousins' preferred targets and a legitimate touchdown threat.    The Redskins suffered a lot of injuries in this game. Kelley, Reed, "

  "comment":"Samaje Perine missed some drives because he was in concussion protocol, but he cleared it and was able to return to the field. It didn't really matter, as the Cowboys clamped down on him aside from 1 15-yard burst. Perine mustered just 38 yards on 12 carries, but he was able to help out his PPR owners with 3 catches for 31 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",
