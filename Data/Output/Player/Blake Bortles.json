Still, it was a bit surprising to see the Jaguars achieve their first victory against a Cleveland team that had been playing well when they lost to inferior squads like Tennessee and Pittsburgh beforehand. Despite winning, Blake Bortles did not play well. He went 17-of-31 for 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions (along with 5 scrambles, 37 rushing yards). The first pick wasn't his fault because he was hit as he released the ball. The most egregious interception occurred in the red zone, which disrupted a great drive. Bortles could've run and picked up a first down on the play, but he instead forced the pass late over the middle of the field, which was a terrible decision. Bortles also had some ugly throws throughout the afternoon.    The Jaguars were able to move the ball on the ground. "

He threw wobbly passes throughout the afternoon and looked hesitant on most of his plays. He also threw short of the first-down marker on third down and missed several open receivers.

   "comment":"Bortles wasn't terrible, Toby Gerhart didn't look like he was running at 2 mph, and Allen Hurns actually caught passes. And yet the Jaguars still lost by double digits. On the bright side, they actually covered the spread!    The Bengals were ripe for a letdown after a big win over Baltimore last week and with a game against division rival Cleveland this coming Thursday. However, Cincinnati drew Jacksonville, and the Jaguars just don't have the talent to go on the road and beat a playoff-caliber team like the Bengals. Jeremy Hill and Mohamed Sanu came up with huge performances to lead an injury-depleted Cincinnati squad to the win.    The Jaguars were fortunate to get on the board first as Bengals cornerback Terence Newman dropped interception deep in Jacksonville territory. Denard Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to A.J. Green, a clutch reception by Cedric Peerman, a chunk run by Hill, and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanu. Cincinnati's next score was set up by Rex Burkhead, getting a piece of a punt to shorten the field. Dalton dropped in a rainbow to Sanu, who made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 32-yard gain to the 10-yard line. On the next play, Sanu recovered a fumble by A.J. Green to maintain the scoring opportunity that ended with a field goal by Andy Dalton. The Jaguars went 3-and-out, thanks to a sack by Carlos Dunlap and Jaguars punter Bryan Anger had his second consecutive punt blocked, which Taylor Mays turned into a safety. Cincinnati could have broken the game open as Bortles had another interception dropped; this time by linebacker Emmanuel Lamur before the half."

By the time the Colts went up 20, Bortles was just 8-of-17 for 60 yards and the pick, which was a forced throw early in the game that led to an Indianapolis field goal. He also dropped the ball on a shotgun snap. Despite the miserable numbers, Bortles doesn't deserve tons of blame because he doesn't have much of a chance. He couldn't take any shots downfield because of his awful offensive line. He also took 4 sacks. The Jaguars desperately need to upgrade their offensive line this upcoming offseason.    "

   "comment":"Bortles took over, but didn't have enough time to do anything.    Flacco finished 20-of-30 for 221 yards. What won't show up in the box score is a nice throw he had to Torrey Smith downfield, which drew a long pass-interference penalty. Still, this was an underwhelming performance from Flacco, who has been enjoying the best season of his career thus far.    A big reason why the Ravens struggled to move the chains was Justin Forsett's ineptitude. Gaining just 48 yards on 16 carries, Forsett had many poor runs after looking so brilliant last week. He's playing injured though, so perhaps that was a part of the reason why he hurt his fantasy owners.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, both Smiths failed to produce. Steve Smith caught all 5 of his targets for 37 yards, while Torrey Smith (2-16), who shouldn't even be playing, did nothing positive outside of drawing that pass interference penalty. He also hurt his team with a holding infraction and a drop. Mike Brown (5-66) led the Ravens in receiving, while Owen Daniels (4-62) secured Flacco's sole touchdown.    Bortles, meanwhile, didn't have much of a chance behind his offensive line. He was constantly under siege, taking a ridiculous 8 sacks. Some of the sacks were brutal, as they occurred in Baltimore territory, negating touchdown opportunities. Some drops, including 1 from "

   "comment":"Bortles. J.J. Watt put an end to that by burning Luke Joeckel for a strip-sack that was recovered by the Jaguars, and a few plays later, Watt beat a running back for another sack. That forced Jacksonville to settle for a 53-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. Houston moved the ball into Jacksonville territory again, but Keenum threw behind DeAndre Hopkins (2-5). Dwayne Gratz caught a deflection and raced down the field for a 55-yard pick-6. It got worse for the Texans, as Foster went down with an injury and hobbled into the locker room. Even without having to defend Foster (5-23), the Jaguars' defense continued to get gashed, as Houston moved the ball down the field before Alfred Blue (17-39) scored a short touchdown. The Texans took a 14-10 lead into the half. Todman (7-52 rushing, 5-46) got the Jaguars moving in the third quarter with a 34-yard run into Houston territory, but Scobee missed a 51-yard field goal. Keenum and the Texans' offensive line started breaking down as the fill-in signal-caller turned the ball over on a coverage strip-sack by Brian Davis. The Jaguars went to a trick play on the next snap as Cecil Shorts (5-47) took a lateral and threw to a wide-open Todman for a 23-yard touchdown after Brian Cushing blew the coverage. However, the Texans answered with a long drive, as Johnson had his way with the Jaguars' secondary. The drive finished with Johnson beating Gratz for an 8-yard touchdown to give Houston a 21-17 lead. Midway through the fourth quarter, Watt burned Joeckel and the left guard with a spin move to get a safety of Bortles. Bortles had to get rid of the ball, yet held on too long. Jacksonville had 1 more chance, and Bortles converted a clutch fourth-down pass to get into Houston territory. He then took off on a 34-yard run to the Texans' 10-yard line. Houston's defense though came up with a goal-line stand to clinch the victory.    Bortles finished completing only 14-of-33 passes for 117 yards. Until the final drive, he really didn't play well. The rookie was extremely inaccurate and dreadful on third down as he didn't convert a single third down all game (0-for-11). Bortles seemed scared to push the ball downfield and got lucky as Houston's defense dropped 3 would-be interceptions. "

   "comment":"Bortles no room to breathe. They constantly swarmed him and accumulated 5 sacks, mostly past the left tackle spot, which was vacated by an injured Luke Joeckel. Sam Young, who took over for Joeckel, was anemic. If he has to start going forward, the Jaguars may not score any points against anyone.    Going back to Newton, his numbers definitely could've been better. Ted Ginn (2-54) dropped a touchdown, and then Greg Olsen had a score nullified by his own offensive pass interference, which was completely unnecessary because he would've caught the ball had he kept running. Newton's pick was probably a miscommunication, as the pass sailed to no 1 in particular.    You may notice that Olsen disappointed, logging just 1 reception for 11 yards. The Jaguars were determined to take him out of the game, using bracket coverage constantly throughout the afternoon. The interference call really hurt his fantasy owners. Because of this performance, Olsen could be obtained as a buy-low target in fantasy leagues.    Jonathan Stewart didn't have much running room, gaining 56 yards on 18 carries, but with most of it (22 yards) coming on 1 attempt. He also caught 4 balls for 25 receiving yards.    As for the Jaguars, Bortles was anemic, going 22-of-40 for just 183 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The huge liability at left tackle really hurt him, but aside from a couple of impressive drives, he was woeful. His first pass was a poor overthrow, which was a sign of how the afternoon would go. One of the picks was taken back for 6, as he telegraphed the throw. The other happened because he was hit as he released the ball. He also took some bad sacks. A few weren't his fault, as Young looked like a human turnstile, but Bortles struggled to release the ball quickly enough.    Bortles' supporting cast didn't help him. I mentioned the offensive line on numerous occasions already, but the receivers let him down as well. "

   "comment":"Bortles is improved, while wide receiver Allen Robinson and running back T.J. Yeldon are flashing play-making potential. Conversely, Miami wasn't impressive in its win against the Redskins last week and followed it up by dropping a winnable game on a road. Ryan Tannehill didn't get a lot of help, and the Dolphins' defense was prone to allowing big plays downfield. Miami played with a serious lack of discipline as 13 penalties for 112 yards played a huge role in the Dolphins dropping this game. A huge loss for the Dolphins also came when left tackle Brandon Albert suffered an injury in the first half and did not return. His injury could have a huge impact on Miami's season.    The Jaguars took the opening kickoff and moved down the field on the Dolphins' defense. The big play was a 36-yard pass to Robinson, and the drive ended with Bortles throwing a 3-yard scoring strike to the emerging No. 1 wideout. The Dolphins answered when a tipped pass fell into "

   "comment":"Bortles from marching down the field for 2 early touchdowns and the winning score at the end, thanks to blown coverages and bad tackling, is very disconcerting. The story of this game, however, is how bad E.J. Manuel was. The coaching staff told Manuel to rip it prior to the game. That backfired big time; in the first 20 minutes of the contest, Manuel lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown and then followed that up with a pick-6 on the very next play. After that, he fired an interception into double coverage on a third-and-16. Manuel also failed to hit a tight end in stride earlier, negating a touchdown, and then overthrew an open receiver in the end zone. During the opening 20 minutes, Manuel was 4-of-12 for 50 yards, 2 picks and a lost fumble. Manuel played better later, though only by default. He finished 24-of-42 for 298 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. However, he was responsible for some horrible clock management on the final drive and was lucky to get away with a fumble on a horrible sneak attempt. Manuel also saw 1 of his teammates recover another 1 of his fumbles, and he spent the afternoon overthrowing receivers downfield. He was absolutely terrible, and he wouldn't even be in the NFL right now if he didn't happen to be a first-round pick. Manuel needs to begin reaching out to CFL teams because that's where he's going to be in a couple of years.    Meanwhile, the Buffalo defense played like hot garbage. Surrendering that final score was inexcusable. Granted, Nickell Robey was whistled for 1 of the worst pass interferences you'll ever see on a third-and-15, but the Jaguars were able to punch it into the end zone with a deep pass after that. The Bills are in deep trouble now at 3-4.    I'd like to give Blake Bortles credit for engineering a winning drive, but he nearly gave the game away right before that with a pick-6 on a late throw over the middle. Bortles went 13-of-29 for 182 yards, 2 touchdowns and that interception. Save for a couple of drives, Bortles was a train wreck.    The Jaguars moved the chains primarily on the ground. "

   "comment":"Bortles knows what the line of scrimmage is. He had 2 illegal forward passes in this game, as he was way over the line of scrimmage on both occasions. His awareness rating in Madden is plummeting as you're reading this.    The Jaguars' hopes of staying in the playoff race were dealt a crushing blow with a loss to San Diego, a team that entered with a 2-8 record. Jacksonville's weak secondary couldn't contain Philip Rivers, while the Jaguars' offense struggled in the red zone despite moving the ball well all day.    Jacksonville's first play from scrimmage was a Blake Bortles hitting a 21-yard pass to T."

   "comment":"Bortles threw for 5 touchdowns. Marcus Mariota accumulated 4 scores of his own, but was able to come away with a victory in a fantastic shootout. Mariota was spectacular. Granted, he was battling Jacksonville's incompetent secondary, but he looked just as great as he did in the season opener at Tampa Bay. I thought he might play well because he had Kendall Wright back, but Wright suffered an injury with a minute remaining in the opening half. Instead, there were 2 factors - besides the Jaguars' inept defensive backfield - that helped Mariota put together 1 of the best performances of his young career. First was Mariota's willingness to run. I don't know why Mariota didn't utilize his legs in many of his previous games, but he took advantage of his best attribute in this contest. He scrambled 9 times for 112 rushing yards, including an 87-yard touchdown. He ran circles around the Jacksonville defense, which didn't appear to realize that Mariota is capable of running effectively when he wants to. Second, Dorial Green-Beckham emerged. The second-round rookie would've been a top-10 pick had he been clean off the field. He showcased his talents in this game, catching 5 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars had no answer for him, as his only blemish was letting a ball go off his hands, which turned out to be intercepted. Green-Beckham's great play allowed Mariota to post a strong passing line: 20-of-29, 268 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick. Mariota's sole blemish was a strip-sack that eventually led to a Jacksonville touchdown.    After Green-Beckham, Delanie Walker snatched 8 balls for 92 yards and a touchdown. Those were Mariota's 2 primary targets, as Wright was next with just 3 receptions for 28 yards. He had a drop prior to getting hurt.    The Titans actually ran the ball well, even when excluding Mariota's numbers. Both Antonio Andrews and David Cobb were given 13 carries, accumulating 58 and 40 yards, respectively. Andrews found the end zone once.    As for the Jaguars, Bortles, as mentioned, threw 5 touchdowns. He was battling a weak secondary, but it's still remarkable that he was able to go 24-of-36 for 322 yards and 5 scores because he was missing Allen Hurns. That, apparently, didn't matter, as he was able to engineer so many successful drives. He even nearly threw a sixth touchdown, but "

   "comment":"Bortles is the most improved quarterback in the NFL this year, and the credit goes to new offensive coordinator Greg Olson. If the Jaguars can improve their offensive line and pass defense this offseason, they could be a serious playoff contender in 2016.    The Jaguars were fortunate on the opening drive, as the Colts dropped 2 interceptions, and 1 went for a chunk completion to tight end Clay Harbor, who caught the pass while on the ground. T.J. Yeldon ran well, and Myers connected on a 46-yard field goal. The Colts answered right back as Matt Hasselbeck threw a ball up for T.Y. Hilton and Nick Marshall mistimed his jump to allow a 57-yard reception to Jacksonville's 11-yard line. The Jaguars held the Colts to a chip-shot field goal. Shortly later, the Jaguars got caught on a blitz, and Hasselbeck quickly hit Zurlon Tipton on the run for a gain of 27 yards. A pass to Hilton went for about 15 to Jacksonville's 10-yard line, but once again Indianapolis settled for a short field goal. Backed up deep in his own territory, a bad shotgun snap hit off the fingers of Bortles and rolled into the end zone. "

Luke Joeckel was the No. 2-overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, but he is a liability for the Jaguars' offense. Going against Joeckel, Watt and Whitney Mercilus combined for 5 sacks ((2 strip-sacks). Joeckel looked pathetic trying to block them.    The Texans' second possession produced a field goal as they got close to the end zone thanks to a completion to DeAndre Hopkins and a 20-yard pass to rookie Jaelen Strong. On their next drive, they moved methodically down the field before Hoyer connected with Jonathan Grimes for a 14-yard touchdown. The Jaguars answered as blown coverage by Brian Cushing let Allen Robinson get open and take off down the field for a gain of 36 yards. That led to a Jacksonville field goal. Denard Robinson soon fumbled the ball away, and Watt recovered it in Jacksonville territory. A 25-yard run by Akeem Hunt set up a first-and-goal before Grimes scored his second touchdown on a short run to give the Texans a 17-3 lead. Just before the half, Andre Hal intercepted Blake Bortles with a great diving catch, and that set up a 51-yard field goal from Nick Novak and the Texans took a 20-3 lead into the half."

   "comment":"Bortles threw a pass on third down, and it was tipped and picked. The Ravens, staying within a point, were able to barely move into field goal range on their final drive, and the ultra-clutch Justin Tucker connected to secure the victory.    It's strange the Ravens scored only 19 points considering a couple of items. First, the Jaguars were missing 1 of their starting cornerbacks, Prince Amukamara, while safety Tashaun Gipson wasn't 100 percent. And second, Joe Flacco completed 21 consecutive passes in this contest. The streak was snapped when Mike Wallace dropped a ball in the end zone, which was a shame because Flacco was just 3 completions short of Donovan McNabb's record of 24. Flacco finished 29-of-40 for 214 yards and a rushing touchdown that was a result of a Wallace block. Flacco, however, threw 2 interceptions, both of which occurred in the final quarter. The first pick was the result of Jalen Ramsey tipping a pass, while the second occurred because Flacco was hit upon releasing the ball. Ramsey, by the way, was absolutely outstanding. He looks like the real deal, though he needs to start respecting some of the heralded veterans instead of trash-talking them like he did to Aaron Rodgers and Steve Smith during the first 3 weeks.    Only 1 Raven logged more than 42 receiving yards, and that was Steve Smith, who secured 8 balls for 87 yards. Smith came up huge on a fourth down during Baltimore's game-winning drive. Dennis Pitta was next on the receiving list (6-42), while Wallace (3-34) didn't do much outside of springing Flacco on his touchdown run.    It's no surprise that Baltimore didn't run the ball very well. Terrance West gained 45 yards on 10 carries, but most of that came on a 15-yard gain. Justin Forsett (7-20) wasn't much of a factor. The Ravens really need Kenneth Dixon to return, as he's their most talented running back.    Speaking of the ground game, many made a big deal of Chris Ivory's return, and I'm not sure why. Looking slow and sluggish, Ivory mustered only 14 yards on 12 carries, looking very much like the sloth-like back who was benched by the Jets at the end of last season. T.J. Yeldon outgained Ivory, 17-14, despite having half as many carries. It's a huge mistake to give Ivory the ball over Yeldon, as the latter is immensely more talented. Either way, the Jaguars will have trouble running as long as Kelvin Beachum and Brandon Linder are out with injuries.    Blake Bortles missing 2 linemen didn't appear to hurt as much as anticipated, as the Ravens didn't collect a sack until the fourth quarter. However, they started putting lots of pressure on him then, and Bortles self-destructed. Bortles threw a crushing interception that I referenced earlier, and he was picked off again on the ensuing drive. Bortles actually threw 3 interceptions, and the first 1 was the worst of them all, as he fired a pass off his back foot, allowing "

If it weren't for some missed kicks against the Ravens, the Jaguars would be 3-2 and a real threat in the AFC South. In the grand scheme of things, the Bears aren't going anywhere this year, so they are better off losing to get a higher draft position for the 2017 NFL Draft.    On the Jaguars' opening drive, they went 90 yards down the field, but Allen Robinson dropped a would-be touchdown pass, and Tracy Porter caught the deflection for an interception to rob Jacksonville of early points. The Bears took advantage with a drive led by passes to Alshon Jeffery to set up a short field goal for Connor Barth. Chicago got the ball back and moved down the field using Jeffery some more. Jordan Howard then plunged into the end zone from a few yards out to take 10-0 lead into the half. Jeffery abused Jacksonville rookie Jalen Ramsey in the first half to the tune of 6 receptions for 90 yards. After trading punts in the third quarter, the Bears got moving when they hit Cameron Meredith for 36 yards on a wide receiver screen. Ka'Deem Carey added a 16-yard run to set up a first-and-goal, but the Jaguars held Chicago to 3 points. Jacksonville got moving with passes of 25 and 29 yards to Allen Hurns to set up the Jaguars inside the Bears' 5-yard line to start the fourth quarter. Chris Ivory soon plunged into the end zone to cut the Bears' lead to 13-7. The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A "

   "comment":"Bortles not taking his career seriously, it's inconsequential. Jacksonville's owner had already been attending meetings and reportedly contemplating a change. With an extended layoff until the next game, Shad Khan may decide to pull the trigger after watching his team absolutely humiliate itself on a national stage. The thing is, it may not matter. Bradley doesn't appear to be a good head coach, but I don't think he's the problem. All I heard about Bortles coming out of Central Florida was that he was a heavy partier, and there were rumblings that he hasn't taken his career seriously. It really shows, as he's regressed despite having some excellent offensive coaching aiding him. Bortles' passes were all over the place. The final stats don't show it - Bortles finished 33-of-54, 337 yards, 3 touchdowns - but he began the game 4-of-11 for 26 yards and was 8-of-16 for 64 yards in the opening half. The rest of his numbers came in garbage time as the Titans played a very soft prevent defense. As he had done masterfully last season, Bortles racked up a ton of yards, as well as 3 touchdowns, in meaningless action. The early-game numbers are very indicative of how poor Bortles was. He overthrew "

   "comment":"Bortles self-destructed. Much like the Chiefs last week, Houston could've utilized the Bobby Boucher offense and still came away with a victory. Some kneel-downs actually would've been preferrable to what Brock Osweiler did in this contest. The good news is that Osweiler didn't turn the ball over. The bad news is that he couldn't get anything going throughout the afternoon. His woeful numbers tell the tale, as Osweiler finished 14-of-27 for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's not a typo - in this day and age, when passing is easier than ever because bogus illegal-contact and defensive-holding penalties are called all the time, Osweiler accumulated just 99 yards. Osweiler was very underwhelming, as you might imagine. His completions were mostly dinks and dunks, and whenever he tried going deeper, he couldn't connect at all with DeAndre Hopkins. The Texans couldn't get anything going downfield, and this will cost them against opponents that aren't, well, the Jaguars.    Osweiler has been capable of what appeared to be the unthinkable prior to this season: rendering Hopkins useless in fantasy football. Hopkins had performed on a high level with Brian Hoyer, Ryan Mallett and Ryan Fitzpatrick in the past, but that hasn't been the case with Osweiler. The former Bronco signal-caller targeted Hopkins 13 times, but was successful on just 5 occasions. Hopkins finished with 48 yards. He was just 1 of 2 Texans to accumulate more than 10 receiving yards, with C.J. Fiedorowicz being the other (3-26). Osweiler threw short touchdowns to backup tight ends Stephen Anderson and Ryan Griffin, 1 of which occurred following a punt return taken to the 6-yard line.    The Texans were able to move the chains on the ground, as Lamar Miller rushed for 83 yards on 15 carries, though most of his yardage came on a 45-yard burst. Akeem Hunt (8-52) had a nice day, and he should've had more yardage, but he had a long gain wiped out by a Chris Clark hold. The right tackle had an abysmal afternoon, as it's clear that the Texans miss Derek Newton.    Moving on to the Jaguars, I mentioned that Bortles self-destructed. The numbers don't show it, as Bortles easily out-passed Osweiler, going 32-of-49 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. As is usually the case with Bortles, however, this was all phantom yardage that occurred late in the game. And yes, if you're wondering, Bortles was actually worse than Osweiler. Bortles was 24-of-34 for only 160 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception by the time the game was 21-10. He gave the game away early with a pick-6. Displaying horrific mechanics, Bortles made a late throw on the outside, and it was taken back the other way, as the Jacksonville players showed very little interest in tackling. Bortles had a second pick that was actually ruled a fumble, as he fired a short, backward pass unnecessarily hard toward "

   "comment":"Bortles look even worse than he already is. Thanks to the performance of the Broncos' stop unit, any quarterback could've started for the Broncos and prevailed.    Paxton Lynch completed half of his passes, going 12-of-24 for only 104 yards. Lynch was inaccurate throughout the afternoon, beginning right away when he was way wide of Emmanuel Sanders on the initial third down of the afternoon. Part of the problem happened to be poor mechanics; Lynch's footwork was awful on a pass that was way high toward Jordan Norwood on another third down. Lynch was hurt by a substantial drop by Virgil Green, but his positive throws were few and far between. Despite this, Gary Kubiak showed an unbelievable amount of trust in Lynch, calling for passes on numerous plays while his team was attempting to run out the clock, including on a second-and-12 with 4:30 remaining, up only 7. Lynch actually scrambled twice in these instances, and he almost picked up the first down on a third-and-4.    With Lynch struggling, only 2 Bronco receivers accumulated more than 10 yards, which is just sad. Thomas led the way with 6 grabs for 61 yards, including a diving catch to put the team into field-goal range at the end of the first half. Sanders (3-28) was the recipient of numerous inaccurate passes.    Devontae Booker handled most of the workload, but didn't do much, gaining only 35 yards on 18 carries. He at least helped his fantasy owners with a touchdown on a very powerful run. Kapri Bibbs actually outgained Booker (5-49), thanks to a 24-yard burst. It's been very difficult to run on the Jaguars, so this wasn't much of a surprise.    Jacksonville's defense played well overall once again, but as is the case every week, the unit was betrayed by Bortles, who was horrendous as ever. I actually expected Bortles to throw 2 pick-sixes against 1 of the NFL's elite defenses, but he at least gave us 1. It was Bortles' 11th pick-6 in 3 years. I have Jacksonville taking Lamar Jackson in my 2018 NFL Mock Draft, which was updated this weekend. Bortles failed to complete half of his passes, going 19-of-42 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. He also lost a fumble to end the game. Bortles' first pick wasn't his fault because "

   "comment":"Bortles faltered. Houston's win allowed it to hold a tie with the Titans atop the AFC South, while the Jacksonville loss has resulted in Gus Bradley being fired. Click the link to see my grade for this.    Savage is almost certain to hold the starting job in the wake of this victory. He finished 23-of-36 for 260 yards in slightly more than a half of action. Compare this to Osweiler's line of 6-of-11 for 48 yards and 2 interceptions. Bill O'Brien would have a mutiny on his hands if he went back to Osweiler, especially since the Texans were able to win.    DeAndre Hopkins definitely would be pissed if Osweiler started once again. Hopkins has struggled all year statistically because of Osweiler's incompetence. However, he managed to catch 8 balls for 87 yards with Savage. He also drew a pass-interference flag on Jalen Ramsay in the second half when the Texans were mounting their comeback. Elsewhere, Ryan Griffin (8-85) was next on the stat sheet, while Wil Fuller (4-42) made an amazing, 1-handed catch for a gain of 22, which led to a field goal.    Good news/bad news/worse news for Lamar Miller: The good news is that Miller was able to score a touchdown. The bad news is that his YPC was pretty pedestrian, as he gained just 63 yards on 22 carries. The worse news is that Miller appeared to sustain some sort of injury in the final couple of minutes.    Moving on to the Jaguars, they struggled offensively for most of the afternoon. They had 1 solid drive in the early going, as the Texans' pass rush was inexplicably absent before Jadeveon Clowney sacked Bortles to disrupt the drive. Bortles eventually scored on the ground off Osweiler's second interception, and as mentioned, Jacksonville had a kickoff return touchdown. Otherwise, the Jaguars couldn't move the chains at all, mustering only 150 net yards of offense. Bortles, to put it nicely, was awful. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 12-of-28 for 92 yards, a rushing touchdown and an interception, which the CBS announcer deemed to be a bad decision. Bortles' passes were all over the place, as he showed poor mechanics and constantly fired ugly throws off his back foot. Bortles has regressed this year, and if the Jaguars had a viable alternative, I'm sure they would've benched Bortles by now.    Bortles' struggles once again ruined a game for "

By the end of the third quarter, Bortles was just 11-of-23 for 89 yards and the 2 interceptions. The Titans sacked him only twice, but they swarmed the backfield and disrupted Jacksonville's offense when this game still was in question.    Meanwhile, Tennessee's offense took a while to get going. "

Bortles found the end zone later in the opening quarter, lofting another nice touch pass to Marcedes Lewis for a touchdown, marking the first time the Ravens allowed an opponent to convert in the red zone all year."

Right out of the gate, Rams wideout Pharaoh Cooper returned the opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown. He made a great spin move away from a scrum to escape to the sideline, where he found open field to run away from the Jacksonville coverage unit. On the Jaguars' first play from scrimmage, Fournette ran untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. At just 15 seconds into the game, the score was tied at 7. The Rams produced a field goal drive with Greg the Leg Zuerlein drilling a 56-yarder. The Jaguars answered with a drive that produced a 22-yard touchdown with a screen pass to Chris Ivory (9-74). The Rams took the lead with a drive that saw them moved down the field with Goff completing passes to Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp. Near the end zone, Goff connected with Gerald Everett on a shovel pass for a 4-yard touchdown. Late in the second quarter, the Jaguars had a punt blocked by Corey Littleton with Malcolm Brown recovering the ball and charging into the end zone from a few yards out to give Los Angeles a 24-14 lead. Jaguars kicker Jason Myers then missed a 54-yard field goal on the final play of the first half. Woods (5-70) fumbled the ball at midfield in the third quarter after getting stripped by Telvin Smith, and the Jaguars recovered. Jacksonville got 3 out of the turnover to make it 24-17. The Jaguars got the ball back and started moving well with Bortles, hitting Allen Hurns (3-37) for 14 yards and Marqise Lee for 20 yards."

Bortles also ran well - 5 scrambles, 34 rushing yards - but Jacksonville could have won by a much wider margin if he wasn't so off. Bortles began the game with an overthrow on a third down. He later had a pick-6 dropped on what should've been an easy interception, as the Charger defender had the ball right in his hands. And if that wasn't bad enough, Bortles committed an utterly inexcusable mistake, heaving a horrible interception on an overthrow in Charger territory when Jacksonville was in position for a game-tying field goal late in regulation. But as bad as Bortles was, he didn't make the worst mistake. That came from "
