   "comment":"Francois on another interception. The second half was just a matter of Green Bay holding on and staying healthy. The drives that mostly ended in touchdowns earlier in the afternoon were limited to field goals in the third quarter, but the points made sure the game stayed well in hand, allowing them to rest Rodgers for the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Oakland finally got on the board on its first possession of the second half via a very effective 80-yard march with all 9 plays going for positive yardage highlighted by a 34-yard pass to Heyward-Bey (5-78).
