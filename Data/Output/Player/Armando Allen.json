The Packers really miss 5.tech Ryan Pickett, and they'll be much better versus the run when he returns from his concussion. That being said, Bell really impressed me. He had a good number of yards after contact, displayed great vision and patience, and picked up his blocking assignments well. He made 2 mistakes though, 1 of which was a fumble at the goal line that was luckily picked up by guard Allen (11-40) found huge holes, as Chicago's offensive line dominated Green Bay's front.
