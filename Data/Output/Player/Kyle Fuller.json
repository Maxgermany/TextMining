  "comment":"Kyle Fuller, linebacker Danny Trevathan and defensive lineman Akiem Hicks. The only reason this game went to overtime was the Ravens' special teams unit producing 2 touchdowns. If Baltimore narrowly misses the playoffs, the team will look back at this game as 1 it should have won.    Throughout the first half, both offenses struggled to move the ball. The Bears got moving early in the second quarter with a face mask on Tony Jefferson and Trubisky taking off on a 19-yard scramble. The drive stalled inside the 10-yard line, and Chicago settled for a field goal. Late in the second quarter, Ravens wide receiver Breshad Perriman was cleaned out on a hit downfield, and Bears cornerback Bryce Callahan caught the deflected ball for an interception. Callahan returned the interception 52 yards to set up Chicago at the Ravens' 20-yard line. Two plays later, Tarik Cohen took a pitch and then threw to a wide open Zach Miller (2-25-1) for a touchdown after Jefferson lost eye discipline to let Miller run free. Before halftime, Joe Flacco led a field goal drive, and the Bears took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. Chicago's defense continued to control the point of attack in the third quarter, with Hicks notching a sack to get the ball back for the Bears. Trubisky started a drive crossing midfield with an 18-yard completion to Kendall Wright. To end the drive, Trubisky rolled out and found Dion Sims (2-42-1) for a 27-yard touchdown. Baltimore got right back into the game as Bobby Rainey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. It was a weird play where Rainey was tripped up by his own teammate and the Bears' coverage unit stopped pursuing thinking he was down, but Rainey got up to dart downfield for the score. Late in the third quarter, the Ravens got a well-timed turnover as Eric Weddle stripped Cohen (14-32) of the ball, and Baltimore pounced on it to get set up at the Bears' 39-yard line. Flacco moved the ball inside the 10 with a third-down conversion to Nick Boyle, but Chicago's defense held strong to force a field goal and maintain a 17-13 lead. Baltimore got the ball back when Ladarius Webb blindsided Trubisky to force a fumble that the Ravens recovered near midfield. The Ravens moved well into Chicago territory before Flacco threw to a well-covered receiver. Kyle Fuller tipped the pass away, and Adrian Amos caught the deflection, returning the ball 90 yards for a touchdown.",
