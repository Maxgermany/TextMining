   "comment":"Austin Seferian-Jenkins benefited from Winston's junk-time stats. Evans had just 3 grabs for 36 yards in the first half, but he finished with 9 catches for 157 yards. He dropped another pass, but he would've enjoyed a much better game had Winston not missed him on numerous occasions. Seferian-Jenkins, meanwhile made only 3 grabs for 29 yards, but he was able to haul in a touchdown at the very end.    Doug Martin and Charlie Sims both ran extremely well. Martin burst for 91 yards on just 18 carries, while Sims (7-50) also posted an impressive stat line. It was odd to see the Rams struggle so much versus the run. However, they did manage to stuff Martin on a 4.h down before halftime, and they were able to force him into a fumble.    Some Rams fans were trying to chant Keep the Rams! Keep the Rams! Perhaps St. Louis would keep its team if more fans showed up. Here's a shot of the stands 20 minutes prior to kickoff last Sunday versus the Lions. Try not to laugh too hard:   "

   "comment":"Austin Seferian-Jenkins for a touchdown on third-and-goal. The Jets scored once again to go up 14-0, thanks to Mike Gillislee's fumble inside the red zone. McCown once again did his thing, hitting Jermaine Kearse for 16 yards on a third-and-5, and then following that up with a 31-yard bomb to Kerley. It looked like the Jets were going to upset the Patriots, but that's when Tom Brady happened. Brady caught fire, aside from an interception on a poor deep shot into double coverage. The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by "
