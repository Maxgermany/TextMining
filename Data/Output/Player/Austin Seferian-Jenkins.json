While Barr helped his team triumph with 8 tackles, 1 sack and the strip-fumble for a touchdown, Bridgewater didn't have as good of a game. He spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, struggling to convert first downs as a consequence. The Vikings were just 6-of-15 on third down, mostly because Bridgewater constantly tossed passes short of the first-down marker. Having said that, Bridgewater's game-tying drive at the end of regulation was a thing of beauty. He found Greg Jennings for a couple of decent gains and moved his team well into field-goal range. He could have kept the possession going, but simply ran out of time. Part of the reason for this is because the officals screwed up on 1 play, ruling that Jennings didn't go out of bounds when he clearly did. His forward progress wasn't stopped or anything, so the refs blew it by allowing 30 or so seconds to run off the clock. Bridgewater even had to hurry as a result, and he nearly threw a pick, as his pass was dropped by a defender. Bridgewater finished 24-of-42 for 241 yards and a touchdown to Jennings (3-38). He scrambled just once for 3 rushing yards. Bridgewater isn't a running quarterback, but he can move around and do stuff with his legs, as we all saw in the Atlanta victory, so he should use more of his mobility going forward if he's too worried about taking chances downfield. Otherwise, he's just Matt Leinart.    It was nice to see Cordarrelle Patterson bounce back. Patterson tied for the team lead in receptions with Chase Ford. They both caught 6. with Patterson accmulated 86 receiving yards.    Jerick McKinnon got almost all of the carries once again, tallying 83 yards on 16 carries. Matt Asiata caught 4 passes for 26 receiving yards, but did nothing with his quartet of rushing attempts, gaining only 1 yard in the process.    The Vikings weren't great on third downs, but the Buccaneers were far worse, converting just 1 of 12 tries. Tampa couldn't get anything going offensively until the end when Glennon pulled out what appeared to be a game-winning drive out of nowhere. Glennon was awful otherwise. He went 19-of-28 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception on a deep shot, but those numbers aren't indicative of how poorly he played. Glennon constantly panicked in the pocket and stopped looking downfield. Barr and Everson Griffen terrorized him. Griffen achieved only 1 sack, but harassed Glennon with numerous hits and pressures.    Glennon's score went to Seferian-Jenkins (3-26). Tampa's other rookie, "

Winston's sole score was a rifle throw to Seferian-Jenkins with a 21-yard strike - a major improvement over his awful interception last week. Winston's sole score was a rifle throw to Vincent Jackson in the end zone just prior to halftime. Winston had only a couple of bad plays, 1 of which was an overthrow toward Seferian-Jenkins in the end zone. Another was a fumble on a strip-sack in the 4.h quarter. Nevertheless, he played well. Winston threw the ball just 9 times after intermission because the Buccaneers were way ahead at that point. It's a shame from a statistical standpoint; Winston could've enjoyed a huge game, as the Saints couldn't get any pressure on him; he had all day to throw on many occasions. The secondary sucked as well; Winston's yardage doesn't include a long pass interference on "

Winston's aerial score went to Seferian-Jenkins drop - and is a completely different player than the 1 who embarrassed himself in the season opener.    Winston's aerial score went to Mike Evans (5-61), who dropped a pass, per usual. He was outgained only by Vincent Jackson (3-87), while Seferian-Jenkins (3-31) also contributed in his first game back, but was guilty of dropping a touchdown.    Martin, as mentioned, had 2 long runs that were called back. Thus, he should've eclipsed the century mark. Instead, Martin gained 95 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. His only blemish on the afternoon was a lost fumble near midfield that set up an Atlanta score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. The errors began early when a face mask gave Tampa a first-and-goal, leading to a touchdown. Later, there was 1 sequence in which Atlanta was penalized on 3 of 4 plays, which set up an easy Buccaneer field goal. The Falcons also continued to screw up in the red zone. They once again resorted to kicking too many field goals.    Ryan went 30-of-45 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and the game-ending interception in which he inexplicably didn't see Tampa's best linebacker. He struggled with pressure, especially in the red zone, which is ridiculous considering that the Buccaneers were missing their 2 top pass-rushers, including All-Pro Gerald McCoy. That's how bad Atlanta's offensive line is.    Ryan's inconsistency and lack of protection prevented him from hooking up with "

Winston's other scores went to Charles Sims (3-32), Brandon Myers (1-4) and Seferian-Jenkins (1-30). Of those, Sims' touchdown is most noteworthy, as his score was a heroic effort right before halftime in which he broke numerous tackles.    Sims saw only 4 carries, however, as "

   "comment":"Austin Seferian-Jenkins dropped a touchdown for the Jets, setting up a missed 34-yard Nick Folk field goal.Seferian-Jenkins dropped a touchdown for the Jets, setting up a missed 34-yard Nick Folk field goal. And if all of that wasn't enough, Ryan Fitzpatrick was picked off, thanks to Eric Rowe's perfect coverage on Brandon Marshall. The Patriots quickly scored after that, and it was suddenly 20-0. Just like that, the game was over.    The Patriots didn't need to be great offensively, and they weren't, but they still did enough to put the Jets away. Tom Brady finished 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns. He did this in 3 quarters of action before taking the final 15 minutes off. Brady obviously didn't have the best game, but he did have plenty of time in the pocket, as the Jets had absolutely no pass rush.    Because New England didn't have to throw the ball very much, only 1 player accumulated more than 32 receiving yards. That was Edelman, who snatched 5 balls for 89 yards. As mentioned earlier, he should've drawn pass interference in the end zone. Malcolm Mitchell (3-29) disappointed his fantasy owners, failing to come up with an end-zone grab in the early going, while James White (3-32) and Martellus Bennett (2-19) caught Brady's touchdowns. White dropped a long gain.    LeGarrette Blount and Dion Lewis nearly split the workload evenly. Blount ended up with more carries than Lewis, 20-16, but only because the Patriots fed Blount while running out the clock. Lewis had more attempts in the opening half, 9-7. Lewis also outgained Blount, 52-50, but Blount scored twice.    As for the pathetic Jets, Petty was knocked out without completing a pass; he was 0-of-3 with a pick. As mentioned, the interception wasn't his fault, but it was still disappointing that the Jets couldn't use Christian Hackenberg once Petty left the game. Hackenberg was inactive for some strange reason, though perhaps it had to do with Todd Bowles' hospitalization. Bowles clearly didn't have all of his mental faculties intact when he made the decision to deactivate Hackenberg. Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way and was his usual, pedestrian self. Fitzpatrick's numbers were awful - 8-of-21 for 136 yards, 2 interceptions - but he should've thrown a touchdown, as Seferian-Jenkins had the aforementioned drop. If Petty can't play in Week 17, Hackenberg needs to start. There's absolutely no reason to keep trotting out a woeful, bearded quarterback with no future within the organization.    The Jets wanted to establish "
