   "comment":"Kurt Warner finished 24-of-33, 279 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    Larry Fitzgerald, who had 6 receptions for 73 yards, had Warner's lone score. Steve Breaston caught 7 balls for 90 yards, while Anquan Boldin hauled in 5 passes for 62 yards.    Yet another 30-yard performance from Tim Hightower. Hightower has rushed between 20 and 39 yards in 8 of 13 games this year. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, he scored a touchdown.    By the way, it should be noted that Arizona clinched the NFC West with this victory, marking the first time they've won their division since 1975.    <b> Dan Marino Record Watch: </b> Kurt Warner now has 4,020 passing yards on the season. He's on pace for 4,948 yards. Dan Marino had 5,084 yards in 1984.   Warner finished 24-of-33, 279 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    Larry Fitzgerald, who had 6 receptions for 73 yards, had Warner's lone score. "

   "comment":"Kurt Warner interception. The third occurred after a Cardinals fumble.    Still, Tarvaris Jackson's 4 touchdowns look impressive. But I think it's more important that Jackson did what he had to do - refrain from committing turnovers and convert third downs. He was 11-of-17 for 163 yards.    Jackson's 4 scores went to Bobby Wade, Bernard Berrian, Chester Taylor and Sidney Rice. However, no Viking wideout had more than 2 receptions.    Adrian Peterson didn't get into the end zone, but he was still able to compile 165 yards on 28 rushes.    Speaking of rushes, Arizona running backs carried the ball just 7 times, as the Cardinals simply didn't bother challenging the Williams Wall.

   "comment":"Kurt Warner off in the end zone and took it 100 yards to the house. On the next offensive drive, Warner off in the end zone and took it 100 yards to the house. On the next offensive drive, Maurice Morris scored on a 64-yard run. Later on, Cardinals defensive lineman Bryan Robinson helped the Lions score again with back-to-back 15-yard personal fouls as he appeared to shower expletives at the official. The Lions eventually lost, but given the fact that they played half this game with their third-string quarterback, I'd say they did a pretty good job.    And yes, Daunte Culpepper was benched at halftime. He was horrific, going just 6-of-12 for 64 yards and an interception. Drew Stanton replaced him and went 10-of-19 for 72 yards and an interception. On the bright side, Stanton offered the Lions a rushing threat out of the quarterback position. However, he had major problems hitting his open receivers. All but 2 of his completions were for 8 yards or less.    When I say that Stanton had trouble getting it to his wideouts, I was referring to Calvin Johnson. Megatron had just 3 catches for 35 yards.    With Kevin Smith on IR, Maurice Morris did a great job doing his best Smith impersonation, rushing for 126 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 35 more yards.    Chris Wells also topped 100 yards on the ground, gaining 110 yards and a score, also on 17 attempts. Unfortunately, Tim Hightower (6 carries, 4 yards) vultured away another potential touchdown.    Warner's numbers were solid (23-37, 233 yards, 2 TDs, INT) but as mentioned earlier, he nearly threw several other picks. Overall, not a good performance, though it was pretty much a meaningless game.    Warner's scores went to "
