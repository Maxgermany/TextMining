   "comment":"Warner threw for 235 yards and 3 touchdowns, but was pressured often and forced into making mistakes. He had 3 interceptions.    The Cardinal who struggled most, however, was Anquan Boldin. Boldin dropped 2 passes, 1 of which was a touchdown, and lost 2 fumbles. Boldin finished with 5 catches for 63 yards. Larry Fitzgerald also had 5 receptions for 65 yards and a pair of scores. Steve Breaston caught Warner's other touchdown.    West Coast teams are now 0-15 on the East Coast, regardless of the start time. Complete debaclation.   "

But I think it's more important that Jackson did what he had to do - refrain from committing turnovers and convert third downs. He was 11-of-17 for 163 yards.    Jackson's 4 scores went to Bobby Wade, Bernard Berrian, Chester Taylor and Sidney Rice. However, no Viking wideout had more than 2 receptions.    Adrian Peterson didn't get into the end zone, but he was still able to compile 165 yards on 28 rushes.    Speaking of rushes, Arizona running backs carried the ball just 7 times, as the Cardinals simply didn't bother challenging the Williams Wall. Instead, Kurt Warner aired it out 45 times, completed 29 of those passes for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    A disappointing day for "

   "comment":"Warner and the Arizona offense marched down the field 80 yards on their great defense and scored on a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown.    On Philadelphia's next possession, FOX put up a dubious stat that read that teams scoring first were 2-6 in the playoffs. So, of course, Philadelphia set the record for a second-half comeback in a championship game, erasing a 24-6 deficit and establishing a 25-24 lead. The Eagles out-gained a reeling Cardinals squad in the third quarter by a 165-5 margin.    But just as Arizona looked like it would not only lose straight up, but blow the +3.5 cover, Kurt Warner commanded the offense to a 14-play touchdown drive spanning 7:52 of the fourth quarter.
