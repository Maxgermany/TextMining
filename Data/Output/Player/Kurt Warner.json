Steve Breaston caught 7 balls for 90 yards, while Anquan Boldin hauled in 5 passes for 62 yards.    Yet another 30-yard performance from Tim Hightower. Hightower has rushed between 20 and 39 yards in 8 of 13 games this year. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, he scored a touchdown.    By the way, it should be noted that Arizona clinched the NFC West with this victory, marking the first time they've won their division since 1975.    <b> Dan Marino Record Watch: </b> Kurt Warner now has 4,020 passing yards on the season. He's on pace for 4,948 yards. Dan Marino had 5,084 yards in 1984.   "

   "comment":"Kurt Warner set an NFL record for completion percentage in game, going 24-of-26 for 243 yards and 2 scores. Warner looked like he was 50 years old last week, but he seemed rejuvenated on Sunday, though it should be noted that his longest completion was only 22 yards. It's amazing what playing a quitting team can do for you.    Chris Wells ran well in this game - 7 carries for 44 yards - but he fumbled twice and wasn't given the ball much late in the contest. "
