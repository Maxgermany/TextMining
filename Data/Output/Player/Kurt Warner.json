But I think it's more important that Jackson did what he had to do - refrain from committing turnovers and convert third downs. He was 11-of-17 for 163 yards.    Jackson's 4 scores went to Bobby Wade, Bernard Berrian, Chester Taylor and Sidney Rice. However, no Viking wideout had more than 2 receptions.    Adrian Peterson didn't get into the end zone, but he was still able to compile 165 yards on 28 rushes.    Speaking of rushes, Arizona running backs carried the ball just 7 times, as the Cardinals simply didn't bother challenging the Williams Wall. Instead, Kurt Warner aired it out 45 times, completed 29 of those passes for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    A disappointing day for "
