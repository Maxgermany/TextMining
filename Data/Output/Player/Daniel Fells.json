   "comment":"Fells. The Lions were simply unprepared for it. Shocker. - Detroit had about 10 drops in this game. Ten freaking drops. - The Lions had the ball with 4 minutes remaining in the contest with the score tied at 10. Instead of trying to put together a game-winning drive, Detroit ran the ball twice, putting Stafford into a third-and-long situation. Stafford was predictably sacked. The Lions punted the ball away and the Rams scored a touchdown on the following drive. - The man responsible for this idiotic play-calling was Scott Linehan. I liked the Lions -3.5 because of Linehan's knowledge of St. Louis' schemes and personnel. Apparently, Linehan knows absolutely nothing and obviously not paying attention to anything while coaching the Rams.    Without Calvin Johnson, Stafford struggled statistically, going 14-of-33 for 168 yards and the aforementioned pick. But as I noted, Stafford suffered through close to 10 drops in this contest. His leading receiver was "
