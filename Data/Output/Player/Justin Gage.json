   "comment":"Justin Gage on a 4.h-and-two on its own 3-yard line. It was extremely obvious, to the announcers, everyone recapping this contest on various highlight shows and anyone watching it live, that Gage didn't get the first down. However, the officials awarded Tennessee with a first-and-goal at the 1. Brad Childress challenged the ruling, yet the referee didn't overturn it. If Ed Hochuli was downgraded for the call in the Denver-San Diego shootout, the official in this contest should be arrested for larceny. It wouldn't shocked me at all if we found out a few years down the road that this game was fixed.    Of course, Minnesota made it pretty easy for the officiating crew. The Titans scored 3 touchdowns against the Vikings. All 3 were scored off Minnesota turnovers. Now, I can understand a desperate interception late in the 4.h quarter, but I don't quite understand how the first turnover occurred. The initial turnover was the result of a Naufahu Tahi fumble. Who!? Exactly. Gus Frerotte threw twice to Tahi on the opening possession. Fahi fumbled on his second reception. What the hell is Brad Childress doing? If you have Adrian Peterson, Chester Taylor, Bernard Berrian and Sidney Rice, why in the world are you calling plays for some sort of Japanese sushi dish?    It shouldn't be surprising that after Childress' genius plan blew up in his face, Tahi didn't catch a single pass the rest of the game. Bernard Berrian led the squad in yardage with 78, while Bobby Wade had the reception lead with 7 (75 yards). Gus Frerotte was 25-of-43 for 266 yards and an interception. That pick occurred late in the game and deep in Tennessee territory. I wouldn't put that on Frerotte; he was just trying to make a play in an unlikely comeback.    Adrian Peterson scored both of Minnesota's touchdowns. He had 80 yards on just 18 carries. Chester Taylor touched the ball only 1 time.    Meanwhile, Chris Johnson matched Peterson's scoring total, but had a bit less yardage (61). LenDale White also scored, but he managed a pathetic 13 yards on 11 carries. One has to wonder why White is even getting the ball anymore.    Kerry Collins managed the game well once again. Collins finished 18-of-35 for 199 yards. More importantly, he didn't turn it over. Justin Gage led all wideouts with 92 yards.    A bit of good news for Viking fans: The Packers also lost, "
