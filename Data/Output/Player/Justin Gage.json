It was extremely obvious, to the announcers, everyone recapping this contest on various highlight shows and anyone watching it live, that Gage didn't get the first down. However, the officials awarded Tennessee with a first-and-goal at the 1. Brad Childress challenged the ruling, yet the referee didn't overturn it.

It wouldn't shocked me at all if we found out a few years down the road that this game was fixed.    Of course, Minnesota made it pretty easy for the officiating crew. The Titans scored 3 touchdowns against the Vikings. All 3 were scored off Minnesota turnovers.
