   "comment":"Dennis Pitta, who was carted off when his leg gave out on him. He wasn't contacted; he just collapsed. Pitta was later diagonsed with a dislocated hip - the same 1 that caused him to miss most of 2013. Pitta might be done for the season. Flacco still managed to persevere, finishing 19-of-31 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. It must be noted that he converted on just 8 of 16 attempts following intermission when he didn't have Pitta at his disposal. However, he made that clutch completion to Steve Smith at the very end, which allowed Tucker to ice this game.    Steve Smith was once again Baltimore's leading receiver. He caught 5 passes for 101 yards. "

   "comment":"Dennis Pitta on Baltimore's last scoring drive of the game. In addition to those passes, Flacco threw a 66-yards touchdown strike to Mike Wallace that gave the Ravens a 10-0 lead at the time. Wallace beat backup safety Duke Williams on the play, and Williams had no business being matched up on him. Wallace's final stat line may look good (3 catches, 91 yards, 1 TD) but most of that came on the score. He may be targeted a lot by Flacco, but do not expect him to put up huge numbers every week.    A duo of injured players returned for the Ravens this week as well. Veteran receiver Steve Smith Sr. was coming off of an Achilles injury that prematurely ended his 2015 campaign, while tight end Dennis Pitta was starting for the first time since 2014. Smith was targeted 9 times, but he only caught 5 of them for 19 yards. He was well covered by the elite Buffalo corners, so he will likely have bigger games in the future. Pitta looked surprisingly good, and it appears as though he is finally healthy. He caught 3 passes for 39 yards, including a 27-yard grab that moved the Ravens into field goal range late in the 4.h quarter. Pitta could be a factor for the Ravens, and he has a lot of upside in most fantasy format. He will be at least an intriguing TE2 in most weeks.    Baltimore's running backs were pretty good in this matchup. "

He did this in the third quarter, and as a result, he managed to go 16-of-22 for 125 yards, 1 touchdown and a meaningless interception following intermission. Flacco's final numbers looked like this: 30-of-44, 262 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick. Flacco should've thrown a second score, but as mentioned, Waller was guilty of a drop in the end zone. The interception occurred on the final play of the game when Flacco was just trying to get something going downfield.    Flacco spread the ball around, targeting 4 players on 5 or more occasions. "
