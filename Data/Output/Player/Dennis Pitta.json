Baltimore finished the drive with Flacco throwing a dart to Pitta, a 22-yard completion to Crockett Gilmore and a roughing-the-passer penalty. Baltimore finished the drive with Flacco throwing a dart to Mike Wallace (4-41) for a 7-yard score. The Ravens quickly got the ball back as a McCown overthrow floated to Eric Weddle for an interception. That gave them the ball close to midfield with 42 seconds left. That set up a 52-yard field goal for Justin Tucker, and the Browns took a 20-12 lead into halftime. To open the third quarter, Flacco moved the ball down the field with a 19-yard completion to Steve Smith and then a 31-yard pass to Smith (3-64). To finish the drive, Wallace got open for a 17-yard touchdown strike and the Ravens kicked the point to make it 20-19. Baltimore got moving again with a completion to Breshad Perriman (2-32), but Haden came through with an interception in the end zone to protect Cleveland's slim lead. To end the third quarter, McCown hit a 47-yard completion to Coleman as he made a leaping grab over Shareece Wright. However, a few plays later, Coleman got flagged for slugging Jimmy Smith, and that was critical lost yards for Cleveland as Patrick Murray then missed a 52-yard field goal. On the game-winning drive, Flacco hit Pitta (9-102) for a 28-yard gain down the middle of the field, and that set up Tucker to connect on a 49-yard field goal to give the Ravens a 22-20 lead. They tacked on another field goal to extend the lead to 25-20 with just under 3 minutes remaining.
