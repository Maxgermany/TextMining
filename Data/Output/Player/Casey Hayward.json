Later, when Winston was sacked in the red zone, it took Roberto Aguayo on the brink of his kicking range, and he whiffed on a 31-yard try as a result. The Buccaneers trailed 14-7 at the half, but things started going to Tampa's way following the break. Lavonte David scored on a pick-six on a Philip Rivers pass that was tipped, and then the Buccaneers were fortunate that a potential Rivers 80-yard touchdown bomb was dropped by Travis Benjamin. Winston, meanwhile, caught fire and helped secure the victory.    Winston finished 20-of-30 for 280 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. He shook off the early pick and was able to keep the chains moving despite not being able to throw to Mike Evans all that often. Winston torched beleaguered cornerback Craig Mager repeatedly, as Mager was atrocious in this contest.    Winston couldn't go to Evans that often because of Hayward's excellent coverage. In addition to his interception, Hayward limited Evans to 3 catches for 38 yards. He also drew an offensive pass interference flag on Evans in the red zone. With Evans out of commission, Winston targeted "

   "comment":"Hayward for the 29-yard score. Rivers responded by leading the Chargers down the field, spreading the ball around on a 92-yard, 12-play drive. Once again, the Giants were burned by a tight end as Rivers made a tremendous throw off his back foot to lead Hunter Henry (3-42-1) past 2 safeties for a 25-yard touchdown pass. That gave the Chargers a 17-16 lead entering the 4.h quarter. The lead didn't last long as Beckham got wide open after torching Hayward for a 48-yard touchdown. A 2.point attempt failed, so New York had a 22-17 lead. Rivers led another drive deep into Giants territory, but Thompson came up big with a diving pass breakup to save a touchdown. Los Angeles cut the lead to 22-20 with just under 5 minutes remaining. Disaster than struck for New York as Beckham went down with an injury to his left leg and had to be carted off the field. That sucked the air out of the building, and on the next play, "

   "comment":"Hayward for some of the contest.    For the Chargers, this was a strong showing. While they were unable to ultimately win the contest, their defense played very well, and they had a chance to beat the Patriots late in the 4.h quarter. Philip Rivers did as much as he could to help the Chargers win. Rivers was his usual solid self, and showed great accuracy during the contest. His ability to hit receivers on out routes to the sideline was very strong, and that allowed him to methodically move the ball down the field. At the same time, Rivers was forced to throw mostly short passes against the Patriots, as the team did well to protect against the deep ball. As a result, the Chargers ended up with a lot of third-and-shorts, but they couldn't convert them. Part of this was due to Rivers' inability to find open receivers in these situations, and some of it was due to Matt Patricia's ability to call the right plays at the right time. Overall, Rivers went 17-of-30 for 212 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a solid game, but he was unable to lead the team to victory at the end of the day. He had a chance on the final drive, but he was killed by a lack of timeouts and a key drop.    Rivers' top receivers during the contest were "

   "comment":"Hayward, but the Chargers missed a makable field goal. Buffalo took advantage with LeSean McCoy breaking off a 37-yard run. On the next play, he got loose down the sideline for a 27-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 7. The Chargers responded with a field goal to take a 10-7 lead. Promptly, Peterman threw his third interception of the first quarter when he was hit as he threw, and the ball floated to Tre Boston. In the second quarter, the Chargers were able to extend their lead as Philip Rivers connected with Keenan Allen for a 21-yard touchdown. Peterman soon threw his 4.h interception on a poorly located pass, and Hayward made the diving catch. Allen then caught a 2-yard touchdown pass to put up Los Angeles 24-7.
