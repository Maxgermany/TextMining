   "comment":"Brandon Jacobs led the band with 52 yards on 10 rushes.    To summarize, Philadelphia won this game because it stopped committing the stupid mistakes it was guilty of all year. Well, for the most part... 1. No surprise here - the Eagles used all of their first-half timeouts in the first quarter. That's the bad news. The good news is that without any timeouts, Reid was unable to challenge anything. Reid is 0-of-5 on challenges this season. 2. The Eagles, who already had a blocked kick returned for a touchdown this year, had that happen to them again at the end of the second quarter. The Giants later blocked yet another chip-shot field goal.   "

First, a muffed punt by Giants cornerback Aaron Ross was recovered by New England. That set up the Patriots for a field goal. A short time later, New England committed their 4.h turnover when Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich forced a fumble from Julian Edelman in punt coverage. On the drive, Manning moved the ball with a couple of good passes along the sideline. The Giants got inside the 10-yard line when Manning hit Michael Clayton in the back of the end zone. His catch was tossed because he had stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, Manning threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone after throwing off his back foot. Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington spun off of his man and made a leaping interception to negate scoring chance. It was Arrington's fifth interception of the season. Brady answered with a big 27-yard toss to Welker in the middle of zone coverage. They hooked up again for 28 yards to get inside the 20. Brady finished the drive with a touchdown strike to Hernandez. He caught the ball short of the end zone and made a few defenders miss before charging in for the game-tying score. Brady led another a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead in the 4.h quarter. The Giants came up with a big answer. Manning made a few good throws to move the ball down the field. He was aided by a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Arrington. On 3rd-and-5, Manning made a perfect throw to Mario Manningham, who got by Arrington running through the end zone. The 10-yard score gave the Giants a 17-13 lead. A penalty on Manningham after the play helped give the Patriots good field position. Brady got to work with a good pass to Deion Branch, and then a 19-yard pass to Gronkowski brought it to the Giants' 15 yard-line. A few plays later, and Brady had a 4th-and-8 at the Giants' 14-yard line. He threw a strike to Gronkowski in the front of the end zone for the lead. To start the game-winning drive, Manning got a huge gain to Ballard. Manning tossed a ball down the seam, and Ballard made a leaping catch for 28 yards. Manning then scrambled for 12 yards. On the next play, he threw incomplete for Victor Cruz in the end zone but pass interference was called. That put the ball on the Patriot's 1-yard line. Manning threw incomplete for Ballard. Jacobs got stuffed on the next play. On third-and-goal, with 19 seconds remaining, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Ballard running an out route in the end zone. That completed New York's massive road win and saw the Giants improve to 6-2 on the season. For the night, Manning was 20-of-39 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacobs ran for 72 yards on 18 carries, while Cruz led the Giants in receiving with 6 receptions for 91 yards. Ballard caught 4 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28-of-49 passes for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Giants had a good rush, but Brady missed some open receivers whom he normally hits. Brady seemed off against New York. Welker led New England in receiving with 9 receptions for 136 yards. Gronkowski had 8 grabs for 101 yards and 1 touchdown.   "

   "comment":"Brandon Jacobs and Mario Manningham totaling 30 yards. Eli Manning was sharp early, completing his first 10 passes. After a somewhat controversial non-fumble, Victor Cruz was short of a first down and the Giants went up 3-0. San Francisco answered with a nice drive. Alex Smith spread the ball around, hitting Delanie Walker, Braylon Edwards and Ted Ginn Jr. for a total of 46 yards. The 49ers converted twice on third down, but were forced to tie the game on a field goal when Aaron Ross wrapped up tight end Vernon Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety Kenny Phillips to earn the final few yards, and with Gore sidelined, it was a good thing he did. They went for 2 and got it on a pass to Michael Crabtree, who caught only 1 pass (21 yards). The Giants took over down 20-13, and on the second play of the drive, Manning threw to where he thought Manningham would be. Instead Carlos Rogers was there for his second interception of the game. On the first play from scrimmage, Hunter bolted for a 17-yard score, and the 49ers were up 2 touchdowns. To their credit, New York was not shaken in hostile territory. They went 80 yards in 7 plays, finishing on a 32-yard deep ball to Hakeem Nicks to make it 27-20. Usually, San Francisco would ride Gore to clinch a win in this spot, but instead went twice to a shotgun formation, going 3.and-out when Kiwanuka and Umenyiora converged on Smith for a failed third down. The Giants had a dramatic drive in them, twice converting 4.h downs. Unfortunately for them, a third time forced to the brink did not work out so well. At the 10-yard line on 4th-and-2, Justin Smith knocked down the final pass of the game. Manning had his typical, big-number game (26-for-40 311 yards 2 TDs, 2 INTs) but the mistakes were costly, especially the second pick. Granted, he had only a little help from the running game, as Brandon Jacobs and D.J. Ware combined for 89 yards on 27 carries. Still, even with a big edge in time of possessions (34:37 to 25:23) and no Gore to deal with, New York found a way to let this win slip away.   Jacobs and Mario Manningham totaling 30 yards.

New York then ran the ball in for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "
