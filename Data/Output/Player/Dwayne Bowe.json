   "comment":"Bowe's second touchdown. On another occasion, 3 Houston defenders had Jamaal Charles wrapped up for a 5-yard loss, but the quick back shed all of those tackles and sprinted for an 8-yard gain. It truly was pathetic. The Texans were getting run over, and they just didn't look like they cared at all. DeMeco Ryans' torn Achillies' 10.on didn't help, but that occurred near halftime, so it's not like Ryans was out for most of the game.    And I'm saying this amid a Houston victory. Matt Schaub and Andre Johnson really saved this team from losing its third of 4. Schaub went 25-of-33 for 305 yards and 2 touchdowns. In the second half alone, he was 17-of-23 for 232 yards and a score. Kansas City's secondary simply had no answer for Johnson, who caught 8 balls for 138 yards and a touchdown. Owen Daniels also showed some life with 5 receptions for 79 yards.    Arian Foster had a big fantasy day, rushing for 71 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also caught 6 balls for 26 receiving yards.    As mentioned earlier, Houston's defense had no answer for Kansas City's offense despite the fact that 90 percent of Matt Cassel's throws were short dump-offs. Cassel had 1 really nice pass where he zipped a 17-yard dart to Bowe for a touchdown. Cassel went 20-of-29 for 201 yards and 3 scores.    The Texans' run defense simply didn't show up. "

The Raiders had nothing going in the first half. Jason Campbell was 4-of-10 for 18 yards and an interception, while the team was getting killed in the yardage (169-49) and first-down (11-2) categories. But Campbell got his act together after intermission, finishing 19-of-33 for 229 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick.    The lightning-quick Jacoby Ford came out of nowhere to haul in 6 grabs for 148 yards. Darrius Heyward-Bey had no receptions.    Darren McFadden rushed for 89 yards on 17 carries, and also had 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. He just missed getting into the end zone; he had a run down to the 1-yard line.    Cassel, meanwhile, went 20-of-35 for 216 yards, 2 scores and a pick. He had some nice throws, but his limitations were really apparent late in the game when his poor arm strength prevented him from keeping drives alive. He will be the eventual downfall of the Chiefs... That is, if Todd Haley isn't. Thomas Jones had 19 carries for 32 yards. Jamaal Charles had 10 attempts for 53 yards. Great job, Todd. Only you can prevent your best player from leading your team to victory.    Charles did have 5 catches for 47 yards. Bowe also hauled 5 grabs for 63 yards and a touchdown, but had the aforementioned crucial drop.   "

The Cardinals did an OK job to move the chains in their own territory, but seemed to bog down whenever they crossed midfield. They struggled to convert third downs (4-of-15) and committed way too many penalties (11).    Derek Anderson went 25-of-46 for 295 yards and a touchdown, though most of his yardage (and touchdown) came in junk time. Fitzgerald (6-90) caught the score, which actually happened on the last play of the game. Coincidentally, the touchdown put the game over the total.   "

   "comment":"Bowe on the final play of the third quarter with his team behind 35-3. It was an ugly start for the Jets though. They came out for their first play with 10 men, which is not something you see very often. In fact, announcer Dan Fouts has never seen it, and I believe him. After having to burn a timeout, at least, they got the right play called because Shonn Greene (24-129, TD) knifed right up the middle for 31 yards, kick-starting the opening drive. The march covered 77 yards on 11 plays and chewed 6:14 off the clock. Mark Sanchez hit consecutive throws to tight end Dustin Keller for 18 yards, then had a naked bootleg for the touchdown on a well-executed play to take a 7-0 lead. As illustrated above, the Chiefs were unable to do anything on offense, so they were at their opponent's mercy. After a quick exchange of punts, however, a 3.and-out did result in a 53-yard field goal by Ryan Succop to pull to 7-3 thanks to nice field position from a Javier Arenas punt return. Ironically, the play that got New York in charge also hurt them. Jets safety Jim Leonhard snagged an interception in plus territory, but injured his knee and is reportedly done for the season. Perhaps it is a case of d?j? vu, since he went down late in 2010, yet the team still rallied to make the AFC Championship Game. New York is going to miss his presence down the stretch, but the turnover led to a quick score. Greene caught a pass and took it 36 yards. After a loss by LaDainian Tomlinson, Sanchez threw to Santonio Holmes for a touchdown and the 14-3 advantage. Then the Jets relaxed and started to really impose their will. Tomlinson and Greene were given 3 carries each on the next drive with Greene capping the 69-yard touchdown march for a commanding 21-3 lead. The very next drive started at the Kansas City 35 because of a great punt return (26 yards) from rookie wide receiver Jeremy Kerley, who had to return punts in Leonhard's absence. Tomlinson had 1 of the receiving touchdowns, which was reminiscent of his prime with the Chargers, taking it 19 yards to the end zone, making it 28-3 at the half. There wasn't anything the Chiefs could do after the break, facing a huge deficit. They at least logged a bit of yardage to avoid the poor field position that plagued them in the second quarter, but the Jets went 90 yards for a touchdown to really ice the game. The big plays in that march were all Kansas City penalties. The Chiefs were flagged 5 times for an astounding 81 yards and Sanchez capped the drive with a 3-yard run, and at 35-3, the rout was on. After an exchange of punts, Kansas City's offense finally got something as the game entered the 4.h quarter. Palko (16-for-32 195 yards, TD, INT) connected with Steve Breaston and Dwayne Bowe along the way, finishing with a 24-yard score to Jerheme Urban."

   "comment":"Bowe and tight end Leonard Pope. Let me backtrack for a moment though, because prior to the Pope gain, the Chiefs were at the the Raiders' 23-yard line. I was thinking field goal, but interim head coach Romeo Crennel was thinking touchdown. Orton threw incomplete and was flagged for grounding (loss of 11 yards). Flags for delay of game and false start seemingly put them out of scoring range, but the pass to Pope salvaged a Succop attempt. Richard Seymour blocked it and the game went to half at 3-3. Remember what I said about big plays? Early in the second half, Oakland's defense forced a quick punt and drove the Raiders drove their way towards midfield. A holding penalty backed them up, but Palmer went deep to Moore for a 61-yard touchdown that changed the complexion of the game. Staked to a 10-3 lead, Oakland's defense was in bend but don't break mode the rest of the afternoon, taking advantage of an offense unable to finish drives. Kansas City's next possession was highlighted by a 43-yard pass to Terrance Copper, who apparently is still in the league. Unfortunately, a first-and-goal from the 6-yard line led to another Succop field goal to make it 10-6. After the Chiefs' defense held, the offense again went to plus territory at the Oakland 35-yard line. Stanford Routt stepped in front of a pass intended for Bowe, ending the march. Even though the Raiders did nothing on offense, their stud punter Lechler changed field position, putting Kansas City on its own 10-yard line. This was crucial because on the next drive Crennel rolled the dice trying to convert a 4th-and-1. Battle was stopped. Oakland took advantage of the short field, marching 30 yards to cash in an easy field goal for a 13-6 advantage. Early in the second quarter, Coach Jackson passed on trying to convert a 4th-and-1, electing instead to punt and play field position. Sometimes conservative works and gambling backfires. Still, with 2:57 remaining, I was tweeting that I expected the Chiefs to tie the game with a touchdown, adding to the legacy of tight finishes in this rivalry. Sure enough, Orton went to Bowe twice for 28 yards to set them up just shy of midfield. Then, "

   "comment":"Bowe for a 36-yard pass, but that was wiped out by an illegal formation. Oh, and then there were 2 Jamaal Charles fumbles that gave San Diego the ball deep in Kansas City territory on both occasions. The Chargers scored 1 touchdown off of the fumbles, but Philip Rivers tossed a lazy interception after the other. If that wasn't bad enough, Cassel followed everything up with 2 interceptions late in the first half. One was way behind Tony Moeaki and returned for 6 by emerging inside linebacker Donald Butler. The other was tipped off the hands of Dexter McCluster. The crowd was booing fiercely beforehand, but they barely made a sound after that last 1. It was just sad at that point. Cassel finished 24-of-42 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Cassel's yardage numbers are bogus; he was able to compile them when the Chargers were playing prevent in the second half. Kansas City needs to move on from Cassel after this season. The team cannot bench him now, unfortunately, because it doesn't have anyone behind him.    Jamaal Charles had a nice fantasy day, rushing for 92 yards on just 17 carries, catching 3 balls for 23 more yards and scoring a pair of touchdowns. Unfortunately, those 2 aforementioned fumbles really cost his team.    Dwayne Bowe caught 7 balls for 108 yards. He was the only Chief with more than 4 receptions and 50 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Chargers surprised many by giving "

He finished 10-of-21 for 159 yards and an interception. He was almost picked in a first-quarter trip to the end zone, and he went just 5-of-11 for 58 yards and an interception after intermission, as he looked lost without Bowe. He should not be allowed to start another NFL game ever again, but Romeo Crennel is going to keep sticking with him for some reason.    Charles finished with 165 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries.

Smith, who is a sub-par quarterback being coached up to playing above-average football, is the primary reason I never slotted Kansas City above No. 8 in my NFL Power Rankings.    I mentioned that Bowe had a deep drop, but he played well otherwise despite his arrest during the week, as he led the team in receiving with 4 catches for 57 yards and a legitimate touchdown in the second quarter. Charles, however, wasn't a big factor in the passing game, hauling in just 2 balls for a loss of 6 receiving yards. He also notched 78 rushing yards on 16 carries.    Two other notable Chiefs: "

   "comment":"Bowe to move the ball inside the 15. After a completion to Anthony Fasano (3-28) moved the ball to the 2. Smith rolled out and threw the ball right to Wesley Woodyard for an interception in the end zone. Peyton Manning gave it right back when he threw a floater downfield that was batted around before Quentin Demps controlled the ball for a pick. Smith came back to hit Junior Hemingway (3-42) for a 17-yard score. The Broncos answered with a 34-yard screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. Manning then threw a perfect strike on a deep post to Decker for a 41-yard touchdown. Decker beat Brandon Flowers on the play. The Chiefs took that 7 right back as Knile Davis returned the kickoff 108-yards to put Kansas City back in front. Manning tried to go back to Decker, but the veteran signal-caller had the underthrown ball fall short to Marcus Cooper for an interception that set up the Chiefs inside Broncos' territory. Smith took advantage with a touchdown pass to Fasano. Manning answered by hitting Decker for a gain of 42 yards to the 3.yard line. That led to a short touchdown toss to Moreno and a 21-14 Kansas City lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Decker burned the Chiefs' secondary again. Manning had a beautiful throw as Decker burned Flowers and Demps for a 37-yard touchdown. Manning kept pushing the ball down the field as Demaryius Thomas (3-106), who beat Cooper on his release to get open for a long catch and run of 77 yards inside Kansas City's 20-yard line. Denver took the lead with Decker's third touchdown catch of the game. He also beat Cooper on that play. Smith tossed a perfectly thrown deep ball that was dropped by A.J. Jenkins, so the Chiefs had to punt. Montee Ball (13-117) had a 45-yard run to midfield on a drive that also ended with a touchdown toss to Decker against Cooper. Despite Donnie Avery having 2 bad drops on passes downfield, Smith methodically moved the ball. At the goal line, Jamaal Charles (19-93) dove over the top to cut the Broncos lead to 7. Moreno converted a second-and-20 with a 31-yard completion, but eventually the Chiefs defense got off the field. The Chiefs took over inside their 10 with 3 and a half minutes remaining. Smith completed a 26-yarder on a third down to Jenkins (3-35), Dexter McCluster (5-43) made a diving catch for 28 yards and Smith got 25 more on a back shoulder to Bowe (3-56). On 4.h down from the 12-yard line, Smith threw incomplete for Bowe in the end zone.    Smith finished 26-of-42 for 293 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He also ran for 46 yards on 4 caries.    Manning was 22-of-35 for 403 yards with 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Moreno was held to 18 yards on 15 carries, but had 4 receptions for 72 yards. Decker destroyed the Chiefs for 174 yards on 8 receptions with 4 touchdowns.    The Broncos really missed Derek Wolfe at the point of attack. Tight end Julius Thomas was missed as well. "

He finished 18-of-36 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 5 turnovers. He did a solid job of moving the chains at times, but the give-aways were killers. The lost fumble was deep in his own territory, which set up an easy touchdown for the Chiefs. His first pick, which was telegraphed, was returned for a score. Another was tipped, but 2 others were incredibly dumb throws. I laughed when I saw someone tweet, McGloin was waiting all day for the linebacker to get open. In addition to McGloin's turnovers, the undrafted rookie quarterback made some other mistakes. He missed an open "

Manning converted some third-and-long situations early on because the Chiefs blitzed, which was foolish. However, they improved their game plan as the evening progressed and limited the Broncos to just 150 net yards in the second half. Manning was very fortunate that he got away with 3 interceptions. He didn't turn the ball over, save for his lost fumble, but the Kansas City defenders had their hands on 3 separate Manning throws.    Manning's 2 touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Bowe on a third-and-19 on the same drive. However, he was just 13-of-26 for 184 yards and a pick following the break. The Cardinals did a great job of pressuring him and forcing quick, errant throws. Once Smith had to come back from a deficit, he just couldn't get the job done because he's so limited. After all, there's a reason that no Kansas City receivers have yet to catch touchdowns this year. Smith finished 26-of-39 for 293 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was thrown right to Alex Okafor. He also scrambled 4 times for 26 rushing yards. It appeared as though Smith had a second score to Anthony Fasano, but the officials ruled that Fasano pushed off even though it was a bogus call. Smith is a good game manager, but he doesn't have the arm or the weapons around him to advance deep into the playoffs.    There was a scary moment in this game when Jamaal Charles bent backward after appearing to fumble. The officials changed the call after watching the replay, but Charles limped off. Fortunately, he turned out to be OK. Having said that, Charles was criminally underutilized for the second week in a row; he touched the ball just 12 times, rushing for 91 yards on 10 carries and catching 2 balls for 20 receiving yards. He scored twice, at least.    Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving with 7 grabs for 110 yards. Bowe (2-29) had 1 awesome reception, but otherwise did nothing.   "

The Georgia State product caught 5 balls for a team-high 87 yards. These numbers are all legitimate, and Wilson's best play was a 33-yarder in which he made a nice catch and broke tackles to move into Pittsburgh territory. He also was the target of a 19-yard pass on a big third-down conversion.    As for Smith's other weapons, Bowe was second on the team with 57 yards on 6 catches. "

We, of course, would like to see more touchdowns from him, but those should come, especially with Chicago and Pittsburgh coming up.    This game never was in real doubt as Alex Smith was sacked 5 times, and even though the Chiefs were able to move the ball and had more yards and first downs, they never could sustain with the pass rush disrupting their game plan.
