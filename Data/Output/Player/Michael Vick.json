   "comment":"Vick did throw for 416 yards and rush for 75 more. He generally had time to scan the field for open receivers, and his runs came after realizing no 1 was open. Their defense was potent in the first half, limiting the 49ers to movement on just 2 drives which both wound up in field goal attempts. Only 1 was converted by their former kicker David Akers. When he lined up for his first try, a bit of the crowd actually cheered. They roared when he missed from 44 yards out. He was not the worst kicker in the stadium though. More on that later. Vick's lone interception ended a drive in the first quarter, but the killer turnover came from Ronnie Brown in the second quarter."
