   "comment":"Michael Vick did throw for 416 yards and rush for 75 more. He generally had time to scan the field for open receivers, and his runs came after realizing no 1 was open. Their defense was potent in the first half, limiting the 49ers to movement on just 2 drives which both wound up in field goal attempts. Only 1 was converted by their former kicker "
