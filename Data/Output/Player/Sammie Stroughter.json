Stroughter's kick return for a touchdown in the third quarter. The offense really didn't do anything; Tampa Bay managed just 12 first downs and 245 total yards.    Josh Johnson played somewhat well (11-of-17, 147 yards), but once again made crucial errors that cost the team. Johnson launched an interception on the first play of the third quarter that led to a Panthers touchdown. He also had a whopping 5 fumbles.    Tampa Bay's leading receiver wasn't Antonio Bryant (2 catches, 37 yards). It wasn't Kellen Winslow Jr. (3-29). It wasn't even the great Michael Clayton (1-9). It was Stroughter, who snagged 3 balls for 65 yards.    It looks like Raheem Morris' revolutionary 2-2-1 RBBC rotation is gone. "

He hasn't been giving his high-priced free agent any carries, and he foolishly elected to go with Byron Sandwich over Luke McCown. Down 21-0 in this contest. Morris opted to punt it on 4th-and-1 at midfield. He got just a 25-yard punt out of it. At that point, it was evident that the Buccaneers didn't have a shot at making this game remotely close. Morris had no faith in his team, and the team responded appropriately.   Stroughter led the Buccaneers with 3 catches for 63 yards.
