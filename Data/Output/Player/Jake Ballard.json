   "comment":"Jake Ballard. Still, New York's drive fizzled inside the 20 and they had to settle for the kick. Miami kept up its strong play on its next drive. Moore ran for 11 on third-and-6. The next play saw running back Reggie Bush break out with a 35-yard run. He had a good hole to get to the second level of the defense. About 10 yards downfield, Bush broke tackles from Aaron Ross and Kenny Philips with a spin move. The Dolphins finished the drive on 4.h-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Moore ran a bootleg and coasted into the end zone to give the Dolphins a 14-3 lead. The Giants were able to answer the score. With only a few seconds left before halftime, Manning tossed a perfect corner touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Jake Ballard. He took just 2 sacks, which is a great sign. He was limping around after the Titans tackled him low in the second quarter, but he was 8-of-13 for 108 yards and a touchdown following intermission, so unlike Fitzgerald, he didn't seem to be bothered by that hit.    Some Tennessee stats: - Thanks to that awesome comeback, Fitzpatrick finished 36-of-58 for 402 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. I mentioned that he was almost pick-sixed in overtime; that nearly happened earlier when "
