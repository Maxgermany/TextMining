  "comment":"Jake Ballard. He took just 2 sacks, which is a great sign. He was limping around after the Titans tackled him low in the second quarter, but he was 8-of-13 for 108 yards and a touchdown following intermission, so unlike Fitzgerald, he didn't seem to be bothered by that hit.

I mentioned that he was almost pick-sixed in overtime; that nearly happened earlier when ",
