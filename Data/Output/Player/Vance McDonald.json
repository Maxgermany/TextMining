All of this was possible because McDonald later scampered 75 yards when the Panthers seemed disinterested, but the Panthers were able to establish control and score a few times to clinch the all-important cover. All of this was possible because Cam Newton was unstoppable. The 49ers barely put any sort of pressure on him, allowing Newton to pick them apart. Newton ended up going 24-of-40 for 353 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped into tight coverage. He also rushed 6 times for 37 yards.    The Panthers have to feel good about their win, but not completely because Jonathan Stewart was knocked out with a hamstring. Stewart disappointed his fantasy owners, mustering only 9 yards on 5 carries. He could miss some games, making Fozzy Whittaker an intriguing pick-up. Whittaker gained 100 yards on 16 carries.    Two of Newton's touchdowns went to Kelvin Benjamin, who was a beast in this matchup. He caught 7 passes for 108 yards and the pair of scores. The other touchdowns went to Greg Olsen (5-122) on a 78-yarder, and Devin Funchess (2-19), who made a late grab after doing nothing most of the afternoon. Newton nearly tossed a fifth score, but Ginn made a catch in which it was ruled that his second foot was out of bounds. Ginn secured a 52-yard reception later in the game in which he bobbled it out bounds, but the officials inexplicably ruled that it was complete after looking at the replay.    As for the 49ers, Blaine Gabbert made a few decent passes against Carolina's defense, making sure to release the ball quickly to nullify the pass rush. This was effective at times, but the 49ers couldn't maintain consistent drives. It didn't help that Gabbert missed several throws, including 1 where his receiver was wide open on a third down. Gabbert finished 17-of-36 for 243 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions, but a 75-yard gain of his occurred in garbage time. One of Gabbert's picks was a horrific throw in which he forced the ball into double coverage.    Save for McDonald, who had that 75-yard reception, the only 49er to accumulate more than 30 receiving yards was Torrey Smith, who hauled in 3 balls for 55 yards and a touchdown."

The Panthers have to feel good about their win, but not completely because Jonathan Stewart was knocked out with a hamstring. Stewart disappointed his fantasy owners, mustering only 9 yards on 5 carries. He could miss some games, making Fozzy Whittaker an intriguing pick-up. Whittaker gained 100 yards on 16 carries.    Two of Newton's touchdowns went to Kelvin Benjamin, who was a beast in this matchup. He caught 7 passes for 108 yards and the pair of scores. The other touchdowns went to Greg Olsen (5-122) on a 78-yarder, and Devin Funchess (2-19), who made a late grab after doing nothing most of the afternoon. Newton nearly tossed a fifth score, but Ginn made a catch in which it was ruled that his second foot was out of bounds. Ginn secured a 52-yard reception later in the game in which he bobbled it out bounds, but the officials inexplicably ruled that it was complete after looking at the replay.    As for the 49ers, Blaine Gabbert made a few decent passes against Carolina's defense, making sure to release the ball quickly to nullify the pass rush. This was effective at times, but the 49ers couldn't maintain consistent drives. It didn't help that Gabbert missed several throws, including 1 where his receiver was wide open on a third down. Gabbert finished 17-of-36 for 243 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions, but a 75-yard gain of his occurred in garbage time. One of Gabbert's picks was a horrific throw in which he forced the ball into double coverage.    Save for McDonald, who had that 75-yard reception, the only 49er to accumulate more than 30 receiving yards was Torrey Smith, who hauled in 3 balls for 55 yards and a touchdown."
