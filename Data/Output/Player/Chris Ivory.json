McCoy wasn't as good in this contest as he was at Pittsburgh. He went 9-of-16 for 74 yards, and seemed to settle for a ton of checkdowns. On a positive note, McCoy didn't turn the ball over. That's more impressive than it sounds because playing in the Superdome is a major challenge for any quarterback, especially a rookie.    Hillis rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts.    The star for the Browns defensively - aside from Bowens, of course - was linebacker "

The team continues to struggle in the red zone, forcing Sean Payton to resort to weird gadget plays that aren't working. The Saints have a bye after an apparent easy contest at Carolina next week, so they'll need to fix this by Week 11.    Roethlisberger had an OK performance, going 17-of-28 for 195 yards and a desperate late interception. As mentioned, however, Big Ben had 2 possible interceptions dropped. He also struggled to figure out Gregg Williams' blitz schemes.    No Steeler had more than 3 receptions or 43 yards. "

   "comment":"Ivory 9-yard run in the red zone on the ensuing possession, and this was immediately followed by a Jace Amaro drop on what would've set up a manageable third-down situation near the goal line. Amaro, who saw the ball hit him right in the chest, was responsible for Geno Smith's first incompletion. More errors were prevalent throughout the evening. The Jets bobbled a handoff on second-and-1 in the red zone, which ultimately led to 1 of many field goals in the red zone. Rex Ryan also burned 2 timeouts in the third quarter. He needed those stoppages at the end of the game, as he was forced to try an onside kick. The Jets consequently had to march down from inside their own 20. Smith did a good job of at least putting the team into the edge of field-goal range, but the attempt was blocked.    Smith had a great outing. He made some mistakes, as he held on to the ball too long on a few occasions, and he sailed a pass over Amaro's head during a 2.point try that would've tied the game, but he was mostly sharp. He went 20-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he should've had a second score, but it was wiped out by a hold. Smith also scrambled 7 times for 37 rushing yards, as he had a pair of a clutch runs to move the chains. Smith, who has been much better this season when he's been able to target an Eric Decker, was not afraid to throw Darrelle Revis' way. Decker, as a consequence, secured 4 of his 7 targets for a team-high 65 yards. Jeff Cumberland (3-50) snagged Smith's sole touchdown, though he saw fewer targets than Amaro (3-22), who absolutely killed his team with that aforementioned drop.    Though Smith played well, the Jets' season is over. The team is now 1-6, and it lost both of its Super Bowls against the Broncos and Patriots. They'll be flat next week and will likely drop to 1-7. Ryan will be seen as a lame-duck coach, and thanks to the bad-character guys in the locker room like Chris Johnson and the backup quarterback, the team will quit. They will be a great fade to close out the season.    As for the Patriots, it has to be very discouraging that they couldn't stop the run and consequently get off the field. Chris Ivory pummeled his way for 107 rushing yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Even Johnson ran well, gaining 61 yards on 13 attempts. New England won't have any sort of chance to win the Super Bowl if this area of its defense doesn't improve. Unfortunately for them, Jerod Mayo is not returning anytime soon, so odds are that the Patriots will continue to struggle to contain ground attacks. "

He scrambled 8 times for 69 rushing yards, but posted mediocre passing numbers, going 18-of-36 for 153 yards and an interception that occurred late when he was hit as he released the ball. He also fumbled twice, losing the ball once. QBDK's big issue was missing receivers; not just in terms of accuracy but just not seeing open targets downfield.

   "comment":"Ivory (11-8), and Johnson outgained Ivory, 69-22. CJ0K also caught 2 passes for 32 receiving yards. He actually looked decent for a change, but his troublesome antics during the week is exactly why bringing him into the team was a huge mistake. He's not nearly the player he once was, so his poor locker room attitude isn't worth it. The Jets, now 1-8, have to regret bringing him in, but it's not like they had the talent to win anyway.    As for the victors, Alex Smith was very economical, going 21-of-31 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He didn't make any mistakes, but then again, he didn't really need to force anything into New York's anemic secondary, who left receivers open all afternoon. I already mentioned that Smith somehow found Fasano for a fluke touchdown in the first half. Smith's other score was thrown to "

   "comment":"Ivory combined for 130 rushing yards prior to intermission, though the Dolphins clamped down after the break and limited the 2 backs to 37 rushing yards following halftime. The Dolphins' defense, as a whole, was stellar in the second half, limiting New York to just 94 net yards after giving up 232 prior to halftime.    The Dolphins, meanwhile, struggled to move the ball until late in this contest. Their offensive game plan was ridiculous at the beginning of the evening, as they inexplicably had Lamar Miller carry the ball just once in the first half. They wisely went back to Miller following intermission, and the talented runner finished with 56 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    Ryan Tannehill, meanwhile, went 25-of-35 for 235 yards and a very weird interception where he threw it while falling down, and a low pass hit the target's hands and popped the ball into the air and right to a New York defensive back's arms. That pick wasn't all on Tannehill, but he almost threw a completely legitimate 1. he fired a pass right to linebacker Calvin Pace, who flat out dropped it. Having said that, Tannehill could've had a slightly better night, as Mike Wallace dropped a touchdown thrown right to him (shocker). Tannehill also did some good stuff, like throwing some impressive strikes on several third-and-longs to move the chains. I feel like he should've run a bit more, as he had just 4 scrambles for 13 rushing yards.    There were 3 Dolphins who had more than 17 receiving yards. Wallace paced the team with 69 receiving yards on 6 catches, but dropped that aforementioned potential touchdown. Jarvis Landry (8-68) tied Wallace with 11 targets, while Dion Sims (4-58) reeled in a pair of big conversions at the end of the game to move the team into field-goal range.    The Dolphins clamped down and consequently were able to eventually establish the lead. That meant that Geno Smith had to air it out. In other words, the Jets had no shot. Smith predictably threw an interception in a comeback attempt, allowing the Dolphins to seal the victory and jump up to the No. 6 seed in the extremely tight AFC playoff race. Smith finished 7-of-13 for 65 yards and the pick. He also fumbled the ball on a terrible handoff to Ivory, which the Jets were extremely fortunate to recover inside their own 5-yard line. Smith missed some routine passes, including 2 to "

   "comment":"Ivory was then wide open for a touchdown when he leaked out of the backfield. The bewildered Dolphins didn't look like they knew what hit them, and it wouldn't get any better. The Jets generated 494 net yards of offense and gained a whopping 8 yards per play. Smith finished 20-of-25 for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a fumble that occurred because of terrible ball security. Granted, the Dolphins were extremely lethargic, but Smith had an amazing performance. Perhaps it'll give the Jets some optimism that he can turn into a decent quarterback with some good offensive coaching. They better hope so, as they'll probably be out of position to take either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as you can see in my 2015 NFL Mock Draft.    It helped Smith that Eric Decker came alive. The former Bronco didn't produce numbers anywhere close to what he posted in Denver, but his season finale was exceptional. He caught 10 of the 11 targets thrown his way for a whopping 221 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught a number of deep bombs, including a 74-yarder where he easily beat coverage, and a 50-yarder, which he snagged over Brent Grimes, who just couldn't do anything because of the height advantage.    The Jets wouldn't have produced any points if they failed to throw the ball. That's because they struggled to run. Ivory had a receiving touchdown, but he mustered only 29 yards on the ground on 13 carries, including 1 attempt in which he was stuffed on a 4.h down. "

   "comment":"Ivory and Eric Decker were ruled out, leaving only Brandon Marshall for Ryan Fitzpatrick to work with. As a result, the Jets achieved their second first down of the game after the 2-minute warning right before halftime. Fitzpatrick went 35-of-58 for only 283 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. All of Fitzpatrick's picks came in the second half, as he was trying desperately to lead his team back. One interception made by second-round rookie Eric Rowe, who had fantastic coverage. Fitzpatrick was also betrayed by some drops from Quincy Enunwa, but he needs to be blamed, as he missed several opportunities, including 1 where he had Devin Smith wide open for a touchdown in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick simply missed him.    With Decker out, it's not a surprise that Brandon Marshall dominated the targets. Fourteen balls went his way, and he caught 10 of them for 109 yards and a touchdown. Marshall, however, had 1 of the dumbest plays of the year, when he foolishly tried to lateral to no 1 in particular while being tackled. Marshall was charged with a fumble as a consequence. Toward the end of the game, he dropped a pass that was tipped and intercepted. Marshall's stat line was great, and he'll continue to produce, but he cost his team a potential victory with those 2 errors.    Other notables in the New York passing game: Jeremy Kerley scored a touchdown, but he's just a mediocre slot receiver not worth owning. He caught 6 passes for only 33 yards. Meanwhile, second-round rookie Devin Smith made 3 grabs for 39 yards. He simply couldn't connect with Fitzpatrick; as mentioned earlier, the bearded quarterback missed him for a score. He might be a fantasy option next year, but not anytime soon.    Ivory's carries went to Bilal Powell, who mustered only 31 yards on 10 attempts."

   "comment":"Ivory. He's been a major bust thus far, and it doesn't appear as though anything will change anytime soon. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-29 for 218 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick to go along with 34 rushing yards on 9 scrambles. He began hot, completing his first 4 passes, but then had a 2-of-9 stretch where he fired inaccurate balls. He's a liability, and as mentioned, he'll be exposed versus tougher foes.    Chris Ivory was iffy for this game after missing last week's contest. There's no doubt that he's completely healthy, as he ran like a bull. The Dolphins had major issues tackling him, as he picked up 166 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. We've seen runners like Ivory - Marion Barber, Brandon Jacobs - have short career spans, so I don't like his long-term prospects. However, Ivory should serve as an RB2 at the very least for the rest of the year.    Marshall's matchup against Grimes was not meant to be, as the latter left the game in the first quarter and never returned. Marshall did burn him for 58 yards, however. He finished with 7 grabs for a team-high 128 yards.    Fitzpatrick's sole touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for LeGarrette Blount fantasy owners like myself was turned into a huge disappointment as he totaled minus-3 yards on 3 carries.    Gronkowski led New England through the air with 11 receptions for 108 yards and a score. He really hurt the Jets' defense. It was Gronkowski's 18th career 100-yard game. Danny Amendola (8-86-1) and Julian Edelman (5-54) chipped in some critical receptions. Brandon LaFell (2-25) returned to the field with a terrible performance of 6 dropped passes.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns. He had some good passes dropped by receivers.    Chris Ivory ran for 41 yards on 17 carries with 2 receptions for 12 yards and a touchdown. He injured a hamstring at the start of the game and didn't look like himself, but gutted it out.    Decker had 6 receptions for 94 yards, and Marshall had 4 catches for 67 yards, but his dropped touchdown was massive.    Defensively, the Jets received nice performances out of "

   "comment":"Ivory also found the end zone. His touchdown was very impressive, as he shook off 5 potential tacklers. Miami had tackling issues all afternoon, but the team was at its worst on this instance. Ivory gained 87 yards on 21 carries, taking a breather late when the game was out of hand; otherwise, he would've eclipsed the century mark.    As for the Dolphins, I mentioned that their offensive numbers were bogus, so don't pay attention to Tannehill's stat line of 33-of-58, 351 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. All of that is meaningless. By halftime, Tannehill was just 9-of-18 for 83 yards and an interception, which occurred when he stared down his receiver. He was nearly picked again in the third quarter, but that was nullified by review. It wasn't surprising to see Tannehill struggle, given that he has no idea how to handle the blitz, and the Jets love sending extra pass-rushers.    "

The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A Yannick Ngakoue sack held the Bears to another field goal. The Jaguars responded with a field goal drive of their own. They then got the ball with just over 3 minutes at their own 20. After a few completions got the ball to midfield, Bortles hit backup wide receiver Arrelious Benn, who made a sliding catch. Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay. With about 2 minutes left, Hoyer got moving with a crossing completion to Meredith (11-113), but on a 4.h-and-10, Ramsey came back to break up a pass intended for Jeffery, letting the Jaguars get the ball back.    Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. Brian Hoyer was 30-of-49 for 302 yards, but Chicago really struggled in the red zone, and that ended up being the difference in this game.    Ka'Deem Carey (9-50) and Jordan Howard (15-34-1) split the workload for Chicago.    Blake Bortles was 20-of-33 for 271 yards with a score and an interception. Bortles got in a funk after his fluky interception and didn't snap out of it until late in the third quarter.    Chris Ivory (11-32-1) led the Jaguars on the ground, and T."

   "comment":"Ivory combined for only 7 carries because the Jaguars trailed throughout. Ivory (4-6) was never going to do much, but Yeldon (3-20) at least looked pretty spry. Yeldon also caught 4 passes for 36 receiving yards.    Phil Simms quotes: I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about these, especially with this being Simms' final appearance on Thursday Night Football. On 1 hand, I'm thankful that we only have to hear him once per week going forward. On the other hand, I'll miss posting his ridiculous quotes. There were 3 bad 1. this week: 1. Those errors are unexcusable. You mean, inexcusable, right Emmitt? I mean, Phil? 2. We talked to him last night. Not sure what he said. I kind of feel the same way after listening to Simms for 3 hours. 3. You know what's so great about winning? It's great. You know what's so great about listening to Phil Simms? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. My fiancee watched the game with me. She took note of some of these, and she eventually grew tired of listening to Simms. She said something that cracked me up: That guy who's talking is a douchebag. I couldn't have said it better myself.   "

   "comment":"Ivory fumbled the ball into the end zone, and it was recovered by Marcus Peters. The Jaguars got the ball back and were able to get points with a 14-yard scoring pass to Yeldon. Soon afterward, Sen'Derrick Marks got a third-down sack to get the ball back for Jacksonville with 3 minutes remaining. Bortles took off on a 27-yard run to get into Kansas City territory, but Dontari Poe blew up a Yeldon run on third down and Stephen Nelson broke up a 4.h-down pass intended for Bryan Walters to clinch the win for Kansas City.    The change in coordinators didn't make a difference for Bortles, as he was 10-of-19 for 90 yards at halftime. He finished completing 22-of-41 passes for 252 yards with 2 scores and an interception, but he was inaccurate and careless with the football. He didn't look any better this week. In fact, you could say Bortles was less effective in the second half than he typically is.    Ivory (18-107) led the Jaguars in rushing, but had a critical fumble and picked up almost half of his yards on 1 carry. "

   "comment":"Ivory lost a fumble in Detroit territory. Things didn't change in the second half, as Bortles threw a pick-six to give the Lions the lead in the third quarter. The pass was high for Marqise Lee, and a tipped pass sailed into the arms of Rafael Bush, who ran into the end zone. The Jaguars were able to re-claim the lead after that, but ultimately lost by a touchdown. Their defense limited the Lions to 12 offensive points, but the rest of the team surrendered 14 points. If Jacksonville had been more careful with the football, it may have prevailed. However, the Jaguars have been incredibly sloppy ever since foolishly firing Greg Olson, and that once again proved to be the case in this game.    I don't want to take much away from Matthew Stafford, however. Stafford didn't post the best fantasy numbers - he went 24-of-33 for 278 yards - but he played well considering how well Jacksonville's defense has been performing recently. Stafford struggled a bit in the early going, overshooting an open Anquan Boldin for a big gain, but he was once again very effective at the end each half. He led the team into field goal range prior to intermission, and he engineered an 8-minute drive to maintain possession at the very end, killing any chance the Jaguars had of prevailing.    The Lions scored just 1 offensive touchdown, which was an Eric Ebron rush on a jet sweep, of all things. Ebron caught 3 passes for 70 yards overall, most of which came on a 61-yard completion on a completely busted coverage by a linebacker. Ebron tied Theo Riddick (8 catches, 70 yards) for the team lead in receiving yardage.    It's hardly a surprise that the 2 prominent Detroit wideouts struggled against Jacksonville's elite secondary. Golden Tate caught only 3 balls for 27 yards, while Marvin Jones secured just 1 reception for 15 yards.    It was also predictable that the Lions couldn't run very well. Dwayne Washington handled most of the workload, but his 13 carries went for only 6 yards. Riddick, meanwhile, gained 13 yards on just 4 tries.    As for the Jaguars, I alluded to Bortles' struggles by mentioning his pick-six. That wasn't the only error he made, as he was nearly strip-sacked in the opening half because he held on to the ball too long. The play was ruled incomplete. There were also numerous occasions in which Bortles had receivers open for significant gains, but didn't see them. Bortles has seemingly regressed ever since Olson was let go, which is not surprising in the slightest, given that Bortles simply doesn't care enough to improve the mental part of his game, preferring to party frequently instead. Bortles finished 22-of-35 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. It was a disappointing showing, considering how poor Detroit's defense has been recently. Bortles was checked for a shoulder injury throughout the first half, but didn't miss any action, aside from a kneel-down right before intermission, which Chad Henne handled and then laughed afterward, for some reason.    It's unclear why the Jaguars insist on giving Ivory plenty of touches. Ivory wasted 17 carries, which he turned into 39 yards, whereas "

However, Bortles made up for it by launching a 52-yard bomb, setting up a nice throw into the end zone to Marcedes Lewis, who made an impressive, leaping touchdown grab over safety Matthias Farley. Bortles' 1 blemish, aside from the errant throw into the end zone, was a lost fumble that occurred when he was hit just prior to releasing the ball, but Indianapolis obviously didn't do anything with the take-away.    The second half had the Jaguars focus on the run, and that's when T.J. Yeldon sprinted 58 yards for a touchdown. Because of that burst, he had 122 yards on 9 carries. Ivory, meanwhile, gained 47 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts. Oddly enough, he didn't catch a pass, and he also lost a fumble.    "
