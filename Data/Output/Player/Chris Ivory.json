   "comment":"Chris Ivory was started by many after his great performance last week. However, the Browns are very good against the run, and limited Ivory to just 48 yards on 15 carries.    McCoy wasn't as good in this contest as he was at Pittsburgh. He went 9-of-16 for 74 yards, and seemed to settle for a ton of checkdowns. On a positive note, McCoy didn't turn the ball over. That's more impressive than it sounds because playing in the Superdome is a major challenge for any quarterback, especially a rookie.    Hillis rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts.    The star for the Browns defensively - aside from Bowens, of course - was linebacker "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory each had 7 carries for 16 and 7 yards, respectively.    Despite this win, New Orleans' biggest problem still remains. The team continues to struggle in the red zone, forcing Sean Payton to resort to weird gadget plays that aren't working. The Saints have a bye after an apparent easy contest at Carolina next week, so they'll need to fix this by Week 11.    Roethlisberger had an OK performance, going 17-of-28 for 195 yards and a desperate late interception. As mentioned, however, Big Ben had 2 possible interceptions dropped. He also struggled to figure out Gregg Williams' blitz schemes.    No Steeler had more than 3 receptions or 43 yards. "

They tackled each other, plugged the wrong gaps, etc. It was awful, as Ivory should never have gains of 71 yards. Johnson, meanwhile, registered 68 yards on 13 carries. That was more of Oakland struggling than Johnson looking good. This could be his best performance of the season.    Only 1 Jet was targeted more than 5 times. That would be Eric Decker, who hauled in 5 of the 6 balls thrown his way for 74 yards. As mentioned, QBDK missed him for a touchdown.   "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory 9-yard run in the red zone on the ensuing possession, and this was immediately followed by a Jace Amaro drop on what would've set up a manageable third-down situation near the goal line. Amaro, who saw the ball hit him right in the chest, was responsible for Geno Smith's first incompletion. More errors were prevalent throughout the evening. The Jets bobbled a handoff on second-and-1 in the red zone, which ultimately led to 1 of many field goals in the red zone. Rex Ryan also burned 2 timeouts in the third quarter. He needed those stoppages at the end of the game, as he was forced to try an onside kick. The Jets consequently had to march down from inside their own 20. Smith did a good job of at least putting the team into the edge of field-goal range, but the attempt was blocked.    Smith had a great outing. He made some mistakes, as he held on to the ball too long on a few occasions, and he sailed a pass over Amaro's head during a 2.point try that would've tied the game, but he was mostly sharp. He went 20-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he should've had a second score, but it was wiped out by a hold. Smith also scrambled 7 times for 37 rushing yards, as he had a pair of a clutch runs to move the chains. Smith, who has been much better this season when he's been able to target an Eric Decker, was not afraid to throw Darrelle Revis' way. Decker, as a consequence, secured 4 of his 7 targets for a team-high 65 yards. Jeff Cumberland (3-50) snagged Smith's sole touchdown, though he saw fewer targets than Amaro (3-22), who absolutely killed his team with that aforementioned drop.    Though Smith played well, the Jets' season is over. The team is now 1-6, and it lost both of its Super Bowls against the Broncos and Patriots. They'll be flat next week and will likely drop to 1-7. Ryan will be seen as a lame-duck coach, and thanks to the bad-character guys in the locker room like Chris Johnson and the backup quarterback, the team will quit. They will be a great fade to close out the season.    As for the Patriots, it has to be very discouraging that they couldn't stop the run and consequently get off the field. Chris Ivory pummeled his way for 107 rushing yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Even Johnson ran well, gaining 61 yards on 13 attempts. New England won't have any sort of chance to win the Super Bowl if this area of its defense doesn't improve. Unfortunately for them, Jerod Mayo is not returning anytime soon, so odds are that the Patriots will continue to struggle to contain ground attacks. "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory (13-43, 2 TDs) run. what happened to Ground and Pound? Why would Marty Mornhinweg sling the ball so willingly with such a pedestrian quarterback?    QBDK was only a bit better, but only because he ran so much. He scrambled 8 times for 69 rushing yards, but posted mediocre passing numbers, going 18-of-36 for 153 yards and an interception that occurred late when he was hit as he released the ball. He also fumbled twice, losing the ball once. QBDK's big issue was missing receivers; not just in terms of accuracy but just not seeing open targets downfield. A hectic Buffalo pass rush didn't help matters; the Bills registered 4 sacks, 1.5 from "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory (11-8), and Johnson outgained Ivory, 69-22. CJ0K also caught 2 passes for 32 receiving yards. He actually looked decent for a change, but his troublesome antics during the week is exactly why bringing him into the team was a huge mistake. He's not nearly the player he once was, so his poor locker room attitude isn't worth it. The Jets, now 1-8, have to regret bringing him in, but it's not like they had the talent to win anyway.    As for the victors, Alex Smith was very economical, going 21-of-31 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He didn't make any mistakes, but then again, he didn't really need to force anything into New York's anemic secondary, who left receivers open all afternoon. I already mentioned that Smith somehow found Fasano for a fluke touchdown in the first half. Smith's other score was thrown to "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory combined for 130 rushing yards prior to intermission, though the Dolphins clamped down after the break and limited the 2 backs to 37 rushing yards following halftime. The Dolphins' defense, as a whole, was stellar in the second half, limiting New York to just 94 net yards after giving up 232 prior to halftime.    The Dolphins, meanwhile, struggled to move the ball until late in this contest. Their offensive game plan was ridiculous at the beginning of the evening, as they inexplicably had Lamar Miller carry the ball just once in the first half. They wisely went back to Miller following intermission, and the talented runner finished with 56 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    Ryan Tannehill, meanwhile, went 25-of-35 for 235 yards and a very weird interception where he threw it while falling down, and a low pass hit the target's hands and popped the ball into the air and right to a New York defensive back's arms. That pick wasn't all on Tannehill, but he almost threw a completely legitimate 1. he fired a pass right to linebacker "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory was then wide open for a touchdown when he leaked out of the backfield. The bewildered Dolphins didn't look like they knew what hit them, and it wouldn't get any better. The Jets generated 494 net yards of offense and gained a whopping 8 yards per play. Smith finished 20-of-25 for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a fumble that occurred because of terrible ball security. Granted, the Dolphins were extremely lethargic, but Smith had an amazing performance. Perhaps it'll give the Jets some optimism that he can turn into a decent quarterback with some good offensive coaching. They better hope so, as they'll probably be out of position to take either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as you can see in my .    It helped Smith that Eric Decker came alive. The former Bronco didn't produce numbers anywhere close to what he posted in Denver, but his season finale was exceptional. He caught 10 of the 11 targets thrown his way for a whopping 221 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught a number of deep bombs, including a 74-yarder where he easily beat coverage, and a 50-yarder, which he snagged over "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory. He's been a major bust thus far, and it doesn't appear as though anything will change anytime soon. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-29 for 218 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick to go along with 34 rushing yards on 9 scrambles. He began hot, completing his first 4 passes, but then had a 2-of-9 stretch where he fired inaccurate balls. He's a liability, and as mentioned, he'll be exposed versus tougher foes.    Chris Ivory was iffy for this game after missing last week's contest. There's no doubt that he's completely healthy, as he ran like a bull. The Dolphins had major issues tackling him, as he picked up 166 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. We've seen runners like Ivory - Marion Barber, Brandon Jacobs - have short career spans, so I don't like his long-term prospects. However, Ivory should serve as an RB2 at the very least for the rest of the year.    Marshall's matchup against Grimes was not meant to be, as the latter left the game in the first quarter and never returned. Marshall did burn him for 58 yards, however. He finished with 7 grabs for a team-high 128 yards.    Fitzpatrick's sole touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory to burst for 146 yards and a touchdown to go along with 3 catches for 50 receiving yards. Most of his runs were positive, though he was stuffed on what seemed like a crucial third-and-1 on the opening drive of the second half. The Jets ended up kicking a field goal to tie the game at 13. It didn't matter, however, as New York exploded after that.    While Marshall and Decker both made mistakes, they both made their fantasy owners very happy, as each scored a touchdown. Marshall caught 7 balls for 111 yards, while Decker snatched 4 passes for 59 yards. Decker would've enjoyed a better performance had he not dropped 2 throws.    As for the Redskins' offense, they barely could do anything because they were missing their starting left tackle, left guard and center. "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for LeGarrette Blount fantasy owners like myself was turned into a huge disappointment as he totaled minus-3 yards on 3 carries.    Gronkowski led New England through the air with 11 receptions for 108 yards and a score. He really hurt the Jets' defense. It was Gronkowski's 18th career 100-yard game. Danny Amendola (8-86-1) and Julian Edelman (5-54) chipped in some critical receptions. Brandon LaFell (2-25) returned to the field with a terrible performance of 6 dropped passes.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns. He had some good passes dropped by receivers.    Chris Ivory ran for 41 yards on 17 carries with 2 receptions for 12 yards and a touchdown. He injured a hamstring at the start of the game and didn't look like himself, but gutted it out.    Decker had 6 receptions for 94 yards, and Marshall had 4 catches for 67 yards, but his dropped touchdown was massive.    Defensively, the Jets received nice performances out of "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory scored on a third-and-1. The Jaguars moved the ball into Jets territory in the final seconds and Bortles made a beautiful throw to Allen Hurns for a 30-yard touchdown after beating Antonio Cromartie. The Jets took a 14-10 lead into the locker room. Bortles led a field goal drive in the third quarter before Fitzpatrick hit a wide-open Jeff Cumberland for a 44-yard gain. A screen to Ivory went for 16 yards to the Jaguars' 1-yard line, and he plunged into the end zone 2 plays later. In the 4.h quarter, Bortles got going by hitting Allen Robinson for a 44-yard pass after he beat Darrelle Revis to get open before catching the pass with Marcus Williams all over him. A 16-yard pass to Hurns set up a Jacksonville field goal. The Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, and Bortles threw a 27-yard pass to Marcedes Lewis, and Yeldon ripped off a 45-yard run to get into Jets territory. However, Bortles was strip-sacked by Calvin Pace, who recovered the fumble for New York. Jacksonville's defense forced a punt, but muffed the punt, and Kellen Davis recovered for New York at the Jaguars' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Brandon Marshall made a phenomenal, diving, 20-yard touchdown catch. Quickly, Bortles ripped the ball down the field before throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Walters. Marshall recovered the onside kick. Ivory fumbled a third-down run, but was extremely lucky that Marshall recovered that loose ball as well. With a minute remaining, the Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, but Bortles threw a pick to Marcus Williams to end the game.    Blake Bortles completed 24-of-40 passes for 381 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Bortles played well with a lot of excellent reads and throws. He's vastly improved this season.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 64 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 37 yards. His offensive line struggled to open holes.    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 121 yards, and Allen Hurns logged 5 catches for 122 yards and a score. Robinson and Hurns outplayed New York's veteran corner tandem of Revis and Cromartie. Julius Thomas (3-14) didn't do much for Jacksonville.    Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-34 for 272 yards with 2 touchdowns. At less than 100 percent with his hand injury, Fitzpatrick was a huge upgrade for New York compared to last week.    Chris Ivory had only 26 yards on 23 carries with 2 touchdowns on the ground and 3 receptions for 22 yards. The Jaguars' front 7 was excellent against the run.    Eric Decker tallied 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars really struggled to cover Decker. Brandon Marshall (4-44-1) had some clutch plays in the 4.h quarter to lift the Jets to a win.    Jets safety Marcus Williams was huge with his 2 interceptions and half of a sacks.

   "comment":"Chris Ivory also found the end zone. His touchdown was very impressive, as he shook off 5 potential tacklers. Miami had tackling issues all afternoon, but the team was at its worst on this instance. Ivory gained 87 yards on 21 carries, taking a breather late when the game was out of hand; otherwise, he would've eclipsed the century mark.    As for the Dolphins, I mentioned that their offensive numbers were bogus, so don't pay attention to Tannehill's stat line of 33-of-58, 351 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. All of that is meaningless. By halftime, Tannehill was just 9-of-18 for 83 yards and an interception, which occurred when he stared down his receiver. He was nearly picked again in the third quarter, but that was nullified by review. It wasn't surprising to see Tannehill struggle, given that he has no idea how to handle the blitz, and the Jets love sending extra pass-rushers.    "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory was so effective on the opening drive. They went back to Ivory after a while, and he responded by losing a fumble deep in his own territory, leading to a Giants field goal. Later on, the Jets were offsides on a 4.h-and-4 punt, and then they dropped an interception in the red zone. However, the Jets' fortunes turned around. In the middle of the 4.h quarter, they had another chance to pick off a pass, and they did so. The Giants had a chance to go up 13 or 17, but Manning's interception gave the Jets new life. A field goal, followed by a touchdown, and then an overtime scoring drive helped them steal a game that appeared to be lost.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was excellent for the second week in a row, as it appears as though he's completely over his thumb injury. Fitzpatrick went 36-of-50 for 390 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 5 times for 22 rushing yards. Granted, the Giants have a horrible secondary, but Fitzpatrick was impressive nonetheless.    Three Jets accumulated more than 90 receiving yards. Two were the usual suspects. Brandon Marshall reeled in 12 of his 13 targets for 131 yards and a touchdown, which sent the game into overtime. Eric Decker (8-101) did most of his work in the second half. The third Jet was Bilal Powell, who was thrown to 13 times. Powell accumulated 8 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Powell didn't do much on the ground, which was expected. Chris Ivory gained 47 yards on 10 carries. He was given just 3 attempts after intermission because the Jets were behind so much and had to go into catch-up mode. It's a shame, as Ivory looked great, aside from his fumble. There was 1 carry where he broke 3 tackles and made a nasty spin move to pick up a 20-yard gain. The Giants were guilty of horrid tackling early on.    The Giants, meanwhile, screwed up as well. They seemed to be gifted a victory, but they threw it all away, beginning with Manning's interception. After that, Odell Beckham couldn't locate a deep pass and then was flagged for kicking the ball out of frustration. This was capped off by a 48-yard missed field goal in overtime to give the Jets the win.    "

   "comment":"Chris Ivory soon plunged into the end zone to cut the Bears' lead to 13-7. The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A Yannick Ngakoue sack held the Bears to another field goal. The Jaguars responded with a field goal drive of their own. They then got the ball with just over 3 minutes at their own 20. After a few completions got the ball to midfield, Bortles hit backup wide receiver Arrelious Benn, who made a sliding catch. Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay. With about 2 minutes left, Hoyer got moving with a crossing completion to Meredith (11-113), but on a 4.h-and-10, Ramsey came back to break up a pass intended for Jeffery, letting the Jaguars get the ball back.    Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. Brian Hoyer was 30-of-49 for 302 yards, but Chicago really struggled in the red zone, and that ended up being the difference in this game.    Ka'Deem Carey (9-50) and Jordan Howard (15-34-1) split the workload for Chicago.    Blake Bortles was 20-of-33 for 271 yards with a score and an interception. Bortles got in a funk after his fluky interception and didn't snap out of it until late in the third quarter.    Chris Ivory (11-32-1) led the Jaguars on the ground, and T."

Yeldon also caught 4 passes for 36 receiving yards.    Phil Simms quotes: I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about these, especially with this being Simms' final appearance on Thursday Night Football. On 1 hand, I'm thankful that we only have to hear him once per week going forward. On the other hand, I'll miss posting his ridiculous quotes. There were 3 bad 1. this week: 1. Those errors are unexcusable. You mean, inexcusable, right Emmitt? I mean, Phil? 2. We talked to him last night. Not sure what he said. I kind of feel the same way after listening to Simms for 3 hours. 3. You know what's so great about winning? It's great. You know what's so great about listening to Phil Simms? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. My fiancee watched the game with me. She took note of some of these, and she eventually grew tired of listening to Simms. She said something that cracked me up: That guy who's talking is a douchebag. I couldn't have said it better myself. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
