   "comment":"Martinez. The second interception occurred when the ball popped into the air as Barkley was hit. Barkley would be a horrible option as a starter, but Jay Cutler could be back in Week 8.    With Barkley under center for more than half the game, none of Chicago's play-makers could post significant numbers. "
