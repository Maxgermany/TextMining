   "comment":"Darby and Derek Stanley also lost fumbles. That's 6 colossal errors in just 30 minutes of play. In total, New York converted 5 Rams turnovers into 27 points. Sounds a lot like the Cardinals game earlier in the year, doesn't it?    It was all defense and Thomas Jones for the Jets in this contest. Jones rushed for 149 yards and 3 touchdowns on just 26 carries. That's not surprising, as the pathetic Rams were 30th against the run going into Sunday's matchup.    With Jones and the stop unit doing all the work, Brett Favre only had to throw 19 passes. He completed 14 of them for 167 yards and a touchdown. Favre fantasy owners, send your hate mail to Bulger for giving way too many points to the Jets early in the game.    Speaking of Bulger, the turnover-prone quarterback was benched in the third quarter. He finished 6-of-13 for 65 yards and the aforementioned interception. Donnie Avery and Torry Holt consequently caught 2 and 1 passes, respectively.    Steven Jackson was out, so Antonio Pittman handled the workload for the Rams. That didn't turn out too well, as Pittman managed just 28 yards on 13 rushes. Kenneth Darby actually out-gained him (32 yards) but carried the ball only 4 times.    What pisses me off about this game is that FOX continued to air it despite the score being 40-0. Did it ever occur to the geniuses who run the network that people wouldn't be watching a 40-point blowout? FOX didn't take me to a different contest until this debacle - yes, I used that word correctly - was over. Did the producer tease the Rams down to +43.5 or something? If so, I'm glad he lost.   "
