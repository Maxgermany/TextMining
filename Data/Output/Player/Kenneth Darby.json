   "comment":"Kenneth Darby registered 49 yards and a score on 14 attempts. Darby entered the game after Jackson left with a groin injury. It does not look good for Jackson, as Adam Schefter reports that the Rams may bring in Larry Johnson as insurance. Jackson simply cannot stay healthy, which is why I recommend passing on him in the first 2 rounds of fantasy drafts this summer.    "
