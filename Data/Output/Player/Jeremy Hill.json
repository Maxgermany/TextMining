As for Tennessee, when news broke of Rob Bironas' passing Sunday morning, I wondered if the Titans would be distracted. Many of the players were teammates with Bironas, so the news had to devastate them. Sure enough, the Titans moved the chains well on occasion, but made plenty of mistakes in this game, which seemed to indicate that their minds were elsewhere.

   "comment":"Jeremy Hill dropped a pass. A.J. McCarron was nearly picked throwing the ball into double coverage. The defense allowed Ryan Mallett to convert numerous third downs. The defenders dropped some potential Mallett interceptions. The Ravens actually led 9-7 going into halftime, as Cincinnati didn't appear to have any sort of energy. I don't know what Marvin Lewis said to his team during intermission, but they were sharper and way more energetic following the break. It helped that the Ravens began making mistakes, but the Bengals looked like a different squad. A.J. McCarron barely let any of his passes hit the ground (7-of-10 in second half), though A.J. Green definitely helped him out. Green made 2 spectacular catches on the same drive, both of which involved improbably tapping his toes onto the field of play right near the sideline. The second catch resulted in a touchdown. McCarron finished 17-of-27 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns overall, while Green snatched 4 passes for 34 yards and the score. Green barely did anything outside of that 1 drive, but that's all the Bengals needed from him.    McCarron's other score was thrown to Tyler Eifert, who hauled in all 4 of his targets for 51 yards. Outside of Eifert and Green, the only other Bengal with more than 20 receiving yards was Marvin Jones (5-38).    Jeremy Hill looked great for the second week in a row. He just missed the century mark, gaining 96 yards and a touchdown on just 16 carries. His dropped pass was his only blemish. "

   "comment":"Jeremy Hill dropped a pass. A.J. McCarron was nearly picked throwing the ball into double coverage. The defense allowed Ryan Mallett to convert numerous third downs. The defenders dropped some potential Mallett interceptions. The Ravens actually led 9-7 going into halftime, as Cincinnati didn't appear to have any sort of energy. I don't know what Marvin Lewis said to his team during intermission, but they were sharper and way more energetic following the break. It helped that the Ravens began making mistakes, but the Bengals looked like a different squad. A.J. McCarron barely let any of his passes hit the ground (7-of-10 in second half), though A.J. Green definitely helped him out. Green made 2 spectacular catches on the same drive, both of which involved improbably tapping his toes onto the field of play right near the sideline. The second catch resulted in a touchdown. McCarron finished 17-of-27 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns overall, while Green snatched 4 passes for 34 yards and the score. Green barely did anything outside of that 1 drive, but that's all the Bengals needed from him.    McCarron's other score was thrown to Tyler Eifert, who hauled in all 4 of his targets for 51 yards. Outside of Eifert and Green, the only other Bengal with more than 20 receiving yards was Marvin Jones (5-38).    Jeremy Hill looked great for the second week in a row. He just missed the century mark, gaining 96 yards and a touchdown on just 16 carries. His dropped pass was his only blemish. "

   "comment":"Jeremy Hill got into the end zone on a 12-yard touchdown run where he blew up the defense. The talk of Hill looking more explosive this season sure appeared to be true on that touchdown run, which put the Bengals up 20-16 in the third quarter. After Hill's touchdown, the Jets moved into the Bengals' territory, but settled for 2 field goals in the 4.h quarter. Coach Todd Bowles probably got too conservative with those field goals though. But in the end, it came down to a last-minute drive that ended with a Ryan Fitzpatrick interception, which was very much on him. In the end, the Bengals just had the better offense and were able to weather the sacks and strong run defense the Jets brought.   "

Also, how the hell did the Bengals not cover this game when they were up 20-9 a halftime? I know, I know, Vontaze Burfict and Vinny Rey were knocked out, and the reason the Bengals have been so much better defensively since the bye has been Burfict's improved play, but still, talk about a double bad beat.    When the Steelers and Bengals meet, there's always a heightened sense of competition and each hit seems to have more impact. The Bengals were the team to strike first with a touchdown, as after Jeremy Hill was stopped 3 times at the goal line, the Bengals went for it on 4.h-and-goal, and Andy Dalton snuck it in to take a 10-3 lead in the first quarter. The Bengals were bottling up "
