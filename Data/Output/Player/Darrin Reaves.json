   "comment":"Darrin Reaves (8-15) split touches with both DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart out with injuries.    Dalton, meanwhile, misfired on just 10 occasions, going 34-of-44 for 323 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Dalton did all of this despite missing both A.J. Green and Marvin Jones. He did a good job of moving the chains for the most part, but the picks were pretty brutal. One was a weak-armed attempt off his back foot, which the Panthers returned 80 yards to set up a Whittaker touchdown. The second sailed on Dalton and led to another Carolina score.    With Green and Jones out, "
