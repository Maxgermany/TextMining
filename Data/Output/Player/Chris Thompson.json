The touchdown came on a pitch play where he got into space and ran into the end zone. The Redskins should mix him in more, as he can be a weapon in certain circumstances.    For the Eagles, this loss was actually a great performance from them. On offense, Wentz and the young unit showed a lot of promise. They will definitely be a competitive team in 2017. Wentz put together a terrific performance in his second game against the Redskins. The rookie went 32-of-46 for 314 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He was every bit as good as those numbers indicate, and he could have been even better. Right out of the gate, Wentz was showing pinpoint accuracy. On the Eagles' first drive, he was hitting all of his receivers and showed a strong connection with tight end "

He totaled 78 yards on 12 carries before he went down with a rib injury that kept him out of the rest of the contest. That injury should be monitored, and the team needs to hope it isn't too serious. If he's out for an extended period of time, Samaje Perine (21 carries, 67 yards) will be the man to add. He looked decent in a lot of late action, but he hasn't fully adapted to the NFL yet. Thompson was absolutely electric for the Redskins. He had a couple of touchdowns on 3 carries, and that included a 61-yard burst on a delayed handoff. The scary thing is Thompson could have been better had he not dropped a pass when he was wide open over the middle of the field. He is worth adding in PPR leagues, as he appears to be 1 of Cousins' preferred targets and a legitimate touchdown threat.    The Redskins suffered a lot of injuries in this game. Kelley, Reed, "

Following that was a possession that saw Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper drop passes, with the instances sandwiching a holding penalty that negated a first down. Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a Trent Williams hold.    Cousins' primary target was Thompson, who caught 6 of his 7 targets for a ridiculous 150 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 8 times for 38 rushing yards. Involving him more on offense than "
