Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. Andre Roberts (1-20) made a great leaping grab to move the ball inside the 20. With just under 30 seconds remaining, Stafford threw a frozen rope to Anquan Boldin (3-28-1) for an 18-yard touchdown pass to win the game for Detroit.    Stafford entered this game red hot, but the Redskins' defense put the clamps on him in the first 2 quarters while being aided by some dropped passes by his receivers. He was only 7-of-13 for 79 yards at the intermission, but came up big in crunch time to finish 18-of-29 for 266 yards with a touchdown. Stafford also ran for 32 yards.    Justin Forsett led the Lions with 33 yards on 8 carries, plus 2 receptions for 15 yards. Marvin Jones led Detroit with 4 catches for 94 yards.    Kirk Cousins completed 30-of-39 passes for 301 yards with a touchdown. Jamison Crowder (7-108) led Washington through the air.    Matt Jones (10-27) turned in a meltdown performance with 3 fumbles. Chris Thompson (12-73) should take over as the feature back for the Redskins.    Defensively, the Redskins ramped up the edge rush, with "

   "comment":"Thompson also performed well. He saw just 3 carries, but turned them into 38 yards and a touchdown. The touchdown came on a pitch play where he got into space and ran into the end zone. The Redskins should mix him in more, as he can be a weapon in certain circumstances.    For the Eagles, this loss was actually a great performance from them. On offense, Wentz and the young unit showed a lot of promise. They will definitely be a competitive team in 2017. Wentz put together a terrific performance in his second game against the Redskins. The rookie went 32-of-46 for 314 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He was every bit as good as those numbers indicate, and he could have been even better. Right out of the gate, Wentz was showing pinpoint accuracy. On the Eagles' first drive, he was hitting all of his receivers and showed a strong connection with tight end "

He totaled 78 yards on 12 carries before he went down with a rib injury that kept him out of the rest of the contest. That injury should be monitored, and the team needs to hope it isn't too serious. If he's out for an extended period of time, Samaje Perine (21 carries, 67 yards) will be the man to add. He looked decent in a lot of late action, but he hasn't fully adapted to the NFL yet. Thompson was absolutely electric for the Redskins. He had a couple of touchdowns on 3 carries, and that included a 61-yard burst on a delayed handoff. The scary thing is Thompson could have been better had he not dropped a pass when he was wide open over the middle of the field. He is worth adding in PPR leagues, as he appears to be 1 of Cousins' preferred targets and a legitimate touchdown threat.    The Redskins suffered a lot of injuries in this game. Kelley, Reed, "

   "comment":"Thompson. Carr was sacked twice on the second drive, then Marshawn Lynch was stuffed on a third-and-2. Following that was a possession that saw Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper drop passes, with the instances sandwiching a holding penalty that negated a first down. Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5, and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a Trent Williams hold.    Cousins' primary target was Thompson, who caught 6 of his 7 targets for a ridiculous 150 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 8 times for 38 rushing yards. Involving him more on offense than "

Wilson had a superb performance considering everything that he had to deal with in this contest. For the entirety of the game, his weak offensive line allowed pressure onto him. New left tackle "
