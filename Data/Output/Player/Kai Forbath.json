   "comment":"Kai Forbath.    This might have been coach Sean Payton's last game with the Saints. There have been multiple reports that several teams could be interested in trading for Payton. Where there is smoke, there usually is fire, and there has been a lot of smoke surrounding Payton. It might be time for a fresh start for Payton, but the Saints shouldn't let him go without getting a nice package of draft picks. The Saints (7-9) need rebuilding. But Payton already rebuilt this franchise once and he can do it again.    There also have been plenty of rumors about the future of New Orleans quarterback "
