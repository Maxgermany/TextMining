   "comment":"Mike Williams (2-12). The Panthers had zero pass rush as Freeman had all day to throw the ball in the first half. They played better in the second half and were able to sack Freeman a couple of times.    Carolina's offense showed signs of life in the second half, too. Newton hit Williams - and he didn't even play. </i>    This game started out like the Carolina Panthers thought they were still playing in the preseason. Tampa Bay was ready to play and the Panthers were sleep walking through the first half. The Buccaneers' defense played tough for 4 quarters and carried the team to a win. The Bucs' defensive line deserves a lot of the credit, especially defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He had a superb game, blowing up runs and rushing the quarterback. On the flip side, the Panthers' offensive line was atrocious. It didn't protect Newton well and was God-awful in run blocking. Carolina's offense couldn't extend drives, and as result, Tampa Bay dominated the time of possession. The Panthers had minus-1 yard rushing at halftime and finished with only 10 yards total on the ground. DeAngelo Williams had minus-1 yards on 6 carries. If Carolina's line doesn't pick up its play, it is going to be a painful season for the running game. The Bucs produced timely turnovers with interceptions by "

   "comment":"Mike Williams on the final play of the game, but the wideout had been forced out of bounds before catching the pass, so the completion was negated by an illegal touching penalty. This game featured tremendous aerial assaults by Freeman and Brees, but both Tampa Bay and New Orleans played awful defense. Neither secondary could cover, and both teams had little pass rush. The tackling by the Bucs and the Saints was absolutely abysmal. Both defenses were painfully bad, and that point can't be emphasized enough.    The game didn't start out that way for Tampa Bay. Gerald McCoy tipped a pass on New Orleans' first possession, and Ronde Barber picked off the deflection. He had a nice return to the Saints' 13-yard line. Freeman threw a quick pass to Tiquan Underwood (2-35) on the next play for a touchdown.    Saint linebacker Jonathan Vilma was playing in his first game back and made an impact with a blitz that caused Freeman to throw a pass too high, allowing Roman Harper to collect an interception. The refs blew the call by saying it was an incompletion, and they screwed up the challenge by not reversing it. Vilma tipped a pass later on the same drive and almost intercepted it. Doug Martin (16-85) finished the possession with a 36-yard touchdown run. Freeman then opened up a 21-7 lead by hitting Vincent Jackson for a 17-yard touchdown. Brees answered with a deep pass to Devery Henderson for 39 yards in busted coverage. That led to a 17-yard touchdown pass to Marques Colston (7-73). Brees then went to Henderson (3-75) after he beat Eric Wright down the field, and Mark Barron missed a tackle on the sidelines. That set up a short touchdown pass to Darren Sproles (5-27 rushing, 4-32 receiving). The Saints' defense then finally got a stop, and Brees rewarded the effort with a 48-yard touchdown pass to Joe Morgan (only catch). The wideout shed tackles by Barron and Wright, who he'd already burned running down the field.    Brees was surgical in a 2.minute drill late in the first half. He gave the Saints the lead with a 20-yard touchdown pass to David Thomas (2-27), who was left uncovered by the safeties. The veteran signal-caller went 20-of-25 for 313 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception through the first 2 quarters.    The Bucs blew big opportunities in the third quarter, missing a 42-yard field goal and squandering a 95-yard catch by Jackson. Malcolm Jenkins showed great hustle to chase down Jackson short of a touchdown, but the wide receiver seemed to be coasting. LeGarrette Blount (5 for -2) was stopped on 3 tries, and on a 4.h-and-goal, Cam Jordan forced Freeman out of bounds. It was an epic fail for Tampa Bay with a bad decision by Greg Schiano not to take the points and terrible play-calling by offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan. The mistakes continued as the Bucs were called for an unsportsmanlike conduct on a pre-snap field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. Brees made Tampa Bay pay by the moving the ball close, setting up Pierre Thomas (13-32) to finish the drive with a short touchdown plunge. Brees finished 27-of-37 for 377 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Lance Moore (9-121) was his favorite target, as Jimmy Graham was out.    Freeman tossed a touchdown to Dallas Clark (5-51) with 4 minutes remaining. The Saints killed themselves with a few penalties on the drive to give the Buccaneers first downs. That gave Freeman 1 more chance, and he ripped the ball inside New Orleans' 10-yard line with 17 seconds remaining. Freeman connected with Jackson on a leaping catch in the back of the end zone, but his feet barely landed out of bounds. That led to the completion to Mike Williams that ended the game on illegal touching. Freeman finished 24-of-42 for 420 yards and 3 touchdowns.
