  "comment":"Will Heller was off the mark. Heller tipped the ball into the air and Buccaneers cornerback Aqib Talib snatched the loose ball and coasted into the end zone from 28 yards out for a touchdown. The next drive Stafford dropped a snap and it was almost recovered by Tampa Bay. Stafford led a second field goal drive in the first quarter, but he missed a wide-open Calvin Johnson in the end zone from busted coverage. The pass sailed over Johnson's head, and the Lions settled for another field goal.    Stafford made a beautiful touchdown toss on a 4.h down. Calvin Johnson got behind Talib for a 36-yard touchdown score. Stafford threw a perfect pass just over the hand of Talib. On the next possession Stafford tossed an 11-yard score to Tony Scheffler. In the third quarter, Stafford contributed to another long drive. It ended with him throwing another touchdown to Johnson on a fade route that beat Talib. After that play, Staffford's day was pretty much done as Detroit ran the ball to drain the clock. Stafford completed 24-of-33 passes for 305 yards with 3 touchdown and 1 interception. Here were Stafford's targets: Calvin Johnson: 10 Brandon Pettigrew: 6 Nate Burleson: 5 Javhid Best: 5 Maurice Morris: 2 Rashied Davis: 1 Tony Scheffler: 1 (and 1 screen pass ruled a lateral) Maurice Stovall: 1 Titus Young: 1 Will Heller: 1    Megatron was more dominant than his numbers indicate. He caught 6 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. The Bucs had no answer for him; not even Talib.    Javhid Best was the Lions' primary back against Tampa Bay. Best ran for 72 yards on 21 carries (3.4 average) while catching 4 passes for 42 yards. The Bucs defense was able to contain Best.    Tight end Brandon Pettigrew came close to having a big game. He almost had a couple of touchdowns, and he should have a productive season for Detroit. Pettigrew finished with 57 yards on 4 catches.    Wide receiver Nate Burleson also had an effective game for Detroit with catching all 5 of his targets for 60 yards.    For Tampa Bay, quarterback "
