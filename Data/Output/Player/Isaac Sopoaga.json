   "comment":"Isaac Sopoaga, who was not done making plays on the afternoon. San Francisco's offense from the 20 was pretty simple. On the 3 productive plays, they handed it to Sopoaga, who was not done making plays on the afternoon. San Francisco's offense from the 20 was pretty simple. On the 3 productive plays, they handed it to Frank Gore who gained 14 yards and scored the touchdown. Other than not catching a single pass, he was leaned on heavily with 31 rushes for 134 yards and that score for an early 7-0 lead. From time to time, McCoy did some damage with his legs, finishing with 8 scrambles for 30 yards. He had 1 such run for a first down on the next drive, but the Browns stalled and punted. The 49ers were pinned at the 1-yard line when Gore made it outside and picked up 23 yards. Almost all of his effective runs were away from the 2 Hutts in the middle, Ahtyba Rubin and Phil Taylor. His understudy Kendall Hunter followed with a nifty run for 26 yards breaking tackles along the way. With the defense stunned, there was only 1 play call - the pass to tackle Joe Staley. The former college tight end picked up 17 yards. The lengthy drive did stall eventually when an inside run by Gore was stuffed. A David Akers field goal made it 10-0. Cleveland's offense managed 1 first down before punting and the first quarter came to a close. San Francisco got another big run by Gore for 26 yards in between a pair of 19-yard receptions from their tight ends Vernon Davis and Justin Peelle. A Gore touchdown run was overturned, and 3 consecutive runs failed, giving the Browns possession on downs. It didn't matter too much. Cleveland did convert a third down with a 17-yard pass to Ben Watson and gained a little field position punting to San Francisco's 36. The 49ers sprinkled in a couple passes to their opponent's former top pick, Braylon Edwards, and capped the drive with a touchdown to their own top selection, Michael Crabtree, for the 17-0 lead. It was looking like a rout. The Browns did show some spunk in the 2-minute drill though. Dashaun Goldson was nailed for a 15-yard penalty and Joshua Cribbs caught a 12-yard pass to help set up a 52-yard field goal attempt. It put them on the board at the halftime gun, but the home team was very much in control. Whatever happened at halftime definitely changed things defensively for Cleveland. San Francisco went 3.and-out on 4 of their first 5 possessions. The Browns got feisty on offense, but getting back to the opening statement, lacked the playmakers to pull this 1 out. Goldson made up for his penalty earlier by killing a drive that reached the San Francisco 34 with an interception. McCoy threw it up for rookie Greg Little in the end zone, but he was doubled up. The score held at 17-3 after the third quarter. Rookie Aldon Smith sacked McCoy to end Cleveland's next drive, but the next time they got it, things became interesting all of a sudden. Cribbs caught a ball down the sideline and shed a tackle racing for a 46-yard touchdown. Leading by just 1 score, it was time for San Francisco's offense to regain their first-half form. This could mean only 1 thing - a pass to defensive tackle Sopoaga on third down from Cleveland's 32. It went for 18 yards and more importantly, allowed them to chew more time off the clock. The drive took 4:05 and concluded with a short Akers field goal to seal it at 20-10. Cleveland managed some garbage time yards and that was that. There really was not much to this game. "
