   "comment":"Bradshaw had a nice 18-yard run. Then, quarterback Eli Manning had a 21-yard pass to tight end Jake Ballard. Still, New York's drive fizzled inside the 20 and they had to settle for the kick. Miami kept up its strong play on its next drive. Moore ran for 11 on third-and-6. The next play saw running back Reggie Bush break out with a 35-yard run. He had a good hole to get to the second level of the defense. About 10 yards downfield, Bush broke tackles from Aaron Ross and Kenny Philips with a spin move. The Dolphins finished the drive on 4.h-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Moore ran a bootleg and coasted into the end zone to give the Dolphins a 14-3 lead. The Giants were able to answer the score. With only a few seconds left before halftime, Manning tossed a perfect corner touchdown pass to Mario Manningham. In the first half, Moore was excellent for Miami. He spun away from sacks, picked apart the secondary, and made critical drive-sustaining plays with his feet. His stats don't completely indicate just how well he was playing. He completed 8-of-11 passes for 71 yards with 5 carries for 31 yards and a score. Manning was also very good, throwing the ball accurately and making good decisions. The biggest issue for the Giants' offense was inconsistent play from the offensive line. To start the third quarter, Bush ran for 41 yards on 2 carries to get Miami a field goal. That was all the scoring of the third quarter as the teams gave their punters some work. Early in the final period, Manning led a field goal drive with 2 good passes to Ballard. On the next possession, the Giants took the lead when Manning hit wide out Victor Cruz on a slant in the intermediate part of the field. He slashed his way through the secondary and dashed into the end zone for a 25-yard score. That put New York up 20-17. The Giants' defense took over and started putting a lot of heat on Moore. New York's defensive line was overwhelming the Dolphins' front. Osi Umenyiora beat Jake Long for a sack. Mathias Kiwanuaka got by Vernon Carey for a sack on the next play. That ended up putting Moore in a 4th-and-23 just after the 2-minute warning. He threw downfield and was intercepted by Corey Webster. Jason Pierre-Paul, Linval Joseph and Justin Tuck also got into the sack column in the game. Moore finished 13-of-22 for 138 yards and 1 interception. Earlier in the week, Bush admitted that he and his team have been terrible this year. Well, Bush tried to do something about it as he ran for 103 yards on 15 carries. Wide receiver Brandon Marshall had 55 yards on 4 catches. Manning had a fabulous performance. He was 31-of-45 for 349 yards and 2 touchdowns. Bradshaw ran for 50 yards on 13 carries and had 5 receptions for 38 yards. The Giants wide outs all had solid games. Cruz led the unit with 7 receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown. "

I mentioned Bradshaw's fumble a bit earlier. He coughed the ball up again later on, but the play was reviewed and eventually ruled a non-fumble. Bradshaw didn't touch the ball again after that, perhaps because he suffered some sort of neck injury. He underwent X-rays afterward. "

   "comment":"Bradshaw, who was running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Another lost fumble for the Colts was charged to Andrew Luck, but that was really a botched handoff. Luck later missed a wide-open Coby Fleener on what would've been a long touchdown. I mention these Indianapolis blunders just to illustrate that this could've easily been a 48-0 result. If you don't believe me, consider this: By the time this game was 24-0 with 12 minutes remaining in regulation, the Colts had outgained the Bengals, 443-42. That's right - Indianapolis had Cincinnati outgained by 401 net yards!    Despite some of the mistakes, Luck had a strong showing. He went 27-of-42 for 344 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had issues generating first downs early - especially on third down, where both teams were a combined 0-of-14 in the opening half - but Luck eventually got into a groove and finished on a strong note. He was 13-of-17 for 152 yards and 2 scores following intermission.    Luck's leading receiver was T.Y. Hilton (7-107), while Reggie Wayne managed 4 receptions for only 15 yards. His scores went to Dwayne Allen (3-52) and Bradshaw (3 catches, 36 yards), who redeemed himself after that early fumble. It was nice to see the Colts' coaching staff continue to use Bradshaw after that initial mistake, whereas some coaches, like Bill Belichick and Tom Coughlin, would've made Bradshaw completely disappear.
