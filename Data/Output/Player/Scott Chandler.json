   "comment":"Scott Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score.Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score. He beat corner Kyle Arrington and safety Patrick Chung took a bad angle. Brady answered by catching fire. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Woodhead. Brady then moved the ball with passes to Wes Welker, and the signal-caller ran the ball into end zone on a short scramble. Brady followed that by throwing a strike to Ron Gronkowski for a 28-yard score. New England ran in short touchdowns with Stevan Ridley and Brandon Bolden to route the Bills with 31 points in the 4.h quarter.    The Bills out-executed the Patriots into the third quarter. New England missed 2 field goals; Welker fumbled the ball away; Gronkowski also coughed the ball up and let go of a potential touchdown. Once the Patriots put their foot on the gas, Buffalo had become a turnover machine and Ryan Fitzpatrick was throwing frequent interceptions.    New England stayed in the game because its front 7 was awesome. Vince Wilfork tipped a pass up and Jerod Mayo came down with the interception. C.J. Spiller (8-33) fumbled the ball inside the Patriots' 5.yard line after a massive hit from Brandon Spikes. Spikes forced another fumble in the second half. Fitzpatrick had T.J. Graham running deep with a step on Devin McCourty, but the pass was underthrown and fell into McCourty. McCourty had his second pick on another under thrown pass.    It was a mixed day for Gronkowski (5-104). He had a 41-yard catch that led to a short Ridley touchdown. He also was stripped of the ball by safety Jarius Byrd. A play after Gronkowksi's fumble, Fitzpatrick lofted in a touchdown pass to Chandler (4-62) over Chung.    Bills' corner "

   "comment":"Scott Chandler would then lose a fumble in the second quarter, which immediately led to an Alex Smith touchdown to Michael Crabtree. That turnover really got the 49ers going.    Smith was near-perfect, going 18-of-24 for 303 yards and 3 touchdowns through 3 quarters. He also had 49 rushing yards, including a 24-yard scramble. He left the game occasionally for Kaepernick, who had 39 rushing yards and a score on the ground himself. Kaepernick attempted only 1 pass, which was completed for 7 yards.    Smith's touchdowns went to Crabtree (6-113), the beleaguered Kyle Williams (2-50) and Mario Manningham (4-26). Both Kyle Williams and Manningham torched Aaron Williams. Vernon Davis also had a big game (5-106), mostly thanks to a 53-yard reception in which he was inexplicably wide open, thanks to Buffalo ineptness.    The 49ers ran all over the Bills, in case you couldn't tell by Smith and Kaepernick's rushing totals. Frank Gore rumbled for 106 yards and a touchdown on just 14 attempts, while Kendall Hunter gained 81 yards on only 11 carries.    Buffalo didn't have nearly as much success on the ground, which is an understatement. Fred Jackson (9-29) and C.J. Spiller (7-24) both found life very difficult Sunday afternoon.    Ryan Fitzpatrick went 16-of-26 for 126 yards and a very ugly interception in which his wobbling pass seemed to get caught in the wind and fall short of its intended target in the end zone.    San Francisco's defense shut down everything, including Steve Johnson, who had 6 catches for only 39 yards. Scott Chandler (4-40) was the team's leader in receiving yards, but he was guilty of that aforementioned fumble.   "

The Chiefs were then able to take the lead with an Alex Smith touchdown run because Leodis McKelvin muffed a punt. The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion.

   "comment":"Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, "

   "comment":"Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain.Chandler Jones tracked down Ryan Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5. and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain."
