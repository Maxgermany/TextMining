   "comment":"Scott Chandler would then lose a fumble in the second quarter, which immediately led to an Alex Smith touchdown to Michael Crabtree. That turnover really got the 49ers going.    Smith was near-perfect, going 18-of-24 for 303 yards and 3 touchdowns through 3 quarters. He also had 49 rushing yards, including a 24-yard scramble. He left the game occasionally for Kaepernick, who had 39 rushing yards and a score on the ground himself. Kaepernick attempted only 1 pass, which was completed for 7 yards.    Smith's touchdowns went to Crabtree (6-113), the beleaguered Kyle Williams (2-50) and Mario Manningham (4-26). Both Kyle Williams and Manningham torched Aaron Williams. Vernon Davis also had a big game (5-106), mostly thanks to a 53-yard reception in which he was inexplicably wide open, thanks to Buffalo ineptness.    The 49ers ran all over the Bills, in case you couldn't tell by Smith and Kaepernick's rushing totals. Frank Gore rumbled for 106 yards and a touchdown on just 14 attempts, while Kendall Hunter gained 81 yards on only 11 carries.    Buffalo didn't have nearly as much success on the ground, which is an understatement. Fred Jackson (9-29) and C.J. Spiller (7-24) both found life very difficult Sunday afternoon.    Ryan Fitzpatrick went 16-of-26 for 126 yards and a very ugly interception in which his wobbling pass seemed to get caught in the wind and fall short of its intended target in the end zone.    San Francisco's defense shut down everything, including Steve Johnson, who had 6 catches for only 39 yards. Scott Chandler (4-40) was the team's leader in receiving yards, but he was guilty of that aforementioned fumble.   "

He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, "
