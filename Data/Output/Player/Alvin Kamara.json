Drew Brees, as a result, didn't have to force poor throws against Chicago's fierce defense. Brees actually misfired on just 5 occasions, going 23-of-28 for 299 yards. He failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all season, but he didn't need to.    Mark Ingram had a solid statistical performance, gaining 75 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries to go along with 6 catches for 24 receiving yards. However, he drew the ire of Sean Payton for fumbling in the red zone late in the game when the Saints were up just 17-12. The Saints ended up kicking the middling field goal anyway because of the Bears turning the ball over on downs. Still, Ingram needs to take care of the ball because Payton is more than eager to give Kamara more touches. Kamara had 28 yards and a touchdown on 8 carries. He also snatched 3 catches for 48 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Kamara. The rookie out of Tennessee was an electric play-maker and was reminiscent of a bigger version of Darren Sproles. Kamara did a lot of damage as a receiver, and in the first half, he had 1 of the best touchdowns of the year. Kamara caught a dump-off pass and managed to weave in and out of the defense for a 33-yard touchdown. He broke multiple tackles en route to the end zone, and that helped to spark the Saints' scoring outburst. Kamara finished with 6 catches for 84 yards and a touchdown, and on the ground, he had 10 carries for 68 yards and a touchdown. The Saints will continue to heavily involve him on offense moving forward, as he is clearly 1 of their most dangerous weapons. "

   "comment":"Kamara. Ingram gained 131 yards and 3 touchdowns on 21 carries. He easily bulldozed the Bills, and he was clutch on an early play as well, picking up a 4.h-and-1 on the team's initial drive. Ingram wasn't a factor in the aerial attack, but Kamara was, catching all 5 of his targets for 32 receiving yards. Like Ingram, Kamara eclipsed the century mark on the ground, gashing the Bills for 106 yards and a touchdown on only 12 attempts. As with Ingram, Kamara moved the chains on a third down, but he did it after catching a pass. Kamara is probably the overall superior back, but the 2 will trample opposing defenses down the stretch as long as the offensive line remains intact. Of course, teams can't stack the line of scrimmage, or "

   "comment":"Kamara (6-75, 1 TD). Thomas saw a team-high 11 targets and was able to find space against Washington's secondary. On 1 nice catch, Thomas caught a short pass and proceeded to spin away from the defenders and push ahead for an extra 6 yards. As for Kamara, he did a lot of damage as a receiver and was able to catch what turned out to be the tying touchdown pass. Kamara was heavily targeted by Brees out of the backfield during the 2-minute drill in the first half. Kamara's versatility makes him a huge threat, and he can be trusted as a high-end RB2. . Brees' other favorite targets were tight end "
