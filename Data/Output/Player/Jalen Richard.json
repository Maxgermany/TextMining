   "comment":"Richard and DeAndre Washington were mixed in. Part of this was due to the fact that Murray lost a fumble and also had a ball squirt out of bounds on an early run. The better of the 2 rookies was Richard. He looked explosive and had a really nice run up the middle. He ended the day with 36 rushing yards on 6 carries. Richard should be used as the main third-down back for the team. Washington, a fifth-round pick from Texas A&amp;M, was not quite as good as Richard, but proved to be a decent option. Washington totaled 5 carries for 23 yards and should continue to be given carries due to his potential.    Jack Del Rio made another great coaching decision late in the fourth quarter, challenging the spot of a ball after a Carr scramble. Initially, it appeared that the call would have to stand, but it was revealed that Carr made it across the first-down marker. That allowed Oakland to run more time off the clock on what was ultimately the game-winning drive for the team.    On defense, "

   "comment":"Richard. The Raiders took a 19-7 lead into halftime. To start the third quarter, the Raiders' offensive line dominated the Colts' front 7 to open huge rushing lanes. That led to DeAndre Washington ripping off a 22-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing Colts possession, Malcolm Smith forced a fumble from Frank Gore (13-73), and the Raiders recovered it at the Indianapolis 38-yard line. A few plays later, Washington bolted for another 22-yard scoring run as he was untouched. That pushed the Raiders' lead to 33-7. The Colts finnaly got going again with a pass to T.Y. Hilton going for 39 yards to the 5-yard line. That set up a short touchdown pass from Luck to Robert Turbin. Early in the fourth quarter, Carr suffered his injury, leaving his team visibly crushed. Luck then moved the ball down the field before running a short touchdown into the end zone and converting a 2-point conversion to Hilton. At 33-22, the Colts got the ball back and promptly Luck hit Hilton on the run for 39 yards. The Colts settled for a field goal to make it 33-25 with 2:30 remaining. McGloin made a great throw to Cooper to get a first down on a third-and-long conversion just before the 2-minute warning. That allowed the Raiders to run out the clock on the Colts.    Carr was 20-of-30 for 228 yards with 3 touchdowns prior to the injury. Cooper had 4 catches for 72 yards.    DeAndre Washington was excellent for the Raiders with 12 carries for 99 yards with 2 scores and an 18-yard reception. Jalen Richard had 66 yards on 6 carries with 3 receptions for 13 yards and a touchdown.    Luck was 19-of-29 for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Colts' offensive line didn't give up a sack, but that was because of Luck. Indianapolis' blockers really struggled with "

   "comment":"Richard coughed up a punt return. That set up a field goal. The Bills drilled another 3-pointer a bit later when Derek Carr lofted an underthrown pass that was picked off. And just like that, the Bills were up 20-7 and never looked back.    Despite what I said about the Bills turning the Raiders over numerous times, I don't want to take anything away from Tyrod Taylor and the rest of the offense, which was extremely efficient in this contest. The Raiders, like the Bills, were missing multiple starters in the secondary, and Taylor took advantage of it. Taylor misfired just 7 times, going 20-of-27 for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The passing yardage number isn't an impressive figure, but because the Bills had the lead for most of the afternoon, Taylor didn't have to force anything downfield. What's important is that any time that Buffalo needed a big play to keep a drive alive, Taylor would deliver.    Of course, Buffalo's best player happened to be LeSean McCoy, who gashed NaVorro Bowman and the Raiders for 151 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He also caught 6 passes for 22 yards. Oakland simply had no answer for McCoy despite Bowman now being in the center of the defense.    Buffalo's leading receiver was Andre Holmes, who got revenge against his former team, catching 3 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown. Jordan Matthews (3-21) had a big gain nullified by penalty. Even Zay Jones got into the mix, snatching 3 receptions for 32 yards. It was a miracle that he didn't have any huge drops.    Meanwhile, Carr posted some misleading stats. He finished 31-of-49 for 313 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. A bulk of Carr's yardage came on a meaningless drive in the fourth quarter. He didn't look like himself, and it didn't appear as though the Raiders were willing to trust him in the early going, as they called for a run on a third-and-2 play. Carr spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, so it's fair to wonder when he'll be 100 percent.    While Carr regressed, the same could be said for Amari Cooper, who was a shell of the dominant player we saw on a recent Thursday night. Cooper caught 5 of his 10 targets for 48 yards. Michael Crabtree was way more productive, hauling in 5 balls for 83 yards.    Despite the fumble, DeAndre Washington had a strong fantasy outing as a receiver, catching 8 passes for 62 yards and a touchdown. He also led the team in rushing (6-26), outgaining Richard (5-21), so despite the error, the Raiders should consider utilizing Washington over the ineffective Marshawn Lynch.   "
