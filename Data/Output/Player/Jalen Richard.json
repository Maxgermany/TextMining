Richard looks fast and agile on the field, garnering 9 carries and turning them into 53 yards. He showed excellent burst and could be a weapon in all facets of the game. For now, it makes sense to use him as a change-of-pace back, but he could end up in a full split with Murray if he keeps doing well.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Jalen Richard. The Raiders took a 19-7 lead into halftime. To start the third quarter, the Raiders' offensive line dominated the Colts' front 7 to open huge rushing lanes. That led to DeAndre Washington ripping off a 22-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing Colts possession, Malcolm Smith forced a fumble from Frank Gore (13-73), and the Raiders recovered it at the Indianapolis 38-yard line. A few plays later, Washington bolted for another 22-yard scoring run as he was untouched. That pushed the Raiders' lead to 33-7. The Colts finnaly got going again with a pass to T.Y. Hilton going for 39 yards to the 5-yard line. That set up a short touchdown pass from Luck to Robert Turbin. Early in the 4.h quarter, Carr suffered his injury, leaving his team visibly crushed. Luck then moved the ball down the field before running a short touchdown into the end zone and converting a 2.point conversion to Hilton. At 33-22, the Colts got the ball back and promptly Luck hit Hilton on the run for 39 yards. The Colts settled for a field goal to make it 33-25 with 2:30 remaining. McGloin made a great throw to Cooper to get a first down on a third-and-long conversion just before the 2-minute warning. That allowed the Raiders to run out the clock on the Colts.    Carr was 20-of-30 for 228 yards with 3 touchdowns prior to the injury. Cooper had 4 catches for 72 yards.    DeAndre Washington was excellent for the Raiders with 12 carries for 99 yards with 2 scores and an 18-yard reception. Jalen Richard had 66 yards on 6 carries with 3 receptions for 13 yards and a touchdown.    Luck was 19-of-29 for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Colts' offensive line didn't give up a sack, but that was because of Luck. Indianapolis' blockers really struggled with "
