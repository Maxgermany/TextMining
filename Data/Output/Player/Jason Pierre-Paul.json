He wasn't as fortunate a bit later, as he was picked on an overthrow in Giants territory.

Siemian was more careful in the second half, but he still felt lots of pressure from Pierre-Paul, who dominated both right tackles in this contest. Siemian finished 29-of-50 for 376 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks. This was a poor showing for sure, but he was battling a tough defense that was desperate to avoid 0-6.
