   "comment":"Corey Clement, who had a nice 15-yard touchdown scamper late in the contest. Clement looked good, but will be kept in a limited role.    The Giants lost to fall to 0-3, but the most encouraging part of the victory for the team was the improvement of Manning. In the second half, Manning was able to help lead the team's offense without making many mistakes. He had issues throwing the ball downfield in the early portion of the contest, but once the 4.h quarter hit, he caught fire. On the first 3 drives of the 4.h quarter, Manning threw no incompletions and had the 3 touchdown passes. He was sharp and accurate, and finally looked to be in rhythm with his receivers. He was able to spread the ball around to his top options and really get everyone involved down the stretch. Overall, Manning finished 35-of-47 for 366 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. Though the picks were not good-looking plays, his second-half performance was very strong. The Giants are going to need him to play like that moving forward. Manning has to carry the offense. He truly is the team's catalyst.    Manning's top receiver was predictably Beckham for most of the contest. After missing Week 1 and being limited in Week 2, Beckham looked to be healthy for the first time. He caught the 2 touchdown passes and was able to rack up 79 yards on 9 catches. He also led the team with 13 targets. Beckham is undoubtedly a WR1 in fantasy, and he can be trusted in any matchup going forward. Elsewhere, "

  "comment":"Corey Clement (6-50) found the end zone.    As great was Wentz was in the second half, Philadelphia's defense was even more dominant. The Eagles pitched a shutout after halftime, as they limited Dallas to just 110 net yards in the second half, which includes some garbage-time yardage. They put tons of pressure on ",
