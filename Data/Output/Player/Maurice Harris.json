   "comment":"Harris, who made an acrobatic catch for the opening score of the game. As the first half continued, Cousins was able to find his receivers open over the middle of the field, as the lateral movement was what allowed the Redskins to find success against Minnesota's strong defense. However, Cousins did have 1 critical mistake. He threw a bad interception at the end of the first half that allowed the Vikings to have the ball in good field position. The Vikings converted for a touchdown, and that stretched the lead by 7. It was a costly play by Cousins that ensured Washington would be playing from behind in the second half. Overall, Cousins went 26-of-45 for 327 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He also ran the ball 4 times for 5 yards while scoring twice on the ground. Cousins was more effective than the numbers indicate, given that his team was playing from behind for the whole contest.    Cousins' favorite receivers were his over-the-middle weapons. Jamison Crowder (4-76) and Vernon Davis (7-76) each saw 11 targets and were very effective. Their ability to run cross-field routes separated them from the other Redskins who saw the field. Crowder had 1 nice catch that saw him find open space and turn on the jets to get 36 yards. He looks like a WR3 candidate for the rest of the season. As for Davis, he was able to steadily rip off chunks of yardage throughout the day. He was reliable for the Redskins, and at this point, they may want to consider keeping him as the starter over the disappointing and oft-injured Jordan Reed. Whenever Reed is out, Davis can be used as a TE1. Meanwhile, Josh Doctson (4-30) had a couple of nice catches, and he continues to improve each week. Maurice Harris (2-50) caught the other touchdown.
