   "comment":"Dwight Lowery. The loose ball was recovered by the Chargers at their own 21-yard line. They gave it back shortly later, however, after Demps intercepted an errant pass at the San Diego 38. The Texans got inside the 5-yard line, but settled for a field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Rivers led a drive, with Inman making receptions of 25 and 11 yards, to set up a short touchdown toss to Hunter Henry (2-20-1). Lowery later picked off an overthrow by Osweiler, and that basically clinched the game for San Diego. In garbage time, the Texans added a field goal and then recovered an onside kick, but 1 Hail Mary attempt fell incomplete and the final 1 was intercepted.    Rivers completed 22-of-30 for 242 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Inman led San Diego with 6 catches for 119 yards and a touchdown.    Melvin Gordon was held to only 70 yards on 17 carries with 4 receptions for 19 yards.    Osweiler was 22-of-37 for 246 yards with 3 interceptions. He played very poorly. Hopkins was held to 70 yards on 5 catches.    Lamar Miller ran for 57 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 18 yards. His fumble was painful.    While Dwight Lowery hasn't impressed this year, he had a big game with an interception and forced fumble. "
