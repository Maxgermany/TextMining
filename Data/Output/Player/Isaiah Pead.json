  "comment":"Isaiah Pead (3-5) barely did anything.    <b> Phil Simms Fun Time: </b> CBS still has Simms as its primary color analyst for some reason, so let's discuss some of the strange things he said during the telecast... It was an obvious but not obvious passing situation on second down. - I have no idea what this means. I guess we can say that this is an obvious but not obvious stupid quote from Simms. Maualuga gets a little rubbed on the inside. - I have to imagine Matt Millen was watching this telecast and began touching himself a little bit upon hearing this quote. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",
