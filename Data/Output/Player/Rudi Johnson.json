   "comment":"Rudi Johnson. Johnson totaled 83 rushing yards on 14 carries, and 48 receiving yards and a score on 3 receptions. Don't be fooled, however. Most of Rudi's yardage came when the game was out of reach and the 49ers were no longer focused on stopping the run. Rudi also fumbled. "

  "comment":"Rudi Johnson scored the opening touchdown of the game, it marked the first time the Lions have scored in the first quarter this season! It was also Detroit's first lead of the year! Hooray!    When the Lions kicked a field goal to extend their lead to 10-3, I wondered if I could say that they were running up the score. As Chris Berman would declare on the old <i> NFL Primetime</i>, Frisky Lions! Courageous Lions! I want courage! I want courrrrage!    Unfortunately, Detroit never made it to the Wizard. They eventually relinquished their lead - they held a 10-9 advantage late in the third quarter - and lost by 8. Of course, Washington had to kick that last field goal to screw me. Thanks a lot, jerks!    But hey... I can't blame the Redskins for being too good for the crappy Lions. Detroit converted just 2-of-12 third-down opportunities and punted on every single possession in the third quarter.    I don't know why Dan Orlovsky didn't go to Calvin Johnson more. Actually, I do know why - terrible arm strength and accuracy - but let's pretend that I'm clueless so I can keep complaining. Megatron caught 4 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown. Johnson also hurt his back from carrying the team.    Rudi Johnson had twice as many carries (8) as Kevin Smith did (4)."
