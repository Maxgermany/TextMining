Bullock, however, whiffed on his 43-yard try, which gave the Texans the victory. Thanks to Tennessee's loss to Jacksonville, Houston clinched the AFC South. That said, this win was certainly an adventure. The Texans didn't score at all in the opening half, generating just 34 net yards of offense. They averaged just 1.5 yards per play, an embarrassing figure, to say the least.
