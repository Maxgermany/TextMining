   "comment":"Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead.
