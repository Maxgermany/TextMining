He bobbled the ball, but was able to secure it and plant his knee inbounds before falling out of play. Barnidge caught 6 balls for 75 yards and a touchdown. This was his second-consecutive strong performance, and he's worth looking into if you need help at tight end.    The Chargers had a difficult task in this game, considering the number of injuries they dealt with on the offensive line. Three blockers were missing, and they also lost Stevie Johnson (hamstring) and "

It's almost pointless to describe it because I'm sure most of you have seen it already, but he somehow caught the ball when it landed in between his legs as he was falling down. He then rolled into the end zone for an inexplicable touchdown. Barnidge is quickly becoming a star; this is the third-consecutive huge outing he's enjoyed. Barnidge finished with 8 grabs for 139 yards and that score. Barnidge is owned in just 37 percent of ESPN leagues, so if he's available in yours, pick him up.    McCown completed multiple passes to 6 players. Barnidge was the leader in receiving yardage, while "

   "comment":"Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out. Troy Niklas (2-12) had 2 scores.    Josh McCown was 18-of-34 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The Browns had no running game. McCown led them with 18 yards on 5 carries. Isaiah Crowell (10-14) was ineffective, and for some reason, the explosive Duke Johnson had only 1 carry for 3 yards despite catching 2 passes for 68 yards.    Gary Barnidge led the Browns with 7 receptions for 53 yards. "

   "comment":"Barnidge in the end zone that could've won the game; and a pass inbounds with about 12 seconds remaining, which ended the game because the Browns didn't have any timeouts remaining. Manziel finished with some ugly passing numbers, going 13-of-32 for 136 yards and the pick. However, he led the team in rushing, scrambling 11 times for 108 yards on the ground. Manziel has had some nice moments recently, so that may convince the Browns to keep him around for 1 more year. However, he still has a lot of work to do to improve his capability in the passing game. It's fair to question whether or not Manziel will put in the effort this offseason.    As for the Chiefs, they clinched playoff berth with this victory, though it was yet another underwhelming 1. Kansas City once again struggled but won against a poor opponent, which can pretty much describe most of Andy Reid's victories in his 10.re with the Chiefs. This team will be in for a rude awakening when it finally battles a superior foe.    Alex Smith was mediocre as a passer. He went 15-of-22 for only 125 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped. He made a couple of nice throws, but most of his attempts were once again of the dink-and-dunk variety. In fact, Smith didn't throw a completion longer than 20 yards, and only 1 of his passes sailed longer than 14 yards. Smith was able to pick up some first downs with his legs - he scrambled 6 times for 54 rushing yards, more than half of which (29 yards) came when Barkevious Mingo failed to wrap him up for a sack - but Smith's conservative approach won't work against some of the better teams in the NFL. This is obvious, of course, but some delusional fans need to be reminded of this because they think their mediocre team is good.    Smith's touchdowns went to the usual suspects: Jeremy Maclin (5-49) and Travis Kelce (6-43), who posted average numbers otherwise. Maclin's score came against Tashaun Gipson, who is having a down season. It capped off a drive that was aided by a Paul Kruger offside penalty on a third down that ended up costing the defense.    Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware didn't split the touches evenly, which was a bit of a surprise. West gained 62 yards on 14 carries, while Spencer Ware handled just 5 attempts, which he turned into 15 yards.    Going back to the Browns for a bit, Isaiah Crowell was able to run well versus a tough Kansas City ground defense, gaining 88 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. Duke Johnson saw half as many carries, managing 26 yards on 8 totes.    Thanks to Manziel's passing ineptitude, Barnidge led the team in receiving with just 3 catches for 47 yards. Only 5 players in total caught passes. One was "

Unfortunately for the Browns, McCown giveth and almost always taketh away, as he held the ball too long near the goal line and was stripped of the ball, which was then recovered for a touchdown by the Steelers to make it 24-9.    This was a much-needed win by the Steelers, and especially helpful to them was the Baltimore Ravens' loss in Dallas, which give both teams 5-5 records atop the AFC North. The Ravens currently own the tiebreaker from having beaten the Steelers earlier this season.    The Browns, on the other hand, are now trying not to reach the depths of the 0-16 2008 Detroit Lions. Cleveland has 5 games left, against the Giants, Bengals, Bills, Chargers and then Steelers again. The Browns will of course be underdogs in each and will have to pull out an upset to keep from going winless in 2016. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Barnidge for a 13-yarder, but Griffin, overall, was very inaccurate, and the timing with his receivers seemed incredibly off. Even his stat line is inflated with garbage-time numbers; Griffin was just 2-of-10 for 20 yards and a pick in the opening half, but was able to move the chains in the second half when the Bengals took their foot off the gas.    Given that Griffin doesn't really care about football, he probably wasn't even aware of how great of a season Terrelle Pryor had been enjoying. I say that because Griffin threw to Pryor just 3 times, with Pryor coming up with 1 catch for only 3 yards. Instead, Griffin spent most of the afternoon firing inaccurate passes to Corey Coleman, whom he has undoubtedly heard of, if only because they're both alumni of the same school. Coleman's 11 targets turned into 3 catches for 26 yards. He trailed only Barnidge (3-27) in receiving. Barnidge dropped a pass, though Griffin was to blame as well for firng a poorly thrown ball.    The Browns trailed throughout, so they couldn't run much. "
