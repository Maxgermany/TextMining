   "comment":"Reggie Wayne, Rosenchoker threw a pick in Indianapolis territory, icing the game for the 4.leaf-clover-carrying Colts. I've been picking games on this Web site since 1999. Rosenchoker's choke job has to be 1 of the top 5 worst beats I've had this past decade. Like I said... roof, razor, noose or crappy FOX reality show. I'm not sure which is least painful.    Andre Johnson had a great game, considering how much of a loser Rosenchoker is. Johnson caught 9 balls for 131 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Steve Slaton ran all over the Bob Sanders-less Colts, gaining 93 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries. I have to wonder why Slaton didn't get the ball late in the 4.h quarter. Calling for multiple Rosenchoker carries is 1 of many gaffs Gary Kubiak has been guilty of this season.    So, did I mention the Colts were lucky? Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne put up solid stats, though most of that came once Rosenchoker went into meltdown mode. Manning was 25-of-34, 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Reggie Wayne had 7 receptions, 97 yards and the winning score.    Indianapolis' defense couldn't stop the Texans in the first 56 minutes of the game. I already gave you Slaton and Johnson's numbers; the Colts also were guilty of holding on a third-and-17, which gave Houston a first down. This was pre-Rosenchoker meltdown; otherwise, Rosenchoker would have just handed the ball to Brackett again.

He caught 7 passes for 106 yards and a very impressive touchdown in which he inexplicably tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of play. He still has it.    As for the team that didn't give up, Ben Tate rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He looked great, as expected. The reason I had him so low in my Week 1 Fantasy Football Rankings was because I wasn't sure what Gary Kubiak would do with his running backs. Tate was amazing, but Derrick Ward (11-39, TD) was the 1 who started and scored the first touchdown. The 2 backs split carries evenly until Ward left with a minor injury. Tate drew heavy praise from Kubiak, so he'll probably be the main guy if Arian Foster misses Week 2.    "

The 21 points off the 2 non-touchdowns and blocked punt may not have allowed Indianapolis to secure a victory, but it would have at least allowed them to have a chance to win at the end of the game. Instead, Arian Foster broke a couple of big gains in the final couple of minutes to give Houston a bulls*** front-door cover on a successful chip-shot field goal.    Luck handled himself well. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes, going 13-of-27 for 186 yards, but he threw 2 touchdowns. The impressive thing is that he didn't turn the ball over despite battling heavy pressure all afternoon. The Texans sacked Luck 5 times, including once at the end of the first quarter when he was hit so hard that I didn't think he'd be able to get up. J.J. Watt got to Luck on 3 occasions, giving him 19.5 sacks on the year.    While the offensive line couldn't pass protect, it did a good job of opening up running lanes. Vick Ballard posted great numbers, gaining 105 yards on 18 carries. With that in mind, it makes you wonder what the hell Moore (4-6) was doing on the goal line.    As previously mentioned, Wayne missed out on a touchdown. He would end up disappointing his fantasy owners with just 3 catches for 14 yards. Luck's scores were thrown to TY Hilton (3-78) and "

Denver escaped with a victory. It was shocking to see Luck fail on a 4.h-quarter comeback attempt, but there were 2 other major take-aways from this game: 1. Peyton Manning looked done in the second half. I never thought I'd be typing that after his brilliant first half - 16-of-22, 199 yards, 3 touchdowns - but he struggled to complete routine passes after the break. Manning was just 6-of-14 for 70 yards in the second half. He did endure a couple of drops, but he had receivers open and couldn't hit them. This includes a pair of major overthrows to his targets when he was trying to run out the clock near the end of regulation. I have no explanation for what happened. Manning was battling a defense mostly devoid of talent. He was so sharp prior to intermission, so I don't know why he looked like Josh McCown near the end of the game. 2. Denver's defense might just be able to carry this team. The Broncos did allow some scores late, but that was bound to happen against an exceptional quarterback like Luck. Besides, there were a couple of fluky instances, including 1 play in which the entire defense assumed Dwayne Allen went out of bounds when he tip-toed the sideline for a 41-yard, 4.h-quarter touchdown. DeMarcus Ware led the Broncos' pass rush with 1.5 sacks. The pressure he applied allowed Rahim Moore to come away with a pair of interceptions. Nate Irving (5 tackles, 1 sack) played well, but got hurt at 1 point. Roby, as mentioned, made the game-ending break-up on Wayne.    Wayne ended up leading the team with 9 receptions for 98 yards, but it was Allen (4-64) and "
