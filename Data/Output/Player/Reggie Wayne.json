   "comment":"Reggie Wayne, Rosenchoker threw a pick in Indianapolis territory, icing the game for the 4.leaf-clover-carrying Colts. I've been picking games on this Web site since 1999. Rosenchoker's choke job has to be 1 of the top 5 worst beats I've had this past decade. Like I said... roof, razor, noose or crappy FOX reality show. I'm not sure which is least painful.    Andre Johnson had a great game, considering how much of a loser Rosenchoker is. Johnson caught 9 balls for 131 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Steve Slaton ran all over the Bob Sanders-less Colts, gaining 93 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries. I have to wonder why Slaton didn't get the ball late in the 4.h quarter. Calling for multiple Rosenchoker carries is 1 of many gaffs Gary Kubiak has been guilty of this season.    So, did I mention the Colts were lucky? Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne put up solid stats, though most of that came once Rosenchoker went into meltdown mode. Manning was 25-of-34, 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Reggie Wayne had 7 receptions, 97 yards and the winning score.    Indianapolis' defense couldn't stop the Texans in the first 56 minutes of the game. I already gave you Slaton and Johnson's numbers; the Colts also were guilty of holding on a third-and-17, which gave Houston a first down. This was pre-Rosenchoker meltdown; otherwise, Rosenchoker would have just handed the ball to Brackett again.   "

He caught 7 passes for 106 yards and a very impressive touchdown in which he inexplicably tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of play. He still has it.    As for the team that didn't give up, Ben Tate rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He looked great, as expected. The reason I had him so low in my Week 1 Fantasy Football Rankings was because I wasn't sure what Gary Kubiak would do with his running backs. Tate was amazing, but Derrick Ward (11-39, TD) was the 1 who started and scored the first touchdown. The 2 backs split carries evenly until Ward left with a minor injury. Tate drew heavy praise from Kubiak, so he'll probably be the main guy if Arian Foster misses Week 2.    "

He was 8-of-16 on third down, so that is encouraging.    The Colts couldn't run the ball very well. "

   "comment":"Reggie Wayne was the other. The future Hall of Fame receiver had 1 of the worst performances of his career. He reeled in just 1 of his 8 targets for just 5 yards. He had a whopping 4 drops. One would've moved the chains, but the drop eventually led to a punt. Another ruined a potential big gain. A third was on the 2-point conversion, which would have pushed this spread (though I'm sure Blakeman would've come up with some sort of penalty).    The Colts actually have a highly productive receiver, and that would be Hilton, who had a monstrous outing. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets and snatched 10 of them for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns. "
