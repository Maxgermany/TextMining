They failed on their final attempt, forcing to settle for a field goal. Speaking of a poor coaching decision, what was Jim Caldwell doing when he called a timeout with 29 seconds remaining in regulation amid a running clock? Instead of being forced into an unfavorable 50-yard field goal, the Jets were able to run another play - which is when Sanchez hit Edwards for 18 yards along the sideline. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Rhodes (14-33) each achieved an unexpected first down in that situation.
