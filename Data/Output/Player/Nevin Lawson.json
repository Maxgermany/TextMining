   "comment":"Nevin Lawson missed a tackle, to let Britt dart into the end zone from 19 yards out. The Lions got on the board with a field goal set up mainly by a 20-yard run by Ameer Abdullah. Early in the second quarter, Detroit moved into Cleveland territory when Stafford made a nice play to buy time before hitting Tate on the run for a 35-yard gain. A 10-yard run by Stafford set up Abdullah to finish the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run that tied the game at 10. Then, the Browns started to play like the Browns; Nevin Lawson stripped tight end Seth DeValve of the ball and scooped it up. Lawson was untouched by DeValve and was able to bolt down the sideline for a 44-yard touchdown. In the final minutes of the half, Kizer made some nice throws to move ball into Detroit territory. He took off on an 18-yard run to get the ball to the 2.5-yard line with 19 seconds remaining. On second-and-goal with 15 seconds, Cleveland ran a quarterback sneak from over 2 yards out, and it was stuffed by Detroit. Before the Browns could get set up to spike the ball, the clock ran out, and they went into the half missing out on the points opportunity. It was a horrible play call, but hilarious and typical of the Browns.
