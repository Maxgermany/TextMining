   "comment":"Nicks for the decisive 29-yard score. Most of the talking heads on TV were pissed off about this and disagreed with the call, but I didn't - until I heard what Cruz said afterward. I thought it was pretty legitimate at first. If you look at Cruz, he glanced to his left and right, decided that he wasn't going anywhere, and dived down on his own. I figured he knew he wasn't touched, and thus gave himself up. Afterward, however, Cruz said that he thought he was touched. If that's the case, then Arizona definitely got hosed.    What's lost amid the controversy was Eli Manning's fourth-quarter performance. He finished 27-of-40 for 321 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final 4 minutes. The top-5 quarterback hit Nicks 10 times for 162 yards and Cruz on 6 occasions for 98 yards. Coming off a concussion, "

   "comment":"Nicks beat cornerback Drayton Florence for a 60-yard gain to the Bills 5-yard line. Bradshaw dove over the top of the line, in for another short touchdown run. In the third quarter, the Giants broke a 17-17 tie with another short touchdown run by Bradshaw. It was set up by some passes from Manning to Ballard. Initially, Manning had a touchdown pass to Manningham, but it was reversed and put on the 1-yard line, where Bradshaw finished it off. Giants cornerback Corey Webster made his first pick of the game in the third quarter. The pass was intended for Stevie Johnson, but was underthrown and Webster caught it. He returned it 25 yards to midfield. That set up a 50-yard field goal attempt which was blocked by Alex Carrington. Fitzpatrick tied the game at 24 with a short touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson. The Bills' veteran signal caller threw a strike to the back shoulder as Johnson got some separation from Corey Webster. In the fourth quarter, as the Bills were driving to take the lead, Webster intercepted a jump pass intended for Johnson at the 5-yard line. It was a critical play and a turning point that led to the Giants' win. Bradshaw led the drive to get New York in scoring position with a 37-yard run. The Bills produced a goal-line stand to hold the Giants to a field goal. New York's defense stopped Buffalo in short order to seal the game for the Giants. For the game, Manning played very well. He made good decisions and took care of the football. Manning completed 21-of-32 passes for 292 yards. Bradshaw led New York with 106 yards rushing on 26 carries and all 3 of the Giants' touchdowns. Ballard had an excellent game with 5 receptions for 81 yards. Nicks had 4 catches for 96 yards. Fitzpatrick finished the contest completing 21-of-30 passes for 244 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Jackson ran for 121 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 47 yards. Johnson had 5 catches for 39 yards and a score.   "

A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1, 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches.

   "comment":"Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1-handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1, 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

   "comment":"Nicks quit on a deep route. Eli Manning was just 2-of-7 for 24 yards after the opening period, and it just seemed evident that the Jets would run away with the victory. The Jets, however, would do stupid things on their own to keep the Giants in the game. Manning hit Victor Cruz for a 99-yard touchdown in the second quarter on what should have been a 10-yard gain or so. Two defenders whiffed on tackles. On the others side of the ball, Dustin Keller was clearly focused on some hot female in the stands because he had a ball hit him in the helmet and then dropped another pass. Nick Folk, meanwhile, whiffed on a 44-yard field goal that was way wide right as the first half concluded.    Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer also deserves a ton of blame. He didn't run the ball at all against a weak ground defense, with Shonn Greene getting just 14 carries for 58 yards. Instead, Mark Sanchez attempted a career-high 59 passes, finishing 30-of-59 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, however. Sanchez could have easily been picked off 5 times. He took a safety and had 2 lost fumbles overturned by replay. I don't know what Schottenheimer was thinking, but he easily solidified his status as 1 of the worst offensive coordinators in the NFL. He got Sanchez sacked 5 times, twice by Jason Pierre-Paul.    While Sanchez was pretty inept, he didn't really get any help from his receivers. I already mentioned Keller's drops. Santonio Holmes had 1 as well on a 3rd-and-9 that would have converted a first down at the end of the third quarter. Burress was whistled for offensive pass interference on a touchdown. Keller at least finished with quality numbers (8-77). Holmes disappointed his fantasy owners (4-50), as did Burress (3-34).    Cruz was definitely the top producer on both sides of the ball. In fact, he was the only Giant with more than 1 reception. He logged 3 grabs for 164 yards and a touchdown. Hakeem Nicks (1-20) did nothing.    It's hard to believe that Eli Manning was able to win by 15 points despite only 9 completions. He went 9-of-27 for 225 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception; his yardage obviously inflated by that 99-yard Cruz strike.    "

   "comment":"Nicks for a 72-yard touchdown, blowing this contest open. Michael Turner was stuffed on 3rd-and-1 on the ensuing possession. The Falcons had to punt, and New York would find the end zone a few minutes later. The 2 New York scores put the game out of reach, but you have to wonder what would have happened if Atlanta opted for the field goals. With 2 successful kicks, the team would have trailed 10-8, and the players wouldn't have been sulking on the bench.    While you could argue that Mike Smith made the right decision in being aggressive and going for it, no 1 can defend his antics at the end of the first half. Following an odd New York possession that featured a terrible spot by the officials, the Falcons were doing a decent job of moving the chains. They advanced to their own 45, but after being tackled inbounds, Smith inexplicably refused to take a timeout. The Falcons ran out of time and had to attempt a Hail Mary, and they went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. Remember when I said that Atlanta could have been down 10-8 with 2 kicks? Well, if Smith used a timeout and his team was able to drive down to field-goal range, the Falcons could have led 11-10 at the end of the third quarter. It's amazing how significant inept coaching decisions can be in an NFL game.    Regardless of the bad coaching, Matt Ryan was simply awful. He went 24-of-41 for just 199 yards, now owning an 0-3 playoff record. He suffered through some Roddy White drops, but he was pretty inaccurate all afternoon. He also looked shaky in the pocket. Despite the drops, White still caught 5 balls for 52 yards. Julio Jones was better statistically (7-64). Poor Tony Gonzalez, who still hasn't won a playoff game in his Hall-of-Fame career, had just 4 grabs for 44 yards.    The FOX announcers and studio analysts were shocked that the Falcons couldn't run the ball, as Michael Turner mustered just 41 yards on 15 carries. This shouldn't have been a surprise, as Turner really wore down during the stretch, averaging 3.6 YPC or worse in all but 1 game beginning in Week 12. The Giants have also improved against the rush lately.    New York, meanwhile, ran the ball really well. Brandon Jacobs (14-92) and Ahmad Bradshaw (14-63) both had more yards than Turner on fewer carries.    As for Eli Manning, he struggled early because his offensive line inexplicably struggled to block a mediocre Atlanta pass rush. However, Manning settled in during the second quarter and was on fire after halftime, finishing 23-of-32 for 277 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Two of Manning's scores went to Hakeem Nicks, who was a monster (6-115) because the Falcons paid so much attention to Victor Cruz (2-28)."

   "comment":"Nicks, as well a bogus personal foul penalty on Victor Cruz that was not a blow to the helmet - so give the Steelers credit for hanging in despite flying in that morning and having to deal with the emotion the Giants would be playing with in the wake of Super Hurricane Sandy. Pittsburgh did a great job of sticking with the running game despite falling behind early. Isaac Redman, starting because both Rashard Mendenhall and Jonathan Dwyer were out, rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries.    Ben Roethlisberger had a very good game overall despite the bogus strip-6. He finished 21-of-30 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in which he felt phantom pressure and uncharacteristically forced a pass into double coverage. He was especially sharp in the final quarter, going 6-of-8 for 99 yards and a score despite not having the services of Antonio Brown, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the opening period.    With Brown out, Mike Wallace (3-66, TD), Jerricho Cotchery (4-50), Heath Miller (4-48) and Emmanuel Sanders (2-20, TD) did a good job of picking up the slack.    Brown wasn't the only high-profile receiver who got hurt. Cruz took that illegitimate personal-foul penalty and was down on the ground for some time. He left, but reentered the contest later to lead the team in receiving; he caught 5 passes for 67 yards. In fact, Cruz was just 1 of 2 Giants to log more than 1 catch; the other was Martellus Bennett (3-40). Hakeem Nicks (1-10) was open deep in the first quarter, but was overthrown. He also drew the aforementioned pass interference, but that was a terrible call.    "

He coughed the ball up again later on, but the play was reviewed and eventually ruled a non-fumble. Bradshaw didn't touch the ball again after that, perhaps because he suffered some sort of neck injury. He underwent X-rays afterward. "

Luck had 24 attempts compared to 11 rushes by Dan Herron (23-63, TD) by intermission. However, Indianapolis was able to move the chains on the ground when it absolutely needed to. The team controlled the clock for 8 minutes on a fourth-quarter drive, setting up a field goal that put the team up 2 possessions, effectively sealing the victory.    It's not like Manning could even score once, so the final field goal may have been irrelevant. Manning's numbers were 26-of-46 for only 211 yards and a touchdown. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack. Manning's stats don't look terrible, but some of his completions occurred in garbage time, so that enhanced his yardage and already-hideous YPA (4.59). He was also nearly picked a couple of times, as the crowd frequently booed him throughout the second half. Perhaps Manning will get healthy next year, but he looked done as an elite quarterback late in the season, though I'm sure he would've found some way to lose in the playoffs even if he were 100 percent.    Manning wasn't the only Bronco who struggled. "
