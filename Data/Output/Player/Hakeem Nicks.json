Bradshaw dove over the top of the line, in for another short touchdown run. In the third quarter, the Giants broke a 17-17 tie with another short touchdown run by Bradshaw. It was set up by some passes from Manning to Ballard. Initially, Manning had a touchdown pass to Manningham, but it was reversed and put on the 1-yard line, where Bradshaw finished it off. Giants cornerback Corey Webster made his first pick of the game in the third quarter. The pass was intended for Stevie Johnson, but was underthrown and Webster caught it. He returned it 25 yards to midfield. That set up a 50-yard field goal attempt which was blocked by Alex Carrington. Fitzpatrick tied the game at 24 with a short touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson. The Bills' veteran signal caller threw a strike to the back shoulder as Johnson got some separation from Corey Webster. In the 4.h quarter, as the Bills were driving to take the lead, Webster intercepted a jump pass intended for Johnson at the 5-yard line. It was a critical play and a turning point that led to the Giants' win. Bradshaw led the drive to get New York in scoring position with a 37-yard run. The Bills produced a goal-line stand to hold the Giants to a field goal. New York's defense stopped Buffalo in short order to seal the game for the Giants. For the game, Manning played very well. He made good decisions and took care of the football. Manning completed 21-of-32 passes for 292 yards. Bradshaw led New York with 106 yards rushing on 26 carries and all 3 of the Giants' touchdowns. Ballard had an excellent game with 5 receptions for 81 yards. Nicks had 4 catches for 96 yards. Fitzpatrick finished the contest completing 21-of-30 passes for 244 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Jackson ran for 121 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 47 yards. Johnson had 5 catches for 39 yards and a score.   "

   "comment":"Hakeem Nicks quit on a deep route. Eli Manning was just 2-of-7 for 24 yards after the opening period, and it just seemed evident that the Jets would run away with the victory. The Jets, however, would do stupid things on their own to keep the Giants in the game. Manning hit Victor Cruz for a 99-yard touchdown in the second quarter on what should have been a 10-yard gain or so. Two defenders whiffed on tackles. On the others side of the ball, Dustin Keller was clearly focused on some hot female in the stands because he had a ball hit him in the helmet and then dropped another pass. Nick Folk, meanwhile, whiffed on a 44-yard field goal that was way wide right as the first half concluded.    Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer also deserves a ton of blame. He didn't run the ball at all against a weak ground defense, with Shonn Greene getting just 14 carries for 58 yards. Instead, Mark Sanchez attempted a career-high 59 passes, finishing 30-of-59 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, however. Sanchez could have easily been picked off 5 times. He took a safety and had 2 lost fumbles overturned by replay. I don't know what Schottenheimer was thinking, but he easily solidified his status as 1 of the worst offensive coordinators in the NFL. He got Sanchez sacked 5 times, twice by Jason Pierre-Paul.    While Sanchez was pretty inept, he didn't really get any help from his receivers. I already mentioned Keller's drops. Santonio Holmes had 1 as well on a 3rd-and-9 that would have converted a first down at the end of the third quarter. Burress was whistled for offensive pass interference on a touchdown. Keller at least finished with quality numbers (8-77). Holmes disappointed his fantasy owners (4-50), as did Burress (3-34).    Cruz was definitely the top producer on both sides of the ball. In fact, he was the only Giant with more than 1 reception. He logged 3 grabs for 164 yards and a touchdown. Hakeem Nicks (1-20) did nothing.    It's hard to believe that Eli Manning was able to win by 15 points despite only 9 completions. He went 9-of-27 for 225 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception; his yardage obviously inflated by that 99-yard Cruz strike.    Nicks quit on a deep route.

Isaac Redman, starting because both Rashard Mendenhall and Jonathan Dwyer were out, rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries.    Ben Roethlisberger had a very good game overall despite the bogus strip-six. He finished 21-of-30 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in which he felt phantom pressure and uncharacteristically forced a pass into double coverage. He was especially sharp in the final quarter, going 6-of-8 for 99 yards and a score despite not having the services of Antonio Brown, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the opening period.    With Brown out, Mike Wallace (3-66, TD), Jerricho Cotchery (4-50), Heath Miller (4-48) and Emmanuel Sanders (2-20, TD) did a good job of picking up the slack.
