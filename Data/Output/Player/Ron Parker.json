   "comment":"Ron Parker came up with the pick. There were too many 3.and-outs, and some drops didn't help. Rivers, however, got his act together in the final 2 frames, ultimately finishing 22-of-33 for 229 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Of course, the Chargers were very fortunate to score at the very end because they converted a fake punt on a sketchy spot. Not only was the play unmeasured; it also wasn't reviewed because the Chiefs appeared to recover a fumble returned for what seemed to be a game-winning score.

   "comment":"Ron Parker. At that point in the game, it appeared as though the Titans were going to shoot themselves in the foot enough to ensure a crucial loss. However, they showed resilience and never quit. Despite wasting all of their timeouts - they ran out of stoppages with 7 minutes remaining - they were able to mount a comeback. They scored what appeared to be a game-tying touchdown, but went for 2 and failed to convert. Following a Kansas City punt, the Titans were able to put themselves into field-goal range to get the unlikely victory.    Considering the extremely cold temperatures in Kansas City, the better running game was expected to win. Thus, it's no wonder that the Titans prevailed despite all of their early blunders. They have the superior ground attack, and their run defense is better than what the Chiefs have in that regard. That proved to be the case in this matchup, as Parker.
