   "comment":"Cook set the Titans up inside the 5-yard line, but the Steelers hunkered down and forced a field goal. The Steelers answered with a drive where Ben Roethlisberger moved the ball with passes downfield. Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown made good catches to get first downs. Big Ben finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. A fake punt where punter Daniel Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards. That set the Steelers up at the 17-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Hines Ward. After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9-yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward. Down 28-3, Hasselbeck and the Titans moved into the hurry-up offense. They were aided by a catch to Jared Cook that was actually an incompletion. The Titans capped the drive with Johnson's first touchdown of the season from 1-yard out. After the score, the Titans executed a nice onside kick that was recovered by cornerback "

Jerome Boger was just simply too inept to realize that.    As for the Bears, they moved the chains well - they actually outgained St Louis by 18 net yards - but they kept making dumb mistakes. I mentioned the Forte and McCown fumbles earlier. Also included were: - An impressive Forte touchdown run featuring multiple cuts and a spin move nullified by penalty. - McCown's errant throw toward an open "

He apologized to the team for being a bum afterward. - Carter, as mentioned, pick-sixed Davis. The Ram quarterback then was guilty of a game-ending interception when he overthrew his receiver. Morris Claiborne snagged the pick, which was huge for him because he struggled all afternoon.    Davis' late interceptions were a shame because he was great for most of this game. He ended up 30-of-42 for 327 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 picks. As noted, he missed out on a fourth score when Cook let the ball fall through his hands in the end zone. It should be noted though that Davis was nearly intercepted in the opening half by "

He had 2 receptions wiped out by offensive pass interference, but he failed to reel in a decent catch late in the game because he was able to get just 1 foot inbounds.    The Rams' leading receiver was Bailey, who logged 5 catches for 74 yards. "

Wilson took advantage with a gain to Kevin Norwood (2-34) for 31 yards, as the Rams had busted coverage with Jenkins leaving Norwood completely uncovered. On the next play, Lynch ran into the end zone from 9 yards out. The Seahawks' defense finished the Rams off when Lance Kendricks was stripped of a reception by Bobby Wagner. Bruce Irvin caught the ball in mid-air and raced down the sideline for a 49-yard score. It was scored a pick-6 for Irvin, but it really was a fumble by Kendricks that was returned for a score. The Rams moved the ball inside Seattle's 10-yard line, but Cook dropped a touchdown pass. "

   "comment":"Cook for a 17-yard gain. He then managed to complete another deep pass by threading the needle in between 2 defenders. Keenum made just 2 errors in this contest, both of which occurred on the final drive of the opening half. He had a pass that was dropped by a Tampa defender, and then he took a horrible sack to give his team no chance on a third down. However, those were his only blemishes. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the next couple of games. If Keenum puts together a pair of quality performances, the Rams may eschew taking a quarterback in the first round, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    As for Gurley, he had trouble finding room against a tough Tampa Bay run defense. He still performed well for his owners, however, as he generated 48 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He was in position for a second score following a Benny Cunningham kickoff return down to the 2-yard line, but he was stuffed on 3 consecutive plays.    Tavon Austin had a spectacular night. He scored twice; once rushing and once receiving. He compiled 32 rushing yards (4 carries) and 41 receiving yards (3 catches). It actually makes me wonder why he touched the ball just 7 times.    St. Louis' 2 leading receivers were Britt (2-71, TD) and Cook (4-64). It was surprising to see both try hard. They must have been motivated because they didn't want to embarrass themselves on national TV.    Moving on to the Buccaneers, Winston struggled, despite what his numbers may say. Winston went 29-of-50 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Those stats are completely misleading, as Winston was just 6-of-12 for 49 yards at halftime. A large chunk of his yardage, as well as both scores, came in garbage time. Winston was very inaccurate throughout the evening. He sailed passes over his receivers' heads, including "

Rodgers absolutely sucked the life out of the Jaguars in the second half. He orchestrated a drive that lasted more than 9 minutes. It culminated in a field goal, but don't blame Rodgers for that, as the Packers oddly opted to run the ball 3 times in a goal-to-go situation. I think it's foolish not to have Rodgers throw the ball at least once, given that he's arguably the best quarterback in the NFL.    Rodgers' 2 touchdowns were thrown to "

   "comment":"Cook, who impressively tapped his toes down along the sideline while falling out of bounds to set up Mason Crosby in field goal range. Crosby, who had already connected on a 56-yarder, drilled a 51-yard attempt to send the Packers to the NFC Championship with a showdown at Atlanta. It's a far cry from where the Packers once were; they were 4-6 following a Sunday night loss at Washington, and it appeared as though they weren't even going to make the playoffs.    Rodgers was his usual tremendous self, going 28-of-43 for 356 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was his first in 318 attempts, and it occurred when he uncharacteristically telegraphed an errant throw to Davante Adams, who was wide open downfield. Still, Rodgers proved that he's just as worthy of being the MVP, if not more, than Matt Ryan. Rodgers, despite missing Jordy Nelson, made tremendous throws all evening. The only times the Packers stalled, aside from the aforementioned pick, occurred when Geronimo Allison ran a wrong route, and when the officials missed blatant defensive pass interference calls. They made up for it with a very sketchy penalty in the fourth quarter; the referees had a terrible performance in this contest and really need to be downgraded.    It's not all good news for the Packers, however, as they suffered some injuries in this game. They lost Morgan Burnett on the first drive, and the stud safety was sorely missed, especially in the fourth quarter when his teammates were worn down. Linemen David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga were also banged up, but they remained in the game (Bakhtiari missed a series). The Packers will need both Burnett and Nelson back for next week's contest in Atlanta.    Cook was the big hero for the Packers for his spectacular catch. Cook was huge, logging 6 catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. He was guilty of a drop to negate a long gain, but he more than made up for it on the final drive. Adams finished with 5 catches for 76 yards, ranking second in yardage. He could've had a better day had the Cowboys not been constantly guilty of tugging on his jersey and not being called for it. "

Manuel had another chance following a field goal, but he floated a pass toward Cooper. Athletic safety Justin Simmons skied over Cooper to snatch the clinching interception.    It's unclear what Carr's injury is, but the Raiders need him to give themselves a chance at the playoffs; they won't win many games with Manuel, despite what we saw late in this contest. Carr went 10-of-18 for 143 yards and a touchdown. His offensive line struggled to block Denver's pass rush, and it didn't help that Michael Crabtree was out of the lineup. However, given how Manuel performed, it's conceivable that Carr could've led the Raiders to a victory at the very end. Manuel, by the way, went 11-of-17 for 106 yards and the pick.    Cooper was a major disappointment. He saw 8 targets, but came up with just 2 catches for 9 yards. He also had his seventh drop of the year. He needed to step up with Crabtree out, and he was a big-time bust, despite the tough matchup. Jared Cook had 3 receptions for 46 yards.    Speaking of struggling fantasy stars, "
