   "comment":"Jared Cook set the Titans up inside the 5.yard line, but the Steelers hunkered down and forced a field goal. The Steelers answered with a drive where Ben Roethlisberger moved the ball with passes downfield. Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown made good catches to get first downs. Big Ben finished the drive with an 8.yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. A fake punt where punter Daniel Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards. That set the Steelers up at the 17-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Hines Ward. After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9.yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward. Down 28-3, Hasselbeck and the Titans moved into the hurry-up offense. They were aided by a catch to Jared Cook that was actually an incompletion. The Titans capped the drive with Johnson's first touchdown of the season from 1.yard out. After the score, the Titans executed a nice onside kick that was recovered by cornerback "

He logged 4 receptions for 80 yards and Clemens' sole aerial score. Cook also drew a pass-interference lag in the end zone, though the throw should've been deemed uncatchable. Jerome Boger was just simply too inept to realize that.    As for the Bears, they moved the chains well - they actually outgained St Louis by 18 net yards - but they kept making dumb mistakes. I mentioned the Forte and McCown fumbles earlier. Also included were: - An impressive Forte touchdown run featuring multiple cuts and a spin move nullified by penalty. - McCown's errant throw toward an open "

   "comment":"Jared Cook for a 17-yard gain. He then managed to complete another deep pass by threading the needle in between 2 defenders. Keenum made just 2 errors in this contest, both of which occurred on the final drive of the opening half. He had a pass that was dropped by a Tampa defender, and then he took a horrible sack to give his team no chance on a third down. However, those were his only blemishes. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the next couple of games. If Keenum puts together a pair of quality performances, the Rams may eschew taking a quarterback in the first round, which is what I have happening in my .    As for Gurley, he had trouble finding room against a tough Tampa Bay run defense. He still performed well for his owners, however, as he generated 48 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He was in position for a second score following a "

Rodgers absolutely sucked the life out of the Jaguars in the second half. He orchestrated a drive that lasted more than 9 minutes. It culminated in a field goal, but don't blame Rodgers for that, as the Packers oddly opted to run the ball 3 times in a goal-to-go situation. I think it's foolish not to have Rodgers throw the ball at least once, given that he's arguably the best quarterback in the NFL.    Rodgers' 2 touchdowns were thrown to "

   "comment":"Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a "

   "comment":"Jared Cook both dropped passes, with the latter mishandling a ball in the end zone, which ultimately may have won the game. Manuel had another chance following a field goal, but he floated a pass toward Cooper. Athletic safety Justin Simmons skied over Cooper to snatch the clinching interception.    It's unclear what Carr's injury is, but the Raiders need him to give themselves a chance at the playoffs; they won't win many games with Manuel, despite what we saw late in this contest. Carr went 10-of-18 for 143 yards and a touchdown. His offensive line struggled to block Denver's pass rush, and it didn't help that Michael Crabtree was out of the lineup. However, given how Manuel performed, it's conceivable that Carr could've led the Raiders to a victory at the very end. Manuel, by the way, went 11-of-17 for 106 yards and the pick.    Cooper was a major disappointment. He saw 8 targets, but came up with just 2 catches for 9 yards. He also had his 7.h drop of the year. He needed to step up with Crabtree out, and he was a big-time bust, despite the tough matchup. Jared Cook had 3 receptions for 46 yards.    Speaking of struggling fantasy stars, "
