   "comment":"McCown on the other side, the Bears didn't seem to stand a chance. But that's why divisional rivalries are so fun. Chicago's offense moved the ball effectively with tough runs by Kahlil Bell, and short, accurate throws from McCown. The defense, meanwhile, buckled down and forced Green Bay into 3 consecutive 3-and-outs. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. The Bears killed themselves with stupid mistakes (penalties, missed field goal, 2 interceptions), while Rodgers caught fire, continuously torching beleaguered cornerback "

Of course, it helped McCown's cause that he could hand the ball off to "

   "comment":"McCown was fine in relief, so perhaps that'll give the Bears more confidence that they can move on without him following this offseason.    The Detroit Lions are in the drivers seat to win the NFC North for their first divisional championship in more than 20 years. After grabbing a tough road win at Chicago combined with Green Bay losing to the Eagles, Detroit is in sole possession of first place in the NFC North with 7 games remaining. The loss isn't the end of the world for the Bears, as they remain in the playoff race. After missing basically 6 quarters of action, Jay Cutler returned to the lineup for Chicago. The Bears started well with a good kick return by Devin Hester. Cutler hit Brandon Marshall for 3 completions including a 32-yard touchdown where Marshall beat Darius Slay in man coverage. The Lions came right back with Matthew Stafford ripping the ball through the Chicago's secondary to Calvin Johnson and Brandon Pettigrew (5-70). Stafford hit a slant to Kris Durham (1-5) to tie the game at 7. Just before halftime, the Bears put together a good drive with Cutler using Alshon Jeffery (9-114) to move the chains on some clutch conversions. However, the possession was ruined by an Ndamukong Suh tipped pass that was caught by DeAndre Leavy for an interception in the end zone. Cutler wasn't same by the end of the first half as he hobbled with his hip injury, a new ankle injury and a swollen hand. In the third quarter, Reggie Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte. He returned the interception 35 yards to the Lions' 9-yard line. A justified holding call on Matt Slausson took away a Matt Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Chris Houston, but the review of the play took the touchdown away as Jeffery had to re-control the ball when he landed on his back out of bounds. The Bears settled for a field goal and a 14-13 deficit. Conte came back with a clutch breakup covering Johnson in the end zone. David Akers missed the field goal, but it didn't matter as Stafford and Bush (14-105) moved the ball into Chicago territory on Detroit's next possession. Johnson beat Tillman in man coverage for a 14-yard score to give the Lions an 8-point lead with a little more than 2 minutes remaining. Josh McCown came in for the Bears' final drive of the game. "

However, the possession was ruined by an Ndamukong Suh tipped pass that was caught by DeAndre Leavy for an interception in the end zone. Cutler wasn't same by the end of the first half as he hobbled with his hip injury, a new ankle injury and a swollen hand. In the third quarter, Reggie Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte. He returned the interception 35 yards to the Lions' 9-yard line. A justified holding call on Matt Slausson took away a Matt Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Chris Houston, but the review of the play took the touchdown away as Jeffery had to re-control the ball when he landed on his back out of bounds. The Bears settled for a field goal and a 14-13 deficit. Conte came back with a clutch breakup covering Johnson in the end zone. David Akers missed the field goal, but it didn't matter as Stafford and Bush (14-105) moved the ball into Chicago territory on Detroit's next possession. Johnson beat Tillman in man coverage for a 14-yard score to give the Lions an 8-point lead with a little more than 2 minutes remaining. Josh McCown came in for the Bears' final drive of the game. "

   "comment":"McCown strip-6 in desperation time. Still, Chicago surrendered 406 net yards of offense to the Rams. Even with all of the injuries, this should not happen. The Bears fell behind early, thanks to a Tavon Austin 65-yard fake reverse and the aforementioned Forte turnover. This allowed the Rams to lean heavily on the run, which is 1 area Chicago's defense fails miserably. Zac Stacy rumbled for 87 yards and a touchdown on just 12 carries, but left early because of a concussion. Benny Cunningham stepped in and was able to pick up where Stacy left off; Cunningham gained 109 yards and a score on 13 attempts.    St. Louis didn't have to ask Clemens to do much. This was a good thing, as Clemens couldn't even complete half of his passes. He went 10-of-22 for 167 yards and a touchdown to Jared Cook. Cook happened to lead the Rams in receiving by a wide margin. In fact, he was the only St. Louis player with more than 2 catches. He logged 4 receptions for 80 yards and Clemens' sole aerial score. Cook also drew a pass-interference lag in the end zone, though the throw should've been deemed uncatchable. Jerome Boger was just simply too inept to realize that.    As for the Bears, they moved the chains well - they actually outgained St Louis by 18 net yards - but they kept making dumb mistakes. I mentioned the Forte and McCown fumbles earlier. Also included were: - An impressive Forte touchdown run featuring multiple cuts and a spin move nullified by penalty. - McCown's errant throw toward an open "

The Bears escaped with a victory, as Cutler went 22-of-31 for 265 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Cutler made some great throws, but the turnovers nearly cost his team a crucial win. McCown did a great job of taking care of the football while also scoring tons of points, so even though the Bears were victorious in this game, that doesn't mean Trestman made the right choice.

   "comment":"McCown was pick-sixed on a telegraphed throw. Rainey lost a fumble on what appeared to secure the team's initial first down. Tampa recovered an Antone Smith fumble at its own 1-yard line, but following a 3-and-out, Hester did this thing and expanded the lead to 35-0. All the Tampa players could do was sit on the sidelines, staring vacantly into the distance.    Ryan finished 21-of-24 for 286 yards and 3 yards. He was pulled in the third quarter because the game was so out of hand. It was nice to see him so locked in after last week's loss. Sure, the Buccaneers were missing some very key personnel in Gerald McCoy, Michael Johnson and Mason Foster, but Ryan didn't have Roddy White's services. He also lost Harry Douglas (2 catches, 14 yards, TD) to an injury in the second quarter. Douglas walked to the locker room with a limp. With White out, Julio Jones was more productive than usual, catching 9 balls for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Not bad for 2-and-a-half quarters of work. Jones was the recipient of that third-and-17 heave that helped put this game away, but his best reception was a remarkable over-the-shoulder catch in the third quarter that turned out to be 40-yard score.    Aside from Hester's rushing touchdown, the Falcons scored twice on the ground with Steven Jackson (14-54) and Antone Smith (4-50) in garbage time. Jackson wasn't great or anything, but he didn't look like a slow plodder in this game. The offensive line was most responsible for his production, however, as it blasted open massive holes for him versus a depleted defense. Meanwhile, Devonta Freeman (11 carries, 12 yards), struggled to do much. He lost a fumble in the second half.    As for the Buccaneers, McCown was an absolute train wreck. He went 5-of-12 for 58 yards and the telegraphed pick-6 before leaving the game with an injury that he sustained when he banged his hand on a helmet. McCown couldn't do anything while he was in the game, as he missed routine passes badly. The Buccaneers didn't even achieve a first down until the 6:51 mark of the second quarter. "

Bears: Jay Cutler was strip-sacked, which led to a Tampa touchdown. Bucs: Speaking of that Tampa score, Mike Evans was whistled for taunting, which gave the Bears a very short field. Bears: Chicago did nothing with the short field position, as there was a dropped interception. Robbie Gould followed that up with a missed field goal, albeit from 54 yards. The Bears then allowed a completion to Vincent Jackson on a third-and-23. Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims."

At first glance, it looked like a completely idiotic decision, given that it's against the rules to challenge in the last 2 minutes of each half. However, what Lewis really did was stop the clock and allow the replay booth to look at the previous snap - which showed that the Buccaneers somehow had 12 men on the field. Tampa, as a consequence, had the ball at the Cincinnati 46 and couldn't move back into field-goal range. The Bengals eventually took over on downs and won the game.

   "comment":"McCown led what looked like a promising scoring drive in the first quarter, but fumbled short of the goal line when he took a big hit prior to flying into the end zone. He left the game, forcing Cleveland to use Manziel the rest of the way. Manziel had a nice start, but quickly reminded everyone of why he is 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL. He was responsible for 2 horrible turnovers that set up the Jets for easy points. New York, hindered by an anemic offense that shouldn't be able to produce many points, suddenly found itself with 31-spot on the scoreboard. Manziel's give-away count was 3. The first was an interception on an inaccurate throw toward Brian Hartline. The next 2 were fumbles. The initial 1 occurred when he was running around like an idiot and stripped as a consequence. The second happened on a blind-side strip-sack. The trio of turnovers were transformed into 14 points from Jets, meaning the score would've been 17-10, had Manziel not been careless. Perhaps the Browns could've mounted a comeback in a 1-score affair, but Manziel gave them no chance.    Having said that, I don't want to completely ignore what the Jets accomplished because they do deserve some credit for this victory. They had key contributions from their prominent players, including Brandon Marshall, who caught 6 balls for 62 yards and a touchdown. I wanted to lead off with Marshall right away because he appeared to save the day when the game was still in doubt. Ryan Fitzpatrick threw an interception, caught by Tashaun Gipson. Marshall, however, ripped the ball out of Gipson's hands, setting up the Jets with an easy touchdown. It was nice to see some effort from him, as he appeared to slack off throughout the 2014 season.    Speaking of Fitzpatrick, he performed well, outside of the pick. He went 15-of-24 for 179 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. It was odd to see so much life from him, but then again, he was playing the Browns. It helped that he got a bit lucky early on, somehow recovering a fumble from a horrible snap on his own 2-yard line while being flipped over. There were 4 Cleveland defenders around the ball, but Fitzpatrick somehow came up with it.    Chris Ivory had a very strong debut, showing why he should've been the primary ball-carrier last year instead of the overrated Chris Johnson. Ivory accumulated 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 attempts. Ivory had a scoring reception wiped out by a James Carpenter hold, but he found the end zone on the same drive anyway.    I mentioned that Marshall caught 1 of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns. The other was hauled in by Eric Decker, thought he managed just 2 receptions for 37 yards. He doesn't belong on 12-team rosters.    Going back to the Browns, Manziel finished 13-of-24 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, a pick and the 2 fumbles. I mentioned all of his mistakes before. He made a couple of nice plays early on, hooking up with Travis Benjamin for a 54-yard touchdown. He had a cool-looking first-down scramble, featuring a juke move, but that was negated by a chop block. However, the first fumble of his came immediately after that. He then overshot Andrew Hawkins, who was wide open in the end zone. As for McCown, he looked much more promising, going 5-of-8 for 49 yards. It seemed like the Browns were going to be much more competitive with him under center. I know McCown isn't very good, but he's light years ahead of Manziel.    Manziel happened to be Cleveland's leading rusher; he scrambled 5 times for 35 rushing yards. More hilariously, McCown was second on the list! He managed 23 yards on 3 scrambles. "

However, Tramon Williams inexplicably was offside, so kicker Josh Lambo had a second opportunity. He converted, giving San Diego a victory and Cleveland yet another defeat. McCown played extremely well, which was a huge surprise because the Chargers have considerable talent in their secondary. He misfired on just 9 occasions, finishing 32-of-41 for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns. He began slowly, going 3-and-out on his first drive and then losing a fumble because he held on to the ball too long. However, the later the game progressed, the sharper he was, tossing only 2 incompletions in the second half (13-of-15, 144 yards, TD). He made some mistakes, like nearly fumbling again and taking a bad sack to take his team out of field-goal range, but he was very solid overall.    McCown doesn't have quality receivers outside of "

The Browns opened a lead in the first quarter as McCown converted a third-and-7 to Andrew Hawkins (3-28) and another to Duke Johnson (3-12 rushing, 4-44) as he ran a great route with a superb catch for 28 yards."

   "comment":"McCown's first drive featured an interception. His arm was hit by Terrell Suggs as he released the ball, but his throwing motion is slower than Kessler's. McCown's second possession featured a near-interception and then a fumble, which he was lucky to recover. On the third drive, McCown launched a careless interception into double coverage. He was guilty of a strip-sack on the fourth drive, as he showed zero awareness in the pocket. His fifth drive featured a tipped pass that was inches away from being a pick-6. McCown did not look ready to play, and the stats demonstrate it. He was 6-of-13 for 59 yards and 2 picks. He was infinitely worse than Kessler, and the Browns didn't have a chance to stay competitive with McCown under center. Again, it was a 13-7 contest when Jackson yanked a healthy Kessler. Perhaps Kessler would've been able to engineer some drives, and it's likely that he would've been more careful with the ball than McCown was. There's really no excuse for Jackson's abysmal decision-making, and if the Browns want to fire him as a result of this embarrassing performance, I couldn't blame them at all.    Only 2 Browns accumulated more than 25 receiving yards: "

   "comment":"McCown's arm as he released the ball. The pass was picked off and taken back for 6. That effectively sealed the victory for New York, as the Browns didn't have much going on offense throughout the afternoon.    The Giants are fortunate that the Browns were guilty of dumb errors, as they couldn't do much on offense either. Again, 13 of their 27 points - an extra point was missed - came as a result of Cleveland turnovers. With that in mind, it's a horrible sign that New York was able to muster just 14 points against Cleveland's woeful defense. And don't blame Beckham's injury either. Though he missed some action, he still saw 11 targets. He reeled in 6 of them for 96 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've had a third score, but Eli Manning overthrew him on the first drive, as Beckham torched Joe Haden.    Manning accumulated 3 touchdowns, but struggled once again. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-27 for only 194 yards. That is a truly horrible stat line against 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Most quarterbacks have torched the Browns this year, so it has to be very discouraging for the Giants that Manning couldn't do much. He should've been able to make several downfield throws, but was just inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't all Manning's fault, as his offensive line had issues keeping the Browns out of the backfield. Cleveland sacked Manning once, but that's not indicative of the pressure Manning saw. Rookie Emmnauel Ogbah put some good heat on the Giant signal-caller.    Excluding Beckham, only 1 Giant had more than 18 receiving yards. That was Victor Cruz, who snatched just 1 of his 5 targets for 37 yards. Sterling Shepard didn't see a single target.    It wasn't a surprise that New York didn't run the ball very well against the Browns. Rashad Jennings gained 55 yards on 15 carries, while Paul Perkins (9-29) did about half as much.    As for the Browns, Josh McCown was able to post solid stats, going 25-of-43 for 322 yards and a touchdown. Don't be deceived, however, as much of this occurred in garbage time. To prove it, McCown was just 10-of-20 for 112 yards in the opening half. Many of his passes were way off the mark; on 1 occasion, he missed a wide-open "

The play was close, and it could've gone either way. McCown then had an interception, but that occurred because Powell slipped. McCown finished 22-of-31 for 224 yards and the 2 turnovers.    "

   "comment":"McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    Kenny Stills was 1 of the heroes during Miami's late-game comeback. He caught both touchdowns in the fourth quarter, snatching 6 balls for 85 yards overall. On top of that, Stills made an acrobatic catch in the first half. Perhaps Stills will remain a big part of the offense when DeVante Parker returns, though his targets (9) will likely decrease. Jarvis Landry actually led the team in that category, as he reeled in 7 of 11 balls thrown his way for 93 yards and a touchdown. Julius Thomas (3-58) made an impressive, 1-handed grab during Miami's comeback.    I remarked earlier that better players happen to be on Miami's bench, and that was the case with Jake Brendel being on the sideline with Mike Pouncey on the field. The reason the Dolphins ran so well in Atlanta was Brendel providing a huge upgrade over the hobbled Pouncey, who needs hip surgery. I don't know why the Dolphins rushed Pouncey back, as it certainly affected Jay Ajayi's stat line. Ajayi mustered just 51 yards on 23 carries.    The Jets, meanwhile, had some decent quarterbacking from McCown until the very end. McCown was 17-of-27 for 209 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. McCown's first score was an absolutely pefect touch pass to "

   "comment":"McCown found tight end Eric Tomlinson (1-20) wide open down the seam for a 20-yard touchdown. New York was set up for more points, as Ryan fumbled a snap and the Jets recovered at the Falcons 34-yard line, but Chandler Catanzaro missed the 46-yard field goal attempt. Atlanta got moving with Ryan hitting tight ends Levine Toilolo (2-20) and Austin Hooper (4-47-1) for 50 yards combined over 3 receptions. To end the drive, Ryan found Hooper in the back of the end zone. Ryan later fumbled another snap, and Jamal Adams was Johnny on the spot to recover the ball, which set up the Jets at the Falcons' 20-yard line. New York went backward from there, but this time, Catanzaro was good on a 43-yard field goal. Atlanta responded with a drive down the field. Ryan hit Mohamed Sanu (3-74) for 16 yards, had a 14-yard scramble, and then found Devonta Freeman for 20 yards to get inside the 10. Hooper dropped a touchdown, leaving Atlanta to settle for a field goal to the tie the game at 10. The Jets came back with McCown leading New York down the field, and Robby Anderson burned Desmond Trufant for a 24-yard touchdown."
