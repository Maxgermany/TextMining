And thanks to the first of Darren McFadden's touchdowns, Oakland's offense found the end zone for the first time all month!    I liked the fact that the Raiders covered this game, but I'm pissed because I called for Justin Fargas to have a big game. Fargas ran for 107 yards, but McFadden vultured 2 touchdowns away. McFadden had 38 yards on 10 rushes.    Though JaMarcus Russell had just 152 yards, he played exceptionally well, completing 10-of-11 attempts and throwing a touchdown.    Ashley Lelie was Russell's leading receiver, catching 4 balls for 92 yards and a score. Zach Miller had 3 grabs for 41 yards.    What was up with Jay Cutler today? Cutler was horrendous, going 16-of-37 for 204 yards and a pick. He also lost a fumble. I hate to say it because it's unfortunate, but we'll never know how much his diabetes is affecting him. I wouldn't be shocked in the slightest if that hindered his performance in this contest.    Despite Cutler's struggles, Brandon Marshall still managed 4 receptions for 84 yards. Eddie Royal caught just 2 passes.    Peyton Hillis, dubbed by many as the next Mike Alstott, rushed for 74 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Hillis is worth starting in lucrative matchups, though he should be on your bench next week, as the Broncos battle the Jets.    Despite Higgins' kick return, the play of the game belongs to Tom Cable. In the middle of the contest, Cutler fired a ball out of bounds that looked like it was homing in on Cable's family jewels. At the last second, Cable was able to karate kick the ball out of the way, sparing himself some excruciating pain.    Oh, and I almost forgot... Congratulations to the Raiders for being the first team to score 4 points in a very long time. Here's proof:   "
