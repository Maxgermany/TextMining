What I did have a problem with is that Reid didn't have the guts to approach McNabb and tell him that he was going with Kolb. McNabb had to find out from 1 of the assistants as he was preparing to warm up.    Unfortunately, Kolb played like... well... a rookie quarterback going against a tough defense.

Thanks in part to immense pressure in his face, Kolb was awful in the season opener, going just 5-of-10 for 24 yards before getting knocked out of the game. QB Dog Killer entered afterward, and caught an unprepared Packers defense off-guard by rushing for 103 yards on 11 carries. The Packers didn't prepare to defend QB Dog Killer going into the contest, so don't buy the deranged psychopath's performance.    With Kolb out or struggling, none of Philadelphia's receivers did much. "

The Panthers blew a number of coverages, making things much easier to Kolb. Still, he deserves credit for being able to convert those opportunities, whereas Derek Anderson probably would have drunkenly tossed an interception and then laughed on the sidelines.    Chris Wells looked great in the preseason, so it was not surprising to see him dash for 90 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Wells looked quick and spry, showing no lingering effects from last year's injuries.    I'm not sure who was calling this game for FOX. I thought it was Dick Stockton, until I may have heard him doing the 49ers-Seahawks game. Perhaps he was everywhere. Nevertheless, I thought it was hilarious when Stockton(??) called "

Of Arizona's 15 rushing attempts, 14 were by Chris Wells, who tallied 93 yards and a touchdown. Wells looked great and the Redskins had no answer for him. Now completely healthy, he needs to be utilized more often.    If there's a negative to come out of this game for Washington, it's that this shouldn't have been as close as the final score indicates. The Redskins won the time of possession by 15 minutes and outgained Arizona by 130 yards. They were simply sloppy deep in Arizona territory, missing a field goal and committing 2 turnovers.   "

   "comment":"Kolb had a pass intended for tight end Rob Housler deflected and it was intercepted by Steelers safety Ryan Clark. Shortly later, Heath Miller got open in busted zone coverage and Ben Roethlisberger lofted in an easy touchdown pass. Roethlisberger struck again when he tossed a perfect go route to wide receiver Mike Wallace. The third-year wide out burned cornerback Richard Marshall and a safety running down the field. Wallace sprinted into the end zone with a 95-yard touchdown. The Cardinals answered with a penalty-aided drive that set up a short touchdown run from Alfonso Smith. At halftime, the Steelers had a 17-7 lead. Arizona running back Beanie Wells left the game with an injury. Early in the third quarter, Kolb hit running back LaRod Stephens-Howling on a crossing route."

Let's take a look at how Kolb (10-of-21, 153 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT) tried to lose this game for Arizona: - He took 6 sacks, including 3 on the first 2 drives. I wouldn't say all of them were his fault, but most were the result of him holding on to the ball too long. Kolb's pocket presence and footwork have been beyond shoddy this year. - Kob was strip-sacked on the third drive, leading to a Baltimore touchdown. - He tossed an interception in his own territory down 4 at the end of the third quarter. - "

   "comment":"Kolb, unlike John Skelton, wouldn't telegraph his passes. Skelton had this issue in a loss at San Francisco back in Week 11. Arizona performed well otherwise in that contest. So, what happened? Kolb suffered a head injury on the opening drive. I thought Skelton would cost his team the game again, and that seemed to be the case when the Cardinals were able to muster just 2 first downs in the opening half. Well, apparently not. Skelton was solid in relief. He made a couple of bad decisions on a pair of interceptions, but was good otherwise, going 19-of-28 for 282 yards, 3 touchdowns and the picks. He also showed great mobility, picking up 25 yards on 6 scrambles. Skelton's second interception was actually challenged by Whisenhunt even though it was painfully obvious that the play wasn't going to be overturned. Whisenhunt should probably be stripped of his red flags because he tried to have yet another clear call reviewed earlier. It was actually a good challenge, but only by accident. The red flag disrupted a San Francisco fake punt that caught Arizona unawares, but the 49ers weren't docked a challenge because the replay equipment malfunctioned for some strange reason.    "

He didn't throw any interceptions this time, but he lost 2 fumbles, including 1 at the end of the first half that was returned for a touchdown. I honestly thought he was playing with a concussion; he banged his head several plays beforehand and didn't seem right when he got up. On the strip-six, he stood in the pocket like an idiot despite the fact that the clock was at about the 4-second mark. He was sacked, and the ball came out. James Sanders took it back 93 yards. QBDK finished 17-of-37 for 217 yards otherwise. He took numerous crushing hits from Arizona's unbelievable defense. The Cardinals sacked him 5 times, as center Jason Kelce was sorely missed.    The Eagles are coached poorly, and that was evident in this contest, as LeSean McCoy inexplicably had just 4 carries in the first half. He finished with 70 yards on 13 carries, so that should tell you that most of his rushing statistics came in garbage time.    Jeremy Maclin was out. Rookie Damaris Johnson started in his place and caught 5 balls for 84 yards. DeSean Jackson (3-43) and Brent Celek (2-36) disappointed their fantasy owners.    As for Kolb, I'm beginning to think that Reid never watched what his former quarterback did in practice. Kolb went 17-of-24 for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns. He took several sacks, as expected, but was really sharp otherwise. Kolb's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Kolb's 324 passing yards or Arizona's current record of 4-0. I don't even know where to begin, to be honest. Well, I guess I should congratulate the Dolphins on a valiant effort. The Cardinals were missing stud defensive lineman Darnell Dockett, but Tannehill's stat line of 26-of-41 for 431 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions was impressive nonetheless. Tannehill, who misfired on numerous long attempts against the Jets last week, connected on multiple long bombs to Hartline. However, he made what would be the game-losing pick in overtime, heaving the ball carelessly as he was hit. It's worth noting that Tannehill was actually intercepted on a third occasion just after halftime, but the turnover was wiped away because of a shaky call on Adrian Wilson. Tannehill also took a terrible sack in the red zone in the first half on what was a loss of 14 yards.    Hartline was awesome. He caught 12 balls for the 253 yards I mentioned. The bulk of it came on an 80-yard touchdown bomb in the 4.h quarter when it appeared as though Arizona established control of the game. Davone Bess, meanwhile, snagged 7 balls for 123 yards.    Reggie Bush was a game-time decision but ended up playing. He gained 67 yards on just 17 yards. He, as well as Daniel Thomas (4-4), lost a goal-line carry to Jorvorskie Lane, who converted.    A Miami skill-position player who nearly screwed them was Legedu Naanee, who caught a ball and fumbled in the 4.h quarter. I didn't think it was a fumble because Naanee didn't make a football move, but I guess I was biased. Patrick Peterson scooped up the football and took it inside the Miami 5-yard line. However, 2 plays later, Sean Smith made 1 of the best sideline interceptions I've ever seen, though it's worth noting that he shoved Larry Fitzgerald out of the way prior to making the pick. On the very next play, Tannehill hit Hartline for the aforementioned 80-yarder.    The Dolphins established a 21-14 lead, but Kevin Kolb had a very clutch drive, culminating with a 15-yard touchdown to Andre Roberts on a last-gasp 4."
