   "comment":"Kevin Kolb's numbers (18-of-27, 309 yards, 2 TDs) look a bit better than he actually performed, but he did a solid job managing the offense. The Panthers blew a number of coverages, making things much easier to Kolb. Still, he deserves credit for being able to convert those opportunities, whereas Derek Anderson probably would have drunkenly tossed an interception and then laughed on the sidelines.    Chris Wells looked great in the preseason, so it was not surprising to see him dash for 90 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Wells looked quick and spry, showing no lingering effects from last year's injuries.    I'm not sure who was calling this game for FOX. I thought it was Dick Stockton, until I may have heard him doing the 49ers-Seahawks game. Perhaps he was everywhere. Nevertheless, I thought it was hilarious when Stockton(??) called "

   "comment":"Kevin Kolb found Fitzgerald deep for a 73-yard touchdown, as the All-Pro wideout compiled 7 grabs for 133 yards. However, Kolb looked pretty mediocre otherwise, finishing 17-of-30 for 251 yards, 2 scores and a very ugly pick inside Washington territory.    Of Arizona's 15 rushing attempts, 14 were by Chris Wells, who tallied 93 yards and a touchdown. Wells looked great and the Redskins had no answer for him. Now completely healthy, he needs to be utilized more often.    If there's a negative to come out of this game for Washington, it's that this shouldn't have been as close as the final score indicates. The Redskins won the time of possession by 15 minutes and outgained Arizona by 130 yards. They were simply sloppy deep in Arizona territory, missing a field goal and committing 2 turnovers.   "

   "comment":"Kevin Kolb. Instead, it seemed like Arizona's coaching staff had QB Dog Killer's number. QBDK was awful yet again. He didn't throw any interceptions this time, but he lost 2 fumbles, including 1 at the end of the first half that was returned for a touchdown. I honestly thought he was playing with a concussion; he banged his head several plays beforehand and didn't seem right when he got up. On the strip-six, he stood in the pocket like an idiot despite the fact that the clock was at about the 4-second mark. He was sacked, and the ball came out. "

   "comment":"Kevin Kolb's 324 passing yards or Arizona's current record of 4-0. I don't even know where to begin, to be honest. Well, I guess I should congratulate the Dolphins on a valiant effort. The Cardinals were missing stud defensive lineman Darnell Dockett, but Tannehill's stat line of 26-of-41 for 431 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions was impressive nonetheless. Tannehill, who misfired on numerous long attempts against the Jets last week, connected on multiple long bombs to Hartline. However, he made what would be the game-losing pick in overtime, heaving the ball carelessly as he was hit. It's worth noting that Tannehill was actually intercepted on a third occasion just after halftime, but the turnover was wiped away because of a shaky call on Adrian Wilson. Tannehill also took a terrible sack in the red zone in the first half on what was a loss of 14 yards.    Hartline was awesome. He caught 12 balls for the 253 yards I mentioned. The bulk of it came on an 80-yard touchdown bomb in the 4.h quarter when it appeared as though Arizona established control of the game. Davone Bess, meanwhile, snagged 7 balls for 123 yards.    Reggie Bush was a game-time decision but ended up playing. He gained 67 yards on just 17 yards. He, as well as Daniel Thomas (4-4), lost a goal-line carry to Jorvorskie Lane, who converted.    A Miami skill-position player who nearly screwed them was Legedu Naanee, who caught a ball and fumbled in the 4.h quarter. I didn't think it was a fumble because Naanee didn't make a football move, but I guess I was biased. Patrick Peterson scooped up the football and took it inside the Miami 5-yard line. However, 2 plays later, Sean Smith made 1 of the best sideline interceptions I've ever seen, though it's worth noting that he shoved Larry Fitzgerald out of the way prior to making the pick. On the very next play, Tannehill hit Hartline for the aforementioned 80-yarder.    The Dolphins established a 21-14 lead, but Kevin Kolb had a very clutch drive, culminating with a 15-yard touchdown to Andre Roberts on a last-gasp 4."
