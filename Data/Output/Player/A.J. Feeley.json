   "comment":"Feeley threw an interception. This was total domination.    It's tough to even summarize the Rams' offense drive-by-drive. Almost all of their possessions were 3 or 4 plays. The 49ers' first possession started with a 14-yard pass to Michael Crabtree and ended when he was unable to haul in a slant that probably would have gone for a score. The 36-yard field goal from David Akers made it 3-0. St. Louis then had what would eventually be their second-longest drive of the game in terms of plays (5) and yards (35). It did not result in points, obviously. San Francisco picked up a couple first downs on the next possession before punting as the first quarter came to an ugly close. The 49ers' defense turned up the heat, with Ray McDonald doing the sack/fumble thing and rookie Aldon Smith, who had a huge game, recovering. From the 6-yard line, Frank Gore tried to do the rest, but 3 runs came up short. On the second attempt, linebacker James Laurinaitis saved a touchdown, and San Francisco went up 6-0 with a short field goal. Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal. After getting the ball back thanks to a sack from Larry Grant, the San Francisco offense kept its collective foot on the pedal as the half wound down, however Chris Long ended the threat with a sack. To its credit, St. Louis came to play defensively. Following the break, things started to unravel for the Rams. After quickly moving down the field on passes to Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver ("
