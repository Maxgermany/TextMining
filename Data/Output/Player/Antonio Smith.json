   "comment":"Antonio Smith, got into a fight. The officials had to break them up, and Cushing drew a 15-yard penalty. You 10. to see this kind of stuff in pick-up basketball games; but not in the NFL. The Cushing infraction was just 1 of 9 Texans penalties in the first half. They also struggled to tackle, clearly displaying a lack of effort in the wake of that heart-breaking Monday night loss.    The Titans did whatever they wanted to against Houston's pathetic defense.

  "comment":"Antonio Smith sacked him on a third down to end the drive before Phil Dawson missed the 47-yard attempt. After getting the ball back, Khalil Mack sacked Kaepernick and the 49ers' comeback hopes ended with a terribly thrown interception right to Charles Woodson.    Carr finished 22-of-28 for 254 yards with 3 touchdowns. He was even better than the numbers indicate, as he made great decisions and displayed a powerful, accurate arm. Rivera had a coming-out party with 7 receptions for 109 yards and the score. San Francisco's defense looked hapless with no pass rush in the second half and a secondary that struggled to cover.    Kaepernick completed 18-of-33 for 174 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. It was an ugly game from him, as he made a number of bad decisions and had some missed opportunities.    Khalil Mack and Antonio Smith each played really well and had 2 sacks to lead Oakland's defense.   ",
