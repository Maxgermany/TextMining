One of the picks was heaved right to Watkins - but that doesn't excuse some of the passes he made later on. Manuel hurled 2 interceptions and could've easily thrown several more. One of the picks was heaved right to J.J. Watt, who took the ball back to the end zone for 6. The other sealed the victory for Houston on a horrible overthrow in the final minute of the game. Manuel also had several casual misfires. One that stood out occurred with a few minutes remaining in regulation. He had a receiver open on third-and-6, but launched the ball out of bounds. Manuel finished 21-of-44 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Buffalo's offense as a whole was a mess; the team was discombobulated, as it wasted timeouts and was flagged for procedural penalties early on and failed to block Watt throughout. It has to be completely embarrassing for the Bills that their first-round quarterback was outplayed by Fitzpatrick, who was run out of town after 4 pedestrian seasons. The humiliation showed when some lethargic Buffalo defenders didn't even bother touching Arian Foster when he had the ball on the ground very late in the game. Foster rolled forward past the first-down marker, giving Houston the win. The poor effort they displayed was staggering.    Watkins overcame his early drops by finishing the game with 4 catches for 30 yards and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins dropped a pass near the goal line on a nice, back-shoulder throw. Later on the possession, Chris Hogan lost a fumble, negating at least 3 points. Robert Woods also lost a fumble later in the firt half. This turnover occurred in his own territory, and it helped set up a Minnesota field goal. Another Viking 3.pointer came via a Kyle Orton interception that was overthrown. All of this happened in the first half alone. The errors continued following intermission. Orton lost a fumble because he was careless with the football. Everson Griffen, who had a huge outing with 3 sacks, managed to strip it. Orton then took a bad sack on a third down, as Buffalo's predictable run-run-pass play-calling didn't have the Vikings fooled at all. Meanwhile, some injuries didn't help. Fred Jackson (3-12) left early with a groin injury. I thought this might be a blessing in disguise because it would force Buffalo's coaching staff to utilize C.J. Spiller much more. Sure enough, Spiller burst for a 53-yard gain on his first carry, but had to be carted off after the play. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with a broken collarbone. This forced Anthony Dixon to rush the ball exclusively, as the Bills didn't have any other active halfbacks on the roster. Dixon responded by gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts.    Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point. However, Orton converted the former situation with a 24-yard completion to Scott Chandler. Orton then launched a 29-yard bomb to Chris Hogan, who was tackled at the 1-yard line with just 5 seconds remaining. He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, Watkins dropped a pass near the goal line on a nice, back-shoulder throw. Later on the possession, Chris Hogan lost a fumble, negating at least 3 points. Robert Woods also lost a fumble later in the firt half. This turnover occurred in his own territory, and it helped set up a Minnesota field goal. Another Viking 3.pointer came via a Kyle Orton interception that was overthrown. All of this happened in the first half alone. The errors continued following intermission. Orton lost a fumble because he was careless with the football. Everson Griffen, who had a huge outing with 3 sacks, managed to strip it. Orton then took a bad sack on a third down, as Buffalo's predictable run-run-pass play-calling didn't have the Vikings fooled at all. Meanwhile, some injuries didn't help. Fred Jackson (3-12) left early with a groin injury. I thought this might be a blessing in disguise because it would force Buffalo's coaching staff to utilize C.J. Spiller much more. Sure enough, Spiller burst for a 53-yard gain on his first carry, but had to be carted off after the play. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with a broken collarbone. This forced Anthony Dixon to rush the ball exclusively, as the Bills didn't have any other active halfbacks on the roster. Dixon responded by gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts.    Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point. However, Orton converted the former situation with a 24-yard completion to Scott Chandler. Orton then launched a 29-yard bomb to Chris Hogan, who was tackled at the 1-yard line with just 5 seconds remaining. He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins, the intended target, didn't make his break when Orton released the ball, so the quarterback didn't know where his receiver would be. And second, Watkins ended up being in the area anyway. He was literally 4-5 yards away from where the pass landed. The second horrific penalty came on a play that set up Miami in the red zone because of a long pass interference. Stephon Gilmore made a terrific break-up, but the officials threw the flag. Both CBS announcers, as well as everyone on the post-game show, was completely appalled by the infraction. Gilmore made a completely clean play; he actually couldn't have defended his receiver any better. Shortly afterward, the Dolphins scored their second of 2 touchdowns on the evening, and even that was controversial, as instant replay showed that the ball was short of the goal line when Jarvis Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was 1 of the 2 major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Louis Delmas dropped a pass thrown right to him. Orton went 22-of-39 for 193 yards, but was just 10-of-22 for 93 yards following intermission. He was solid early, finding Chris Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front 4 that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered 5 sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone. Landry converted all 5 of his targets, but lost a fumble on the free kick following the poor Orton safety call. Fortunately for Landry, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a 47-yard field goal on the ensuing drive, setting up Miami with a short field, which eventually led to Landry's touchdown.    Sammy Watkins, like Wallace, was also missed deep, as Orton overthrew him. Watkins had a horrific fantasy outing, snagging just 3 of his 7 targets for 32 yards. Hogan was the hero for the Bills early on with 7 grabs for 74 yards, while Bryce Brown tied Hogan with 7 catches for 57 receiving yards, saving those who started him in PPR leagues. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Watkins, the intended target, didn't make his break when Orton released the ball, so the quarterback didn't know where his receiver would be.

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins. The Bills led 7-0, but that's when Orton began giving this game away. He threw a pick in the first quarter to Watkins. The Bills led 7-0, but that's when Orton began giving this game away. He threw a pick in the first quarter to Charles Woodson, which was a forced pass. He then nearly had another interception, but the ball hit the ground. Following that, Orton hurled a potential pick-six that was dropped, and then almost had another 1 in a careless heave into double coverage. Orton was extremely fortunate that he didn't toss 5 interceptions in the first half. As he was getting away with possible turnovers, he was heaving inaccurate passes that missed his targets. The Bills, consequently, had numerous 3.and-outs, and it didn't get any better until the Raiders were up 2 scores. Orton had yet another near-pick in the second half and then fired an actual interception on a high pass. He was even lucky on a late touchdown, as Eric Wood got away with a holding penalty, which enraged Justin Tuck. The Bills desperately need to find a quarterback this offseason. Alas, there aren't many realistic options. The 1 possibility is Jay Cutler, who will be available via trade for a mere mid-round pick.    The other reason for Buffalo's defeat was that the team lost Marcell Dareus and Stephon Gilmore, 2 of the team's best defenders, to various injuries. With Dareus out, the Raiders were able to run the ball effectively with both Latavius Murray and Darren McFadden. Murray gained 86 yards on 23 carries, while McFadden (9-54) had a big 25-yard burst, getting tackled inches short of the goal line.    Derek Carr had a solid performance. Making strides with Greg Olson's tutelage, Carr went 17-of-34 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. The completion percentage isn't pretty, and some of his passes were off the mark, but keep in mind that he was battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL. He was under heavy pressure at times, yet had some spectacular throws, including a perfect bomb to Kenbrell Thompkins for 50 yards early on. Carr was almost pick-sixed a bit later, but he had way fewer near-interceptions than his counterpart. He had a clutch 51-yard completion to Andre Holmes on a third-and-22 in the second half. Speaking of pick-sixes, Matt Schaub entered the game briefly in the second half when Carr hurt his ankle. The crowd booed him, and the Raiders had to take a timeout because they couldn't line up properly. Carr was able to reenter the game after the stoppage. Instead of an inevitable pick-six - Schaub seemed poised to throw 1 - the Raiders were able to preserve the field goal.    Oakland's leading receiver was Thompkins, who caught 5 balls for 90 yards. Only 2 other Raiders had 3 or more receptions: Holmes (3-73), who made a great, leaping catch over a defender, and Murray (3-22). Mychal Rivera caught only 1 pass for 5 yards.    Some Buffalo stats: - The Bills couldn't run the ball at all. Fred Jackson led the team with 10 rushing yards on 6 carries, though he made up for it in the passing game, catching 9 balls for 93 receiving yards. - Making his return from an extensive injury, C.J. Spiller lost 4 yards on 4 attempts. Spiller will probably be playing his final game for the Bills next week. - Watkins, who caught the aforementioned 42-yard bomb, finished with 3 grabs for 75 yards and the touchdown. "

However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well.

One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score.

Watkins. However, the Chiefs finally got momentum going on offense and made the appropriate adjustments on defense to outscore the Bills 23-6 in the final 32 minutes of the game. Alex Smith played terrifically. I've been 1 of his main critics over the years, but I'll give him credit when he deserves it. That's most certainly the case here, as I thought the Chiefs were screwed when they were down 9 as a result of Smith's limitations. Smith was up to his old tricks early on, throwing a typical checkdown that wasn't even far enough on a third-and-4 try. However, something happened late in the game, and the light when on for Smith, who suddenly began throwing several deep passes. He began by launching a 37-yard reception to Jeremy Maclin, who was able to reel in the ball with a diving effort. This set up a touchdown. Smith then hurled a 41-yard score to Maclin, who beat Ronald Darby deep. Smith finished 19-of-30 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also did a great job of picking up some first downs on the ground on occasion, scrambling 6 times for 35 rushing yards. This was all very impressive considering that the Chiefs lost 2 offensive linemen early on. Guard Jeff Allen, perhaps the team's best blocker, and tackle Eric Fisher both exited with injuries. At 1 point, Kansas City had absolutely no backup linemen to use, but Allen was able to return to the field.    It helped Smith that he had a great performance from Spencer Ware. It appears as though it doesn't matter who the running back is for the Chiefs. Spencer, originally behind Jamaal Charles and Charcandrick West on the depth chart, ripped off 114 yards and a touchdown on only 19 carries. Had the Chiefs led throughout, Ware could've posted much greater numbers.    Smith's 2 touchdowns went to the usual suspects, Maclin and Travis Kelce. The former snatched 9 balls for 160 yards. Kelce, who was questionable heading into this contest, had 4 catches for 69 yards. Besides those 2. the only other Kansas City player to log multiple receiving yards was Albert Wilson (3-25).    As for the Bills, I mentioned that they had lots of success early in the afternoon. The Chiefs simply couldn't handle Watkins, who torched Sean Smith relentlessly."

Manuel ran a dumb Wildcat play in the third quarter, which was followed by a useless field goal that turned a 21-0 deficit into a 21-3 score.

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins offensive pass interference disrupted a drive. Watkins offensive pass interference disrupted a drive. Cooper Kupp, meanwhile, fumbled the ball at the Minnesota 1-yard line in the second quarter. Late in the afternoon, Kupp dropped a ball on third down. The Rams are a young team, and their inexperience really showed in this contest. Goff finished 23-of-37 for 225 yards. He had a few impressive throws against a terrific defense, so he's way down in the pecking order for people responsible for this ugly loss. Goff didn't turn the ball over, which is a plus.    Robert Woods continues to be Goff's favorite receiver. Woods caught 8 of his 11 targets for 81 yards, while Kupp (6-64), despite his mistakes, was right behind him. Watkins was a disappointment once again, catching just 3 balls for 36 yards to go along with the aforementioned offensive pass interference. Watkins will need to step up if Woods is out; Woods suffered a shoulder injury late in this contest, but reports indicate it's not very serious. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
