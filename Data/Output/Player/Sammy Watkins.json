   "comment":"Sammy Watkins dropped a pass near the goal line on a nice, back-shoulder throw. Later on the possession, Chris Hogan lost a fumble, negating at least 3 points. Robert Woods also lost a fumble later in the firt half. This turnover occurred in his own territory, and it helped set up a Minnesota field goal. Another Viking 3.pointer came via a Kyle Orton interception that was overthrown. All of this happened in the first half alone. The errors continued following intermission. Orton lost a fumble because he was careless with the football. Everson Griffen, who had a huge outing with 3 sacks, managed to strip it. Orton then took a bad sack on a third down, as Buffalo's predictable run-run-pass play-calling didn't have the Vikings fooled at all. Meanwhile, some injuries didn't help. Fred Jackson (3-12) left early with a groin injury. I thought this might be a blessing in disguise because it would force Buffalo's coaching staff to utilize C.J. Spiller much more. Sure enough, Spiller burst for a 53-yard gain on his first carry, but had to be carted off after the play. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with a broken collarbone. This forced Anthony Dixon to rush the ball exclusively, as the Bills didn't have any other active halfbacks on the roster. Dixon responded by gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts.    Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point. However, Orton converted the former situation with a 24-yard completion to Scott Chandler. Orton then launched a 29-yard bomb to Chris Hogan, who was tackled at the 1-yard line with just 5 seconds remaining. He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins, the intended target, didn't make his break when Orton released the ball, so the quarterback didn't know where his receiver would be. And second, Watkins ended up being in the area anyway. He was literally 4-5 yards away from where the pass landed. The second horrific penalty came on a play that set up Miami in the red zone because of a long pass interference. Stephon Gilmore made a terrific break-up, but the officials threw the flag. Both CBS announcers, as well as everyone on the post-game show, was completely appalled by the infraction. Gilmore made a completely clean play; he actually couldn't have defended his receiver any better. Shortly afterward, the Dolphins scored their second of 2 touchdowns on the evening, and even that was controversial, as instant replay showed that the ball was short of the goal line when Jarvis Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was 1 of the 2 major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Louis Delmas dropped a pass thrown right to him. Orton went 22-of-39 for 193 yards, but was just 10-of-22 for 93 yards following intermission. He was solid early, finding Chris Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front 4 that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered 5 sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone. Landry converted all 5 of his targets, but lost a fumble on the free kick following the poor Orton safety call. Fortunately for Landry, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a 47-yard field goal on the ensuing drive, setting up Miami with a short field, which eventually led to Landry's touchdown.    Sammy Watkins, like Wallace, was also missed deep, as Orton overthrew him. Watkins had a horrific fantasy outing, snagging just 3 of his 7 targets for 32 yards. Hogan was the hero for the Bills early on with 7 grabs for 74 yards, while Bryce Brown tied Hogan with 7 catches for 57 receiving yards, saving those who started him in PPR leagues. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

He had a fantastic opening half, going 11-of-15 for 143 yards and a touchdown prior to the break. His only blemish in the first half was a strip-sack that allowed the Patriots to kick a field goal. Orton, however, looked like his usual self following intermission. He was just 4-of-8 for 33 yards in the second half, meaning he finished 16-of-23 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Bills need a quarterback, but they're not in position to take 1 during the draft. They'll have to use a second-rounder on 1.    Buffalo also needs a new running back. "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins. The No. 1 wideout caught a touchdown just prior to halftime, which was an amazing feat because he injured himself prior to making the reception. This drew the game to within 3. but the Bills couldn't get anything going without Watkins, who was on crutches right after the break. To illustrate Buffalo's troubles, Manuel was 15-of-20 for 129 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick with Watkins and 13-of-22 for 134 yards without him. The score was 17-14 with Watkins and 17-7 without him.    Watkins at least helped his fantasy owners prior to leaving. He snatched 4 balls for 48 yards and the score in 1 half of action. No Buffalo player finished with more than 62 yards, with Charles Clay leading that category. Clay saw a whopping 13 targets, more than double than any other Buffalo player saw. He turned those into 9 grabs for 62 yards. Clay was producing even with Watkins on the field, so don't think that the injury opened up opportunities for him.    McCoy ran well despite being questionable prior to kickoff, though he didn't have much of an opportunity because the Bills trailed throughout. McCoy tallied 90 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts.

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins on a couple of deep throws, including a 63-yard bomb to set up an eventual touchdown. He misfired just once in the opening half and then was perfect after intermission, finishing a very efficient 11-of-12 for 181 yards and a touchdown to go along with 44 rushing yards on 10 scrambles. The difference between Taylor and Manuel is night and day; Manuel was a train wreck, while Taylor has proven that he can be a legitimate starting quarterback.    I mentioned Watkins earlier; it was reported that he would be limited in this contest because he was banged up. It was quite apparent early on that this was misleading, as Watkins was unstoppable. He sat some plays out, but the clueless Dolphins had absolutely no answer for him when he was on the field. He caught all 8 of his targets for 168 yards and a touchdown. With Taylor back, Watkins' numbers should be terrific going forward.    Remarkably, aside from Watkins, no other Buffalo player had more than 7 receiving yards. In fact, only 2 other Bills - "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins on a third-and-1. Taylor made a couple of nice scrambles for 15 and 10 yards, but he was guilty of numerous ugly throws throughout the evening. There was also horrible clock management on his part near the end, though some of that was Rex Ryan's fault. Speaking of Ryan, he also wasted a timeout when deciding to go for it on a 4.h down in the final quarter. That timeout would've come in handy at the end of the game, when the Bills advanced to midfield, but ran out of time. It's hard to imagine Ryan keeping his job after this season. It's not completely his fault the Bills are 0-2 because of all the injuries in the front 7. but Ryan's abysmal game management, as well as his team's 10.ency to be incredibly sloppy, makes him a strong candidate to be let go after just 2 years. In fact, if the Bills continue to lose, it wouldn't surprise me if Ryan is axed during the team's Week 10 bye.    Taylor's long touchdowns were to Marquise Goodwin (2-112) and Greg Salas (4-89). Goodwin absolutely torched Darrelle Revis, who continued to look like 1 of the worst cornerbacks in the NFL. Sammy Watkins, meanwhile, played, but caught only 2 balls for 20 yards. Watkins did not look 100 percent. In fact, he failed to finish the game.    "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins caught 4-of-6 targets for 54 yards, including a second-quarter touchdown. He isn't blowing up after returning from his foot injury, but he is playing solid enough to be useful in fantasy football, which is all the Bills' fans can really hope for now that the team has all but been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs.    The Steelers kept pace with the Ravens, who will face a tough Patriots team in Foxborough Monday night. If the Ravens win, they'll stay a step ahead of the Steelers as they beat them head-to-head this season, but if they lose, the Steelers will regain first place in the AFC North.    This game was delayed for 10 minutes after halftime due to an excess of rubber pellets that had been moved toward the sidelines as the grounds crew removed snow. It was kinda gross.   "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins and make some of the downfield throws. Overall, Taylor went 26-of-39 for 329 yards and 3 touchdowns. He really helped to lead the team's comeback, and if he plays like he did in the second half, he can be a franchise quarterback. His mobility really helps him, and it was a huge reason that the Bills were able to make the comeback. My theory on why Taylor struggled early is the rumors that have been swirling around him. Rex Ryan may not be returning as the head coach, and if he is not back, the Bills may opt to make a change at quarterback. Taylor is probably thinking about that possibility and may have been trying to force it too much. That would explain why he struggled. He was overthinking everything.    As usual, Buffalo's receiving attack generated a couple of strong performances from its top receivers. Leading the way on Saturday was Sammy Watkins (7-154, 1 TD), who put together a strong performance and really established himself as a downfield threat. If he is fully healthy in 2017, he could be a massive weapon for the Bills. The other top receiver for Buffalo was Charles Clay. The tight end, going against his former team, saw 10 targets and snatched 8 of them for 85 yards. He also caught 2 touchdowns and should be an athletic red-zone weapon.    Despite the strong performance from the passing game, the Bills' rushing attack was really what carried them. Once again, "

   "comment":"Sammy Watkins didn't do much, securing 1 of his 2 targets for only 17 yards. Perhaps Watkins being banged up throughout the week had something to do with this, but it's worth noting that he didn't go for a catch on a third down because he sensed a hit from the safety.    Meanwhile, this was another game in which Elliott failed to reach 100 rushing yards, as he gained 85 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He helped his fantasy owners with 4 catches for 54 receiving yards and another score, but his inability to dominate on the ground is not a surprise. The Cowboys' offensive line isn't nearly as good as it was last year because "
