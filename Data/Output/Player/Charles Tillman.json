   "comment":"Tillman left the game with an injury. Still, Ryan was able to perform well despite the fact that Michael Turner was limited to 54 yards on 25 carries. More importantly, Ryan has the Falcons at 4-2. The same Falcons who were picked by many to finish at the bottom of the NFC South.    We all know about Roddy White, who was once again a force, catching 9 balls for 112 yards and a touchdown. But rookie Harry Douglas is beginning to emerge as a solid secondary option for Ryan. Douglas compiled 5 receptions and 96 yards.    Though the Bears couldn't score against the Falcons, "
