   "comment":"Aaron Ross in the end zone moved the ball to the 1-yard line. Miami capped the drive with Steve Slaton plunging in the end zone. The Giants came back with a drive that yielded a field goal for New York. Running back Ahmad Bradshaw had a nice 18-yard run. Then, quarterback Eli Manning had a 21-yard pass to tight end Jake Ballard. Still, New York's drive fizzled inside the 20 and they had to settle for the kick. Miami kept up its strong play on its next drive. Moore ran for 11 on third-and-6. The next play saw running back Reggie Bush break out with a 35-yard run. He had a good hole to get to the second level of the defense. About 10 yards downfield, Bush broke tackles from Aaron Ross and Kenny Philips with a spin move. The Dolphins finished the drive on 4.h-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Moore ran a bootleg and coasted into the end zone to give the Dolphins a 14-3 lead. The Giants were able to answer the score. With only a few seconds left before halftime, Manning tossed a perfect corner touchdown pass to "

Some of Newton's throws were beautiful, including 1 touchdown that was a perfectly placed back-shoulder throw. Two of Newton's aerial touchdowns went to ",
