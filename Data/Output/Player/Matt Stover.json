Last week, they replaced Hauschka with Billy Cundiff, who actually nailed 5 field goals in this contest, including a 46-yarder. However, Cundiff whiffed badly on a crucial attempt from just 30 yards. Stover, meanwhile, nailed the decisive kick for the Colts to send the Ravens to 5-5. Talk about insult to injury.    It was a wasted performance by "
