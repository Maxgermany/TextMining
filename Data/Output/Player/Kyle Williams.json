It was somewhat of a breakout performance for Williams with 5 receptions for 54 yards and (spoiler alert) a touchdown. Since the injury to Josh Morgan, the team has been looking for someone to pick up the slack. The drive ended with Smith throwing to Davis, who came up just short of the first down. Akers hit the field goal, making it 9-0. After yet another failed Arizona drive, the game mercifully went to halftime. Finally, San Francisco asserted itself as the bully, taking the ball right up the field 84 yards capped by the aforementioned touchdown to Williams. Crabtree had 2 receptions for 44 yards early in the drive which put them up 16-0. At that point it might as well have been 100-0 given the ineptness of Arizona's offense.

   "comment":"Williams had a big punt return for 36 yards to change field position and set the 49ers up in Seahawks' territory. Gore and Hunter runs did most of the work on the drive while Smith missed on his only pass attempt and scrambled for an 11-yard gain. An illegal block by Braylon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the fourth quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Aldon Smith registered a sack to force a 3rd-and-15. Jackson almost bailed Seattle out, hitting Obomanu a yard short of the marker. Carroll resisted the urge to go for it against a stout defense and wisely chose to play field position. It looked like a bad decision when the punt went out of the end zone and Smith hit Davis for 17 yards on the first play of the drive. Just like that, all the Seahawks had gained from the kick was 8 yards of field position. However, the defense stood tall from there, forcing a punt that was blocked by Heath Farwell. Seattle took over at the 49ers' 4-yard line and Lynch delivered the first rushing touchdown of the season against San Francisco to put the Seahawks up 17-16. Suddenly trailing, the 49ers caught a break when Robinson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after hitting defenseless kickoff returner Kyle Williams. Set up at their own 39-yard line, everything was looking good for San Francisco, and then Edwards was flagged for pass interference to start the drive. However, 2 plays later, Smith (14-of-26, 179 yards) connected on a deep ball good for 41 yards to Michael Crabtree. It was a huge play for Smith, who did what he has all season - protect the football and not screw it up. A ready and able Seattle defense held tough on 3 consecutive rushing plays, including a straight run on 3rd-and-6 that didn't exactly ooze confidence in Smith's arm. Yet another field goal from Akers put the 49ers ahead, 19-17. It looked like the Seahawks would respond. Lynch alternated rushing and receiving on the next 4 plays for a total of 33 yards, putting them just past midfield with 1:07 to play. Then Tarvaris Jackson did what bad quarterbacks do in tough spots. On 3rd-and-3, he was trying to scramble for a first down and had the ball knocked out from behind by linebacker "

   "comment":"Williams had a big punt return for 36 yards to change field position and set the 49ers up in Seahawks' territory. Gore and Hunter runs did most of the work on the drive while Smith missed on his only pass attempt and scrambled for an 11-yard gain. An illegal block by Braylon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the fourth quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Aldon Smith registered a sack to force a 3rd-and-15. Jackson almost bailed Seattle out, hitting Obomanu a yard short of the marker. Carroll resisted the urge to go for it against a stout defense and wisely chose to play field position. It looked like a bad decision when the punt went out of the end zone and Smith hit Davis for 17 yards on the first play of the drive. Just like that, all the Seahawks had gained from the kick was 8 yards of field position. However, the defense stood tall from there, forcing a punt that was blocked by Heath Farwell. Seattle took over at the 49ers' 4-yard line and Lynch delivered the first rushing touchdown of the season against San Francisco to put the Seahawks up 17-16. Suddenly trailing, the 49ers caught a break when Robinson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after hitting defenseless kickoff returner Kyle Williams. Set up at their own 39-yard line, everything was looking good for San Francisco, and then Edwards was flagged for pass interference to start the drive. However, 2 plays later, Smith (14-of-26, 179 yards) connected on a deep ball good for 41 yards to Michael Crabtree. It was a huge play for Smith, who did what he has all season - protect the football and not screw it up. A ready and able Seattle defense held tough on 3 consecutive rushing plays, including a straight run on 3rd-and-6 that didn't exactly ooze confidence in Smith's arm. Yet another field goal from Akers put the 49ers ahead, 19-17. It looked like the Seahawks would respond. Lynch alternated rushing and receiving on the next 4 plays for a total of 33 yards, putting them just past midfield with 1:07 to play. Then Tarvaris Jackson did what bad quarterbacks do in tough spots. On 3rd-and-3, he was trying to scramble for a first down and had the ball knocked out from behind by linebacker "

   "comment":"Williams. Unlike Billy Cundiff, Williams' main job isn't returning punts. He was in the game because Ginn was hurt. That doesn't excuse his 2 crucial mistakes that led to 10 New York points, but if you're comparing Williams to Cundiff, it's no contest. The kicker was more responsible.    This was a dead-even game otherwise. The total yardage was 319-319 at the end of regulation, and both squads would have been worthy NFC champions. The reason I picked the Giants, however, was that an even matchup like this would go to the team with the better quarterback. And "

At 1-7, it's not like they're going to the playoffs anyway. They need to make sure Smith is a bust before deciding on whether they want to draft Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston.    Harvin made his debut for the Jets, but served as an inefficient receiver - I already mentioned him being thrown to on the first pick - hauling in just 3 of 9 targets for 22 yards. He also had 4 carries for 28 rushing yards. He made a nice return to open the game, but then stupidly took a kickoff out of the back of the end zone in the third quarter. He sprinted to the 3-yard line and stopped to throw a pass back, but decided against it and was promply tackled.    The Jets' leading receiver was "
