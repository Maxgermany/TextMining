   "comment":"Denzel Perryman back from injury in this game. This was 1 of 8 reasons I made the Chargers my Pick of the Month. They were 2-7 entering this game, but I thought they'd play better with all of their players back. Apparently not, as my $880 went up in flames. The big issue for the Chargers has been their pass protection. "

It also didn't help that the Jaguars didn't have their starting right tackle, Jermey Parnell. His backup was abused by ",
