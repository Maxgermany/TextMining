   "comment":"Riddick. The Lions strangely opted to run the time out, settling for a 43-yard field goal despite their horrible kicking issues this year. They naturally missed the kick, but their own delay-of-game penalty negated the whiff. Matt Prater got another chance from 48 yards and improbably connected. The Lions prevailed, but their issues are still prevalent. They barely try some weeks, and regardless of whether they do or not, they commit dumb errors like having a delay of game during a game-winning kicking try. Their offensive line sucked. In addition to allowing Atlanta's anemic pass rush to apply pressure, they were guilty of holds and blindside blocks to nullify big gains.    Matthew Stafford was especially terrible, at least prior to the game-winning drive. He went 24-of-47 for 325 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that he forced into triple coverage. The completion percentage is an indicator of what sort of day it was. He was horribly inaccurate, throwing behind and way past his receivers on numerous occasions. Granted, he didn't have Calvin Johnson, Reggie Bush or any of his tight ends at his disposal, but that shouldn't have affected his accuracy. He nearly had 2 other picks. One occurred when Osi Umenyiora pressured him on a third-and-long. The other was nearly snatched out of the air by Tyson Jackson. Stafford's scores went to Riddick and Golden Tate, both of whom had huge outings."

Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because "

   "comment":"Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1-yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on fourth down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. "

Midway through the fourth quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards.

   "comment":"Riddick (8 catches, 70 yards) for the team lead in receiving yardage.    It's hardly a surprise that the 2 prominent Detroit wideouts struggled against Jacksonville's elite secondary. Golden Tate caught only 3 balls for 27 yards, while Marvin Jones secured just 1 reception for 15 yards.    It was also predictable that the Lions couldn't run very well. Dwayne Washington handled most of the workload, but his 13 carries went for only 6 yards. Riddick, meanwhile, gained 13 yards on just 4 tries.    As for the Jaguars, I alluded to Bortles' struggles by mentioning his pick-6. That wasn't the only error he made, as he was nearly strip-sacked in the opening half because he held on to the ball too long. The play was ruled incomplete. There were also numerous occasions in which Bortles had receivers open for significant gains, but didn't see them. Bortles has seemingly regressed ever since Olson was let go, which is not surprising in the slightest, given that Bortles simply doesn't care enough to improve the mental part of his game, preferring to party frequently instead. Bortles finished 22-of-35 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. It was a disappointing showing, considering how poor Detroit's defense has been recently. Bortles was checked for a shoulder injury throughout the first half, but didn't miss any action, aside from a kneel-down right before intermission, which "

   "comment":"Riddick gained 45 yards on 9 carries. A big chunk came on a 12-yard burst early on, so Riddick didn't do much otherwise. Still, it was an improvement over last week, when the Lions couldn't even gain 20 yards on the ground.    As for the Vikings, Bradford's stat line might look pretty good because of his completion percentage. He went 31-of-37 for 224 yards and the aforementioned interception. I'm sure some NFL talking heads who slurp quarterbacks will compliment Bradford for that completion percentage, but it's just further proof that stats can be very misleading. Bradford misfired just 6 times because he dinked and dunked most of the time. There were so many occasions when he settled for short passes on third-and-medium or third-and-long, which would explain why the Vikings were just 2-of-10 on third down. Minnesota's offense was just agonizing to watch. The team had just 1 completion of longer than 21 yards, and that was a 41-yard short toss to "
