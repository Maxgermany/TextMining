   "comment":"Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because "

There were a number of terrible calls in this game, which shouldn't have been a surprise because Jerome Boger was the official.

   "comment":"Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. "

   "comment":"Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards. He also ran the ball 6 times for 31 yards and a touchdown.    Calvin Johnson caught 5 passes for 88 yards, and Golden Tate had 8 receptions for 73 yards. Ameer Abdullah had 12 carries for 33 yards. Theo Riddick had 6 carries for 14 yards and 5 receptions for 72 yards.    Carr was 13-of-25 for 169 yards. Surprisingly, Detroit's secondary limited Cooper to only 1 catch for 4 yards. "

No Detroit runner posted great numbers, but the Lions ran the ball very well, ripping off at least 4 yards on most of their carries, which constantly set up Stafford in second-and-short situations.
