The Lions strangely opted to run the time out, settling for a 43-yard field goal despite their horrible kicking issues this year. They naturally missed the kick, but their own delay-of-game penalty negated the whiff. Matt Prater got another chance from 48 yards and improbably connected. The Lions prevailed, but their issues are still prevalent. They barely try some weeks, and regardless of whether they do or not, they commit dumb errors like having a delay of game during a game-winning kicking try. Their offensive line sucked. In addition to allowing Atlanta's anemic pass rush to apply pressure, they were guilty of holds and blindside blocks to nullify big gains.    Matthew Stafford was especially terrible, at least prior to the game-winning drive. He went 24-of-47 for 325 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that he forced into triple coverage. The completion percentage is an indicator of what sort of day it was. He was horribly inaccurate, throwing behind and way past his receivers on numerous occasions. Granted, he didn't have Calvin Johnson, Reggie Bush or any of his tight ends at his disposal, but that shouldn't have affected his accuracy. He nearly had 2 other picks. One occurred when Osi Umenyiora pressured him on a third-and-long. The other was nearly snatched out of the air by Tyson Jackson. Stafford's scores went to Riddick and Golden Tate, both of whom had huge outings."

   "comment":"Theo Riddick knifed through the Colts' defense for a 21-yard touchdown as rookie left tackle Taylor Decker made an excellent block at the second level to spring Riddick downfield. After trading punts, Stafford got moving again with a 27-yard gain to Marvin Jones (4-85), a third-down conversion to Boldin, and a gain of 13 yards to Eric Ebron (5-46-1). That set up Dwayne Washington to plunge into the end zone from a yard out. Luck responded with a drive that saw him complete passes to Donte Moncrief (6-64-1) and T.Y. Hilton (6-79) to set up a 50-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. Stafford answered with a 32-yard pass to Jones and finished another drive with a strike to Ebron for a short touchdown reception. Ebron made a superb catch while getting hit by 2 defenders. Luck quickly moved the ball with a 32-yard completion to Moncrief, 14 yards to Josh Ferguson, 16 yards to Dwayne Allen, 8 to Hilton, and a short touchdown strike to Moncrief. The Lions took a 21-10 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Luck got rolling with a 51-yard pass to Philip Dorsett (4-94), who beat Darius Slay for the reception. Allen (4-53-1) got open in busted coverage for a 19-yard score. Luck went back to Allen for a 2.point conversion and midway through the third quarter, the Lions' lead was cut to 21-18. Stafford answered ripping the ball down the field and finished it with a short touchdown toss to Abdullah, who was left uncovered in the flat. Luck came back to produce another field-goal drive. The Lions punted the ball away, and Luck went right back to work with a 32-yard pass to Hilton to get into Detroit territory. The Lions' lead evaporated when Luck hit tight end Jack Doyle (3-35-2) for a 16-yard touchdown, and just like that, the game was tied at 28. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Lions were led into the red zone on nice gains by Riddick, Abdullah, Boldin and Ebron. A screen to Riddick hit pay dirt from 13 yards out, as Larry Warford hit the key block to spring Riddick. However, Matt Prater missed the extra point. After a few moderate gains, Luck hit Dorsett for a 33-yard gain after he beat Quandre Diggs downfield. That put the Colts in the red zone with 2 minutes left on the clock. With just under 40 seconds remaining, Luck connected with Doyle for a 6-yard touchdown. Vinatieri made the extra point to give the Colts a 1.point lead. Stafford got the ball at the Lions' 25-yard line with 37 seconds remaining and all 3 timeouts. Riddick rumbled for 20 yards on the first completion. Stafford then hit Ebron for close to 10 yards and then Jones for 22 yards. That set up Prater to redeem himself with a 43-yard field goal attempt that he drilled to give the Lions the victory. A safety was tacked on during the Colts' lateral on the kickoff return as time expired.    Matthew Stafford was superb, going 31-of-39 for 340 yards with 3 touchdowns. Indianapolis' secondary was completely helpless to stop Detroit. The Colts' defense had 1 sack on a play where Erik Walden beat Laken Tomlinson. Other than that, Stafford threw from a clean pocket all too often. The linebackers were incapable of defending against Detroit's running back duo and the secondary was torched. Indianapolis' defense was horrible in the season opener.    Ameer Abdullah had 63 yards on 12 carries with 5 receptions for 57 yards and a touchdown. Theo Riddick saw 7 carries for 45 yards with 1 touchdown rushing and 5 receptions for 63 yards with 1 touchdown receiving. This duo carved up the Colts' defense.    Andrew Luck was excellent, completing 31-of-47 passes for 385 yards with 4 touchdowns. The Colts' much-maligned offensive line had a rough start to the game, but played well down the stretch and was very good in the second half.    Riddick knifed through the Colts' defense for a 21-yard touchdown as rookie left tackle Taylor Decker made an excellent block at the second level to spring Riddick downfield. After trading punts, Stafford got moving again with a 27-yard gain to "

Stafford, however, was not penalized for the turnover because the Vikings didn't score off the give-away.    Stafford endured some drops in the opening half. Anquan Boldin dropped a pass on third down, while Marvin Jones let the ball fall through his hands shortly later. Neither player did much, save for Boldin catching a touchdown. Jones logged just 1 reception for 5 yards. Tate, meanwhile, who won the game, secured 11 receptions for 79 yards. He finished behind only Eric Ebron (7-92) on the receiving list.    Riddick and Dwayne Washington shared the workload."

It's hardly a surprise that the 2 prominent Detroit wideouts struggled against Jacksonville's elite secondary. Riddick (8 catches, 70 yards) for the team lead in receiving yardage.    It's hardly a surprise that the 2 prominent Detroit wideouts struggled against Jacksonville's elite secondary. Golden Tate caught only 3 balls for 27 yards, while Marvin Jones secured just 1 reception for 15 yards.    It was also predictable that the Lions couldn't run very well. Dwayne Washington handled most of the workload, but his 13 carries went for only 6 yards. Riddick, meanwhile, gained 13 yards on just 4 tries.    As for the Jaguars, I alluded to Bortles' struggles by mentioning his pick-six. That wasn't the only error he made, as he was nearly strip-sacked in the opening half because he held on to the ball too long. The play was ruled incomplete. There were also numerous occasions in which Bortles had receivers open for significant gains, but didn't see them. Bortles has seemingly regressed ever since Olson was let go, which is not surprising in the slightest, given that Bortles simply doesn't care enough to improve the mental part of his game, preferring to party frequently instead. Bortles finished 22-of-35 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. It was a disappointing showing, considering how poor Detroit's defense has been recently. Bortles was checked for a shoulder injury throughout the first half, but didn't miss any action, aside from a kneel-down right before intermission, which "

   "comment":"Theo Riddick gained 45 yards on 9 carries. A big chunk came on a 12-yard burst early on, so Riddick didn't do much otherwise. Still, it was an improvement over last week, when the Lions couldn't even gain 20 yards on the ground.    As for the Vikings, Bradford's stat line might look pretty good because of his completion percentage. He went 31-of-37 for 224 yards and the aforementioned interception. I'm sure some NFL talking heads who slurp quarterbacks will compliment Bradford for that completion percentage, but it's just further proof that stats can be very misleading. Bradford misfired just 6 times because he dinked and dunked most of the time. There were so many occasions when he settled for short passes on third-and-medium or third-and-long, which would explain why the Vikings were just 2-of-10 on third down. Minnesota's offense was just agonizing to watch. The team had just 1 completion of longer than 21 yards, and that was a 41-yard short toss to "
