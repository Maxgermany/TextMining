Playing on his 34th birthday, Delhomme committed 6 turnovers - 1 fumble, 5 interceptions - and threw into double coverage all evening. Delhomme had 5 total picks in his postseason career going into this contest. Thanks to Delhomme playing like a recovering a crack addict, Carolina couldn't move the chains at all. Following a quick opening touchdown, the team's other 6 first-half drives were comprised of: 3 3.and-outs, a pair of interceptions and a fumble. The Panthers ran 15 total plays in those 6 possessions!    Speaking of crack, it seemed as though Carolina's coaching staff completely forgot that "
