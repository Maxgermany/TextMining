Of course, the fake quarterback I'm referring to is Vince Young, who was 12-of-22 for 110 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions before he left the game with a leg injury. Young also fumbled once. On the ground, he totaled just 4 yards. I know his receivers suck, but Kerry Collins was able to manage more than half the passing yardage Young had in 20 less throws. I'm being facetious here, as most of Collins' yardage came after the catch, but the fact remains that Young was once again struggling.    The 1 bright spot for the Jaguars was "

Fortunately, things began to make more sense as the game went on. Joe Flacco coughed up 3 interceptions (1 was nullified by a booth review). Collins eventually became sober enough to lead Tennessee to a game-winning touchdown drive toward the end of the 4.h quarter. Of course, the Ravens helped out the Titans a ton. They were whistled for 11 penalties for 91 yards, though 1 was a BS roughing-the-passer penalty on the decisive drive.    Nothing of note in the passing department; both signal callers barely completed 50 percent of their passes, and they combined for 1 touchdown and 4 picks. "

Fisher admitted that he passed up on the kick because the roof was open and there was a chance that Bironas' attempt could have been blown off course. However, Bironas was 4-of-4 on the day and earlier nailed a 51-yarder. Fisher should have put his faith in Bironas.    Speaking of field goals, Kris Brown missed a 20-yarder, causing me to spaz out multiple times in the Live In-Games Thread in the forum. Check it out if you missed it.    Congratulations to the Texans, though. It seems like this franchise has finally turned the corner. It looks like they'll finish with a winning record for the first time ever. They have the Raiders and Bears (home) to close out the season.    Matt Schaub, undefeated at home this season (4-0), was 23-of-39 for 284 yards and a touchdown. But the big story was Andre Johnson, who hauled in 11 grabs for a franchise-record 207 yards and a score.    Steve Slaton helped open things up for Johnson, rushing for 100 yards on 24 carries versus 1 of the league's top run defenses.    Unfortunately for Owen Daniels and Kevin Walter's fantasy owners, neither Texan did much. Daniels had 4 catches for 41 yards, while Walter had 2 grabs for 8 yards.    Chris Johnson was the only Titan of note from a fantasy perspective. He rushed for 65 yards on 13 carries. Justin Gage paced the squad with 76 receiving yards, but it's unlikely that anyone in the semifinals of their league started him.    Kerry Collins struggled, failing to complete 50 percent of his passes. Collins was 15-of-33 for 181 yards and a pick.    The Titans are now in serious jeopardy of losing their grasp on homefield advantage. If the Steelers win out, they'll have it. And making matters worse, "

   "comment":"Collins. He's terrible. Though his stats don't look too bad - 19-of-38 for 191 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception - some of that came in junk time late in the game when Indianapolis was down 15. Collins played as though he just came out of a Penn State frat party. He was so inaccurate that the Colts simply had no chance. In fact, it's a miracle he threw only 1 pick. I have to wonder why Curtis Painter isn't starting. He's at least familiar with the offense. Collins belongs in a glue factory.    "
