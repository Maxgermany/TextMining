   "comment":"Graham for 47 yards. He then had a nice scramble with yardage tacked on for unnecessary roughness. Two plays later, he ran into the end zone, which sent the message that Buffalo would indeed be competitive in this ball game. Unfortunately for Buffalo, its defense had major issues stopping the Bengals, who generated 483 net yards of offense and 26 first downs (compared to 322 and 20 for the Bills). Cincinnati even had a 98-yard touchdown drive after the Bills failed to find the end zone on 4 tries from the 1-yard line. That sequence was inexcusable. Buffalo was so close to the goal line, yet didn't even try a quarterback sneak a single time. The Bills were eventually down by 14 - it could've been 17, but Cincinnati missed a chip-shot field goal - but Lewis led the charge to engineer 2 scoring drives, tying the game up. The defense ultimately failed him in overtime, but Lewis should still be proud of his performance. He went 19-of-32 for 216 yards and 2 touchdowns. His only mistake was a lost fumble that ruined a promising drive in the second half. Just as he did in his first professional start, Lewis proved that he can be a solid No. 2 quarterback in this league. Unfortunately, Lewis suffered a foot injury late the game and was spotted in a walking boot afterward. X-rays were negative, but he'll have an MRI on Monday.    Lewis' performance is remarkable considering his No. 1 wideout, Stevie Johnson, was out. Robert Woods didn't do much either (2-9), as Lewis concentrated on getting the ball to T.J. Graham (4-74), Marquise Goodwin (2-51, TD) and Scott Chandler (2-47)."

   "comment":"Graham lost a fumble and also had a big drop on a fourth-and-2. This was just 1 of 3 instances in which Buffalo failed to convert on fourth down. It was a bit odd because Thad Lewis was able to complete some impressive throws on third-and-long situations. This obviously does not include a Fred Jackson drop on third down. Buffalo's mistakes included penalties. On offside on a fourth-and-1 field goal attempt allowed the Patriots to score a touchdown. On another sequence, Alan Branch was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for a late shove, and during the announcement, Ed Hochuli told the crowd that Jerry Hughes was flagged for a separate 15-yard infraction for shouting expletives at the officials. This didn't cost the Bills, however, because the drive ultimately culminted with a Brady punt. On third-and-32. Yes, it was that weird of a game.    As for some positives, LeGarrette Blount had a career day. He rushed for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. And if that wasn't enough, he inexplicably had kickoff returns of 83 and 62 yards in the second half.    Brady didn't have as much success. He went 14-of-24 for 122 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. The score was thrown to Vereen (3-42), who was just 1 of 2 New England players to record more than 1 reception. The other was Edelman (9-65), who was guilty of a drop. New England's aerial attack was simply stymied by the weather, though Aaron Dobson's injury didn't help.    As for the Bills, Lewis was pretty solid. Considering all of the drops and the horrible weather, his 16-of-29, 247-yard and 1-touchdown line is impressive. Lewis has not been any sort of downgrade from E.J. Manuel this season. Manuel obviously has more long-term potential, but Lewis has solidified himself as a solid backup.    Manuel's aerial score went to Graham (3-62). Jackson secured Buffalo's other touchdown (14-60); he was a factor in the passing game (3 catches, 53 receiving yards), though he was outgained on the ground by "

   "comment":"Graham for a touchdown. They went up 10-0 and never looked back. New York's defense dominated the afternoon, but the Steelers killed themselves with some errors. Roethlisberger continued to hold on to the ball way too long. On 1 instance, he stood in the pocket for what seemed like an eternity. He eventually lofted a careless pass that was picked off. Antonio Brown also hurt his team by fumbling twice - once on offense and once on a punt return. Shaun Suisham whiffed on a field goal, while LeGarrette Blount inexplicably ran backward for a loss of 7 yards on second-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Roethlisberger finished 30-of-43 for 343 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks. However, his score and a bulk of his yardage came in garbage time. He generated just 54 yards in the first half.    Martavis Bryant caught Roethlisberger's sole aerial score, as he had another big game with 4 grabs for 143 yards. Brown hurt his team with the 2 fumbles, but his PPR owners didn't mind; he had 8 catches for 74 yards.    The Steelers could never get their ground attack going. Le'Veon Bell managed just 36 yards on 11 carries. He was a bigger factor in the passing game, hauling in 8 balls for 33 receiving yards.    QBDK didn't have nearly as many yards as his counterpart, but he was the superior signal-caller in this matchup. He went 10-of-18 for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns in addition to 39 rushing yards on 8 scrambles against a defense missing Troy Polamalu and Ryan Shazier. He made a nice juke on Brice McCain on an 18-yard run, which led to a score to Jace Amaro. It should be noted that QBDK made 2 mistakes that he wasn't punished for. He lost a fumble in the second half, but it wasn't ruled that way by the officials. Mike Tomlin challenged, but the officials inexplicably didn't overturn the call. Later, QBDK fired a terrible pass late across his body in the red zone. William Gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) appeared to have an interception, but he dropped the ball.    Excluding Graham, who had just 1 catch - his 67-yard touchdown - the Jets' leading receiver was Eric Decker, who caught 3 balls for just 24 yards."
