   "comment":"Michael Johnson had a sack to push back a field goal attempt by the Redskins, and once again, they missed it. McCown took advantage with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Evans, who burned past Tracy Porter. They hooked up again for another score as Evans burned a linebacker for a 56-yard touchdown. The Redskins' offensive line was too porous to give Washington any chance of making a comeback.    McCown completed 15-of-23 passes for 288 yards with 2 scores. Charles Sims led the Bucs on the ground with 36 yards on 13 carries. Vincent Jackson (3-43) is seeing fewer targets, as Evans has emerged as a big-time play-maker.    Griffin finished 23-of-32 for 207 yards with a score and 2 interceptions. Alfred Morris had a solid performance with 96 yards on 20 carries and 2 catches for 36 yards. Griffin missed an opportunity for a big play as he could have had a long touchdown pass of around 60 yards to DeSean Jackson (4-35) in the first half, but he overthrew Jackson in the end zone.    The Bucs' defense got good games from Gerald McCoy (5 tackles, 1.5 sacks), Clinton McDonald (4 tackles, 1 sack), Jacquies Smith (2 sacks), Michael Johnson (1 sack) and Lavonte David (12 tackles).    One of the reasons the Redskins' line struggled was left tackle "

   "comment":"Michael Johnson this year, so the team is expected to select pass-rushers early and often this April, which is what I have happening in my .    As for Hilton, he still managed to accumulate 103 receiving yards, but reeled in just 6 of his 14 targets. He would've hurt his team with his mistakes had the Bengals been remotely competitive on offense. Elsewhere, Hakeem Nicks (3-59) caught a 45-yarder, his longest with the Colts, while Donte Moncrief (3-54) reeled in Luck's sole touchdown.    The Colts ran the ball well with Maualuga out. Dan Herron had a big game, gaining 56 rushing yards and a touchdown on 12 carries and also served as a reliable pass-catcher out of the backfield, hauling in 10 balls for 85 receiving yards. However, Herron fumbled twice throughout this contest, losing 1. and he was ultimately benched in favor of an alien being named Zurlon Tipton, who also had success on the ground (11-40).    As for the Bengals, I already said that Dalton was anemic. His numbers indicated that, as he finished just 18-of-35 for 155 yards, and he turned the ball over yet again, losing a fumble. Dalton is now 0-4 in the playoffs. This defeat wasn't all on him because he was missing Green and Gresham, but his passes were all over the place. He heaved a terrible throw to "
