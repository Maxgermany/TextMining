   "comment":"Wilson was marching down the field, attempting to lead his team to a game-winning touchdown, the officials granted his team a 4.h timeout following a Marshawn Lynch carry. This enraged the Cardinal players, who looked like they wanted to punch the refs. A 10-minute delay ensued. The crowd booed mercilessly. FOX brought in Mike Pereira, who explained what happened. The officiating crew apparently forgot to charge Seattle with a timeout on a Doug Baldwin injury. The lead ref then announced that the Seahawks did, in fact, have a third timeout to use because the clock was stopped during the Baldwin injury. Pereira came back and then angrily said, That's not true. Just because the clock was stopped, doesn't mean there's no charged timeout. Some of the replacement officials did well this weekend, but these guys, as well as the 1. in the Green Bay-San Francisco game, were particularly atrocious.    The Cardinals moved the ball pretty well in the first half. Their offensive line held up shockingly well after being unable to block whatsoever in the preseason. However, the Seahawks seemed to figure things out after intermission. The Cardinals didn't achieve a single first down until John Skelton was knocked out with an injury in the 4.h quarter. Skelton started hot, going 11-of-17 for 124 yards in the first half, but was just 3-of-11 for only 25 yards and a pick after the break. However, Kolb stepped in and looked much sharper, going 6-of-8 for 66 yards and the decisive touchdown on his only drive. Kolb's score was pretty humorous because Ken Whisenhunt was running down the sideline, trying desperately to call a timeout. He has to be pretty happy that it wasn't granted. At any rate, Skelton suffered a high ankle sprain, but it doesn't matter at this point. Kolb will be starting next week.    Kolb hit Larry Fitzgerald twice on his only possession. Fitzgerald had just 2 catches before that, so he finished with 4 grabs for 63 yards. Andre Roberts (5-54) caught the touchdown.    The Cardinals couldn't run the ball at all. Chris Wells and Ryan Williams had just 14 and 9 rushing yards, respectively. Williams lost a fumble.    Russell Wilson went 18-of-34 for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception carelessly thrown into triple coverage in his debut. He ran a pretty conservative game plan, probably because Seattle's offensive line couldn't block the Cardinals. Wilson was sacked thrice, but he was constantly running for his life.    Wilson's score went to "

   "comment":"Wilson hadn't tossed a very ugly pick-six, they would have been victorious by double digits.    Cam Newton just couldn't get anything going offensively. He was 12-of-29 for 141 yards, but that doesn't tell the whole story. He was 3-of-15 for 40 yards by halftime, nearly getting picked on a couple of occasions. He converted just 2-of-11 third downs. He missed an open target for a touchdown by skipping the ball to him. He stared down Steve Smith and ignored Greg Olsen, who was open on some occasions. He was constantly pressured, getting sacked 4 times, including twice by Bruce Irvin, who forced a fumble to seal the victory for Seattle. If Newton weren't so mobile - he rushed for 42 yards on 7 scrambles - the Seahawks would have accumulated at least 8 sacks. It was complete domination.    Thanks to Newton's struggles, Smith disappointed fantasy owners, catching just 4 passes for 40 yards. Brandon LaFell (3-44) had more receiving yards.    Carolina's leading rusher was Jonathan Stewart, who gained 16 yards on 4 carries. Stewart also dropped a pass. DeAngelo Williams, meanwhile, gained just 6 yards on 6 attempts. He lost a fumble and got stuffed on a goal-line touch.    Marshawn Lynch had nearly quadruple the amount of rushing yards of Stewart and Williams combined. Having said that, Lynch struggled to find running room, gaining 85 yards on 21 attempts. Lynch did have some nice, tough runs at the end of the game to chew up the clock.    Russell Wilson was very economical, going 19-of-25 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. I mentioned his awful pick-six. The second give-away wasn't his fault, as Lynch bobbled the ball and tipped it into the air.    Taking advantage of Chris Gamble's absence, "

He was incredibly clutch at the end of the game, engineering a 97-yard drive to take the lead near the end of regulation, and following a quick Chicago field goal, he put together an 80-yard touchdown drive in overtime. What's remarkable about this is that he did this on the road, where the Seahawks perennially struggle, and against a supposedly stout Chicago defense. Wilson's final numbers are 23-of-37 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, though his passing numbers don't tell the whole story. He did a great job of buying time with his legs. He kept plays alive, either finding an open receiver after roaming around in the pocket or scrambling for yardage. He ran it 9 times for 71 rushing yards.    Wilson's 2 scores went to "

   "comment":"Wilson converted a crucial third down with 44 seconds left, it appeared as though the Falcons were destined to lose yet again. And when official Walt Coleman ruled that Marshawn Lynch broke the plane of the goal line, which gave Seattle a 28-27 lead, it was assumed that Atlanta would once again would be 1.and-done in the playoffs. But Ryan stepped up when it counted most - as he's done for most of this season. Ryan finished 24-of-35 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He had some shaky moments, particularly in the middle of the 4.h quarter when he failed to advance the chains, but his final completions of 22 and 19 yards to Harry Douglas and Tony Gonzalez, respectively, were absolutely huge for this franchise.    Speaking of Gonzalez, it was cool to see him crying after the game was over. Gonzalez, who tied Julio Jones with a team-high 6 receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown, just won his first playoff contest in his Hall-of-Fame career. Roddy White (5-76) and Jason Snelling caught Ryan's other scores.    As for the Seahawks, they probably would have prevailed had Pete Carroll not been guilty of some egregious errors in the first half. He opted to go for it on a 4th-and-1 inside Atlanta's 15, which I didn't have a big problem with until he called for a Michael Robinson carry that was easily stuffed. Marshawn Lynch wasn't even on the field for some strange reason. Later on, the Seahawks left points off the board when Wilson took a sack with about a dozen seconds remaining prior to intermission. I don't know why Carroll didn't have his field-goal unit prepared, but Wilson tried to run a play on 4.h down when time expired. Wilson's sack was his only blunder in what was an awesome afternoon for him. The dynamic rookie went 24-of-36 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception (on the final Hail Mary) while leading the team with 60 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. He was unbelievable after halftime, going 14-of-19 for 241 yards following the break. The Falcons simply had no answer for him, as he led his team to the end zone on all but 1 of his final 5 drives if the Hail Mary at the end is excluded.    It's remarkable that Wilson played so well when he didn't have Lynch assisting him. The stud back had an unusually poor outing, gaining just 46 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also fumbled in the first quarter to set up an Atlanta touchdown.    Some of the skill players who stepped up were "

   "comment":"Wilson's second-half surges have put them in position to pull off an improbable victory. Things were different this afternoon, however, as Seattle got off to a hot start. They were up 10-0 when the team blocked an Indianapolis punt. Jermaine Kearse recovered the ball in the end zone, but it was ruled a safety. Official Ron Winter was too inept to make the correct call after looking at the replay. Still though, the Seahawks were up 12-0 on the Colts, who looked completely out of it. Indianapolis had 3 drops on third down at that point, so the players just appeared to be too unfocused to mount any sort of comeback. Everything changed after that, however. Not only did the Colts start generating consistent scoring drives; they also got on the board via a special-teams block of their own when a Seattle field goal was batted down and returned for a touchdown.    Andrew Luck and his receivers eventually got on the same page. Luck finished 16-of-29 for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire in the second half, going 11-of-16 for 132 yards and a score following intermission. Both of Luck's scores went to T.Y. Hilton, who caught 5 balls for 140 yards, though it should be noted that 1 of the scores could've been prevented if a lethargic Richard Sherman ran downfield instead of halfheartedly waltzing toward Hilton. Including plays nullified by penalty, Hilton saw more targets than Darrius Heyward-Bey, 8-7. Reggie Wayne, meanwhile, struggled with drops early, but finished with 6 receptions for 65 yards, with all but 1 catch coming after halftime.    Trent Richardson's stats sucked - he had 56 yards on 18 carries, most of which came on a 16-yard try - but he didn't have much of a chance behind an offensive line that couldn't open up anything for him. The Indianapolis front struggled throughout the afternoon - left tackle Anthony Castonzo was abused by Chris Clemons, who had a sack and a forced fumble - so that makes Luck's performance all that more impressive.    Russell Wilson played well despite the loss. He failed to complete half of his passes - he went 15-of-31 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in desperation time - but he rushed for 102 yards on 13 scrambles. Wilson once again navigated the pocket like a 10-year veteran, but he had to do way too much because of injuries to his offensive line.    "

On the ensuing kickoff, Seattle's Jermaine Kearse fumbled the ball to Tampa Bay, so the Bucs were set up at the Seahawks 31-yard line. Glennon threw a bullet to Wright for 27 yards for the next play. On the following snap, Mike James threw a jump pass to Tom Crabtree for a touchdown. Filling in for Doug Martin, James (28-158) was awesome for the Bucs. He ripped up the Seattle defense all day, while Tampa Bay's offensive line had a superb performance in run blocking against the Seahawks' front 7. Down 21-0, Seattle woke up with a 16-yard run from Wilson. A facemask on "

He barely had to do any scrambling because he wasn't under very much heat despite his previous offensive line problems; he scrambled just 3 times for 20 rushing yards. Wilson would've had a bigger statistical game, but he just didn't need to pass because of the huge lead. He threw the ball just 6 times after intermission.

He went just 11-of-27 for 108 yards, 1 touchdown and that weird interception. He also didn't scramble very much, scampering just twice for 32 rushing yards. Wilson was under heavy pressure throughout the afternoon, but that doesn't excuse the many inaccurate passes he fired downfield. Wilson constantly overthrew his receivers.

   "comment":"Wilson, inexplicably squirting out of 2 potential sacks to find Colston for a 15-yard completion.    Jimmy Graham had an eventful pre-game when he ripped off Bruce Irvin's cap and then got into a shouting match with Richard Sherman. However, Graham didn't log a single reception until an 8.yard catch on a failed final drive. Earl Thomas did a great job of keeping Graham in check.    The Saints ran the ball well with both Khiry Robinson (13-57, TD) and Ingram (10-49). Robinson is someone to watch out for in fantasy next year; as the FOX broadcasters let us know repeatedly, Bill Parcells called Sean Payton during the week and told him that Robinson reminds him of Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin.    Speaking of Payton, he had some poor coaching gaffes in the second half. He burned a pair of timeouts, which was absolutely crucial, as the Saints simply ran out of time on their final drive. He then had Graham try an 48-yard field goal into the wind instead of having Brees attempt to move the chains. Sure, it was a 4.h-and-15, but Graham had zero chance in that spot. Even a punt would've been a better choice. Payton then wasted his final timeout when challenging what seemed like a sure reception on Seattle's final offensive possession. It was a big gain, but Payton simply couldn't throw the red flag there unless he was absolutely sure that Doug Baldwin dropped the pass. Payton also may have been responsible for Colston's desperation bone-headed forward lateral on the last play from scrimmage. Colston should have just stepped out of bounds following a reception to give Brees a Hail Mary try, but perhaps he was told to attempt a backward pass.    As for the winners, the big story for the Seahawks heading into this contest was Percy Harvin's return to the field. Harvin had a 9.yard rush on a sweep and made a 16-yard leaping catch, but his first game back turned out to be a flop because he was knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter on a fierce hit by Malcolm Jenkins. The Saints made it a point to hit him hard; safety Rafael Bush drew a flag for a shoulder shot to the helmet, yet the coaches high-fived him on the sideline. Roger Goodell can't be happy about that. Harvin finished with just 3 grabs for 21 yards.    Marshawn Lynch couldn't muster anything in the early going, as the Saints did a great job of bottling him up. However, he broke free for some big gains as the game developed, finishing with a franchise playoff-record 140 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 carries. Lynch appeared like he wore down at the end of the season, but he was in full Beast Mode in this contest. That obviously bodes well going forward.    Russell Wilson had some issues with his accuracy; he completed only half of his passes (9-of-18 for 103 yards), as some of his attempts were behind his intended targets. However, there are 2 things to keep in mind. First, the Saints have an outstanding aerial defense, as stud cornerback "

The same can be said for Kaepernick, who is now 1-3 straight up and 0-4 against the spread versus Wilson. Kaepernick struggled at times in last year's Super Bowl, and he once again disappointed in this year's conference title game. This wasn't the case early on.

   "comment":"Wilson converted first down after first down using both his arms and his legs. He marched Seattle all the way down the field and into the end zone. Manning never even had a chance in the extra session. What Manning did in the final minute was unbelievable, but he struggled mightily throughout the afternoon. He had issues with the crowd noise throughout the entire contest, and he simply didn't try to convert third-and-longs very much, settling for ineffective Montee Ball draws in those situations. His passes fluttered all over the place, some of which weren't even close to his intended targets. He also nearly threw a second interception - though it occurred prior to his actual 1 - as Kam Chancellor snagged a pass that just barely hit the ground. Chancellor would redeem himself later by securing what seemed to be a game-clinching pick in the red zone. However, Manning flipped the switch at the very end and gave his team a chance. He finished 31-of-49 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and that pick. Consider that Manning was just 11-of-16 for only 87 yards at intermission. Also, to be fair, Demaryius Thomas was hobbled with an injury throughout. He left the game briefly, but was never the same upon returning. It didn't help that he had to battle Richard Sherman for most of the afternoon. Thomas caught just 4 passes for 31 yards. He appeared to lose a fumble, but it was ruled incomplete after a review.    Manning's scores went to Jacob Tamme and Julius Thomas (3-17), who was strangely shut out for the most part after Antonio Gates had a monstrous outing the week before. Thomas' touchdown came on a shovel pass. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Sanders saw a team-high 15 targets, reeling in 11 of them for 149 yards. Wes Welker also contributed with 6 grabs for 60 yards in his first game back from his suspension.    As mentioned, the Broncos couldn't run the ball very successfully. Ball was limited to just 38 yards on 14 carries. This output was not a surprise considering how dominant Seattle's front is.    Wilson was masterful at the end of the game, and he was pretty sharp throughout. He made 1 mistake with an interception that he threw up 12 with 11 minutes remaining, but he made up for it with his terrific performance in overtime. He finished 24-of-34 for 258 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick to go with his 40 rushing yards on his 9 scrambles.    The Broncos barely had any answers for "

   "comment":"Wilson played some great football in the second half, but the Rams outplayed Seattle at the line of scrimmage and were led by some amazing special teams plays. St. Louis special teams coordinator John Fassel had a legendary game with 1 of the best fakes on a punt return you'll ever see, a long kick return, and a huge fake punt conversion in the 4.h quarter. The Seahawks fell to 3-3, and the defending champions aren't playing complete football, as perhaps a Super Bowl hangover is setting in.    Seattle got the scoring started in the first quarter when Doug Baldwin bolted down the field for a gain of 49 yards. The Seahawks had to settle for a field goal, but the Rams answered with Benny Cunningham returning the kickoff 75 yards to the Seattle 31. Tre Mason took over on a few runs and scored from 6 yards out. After the Rams got the ball back, Mason ripped off a run of 28 yards. St. Louis expanded its lead on a shovel pass from Austin Davis to Cunningham. The Rams entered the game with an NFL record for ineffective pass rush as they had only sack on the season, but that changed in the second quarter, as Aaron Donald and Eugene Sims recorded sacks on back-to-back plays. That forced a punt, and the Rams set up an amazing trick play. Tavon Austin went back to receive on the opposite side of the field from where the ball was going. Stedman Bailey was blocking a gunner on the other side. Bailey peeled off the gunner and tracked down the punt with an over-the-shoulder catch. However, all of the Rams' blockers had rand toward Austin, who acted like he was catching the ball. That drew the Seattle coverage. After Bailey caught the ball, he was untouched on a 90-yard touchdown return. It was 1 of the greatest special teams plays I've ever seen and an ingenious trick play by Fassel. After the Rams missed a 52-yard field goal, the Seahawks got going in the 2-minute drill as they moved the ball down the field by getting Wilson out of the pocket. Just before the half, the Seahawks tacked on a field goal. In the third quarter, Seattle had a good drive and Wilson ran in a 19-yard touchdown run on a read option, as linebacker ,"

The deflated Giants allowed Lynch to run into the end zone once again. The Seahawks followed that up with another score in garbage time, making it appear as though this game wasn't the close affair that it surely was for 3.and-half quarters.    Despite this game being tight, the Giants still looked completely pathetic trying to stop Seattle's ground attack. The Seahawks rushed for a franchise-record 350 yards, led by Lynch, who tallied 140 yards and a quartet of touchdowns on 21 carries. Lynch was extremely tough and moved the pile on most of his attempts. He'll be missed when he moves on next year, but Seattle fans got a taste of the future, as Christine Michael gained 71 yards on just 4 carries.    Like Lynch, Russell Wilson eclipsed the century barrier on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks designed plenty of runs for Wilson, and the Giants didn't have an answer. They were perplexed every single time. Wilson, however, didn't succeed in the passing game. He went 10-of-17 for 172 yards and 2 interceptions, and he also was pressured quite frequently. One of his picks was forced into tight coverage, while the second was underthrown. He missed an open "

   "comment":"Wilson took 2 sacks in the red zone during the first quarter. Following a third sack and a short pass on third down, the fans expressed their displeasure for the first of many occasions. A bit later in the second period, an illegal block downfield took away a Wilson scramble to the Arizona 1-yard line. Following 2 more sacks - giving the Cardinals 5 in the first half alone - the Seahawks had to settle for another field goal. Seattle's poor red-zone efficiency continued throughout the afternoon - a false start and another sack foiled an opportunity following a blocked punt - but the tide turned, as the Cardinals began making errors late in the game, adding to some they made earlier. For instance, "

Wilson apparently read his teammates perfectly, as Seattle went on the road and triumphed twice by double digits against a pair of teams that had a combined 16 victories. What's scary is that the Seahawks are doing this as visitors. They're so much more dominant at home, and they'll be playing as hosts throughout the playoffs if they win out and the Packers trip up once.    Wilson had a strong outing. The Eagles made some quality defensive plays, but Wilson proved to be too much. He was a magician in the pocket, eluding defenders and either scrambling for big gains or keeping plays alive to find receivers downfield. On 1 drive alone, Wilson found "

Wilson misfired on third down in the red zone, which would've set up the Seahawks with a field goal that could've made this game 13-7. However, Ed Hocchuli called the 49ers for an illegal hit to the quarterback on what looked like a simple, routine tackle, which granted Seattle a first down and a subsequent trip into the end zone, giving the team a 10-point lead. This was an atrocious call that had Troy Aikman ranting for what seemed like 10 minutes. It effectively decided the game, though the 49ers didn't look as though they were going to do much offensively. Wilson finished 12-of-24 for 168 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 of the worst interceptions he's ever thrown. Wilson moved his team into field-goal range at the end of the first half, but on a third-down try with about 8 seconds remaining, he took a poor shot downfield, which was intercepted by "

After losing 4 units to the Seahawks in Week 16, I don't think I could have lived with myself if they hadn't met expectations at home against the Rams.    Facing a tough St. Louis defense, the Seahawks did their part to land home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, thanks to some huge plays from their defense. Seattle's stop-unit came up with a touchdown, 2 interceptions and a clutch goal-line fumble to make the road to the Super Bowl run through Seattle and the 12th Man in the NFC.    The Rams got on the board first with a short field goal drive. They put tons of pressure on Russell Wilson throughout the first half, which eventually paid off with Wilson scrambling and overthrowing in the middle of the field.

   "comment":"Wilson pass to Jermaine Kearse. The Seahawks are going to the Super Bowl. The Packers are going to be kicking themselves for all of the blown opportunities they had in this contest. It began early when Aaron Rodgers threw an interception in the end zone, as Richard Sherman picked off a pass heading toward Davante Adams. After that, Green Bay had the following unforced blunders: - Following an overturned John Kuhn touchdown, Mike McCarthy opted to kick a field goal from the 1-inch line. Rodgers could've easily converted on a sneak. - McCarthy did the same exact thing on the ensuing drive that saw Rodgers miss Jordy Nelson by inches. McCarthy opted to send out Mason Crosby on the 1-yard line. His conservative play-calling left a whopping 8 points off the board in the first quarter. - Brandon Bostick dropped the ball on an attempted onside kick at the very end of the game. Bostick just had the ball slip out of his hands. Had he hung on to it, the Seahawks wouldn't have gotten the 1 possession they needed to take the lead. - Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had a chance to intercept a pass on a 2.point conversion following a Seattle touchdown that gave the Seahawks their first lead of the afternoon. Instead, the ball went right over his head and into the hands of Luke Willson. Had Clinton-Dix made the pick, Mason Crosby's 48-yard field goal at the end of regulaton would've clinched a trip to the Super Bowl for the Packers. - On Green Bay's game-tying drive, McCarthy opted not to call any timeouts. Time trickled off the clock, and Green Bay never really had an opportunity to score the go-ahead touchdown.    It would be a mistake to concentrate on the Packers exclusively, given how awesome Wilson was at the very end. Wilson, at 1 point, was 2-of-9 for only 13 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. Green Bay smothered him, as "

Michael Bennett was offsides on multiple occasions, resulting in big gains for the Packers. The Seahawks, on their first possession, held on a kickoff and then had to call a timeout because they had 12 men in the huddle. J.R. Sweezy was flagged for a penalty because he hit a player a minute after the whistle was blown. The Seahawks didn't run the clock down at the end of the first half while punting, giving Aaron Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. "

He once again had protection troubles, getting sacked 4 times, and this team is just no longer as confident in stomping on their opponents when they are down.    This game was a statement by the Bengals and Andy Dalton. They were down by 17 to the Legion of Boom, and Dalton did not look perfect, but he rallied and took it to them in the 4.h quarter. Dalton is firmly in the early MVP talk and has a solid defense, offensive line, running backs, tight end, wide receivers and kicker. And now, Dalton is playing consistent ball, which has not been his modus operandi in the past. The Bengals served notice that they can beat top teams, even when everything isn't going their way.   "

   "comment":"Wilson played well for the most part in this game, completing 15-of-23 passes for 213 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He also tacked on 3 rushes for 21 yards. Wilson made some big throws, averaging over 9 yards per pass attempt, but the Seahawks got complacent with the big 4.h-quarter lead. He once again had protection troubles, getting sacked 4 times, and this team is just no longer as confident in stomping on their opponents when they are down.    This game was a statement by the Bengals and Andy Dalton. They were down by 17 to the Legion of Boom, and Dalton did not look perfect, but he rallied and took it to them in the 4.h quarter. Dalton is firmly in the early MVP talk and has a solid defense, offensive line, running backs, tight end, wide receivers and kicker. And now, Dalton is playing consistent ball, which has not been his modus operandi in the past. The Bengals served notice that they can beat top teams, even when everything isn't going their way.   "

With a huge lead, Wilson shouldn't have been under much pressure, but instead, San Francisco was able to smother him to derail some drives. Some penalties by the linemen ruined a couple of possessions as well. Wilson's decision-making is also disconcerting. On 3 occasions this evening, Wilson tried to squeeze the ball into double coverage and didn't have any success doing so. The first time came in the red zone toward the end of the first half, when he was picked off. The second was a deep bomb downfield to "

It was a masterful performance, but the key in this game was the fact that he didn't turn the ball over once and neither did his teammates, while the Steelers gave up the ball 4 times.    The first turnover for the Steelers was the most devastating, as coach Mike Tomlin sent in backup quarterback Landry Jones to hold for a 45-yard field goal. As a side note, Jones is not their regular holder, so the jig was up before any of these shenanigans started. The Steelers then got out of field-goal formation and Jones took a shotgun snap, then commenced to throwing to a covered lineman, 25-foot tall offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva. You can guess what happened after that, but I'll tell you anyway. Cornerback Jeremy Lane caught the easy interception then ran it back 54 yards to Pittsburgh's 24-yard line. Wilson and company capitalized on that turnover with a 16-yard touchdown to Jermaine Kearse."

   "comment":"Wilson threw a 48-yard pass that was wiped out because he was barely over the line of scrimmage when he released the ball, and then he hurled a careless, punt-like interception. Despite all of this, the Seahawks still had a chance to win at the end. However, Wilson lost a fumble in the red zone after picking up a first down on a second-and-13. It looked like a great play at first to give Seattle a first-and-10 in the red zone, but replay review caught Wilson losing control of the ball mere nanoseconds prior to his knee hitting the ground.    Wilson finished 25-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns, an interception and a lost fumble. Wilson's stat line looks fine, but both of his touchdowns came late, so garbage time definitely enhanced his numbers; Wilson was just 10-of-18 for 92 yards and a pick by halftime. Wilson had been on fire entering this contest, but it looked like he reverted to early-season form. It wasn't really much of his fault though, as the offensive line struggled to handle "

   "comment":"Wilson, who was under pressure from Kawann Short, panicked, released the ball inaccurately, and watched it get intercepted and taken back by Luke Kuechly for 6. Just like that, Carolina up was 14-0. The Seahawks didn't seem to have any hope of coming back either; they were completely out of whack, as they were both half-asleep because of the early start time, and it didn't help that they complained about the field turf on Carolina's sloppy surface, which was absolutely inexcusable. I don't get how the NFL allowed it to be that bad, but Roger Goodell always seems content with screwing over Seattle in every way imaginable because he doesn't want them in the Super Bowl. The horrible turf appeared to be in the Seattle players' heads, as they were heard shouting about needing different cleats throughout the first quarter. It was completely ridiculous and highly unprofessional on the NFL and the Panthers' part. At any rate, the Panthers continued to dominate throughout the first half. They generated their longest drive of the season, time-wise, and then Wilson threw an interception because he was hit as he released the ball. On that very play, "

Thanks to that, and Seattle's line incapable of blocking the Rams' ferocious defensive front, the Seahawks couldn't do anything offensively. Wilson finished 22-of-35 for 254 yards. The glaring stat was his rushing yardage, which was just 14. He scrambled only 5 times. Wilson wasn't moving at his usual speed, and it remains to be seen when he'll be 100 percent, given that he'll be taking crushing hits every week. That's a major issue. The Seahawks desperately need Wilson to scramble because their offensive line is so bad, but Wilson can't do that right now because his mobility is so limited.    Wilson isn't the only offensive player who happens to be banged up; "

   "comment":"Wilson was actually sacked only once, but had to release the ball quickly to avoid taking hits. As a result, the Seahawks weren't able to stay on the field for a long time, allowing New Orleans to win the time-of-possession battle by about 13 minutes. You can't give Drew Brees that much time to lead his offense and expect to win, and naturally, New Orleans was able to pull the upset.    Wilson finished 22-of-34 for 253 yards and an interception. The pick was a rare 1. as it was Wilson's first in 203 attempts. It occurred because Wilson didn't see linebacker "

   "comment":"Wilson era, so it's no surprise that Wilson had his worst NFL start ever. He threw a career-high 5 interceptions, though most of those weren't his fault. The first occurred because his receiver fell down. The second 1 was on him, as Wilson launched a pass that hung up in the air forever. It would've been a good punt, but it was a bad pass instead. Wilson's third interception was questionable, as the Packers easily could've been flagged for pass interference on the play. The next 2 picks were via tipped or dropped passes. Wilson, as it turns out, was really only responsible for 1 pick (2 at most). That won't make his fantasy owners feel better though, as Wilson went 22-of-30 for 240 yards, 1 touchdown and the 5 interceptions. He was hurt by tons of drops, so don't feel too discouraged if you own Wilson and somehow survived with him (or if you were on a bye.)    "

   "comment":"Wilson's foot, resulting in a safety. The Falcons then took the lead with a field goal on the ensuing possession, and they never looked back. The end result of this game was definitely misleading, but what's not is Atlanta's yardage total. The Falcons accumulated 422 net yards of offense, as the Seahawks had absolutely no answer for anything Atlanta was doing. Earl Thomas was clearly missed, and it didn't help that No. 2 cornerback Deshawn Shead was knocked out of the game when his knee buckled while trying to cover Taylor Gabriel. The Atlanta receiver actually pushed off, and Shead went down instantly. It's unclear why offensive pass interference wasn't called. The Falcons were flagged just twice all game. Hopefully official Gene Steratore makes great use of his new yacht. With Seattle's defense struggling big time, Matt Ryan torched the formerly dominant Legion of Boom with ease. Ryan went 26-of-37 for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. He validated his possible MVP status, as the Seahawks couldn't do anything to slow him down. They didn't put much pressure on him, and even when they did, he still found open receivers, punishing them for blitzing him. Even when Julio Jones was knocked out, Ryan still torched Seattle's secondary mercilessly. Atlanta punted just once in meaningful action.    Speaking of Jones, he left the game temporarily on the opening drive of the third quarter with a toe injury, as he was hobbling around on the sideline. Jones reentered the game, but left prior to the end of regulation. I imagine he still would've played had the contest not gotten out of hand, but it still has to be disconcerting for the Falcons. They'll obviously need Jones to beat a tougher opponent in the NFC Championship. Jones caught 6 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. He also dropped a pass. His score, the first of the game for the Falcons, was an obvious pass interference call - blocking downfield prior to the ball being released - that Steratore didn't call for some reason. The FOX announcers, including Mike Pereira, were befuddled as to why no flagged was tossed.    If Jones is hobbled next week, the other receivers will obviously have to pick up the slack. Gabriel (4-71) was top wideout producer as far as yardage is concerned, while Mohamed Sanu (4-44) found the end zone. Running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were big factors as receivers as well. Freeman hauled in 4 balls for 80 yards, while Coleman snatched 3 passes for 22 yards and a touchdown. Speaking of Freeman and Coleman, they ran well versus the Seahawks, which was surprising. Freeman (14-45, TD) and Coleman (11-57) combined to eclipse the century mark.    Atlanta moves on to the NFC Championship. It'll either host the Packers or travel to Dallas. If the Cowboys beat Green Bay, this will have been the final game in the Georgia Dome.    As for the Seahwks, they were hot offensively early on, as they engineered a 14-play touchdown drive to start the game. The possession lasted 8:34. There were some great runs, while Russell Wilson was precise. However, bad luck ensued; the Ifedi injury, the aforementioned penalty on the Hester return, and Wilson falling down all hurt. Then, Atlanta held the ball forever, and Seattle's offensive chances were limited as a result. The Seahawks' decision to punt on 1 occasion on a 4.h-and-1 from around their own 40-yard line also hurt. They pinned the Falcons down at the 1-yard line, but Ryan put together a 99-yard touchdown drive. Wilson went 17-of-30 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions in garbage time, 1 of which should've been called a reception down by contact. Wilson played well, but once again had issues on the offensive line. He constantly had to run out of the pocket, and many of his incompletions were thrown away.    If there's a silver lining for the Seahawks, it's that they may have found something in "

   "comment":"Wilson!    The final score of this game is deceiving. While the scoreboard says it was a 1.score contest, the Titans led by 2 scores for most of the second half. The Seahawks had a chance at a late comeback, but that was more a result of the Titans playing prevent defense on Seattle's last offensive possession of the game where the Seahawks cut the deficit to 6. The Titans looked good for the entirety of this game, but they really turned things on in the second half. In the third quarter, they scored 21 points, which really helped to put the contest out of reach. All of this was thanks to the performance of their offense, especially their rushing attack. While it was widely expected that Derrick Henry would shoulder the load for the Titans' ground game, that was not the case. DeMarco Murray continued to lead the backfield and showed no signs of the hamstring injury that had made him questionable in the leadup to the contest. Overall, Murray totaled 115 yards on 14 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run that saw him follow his blockers perfectly and cut into open space all across the field. He is a low-end RB1 right now, though Henry could take some opportunities away from him in the future. Speaking of Henry, he started the game poorly, and at 1 point, had 4 carries for minus-6 yards. By the end of the day, Henry had racked up 54 yards on 13 carries, and he looked good in the second half. Henry has RB1 potential for the future, but that won't happen this year unless Murray misses time.    Tennessee's offensive line also deserves credit for this performance. The team's line is 1 of the top units in the league and will continue to provide quality blocking for Mariota and the backs all season, provided that the linemen can stay healthy. Speaking of Mariota, he had an impressive performance against a stout Seattle defense. Early on, Mariota was under pressure, but he was able to scramble away from sacks and make plays outside the pocket. He used his mobility to his advantage, and that helped to take away the effectiveness of the Seahawks' defensive line, which is their strongest part of the defensive unit. Mariota was very accurate per usual, and he was able to spread the ball around and find the open man. Overall, Mariota went 20-of-32 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he helped the Titans to control the game. Mariota has a great grasp of the offense, and his ability to analyze defenses and find effective matchups will be a major weapon for the Titans.    With Corey Davis out, Mariota focus on targeting Rishard Matthews (6-87, 1 TD) for a majority of the day. Matthews was solid for most of the game, but a good chunk of his yardage came on a 55-yard screen-pass touchdown. On the play, Matthews was able to follow his blockers and made a man miss to get the score. Matthews is a WR3 in fantasy, but he could put up WR2 numbers if Davis continues to miss time. Mariota's other touchdown went to Jonnu Smith (1-24), who went uncovered on a play where he slipped out of the backfield as a fullback. Eric Decker (4-49) was impactful in the first half, while Delanie Walker (4-31) had a decent day. Both are capable of more, but since Mariota likes to spread the ball around, their productions can fluctuate.    For the Seahawks, their offense actually looked very good during the contest. They were led by a strong passing attack that saw Russell Wilson post his best stat line of the season. Wilson ended up going 29-of-49 for 373 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. The stat line is a bit deceiving, as some of his yardage came with his team down by multiple scores late. But still, it was significantly better than the initial 2 starts for Wilson. Wilson finally had decent protection from his offensive line and wasn't forced to throw the ball away too much. He was sacked once during the contest, and that was a major improvement for Seattle. Throughout the game, when Wilson had time, he was able to find the open receiver wherever they were on the field. Wilson's accuracy and ball placement were superb, and he definitely is not the 1 to blame for the team's loss.    Wilson's top receivers on Sunday were "

   "comment":"Wilson and Deshaun Watson were incredible, as they made 1 great pass after another. However, ball security for Seattle ended up giving the Seahawks enough of an edge to avoid the road upset from Houston.    On the first drive of the game, Watson laid out a perfect bomb for Will Fuller, who burned Shaquil Griffin and Earl Thomas for a 59-yard touchdown. Quickly, Houston got the ball back and DeAndre Hopkins beat Richard Sherman for a 27-yard reception to get inside the 30, but Watson made an ill-advised pass that was jumped by Thomas for an interception. He raced 78 yards for a pick-six to tie the game at 7. Watson shook off the bad play and got moving with a 15-yard completion to Hopkins and then a 22-yard pass interference on Jeremy Lane, who had to grab Fuller to prevent a long touchdown. Lamar Miller ran for 12 to set up a first-and-goal and then darted into end zone from a few yards out. Seattle got moving with a Tyler Lockett snatching a 27-yard completion. Jadeveon Clowney had a third-down strip-sack on Wilson, but the ball flew forward and Seahawks tight end Luke Willson scooped up the ball at the 20 to give Seattle a lucky first down."

   "comment":"Wilson got a bit banged up and missed a play. Kam Chancellor also went into the 10. for some undisclosed reason. The worst injury, however, was to Richard Sherman when he grabbed his Achilles. The NBC announcing crew noted that Sherman didn't trust his Achilles entering this contest, and it turned out that his decision to play would end up costing him the season. Sherman was seen telling his teammates that he tore his Achilles on the sideline. For more, check out my Disaster Grades. If there was any proof needed that Thursday night games should be abolished, this game was it. The Seahawks-Cardinals clash was a sloppy struggle with way too many injuries, and had Sherman been playing on proper rest, he almost certainly wouldn't have gotten hurt.    Wilson, as mentioned, missed only 1 snap, and he proved that he was healthy with 1 of the most spectacular plays of the season. Wilson was under duress by 2 defenders in the pocket. He spun around twice, avoiding them for 8 seconds. He then launched a ball downfield, and "
