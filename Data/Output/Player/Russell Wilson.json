   "comment":"Russell Wilson was marching down the field, attempting to lead his team to a game-winning touchdown, the officials granted his team a 4.h timeout following a Marshawn Lynch carry. This enraged the Cardinal players, who looked like they wanted to punch the refs. A 10-minute delay ensued. The crowd booed mercilessly. FOX brought in Mike Pereira, who explained what happened. The officiating crew apparently forgot to charge Seattle with a timeout on a Doug Baldwin injury. The lead ref then announced that the Seahawks did, in fact, have a third timeout to use because the clock was stopped during the Baldwin injury. Pereira came back and then angrily said, That's not true. Just because the clock was stopped, doesn't mean there's no charged timeout. Some of the replacement officials did well this weekend, but these guys, as well as the 1. in the Green Bay-San Francisco game, were particularly atrocious.    The Cardinals moved the ball pretty well in the first half. Their offensive line held up shockingly well after being unable to block whatsoever in the preseason. However, the Seahawks seemed to figure things out after intermission. The Cardinals didn't achieve a single first down until John Skelton was knocked out with an injury in the 4.h quarter. Skelton started hot, going 11-of-17 for 124 yards in the first half, but was just 3-of-11 for only 25 yards and a pick after the break. However, Kolb stepped in and looked much sharper, going 6-of-8 for 66 yards and the decisive touchdown on his only drive. Kolb's score was pretty humorous because Ken Whisenhunt was running down the sideline, trying desperately to call a timeout. He has to be pretty happy that it wasn't granted. At any rate, Skelton suffered a high ankle sprain, but it doesn't matter at this point. Kolb will be starting next week.    Kolb hit Larry Fitzgerald twice on his only possession. Fitzgerald had just 2 catches before that, so he finished with 4 grabs for 63 yards. Andre Roberts (5-54) caught the touchdown.    The Cardinals couldn't run the ball at all. Chris Wells and Ryan Williams had just 14 and 9 rushing yards, respectively. Williams lost a fumble.    Russell Wilson went 18-of-34 for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception carelessly thrown into triple coverage in his debut. He ran a pretty conservative game plan, probably because Seattle's offensive line couldn't block the Cardinals. Wilson was sacked thrice, but he was constantly running for his life.    Wilson's score went to "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson hadn't tossed a very ugly pick-six, they would have been victorious by double digits.    Cam Newton just couldn't get anything going offensively. He was 12-of-29 for 141 yards, but that doesn't tell the whole story. He was 3-of-15 for 40 yards by halftime, nearly getting picked on a couple of occasions. He converted just 2-of-11 third downs. He missed an open target for a touchdown by skipping the ball to him. He stared down Steve Smith and ignored Greg Olsen, who was open on some occasions. He was constantly pressured, getting sacked 4 times, including twice by Bruce Irvin, who forced a fumble to seal the victory for Seattle. If Newton weren't so mobile - he rushed for 42 yards on 7 scrambles - the Seahawks would have accumulated at least 8 sacks. It was complete domination.    Thanks to Newton's struggles, Smith disappointed fantasy owners, catching just 4 passes for 40 yards. Brandon LaFell (3-44) had more receiving yards.    Carolina's leading rusher was Jonathan Stewart, who gained 16 yards on 4 carries. Stewart also dropped a pass. DeAngelo Williams, meanwhile, gained just 6 yards on 6 attempts. He lost a fumble and got stuffed on a goal-line touch.    Marshawn Lynch had nearly quadruple the amount of rushing yards of Stewart and Williams combined. Having said that, Lynch struggled to find running room, gaining 85 yards on 21 attempts. Lynch did have some nice, tough runs at the end of the game to chew up the clock.    Russell Wilson was very economical, going 19-of-25 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. I mentioned his awful pick-six. The second give-away wasn't his fault, as Lynch bobbled the ball and tipped it into the air.    Taking advantage of Chris Gamble's absence, "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson. He was incredibly clutch at the end of the game, engineering a 97-yard drive to take the lead near the end of regulation, and following a quick Chicago field goal, he put together an 80-yard touchdown drive in overtime. What's remarkable about this is that he did this on the road, where the Seahawks perennially struggle, and against a supposedly stout Chicago defense. Wilson's final numbers are 23-of-37 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, though his passing numbers don't tell the whole story. He did a great job of buying time with his legs. He kept plays alive, either finding an open receiver after roaming around in the pocket or scrambling for yardage. He ran it 9 times for 71 rushing yards.    Wilson's 2 scores went to "

Wilson was able to scramble 10 times for 77 yards to help offset his poor passing numbers (12-of-23, 123 yards, interception) - a byproduct of all of the pressure.

   "comment":"Russell Wilson's second-half surges have put them in position to pull off an improbable victory. Things were different this afternoon, however, as Seattle got off to a hot start. They were up 10-0 when the team blocked an Indianapolis punt. Jermaine Kearse recovered the ball in the end zone, but it was ruled a safety. Official Ron Winter was too inept to make the correct call after looking at the replay. Still though, the Seahawks were up 12-0 on the Colts, who looked completely out of it. Indianapolis had 3 drops on third down at that point, so the players just appeared to be too unfocused to mount any sort of comeback. Everything changed after that, however. Not only did the Colts start generating consistent scoring drives; they also got on the board via a special-teams block of their own when a Seattle field goal was batted down and returned for a touchdown.    Andrew Luck and his receivers eventually got on the same page. Luck finished 16-of-29 for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire in the second half, going 11-of-16 for 132 yards and a score following intermission. Both of Luck's scores went to T.Y. Hilton, who caught 5 balls for 140 yards, though it should be noted that 1 of the scores could've been prevented if a lethargic Richard Sherman ran downfield instead of halfheartedly waltzing toward Hilton. Including plays nullified by penalty, Hilton saw more targets than Darrius Heyward-Bey, 8-7. Reggie Wayne, meanwhile, struggled with drops early, but finished with 6 receptions for 65 yards, with all but 1 catch coming after halftime.    Trent Richardson's stats sucked - he had 56 yards on 18 carries, most of which came on a 16-yard try - but he didn't have much of a chance behind an offensive line that couldn't open up anything for him. The Indianapolis front struggled throughout the afternoon - left tackle Anthony Castonzo was abused by Chris Clemons, who had a sack and a forced fumble - so that makes Luck's performance all that more impressive.    Russell Wilson played well despite the loss. He failed to complete half of his passes - he went 15-of-31 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in desperation time - but he rushed for 102 yards on 13 scrambles. Wilson once again navigated the pocket like a 10-year veteran, but he had to do way too much because of injuries to his offensive line.    "

Wilson scrambled 8 times for 29 rushing yards to go along with his great passing numbers, 18-of-29 for 235 yards and 3 touchdowns. Wilson's only issue in this contest was failing to han on to the football. He fumbled thrice, losing possession on 2 occasions. This will all be fixed with upgraded pass protection. Okung will make a huge difference.    Wilson's 3 touchdowns went to different players, which is not a surprise because he always spreads the ball around. "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson, who let the ball hit the ground only 7 times. He went 19-of-26 for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns. He barely had to do any scrambling because he wasn't under very much heat despite his previous offensive line problems; he scrambled just 3 times for 20 rushing yards. Wilson would've had a bigger statistical game, but he just didn't need to pass because of the huge lead. He threw the ball just 6 times after intermission. Wilson was awesome, as was the ground attack. "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson's second interception hit the ground and bounced into the arms of an Arizona defender. However, the incompetent refs ruled that the ball somehow bounced off a player's arm when something like this wasn't physically possible. The Cardinals took over, and following 1 first down, they took 3 knees to clinch the victory. Wilson had perhaps the worst performance of his young career. He went just 11-of-27 for 108 yards, 1 touchdown and that weird interception. He also didn't scramble very much, scampering just twice for 32 rushing yards. Wilson was under heavy pressure throughout the afternoon, but that doesn't excuse the many inaccurate passes he fired downfield. Wilson constantly overthrew his receivers. Of course, he didn't really have much to work with. "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson, inexplicably squirting out of 2 potential sacks to find Colston for a 15-yard completion.    Jimmy Graham had an eventful pre-game when he ripped off Bruce Irvin's cap and then got into a shouting match with Richard Sherman. However, Graham didn't log a single reception until an 8.yard catch on a failed final drive. Earl Thomas did a great job of keeping Graham in check.    The Saints ran the ball well with both Khiry Robinson (13-57, TD) and Ingram (10-49). Robinson is someone to watch out for in fantasy next year; as the FOX broadcasters let us know repeatedly, Bill Parcells called Sean Payton during the week and told him that Robinson reminds him of Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin.    Speaking of Payton, he had some poor coaching gaffes in the second half. He burned a pair of timeouts, which was absolutely crucial, as the Saints simply ran out of time on their final drive. He then had Graham try an 48-yard field goal into the wind instead of having Brees attempt to move the chains. Sure, it was a 4.h-and-15, but Graham had zero chance in that spot. Even a punt would've been a better choice. Payton then wasted his final timeout when challenging what seemed like a sure reception on Seattle's final offensive possession. It was a big gain, but Payton simply couldn't throw the red flag there unless he was absolutely sure that Doug Baldwin dropped the pass. Payton also may have been responsible for Colston's desperation bone-headed forward lateral on the last play from scrimmage. Colston should have just stepped out of bounds following a reception to give Brees a Hail Mary try, but perhaps he was told to attempt a backward pass.    As for the winners, the big story for the Seahawks heading into this contest was Percy Harvin's return to the field. Harvin had a 9.yard rush on a sweep and made a 16-yard leaping catch, but his first game back turned out to be a flop because he was knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter on a fierce hit by Malcolm Jenkins. The Saints made it a point to hit him hard; safety Rafael Bush drew a flag for a shoulder shot to the helmet, yet the coaches high-fived him on the sideline. Roger Goodell can't be happy about that. Harvin finished with just 3 grabs for 21 yards.    Marshawn Lynch couldn't muster anything in the early going, as the Saints did a great job of bottling him up. However, he broke free for some big gains as the game developed, finishing with a franchise playoff-record 140 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 carries. Lynch appeared like he wore down at the end of the season, but he was in full Beast Mode in this contest. That obviously bodes well going forward.    Russell Wilson had some issues with his accuracy; he completed only half of his passes (9-of-18 for 103 yards), as some of his attempts were behind his intended targets. However, there are 2 things to keep in mind. First, the Saints have an outstanding aerial defense, as stud cornerback Keenan Lewis broke up several passes. Second, Wilson made a clutch, third-down conversion to Baldwin (2-30) on the team's final possession, setting up Lynch's second touchdown. Baldwin, by the way, led the Seahawks in receiving yardage. Harvin, meanwhile, was the only Seahawk with more than 2 receptions. Wilson almost definitely would've enjoyed a better performance had Harvin remained on the field. Fortunately for Seattle, he'll have an extra day to get cleared. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson will clash on countless occasions over the next 10-15 years, and as with the Brady-Manning dynamic, the flashier quarterback hasn't been able to defeat the clutch upstart, instead choking in big moments. Manning couldn't defeat Brady early in his career. He also came up small in the clutch prior to the AFC Championship following the 2006 season. The same can be said for Kaepernick, who is now 1-3 straight up and 0-4 against the spread versus Wilson. Kaepernick struggled at times in last year's Super Bowl, and he once again disappointed in this year's conference title game. This wasn't the case early on. Kaepernick was running all over Seattle's vaunted defense, scrambling 8 times for 98 rushing yards in the opening half, which includes a career-long 58-yard scamper that helped set up an Anthony Dixon plunge into the end zone. He was just 3-of-5 for 17 yards in the first half - this prompted a drunken Terry Bradshaw to clamor for the 49er coaching staff to allow Kaepernick to air it out more often - but the passing numbers were so limited because the running lanes were just so wide open. Kaepernick didn't even have to throw, but when he did in the third quarter, he had success. He fired a high number of passes across his body that he was able to complete, thanks to his great throwing velocity. He also zipped a very impressive jump-pass touchdown to Anquan Boldin. However, Kaepernick struggled mightily in the 4.h quarter. He was strip-sacked by "

The deflated Giants allowed Lynch to run into the end zone once again. The Seahawks followed that up with another score in garbage time, making it appear as though this game wasn't the close affair that it surely was for 3.and-half quarters.    Despite this game being tight, the Giants still looked completely pathetic trying to stop Seattle's ground attack. The Seahawks rushed for a franchise-record 350 yards, led by Lynch, who tallied 140 yards and a quartet of touchdowns on 21 carries. Lynch was extremely tough and moved the pile on most of his attempts. He'll be missed when he moves on next year, but Seattle fans got a taste of the future, as Christine Michael gained 71 yards on just 4 carries.    Like Lynch, Russell Wilson eclipsed the century barrier on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks designed plenty of runs for Wilson, and the Giants didn't have an answer. They were perplexed every single time. Wilson, however, didn't succeed in the passing game. He went 10-of-17 for 172 yards and 2 interceptions, and he also was pressured quite frequently. One of his picks was forced into tight coverage, while the second was underthrown. He missed an open "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson to announce that the team had its swagger back. Wilson apparently read his teammates perfectly, as Seattle went on the road and triumphed twice by double digits against a pair of teams that had a combined 16 victories. What's scary is that the Seahawks are doing this as visitors. They're so much more dominant at home, and they'll be playing as hosts throughout the playoffs if they win out and the Packers trip up once.    Wilson had a strong outing. The Eagles made some quality defensive plays, but Wilson proved to be too much. He was a magician in the pocket, eluding defenders and either scrambling for big gains or keeping plays alive to find receivers downfield. On 1 drive alone, Wilson found "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson, who completed half of his passes, was involved on the most controversial play of this game. Wilson misfired on third down in the red zone, which would've set up the Seahawks with a field goal that could've made this game 13-7. However, Ed Hocchuli called the 49ers for an illegal hit to the quarterback on what looked like a simple, routine tackle, which granted Seattle a first down and a subsequent trip into the end zone, giving the team a 10-point lead. This was an atrocious call that had Troy Aikman ranting for what seemed like 10 minutes. It effectively decided the game, though the 49ers didn't look as though they were going to do much offensively. Wilson finished 12-of-24 for 168 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 of the worst interceptions he's ever thrown. Wilson moved his team into field-goal range at the end of the first half, but on a third-down try with about 8 seconds remaining, he took a poor shot downfield, which was intercepted by "

After losing 4 units to the Seahawks in Week 16, I don't think I could have lived with myself if they hadn't met expectations at home against the Rams.    Facing a tough St. Louis defense, the Seahawks did their part to land home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, thanks to some huge plays from their defense. Seattle's stop-unit came up with a touchdown, 2 interceptions and a clutch goal-line fumble to make the road to the Super Bowl run through Seattle and the 12th Man in the NFC.    The Rams got on the board first with a short field goal drive. They put tons of pressure on Russell Wilson throughout the first half, which eventually paid off with Wilson scrambling and overthrowing in the middle of the field.

Wilson made some big throws, averaging over 9 yards per pass attempt, but the Seahawks got complacent with the big 4.h-quarter lead. He once again had protection troubles, getting sacked 4 times, and this team is just no longer as confident in stomping on their opponents when they are down.    This game was a statement by the Bengals and Andy Dalton. They were down by 17 to the Legion of Boom, and Dalton did not look perfect, but he rallied and took it to them in the 4.h quarter. Dalton is firmly in the early MVP talk and has a solid defense, offensive line, running backs, tight end, wide receivers and kicker. And now, Dalton is playing consistent ball, which has not been his modus operandi in the past. The Bengals served notice that they can beat top teams, even when everything isn't going their way.   "

With a huge lead, Wilson shouldn't have been under much pressure, but instead, San Francisco was able to smother him to derail some drives. Some penalties by the linemen ruined a couple of possessions as well. Wilson's decision-making is also disconcerting. On 3 occasions this evening, Wilson tried to squeeze the ball into double coverage and didn't have any success doing so. The first time came in the red zone toward the end of the first half, when he was picked off. The second was a deep bomb downfield to "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson went berserk in the second half. He completed 11-of-14 attempts for 171 yards and 3 touchdowns following the break, as he mercilessly torched Baltimore's atrocious secondary. Wilson's final numbers were 23-of-32 for 292 yards and 5 scores, as he had all day to throw for most of the afternoon. Granted, the opponent was weak, but Wilson has been on a tear after losing to the Cardinals on a Sunday night. Ever since the coaching staff made some adjustments to the offensive line, Wilson has been unstoppable.    "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson threw a 48-yard pass that was wiped out because he was barely over the line of scrimmage when he released the ball, and then he hurled a careless, punt-like interception. Despite all of this, the Seahawks still had a chance to win at the end. However, Wilson lost a fumble in the red zone after picking up a first down on a second-and-13. It looked like a great play at first to give Seattle a first-and-10 in the red zone, but replay review caught Wilson losing control of the ball mere nanoseconds prior to his knee hitting the ground.    Wilson finished 25-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns, an interception and a lost fumble. Wilson's stat line looks fine, but both of his touchdowns came late, so garbage time definitely enhanced his numbers; Wilson was just 10-of-18 for 92 yards and a pick by halftime. Wilson had been on fire entering this contest, but it looked like he reverted to early-season form. It wasn't really much of his fault though, as the offensive line struggled to handle "

The Vikings recorded just 2 sacks, but Wilson had to throw the ball away on numerous occasions. One instance should've been ruled intentional grounding, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to make the correct call. Wilson went 13-of-26 for 142 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was a tipped pass on a 4.h down. He did not look comfortable whatsoever in the frigid weather. Wilson did, however, make a great play when he mishandled a snap, scooped up the ball 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage, avoided some defenders and found Tyler Lockett for a huge gain that helped set up Seattle's first score of the game.

   "comment":"Russell Wilson last week, leading to Wilson's ankle sprain. Wilson certainly wasn't himself in this game, as he was very limited in terms of mobility. Thanks to that, and Seattle's line incapable of blocking the Rams' ferocious defensive front, the Seahawks couldn't do anything offensively. Wilson finished 22-of-35 for 254 yards. The glaring stat was his rushing yardage, which was just 14. He scrambled only 5 times. Wilson wasn't moving at his usual speed, and it remains to be seen when he'll be 100 percent, given that he'll be taking crushing hits every week. That's a major issue. The Seahawks desperately need Wilson to scramble because their offensive line is so bad, but Wilson can't do that right now because his mobility is so limited.    Wilson isn't the only offensive player who happens to be banged up; "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson was yet another Seahawk who put together a strong performance. Wilson finally looks to be back after an injury-plagued start to the 2016 season. In the contest, Wilson went 18-of-31 for 272 yards and a touchdown. He displayed excellent downfield accuracy, tossing numerous perfect deep balls. On 1 in particular, he lofted the ball to Tyler Lockett for what was nearly a touchdown. Wilson hit the speedster in stride, but Lockett went out of bounds at the 3-yard line. Wilson was also able to have an impact in terms of scrambling around. His mobility has returned as his ankle has gotten healthier, and that was on display today. He ran the ball 5 times for 23 yards, but he was also able to move around the pocket, avoid sacks, and complete passes downfield. On a trick play, he caught a 15-yard pass from Doug Baldwin went for a touchdown. Overall, this was a great day for Wilson, and he is certainly returning to his peak performance level.    Because of the improved play of Wilson, Seattle's receivers were able to find some success. Doug Baldwin (4-104) was the top target of the quarterback during the game. He was constantly getting open downfield, and he was able to get some serious yards after the catch as well. On 1 short completion, Baldwin managed to turn upfield and avoid tacklers to get a big gain. He should be a low-end WR1 so long as Wilson is healthy.    Jimmy Graham (3-46, 1 TD) was Wilson's second-favorite target. Graham put together yet another solid performance, and he continues to defy the odds coming off of a devastating knee injury. His touchdown was a highly impressive play, as he caught the ball and used his physicality to push the defender away as he brought it in. Graham then scampered to the end zone for the 35-yard touchdown. He is 1 of the top-five tight ends in fantasy right now.    Elsewhere, Tyler Lockett (2-39) looks to be at full speed again. He had just 2 catches, but he had some opportunities that were wiped out by penalties. He will be a factor down the stretch and is worth picking up if he is available in your league.    Defensively, Bobby Wagner once again stood out. Arguably the best linebacker in the league, Wagner had 15 total tackles on the day and was constantly making plays in the backfield. He recorded a sack and 2 tackles for a loss. He is probably the most important player on the Seahawks' defense.    The Eagles have to be disappointed in the result of this contest. They were hanging with the Seahawks early, but they absolutely fell apart as the game went on. Part of that can be blamed on the inexperience of Carson Wentz. Wentz had a tough day, going 23-of-45 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He simply did not have it. Early on, he made some sharp throws against the Seahawks' defense, but eventually the talent of their secondary caught up with him. Wentz had some issues with staring down receivers, and that helped to lead to 1 of the picks by Kam Chancellor. Wentz telegraphed his throw and allowed the roaming safety to come across and grab the pass. That seemed to shake Wentz's confidence, and from there, he had more problems. Still, Wentz was not altogether terrible. He had a below-average game against a tough defense. The contest will be a learning experience for the rookie, and it will be interesting to see if he improves following this contest.    Part of Wentz's issues stemmed from issues with Philadelphia's receiving corps. At 1 point, the receivers had 15 receiving yards, which was the same amount as Russell Wilson. Nelson Agholor was guilty of some brutal drops, as always. By the end of the game, "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson era, so it's no surprise that Wilson had his worst NFL start ever. He threw a career-high 5 interceptions, though most of those weren't his fault. The first occurred because his receiver fell down. The second 1 was on him, as Wilson launched a pass that hung up in the air forever. It would've been a good punt, but it was a bad pass instead. Wilson's third interception was questionable, as the Packers easily could've been flagged for pass interference on the play. The next 2 picks were via tipped or dropped passes. Wilson, as it turns out, was really only responsible for 1 pick (2 at most). That won't make his fantasy owners feel better though, as Wilson went 22-of-30 for 240 yards, 1 touchdown and the 5 interceptions. He was hurt by tons of drops, so don't feel too discouraged if you own Wilson and somehow survived with him (or if you were on a bye.)    "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson had about as good a game as he possibly could have. His offensive line played very poorly for a majority of the contest, and the unit constantly allowed pressure on the quarterback. The Packers were only able to total 3 sacks, but part of that was due to Wilson's mobility. If you were to replace Wilson with a non-mobile quarterback, there may have been twice as many sacks. Despite the lack of protection, Wilson was able to make some great throws. In the 2-minute drill at the end of the second half, Wilson found "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson!    The final score of this game is deceiving. While the scoreboard says it was a 1.score contest, the Titans led by 2 scores for most of the second half. The Seahawks had a chance at a late comeback, but that was more a result of the Titans playing prevent defense on Seattle's last offensive possession of the game where the Seahawks cut the deficit to 6. The Titans looked good for the entirety of this game, but they really turned things on in the second half. In the third quarter, they scored 21 points, which really helped to put the contest out of reach. All of this was thanks to the performance of their offense, especially their rushing attack. While it was widely expected that Derrick Henry would shoulder the load for the Titans' ground game, that was not the case. DeMarco Murray continued to lead the backfield and showed no signs of the hamstring injury that had made him questionable in the leadup to the contest. Overall, Murray totaled 115 yards on 14 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run that saw him follow his blockers perfectly and cut into open space all across the field. He is a low-end RB1 right now, though Henry could take some opportunities away from him in the future. Speaking of Henry, he started the game poorly, and at 1 point, had 4 carries for minus-6 yards. By the end of the day, Henry had racked up 54 yards on 13 carries, and he looked good in the second half. Henry has RB1 potential for the future, but that won't happen this year unless Murray misses time.    Tennessee's offensive line also deserves credit for this performance. The team's line is 1 of the top units in the league and will continue to provide quality blocking for Mariota and the backs all season, provided that the linemen can stay healthy. Speaking of Mariota, he had an impressive performance against a stout Seattle defense. Early on, Mariota was under pressure, but he was able to scramble away from sacks and make plays outside the pocket. He used his mobility to his advantage, and that helped to take away the effectiveness of the Seahawks' defensive line, which is their strongest part of the defensive unit. Mariota was very accurate per usual, and he was able to spread the ball around and find the open man. Overall, Mariota went 20-of-32 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he helped the Titans to control the game. Mariota has a great grasp of the offense, and his ability to analyze defenses and find effective matchups will be a major weapon for the Titans.    With Corey Davis out, Mariota focus on targeting Rishard Matthews (6-87, 1 TD) for a majority of the day. Matthews was solid for most of the game, but a good chunk of his yardage came on a 55-yard screen-pass touchdown. On the play, Matthews was able to follow his blockers and made a man miss to get the score. Matthews is a WR3 in fantasy, but he could put up WR2 numbers if Davis continues to miss time. Mariota's other touchdown went to Jonnu Smith (1-24), who went uncovered on a play where he slipped out of the backfield as a fullback. Eric Decker (4-49) was impactful in the first half, while Delanie Walker (4-31) had a decent day. Both are capable of more, but since Mariota likes to spread the ball around, their productions can fluctuate.    For the Seahawks, their offense actually looked very good during the contest. They were led by a strong passing attack that saw Russell Wilson post his best stat line of the season. Wilson ended up going 29-of-49 for 373 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. The stat line is a bit deceiving, as some of his yardage came with his team down by multiple scores late. But still, it was significantly better than the initial 2 starts for Wilson. Wilson finally had decent protection from his offensive line and wasn't forced to throw the ball away too much. He was sacked once during the contest, and that was a major improvement for Seattle. Throughout the game, when Wilson had time, he was able to find the open receiver wherever they were on the field. Wilson's accuracy and ball placement were superb, and he definitely is not the 1 to blame for the team's loss.    Wilson's top receivers on Sunday were "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson caught fire, while the offensive line blasted open big running lanes for the running backs. Tony Dungy described it as an avalanche, and that's exactly what it felt like.    Wilson misfired on just 5 occasions, going 21-of-26 for 295 yards, 2 passing touchdowns and a pair of interceptions to go along with 4 scrambles for 38 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Wilson had major issues with pressure in the opening half, and this resulted in an early safety. This wasn't as much of an issue in the second half, as the Colts' front 7 seemingly ran out of gas. Neither of the interceptions were really fully Wilson's fault, by the way. The first was just an amazing play by safety "

   "comment":"Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson were incredible, as they made 1 great pass after another. However, ball security for Seattle ended up giving the Seahawks enough of an edge to avoid the road upset from Houston.    On the first drive of the game, Watson laid out a perfect bomb for Will Fuller, who burned Shaquil Griffin and Earl Thomas for a 59-yard touchdown. Quickly, Houston got the ball back and DeAndre Hopkins beat Richard Sherman for a 27-yard reception to get inside the 30, but Watson made an ill-advised pass that was jumped by Thomas for an interception. He raced 78 yards for a pick-six to tie the game at 7. Watson shook off the bad play and got moving with a 15-yard completion to Hopkins and then a 22-yard pass interference on Jeremy Lane, who had to grab Fuller to prevent a long touchdown. Lamar Miller ran for 12 to set up a first-and-goal and then darted into end zone from a few yards out. Seattle got moving with a Tyler Lockett snatching a 27-yard completion. Jadeveon Clowney had a third-down strip-sack on Wilson, but the ball flew forward and Seahawks tight end Luke Willson scooped up the ball at the 20 to give Seattle a lucky first down. Russell Wilson dodged Clowney and then found Paul Richardson for a 20-yard touchdown."

Excelling against the run and spying on Wilson late in the game, Brown racked up 11 tackles and a sack, and was able to hit the quarterback multiple times. Brown was all over the field, and his energy rubbed off on the rest of the defense, which did well to limit the strong Seattle offense.    On the offensive side, the Redskins can thank Kirk Cousins for the win. In the first 58 minutes of the contest, the team was barely able to do anything on offense. The run game was going nowhere, and the receivers were having trouble stepping up against the Seattle secondary. And with the Redskins down by 4 with just a couple minutes left, things looked hopeless. However, Cousins delivered with 1 of his best drives of the season. The possession only lasted 4 plays. After initially tossing an incompletion, Cousins connected on a throw to Brian Quick for 31 yards. It was a perfectly thrown ball despite the fact that he was under pressure, and that really gave the team momentum. The next play was another perfect throw to Josh Doctson, who had a step on his man. Doctson rolled to a stop at the 1-yard line. After Rob Kelley punched the ball in on the next play, that was all she wrote. Cousins was able to do this despite having 4 missing offensive line starters. He did this despite the pressure. He really delivered when it mattered. Though his final stat line may look only decent, 21-of-31 for 247 yards, he really helped to carry the Redskins to victory at the end of the day. Cousins deserves a lot of credit for this surprising win.    Cousins' top targets on Sunday were Vernon Davis (6-72) and Josh Doctson (3-59). Davis filled in admirably for Jordan Reed and showed that he still has the athletic ability that once made him a major weapon. As long as Reed is out, Davis can be started as a low-end TE1. If he is available in your league, make sure to pick him up. Meanwhile, Doctson did most of his damage on the 38-yard pass on the final drive of the game, but it's clear that he's becoming a bigger part of the team's offensive system. Doctson can be added, and in certain matchups, he can be used as a FLEX. Elsewhere in the pass game, Terrelle Pryor (2-17) disappointed again, while Brian Quick (3-49) looked good when on the field. Pryor can be dropped in all leagues, while Quick is a player to monitor given his veteran status.    As mentioned earlier, the Redskins didn't do much on the ground. Kelley got 14 carries, but only managed 18 yards, though he did score twice. Chris Thompson was more explosive, gaining 20 yards on 4 carries, but he didn't see much work in the red zone.    For the Seahawks, this was a crushing loss. They were expected to manhandle the Redskins, and they just didn't have it from the start. The only reason Seattle was able to stay competitive was due to the performance of Russell Wilson. Wilson had a superb performance considering everything that he had to deal with in this contest. For the entirety of the game, his weak offensive line allowed pressure onto him. New left tackle "
