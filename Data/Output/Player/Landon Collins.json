  "comment":"Landon Collins. Kansas City's defense bailed out the offense and got the ball back, but the Chiefs were put in a tough situation again as Smith overthrew Robinson and Jenkins intercepted the pass. Jenkins then returned the pick to the Chiefs' 23-yard line with just over 2 minutes remaining. New York hit a 26-yard field goal to go up 9-6 with 1:38 left. The Chiefs got into field-goal range with a 32-yard completion to Kelce that put them inside the New York 35-yard line. Smith threw some short passes and ran for a first down to get inside the 15, but shots at the end zone went incomplete, so Kansas City tied the game at 9 to force overtime. The Chiefs had a drive going in overtime, but ended up punting again. With less than 2 minutes remaining in the extra period, ",
