   "comment":"Griffith fumbled, leading to Detroit's next end-zone visit. On Seattle's third possession, they turned the ball over on downs, allowing Jason Hanson to kick a 41-yard field goal. Though the Seahawks carelessly fell into a 17-0 hole, they did a great job of sticking with their game plan and not panicking. Hasselbeck didn't toss another pick, finishing 39-of-51 for 329 yards and a touchdown. He easily shredded Detroit's secondary, and for the first time in weeks, he didn't have to worry about pressure because of the Lions' horrible defense. Hasselbeck was sacked only once. And by the way, congratulations to Hasselbeck, who became the all-time Seahawks leader in completions. Of course Dick Stockton was too senile at the time to talk about this; he probably thought Dave Krieg, the previous record-holder, was still under center.

While Jones was effective in the passing attack, I expected more out of him on the ground. He rushed for just 36 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts versus Detroit's porous defense.    As mentioned, Stafford tossed 5 picks. Otherwise, he was 22-of-42 for 203 yards and 2 touchdowns. Stafford made some impressive throws and led the Lions to 3 scoring drives to start the game, but he also made a dumb errors later on. Remember though that he's merely a rookie with no offensive line and was playing in a hostile Seattle environment. There's no need to panic.    An encouraging development for the Lions was the emergence of "
