  "comment":"Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, ",
