   "comment":"Ka'Deem Carey, however, led the team in rushing yardage, gaining 32 yards on 9 tries. Carey appeared to lose a fumble in the third quarter, but the officials strangely ruled that it wasn't a turnover.    The Bears remarkably weren't whistled for a single penalty in this game. That's either a positive or a negative. The former is a possibility because Chicago played with lots of discipline. However, the negative is that despite some favorable officiating, the Bears still couldn't win this game.   "

  "comment":"Ka'Deem Carey. Both running backs had half of their yardage come on their longest burst. Howard (7-22) had a gain of 11, while Carey (10-48) made a burst of 24. I wouldn't cut Howard in fantasy just yet, though the declining usage is worrisome.    The silver lining for Chicago is that Leonard Floyd was terrific. The first-round rookie put together a strong performance, as he was a nuisance for Rodgers all evening. Floyd registered 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss Phil Simms and some of the strange things he said during the telecast. Simms opened the evening by saying that the Packers, due to a lack of their running game, were going to get the ball to Aaron Rodgers. Am I missing something, or were the Packers just planning on direct snapping to their running backs? What does he mean by getting the ball to Rodgers? Doesn't Rodgers always have the ball? Perhaps even more confusing, there was this: He was trying to go across the middle and it was not a person. If anyone can decipher what the hell that possibly means, you should probably be hired by the government as someone who can decript alien languages. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
