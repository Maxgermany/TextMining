   "comment":"Ka'Deem Carey, however, led the team in rushing yardage, gaining 32 yards on 9 tries. Carey appeared to lose a fumble in the third quarter, but the officials strangely ruled that it wasn't a turnover.    The Bears remarkably weren't whistled for a single penalty in this game. That's either a positive or a negative. The former is a possibility because Chicago played with lots of discipline. However, the negative is that despite some favorable officiating, the Bears still couldn't win this game.   "

   "comment":"Ka'Deem Carey added a 16-yard run to set up a first-and-goal, but the Jaguars held Chicago to 3 points. Jacksonville got moving with passes of 25 and 29 yards to Allen Hurns to set up the Jaguars inside the Bears' 5-yard line to start the 4.h quarter. Chris Ivory soon plunged into the end zone to cut the Bears' lead to 13-7. The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A Yannick Ngakoue sack held the Bears to another field goal. The Jaguars responded with a field goal drive of their own. They then got the ball with just over 3 minutes at their own 20. After a few completions got the ball to midfield, Bortles hit backup wide receiver Arrelious Benn, who made a sliding catch. Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay. With about 2 minutes left, Hoyer got moving with a crossing completion to Meredith (11-113), but on a 4.h-and-10, Ramsey came back to break up a pass intended for Jeffery, letting the Jaguars get the ball back.    Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. Brian Hoyer was 30-of-49 for 302 yards, but Chicago really struggled in the red zone, and that ended up being the difference in this game.    Ka'Deem Carey (9-50) and Jordan Howard (15-34-1) split the workload for Chicago.    Blake Bortles was 20-of-33 for 271 yards with a score and an interception. Bortles got in a funk after his fluky interception and didn't snap out of it until late in the third quarter.    Chris Ivory (11-32-1) led the Jaguars on the ground, and "
