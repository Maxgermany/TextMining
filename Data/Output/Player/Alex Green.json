   "comment":"Green Bay 14 free points because of a trio of dumb penalties. DeVier Posey was offside on a punt, which allowed Rodgers to find Nelson for a 41-yard score on the very next play. In the third quarter, a Mason Crosby field goal was wiped off the board because of a Connor Barwin leaping penalty. Houston stopped them again, but Danieal Manning hit a Packer in the head for an unsportsmanlike penalty. Rodgers then found Nelson for another score.    Nelson had 3 of Rodgers' 6 touchdowns. He finished with 9 catches for 121 yards. Jones found the end zone twice, while Tom Crabtree had the 6.h score. Randall Cobb (7-102) had a nice performance without crossing the goal line, while Finley (2-12) sucked yet again.    Alex Green took all of the carries for the Packers until this game was out of hand. He couldn't gain 3 yards per carry (22 rushes, 65 yards), but he still ran well. He was just stymied by a tough Houston defense. It's awesome, by the way, to see A. Green in Green Bay's box score because it makes me think of the good old days when the team had Ahman Green on the roster.    "

   "comment":"Green Bay back 8 are also missing because of injuries. It seemed like they would be able to handle Blaine Gabbert because of his deficiencies, but that was hardly the case. Gabbert was sharp for 1 of the few occasions in his disappointing NFL career, going 27-of-49 for 303 yards and a touchdown. Though some of those attempts were wildly off the mark, those numbers could've been even better had his receivers not dropped several passes. This includes Mike Thomas, who let the ball slip through his hands in the end zone. Before anyone gets too excited, however, we've seen terrible quarterbacks light up poor defenses (i.e. Mark Sanchez against the Patriots). Sanchez came back with a poor showing versus the Dolphins, and it's very likely that Gabbert will regress when he battles a stop unit that isn't missing most of its starters.    Gabbert's sole touchdown was a trick play of sorts where the Jaguars ran a screen for eligible tackle Guy Whimper. The leading receiver, meanwhile, was Cecil Shorts, who had a great outing, catching 8 balls for 116 yards. Justin Blackmon was decent statistically (4-67) but made some mental mistakes on the field in terms of route running and such.    Rashad Jennings did an OK job filling in for Maurice Jones-Drew. He rushed for 59 yards on 17 carries, but was more effective in the passing game, catching 6 balls for 56 receiving yards. He lost a fumble in the red zone, however.    The Packers were lucky to win this contest. The Jaguars could have scored on the possession in which Jennings fumbled. They also had a blocked punt that was returned for a touchdown. The Packers were just so stagnant offensively and couldn't get anything going. Aaron Rodgers went 22-of-35 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jacksonville was able to muster decent pressure on him, and he just looked out of rhythm with a receiving corps missing both Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson.    Rodgers' scores went to Randall Cobb (5-28) and Donald Driver (2-10). James Jones (7-78) was the team's leading receiver, while Jermichael Finley (2-24) once again did nothing.    Speaking of nothing, Alex Green struggled to get any sort of yardage on the ground. He gained 54 yards on 22 attempts. The running back position has to be a priority for the Packers this offseason or perhaps the next couple of days before the trade deadline expires.   "

Mathias Kiwanuka recorded 2 sacks, while Osi Umenyiora, who registered a sack and a forced fumble, showed signs of life for the first time all season. Having a healthy Antrel Rolle was also a major boost. Rodgers ended up 14-of-25 for 219 yards, an early touchdown to Jordy Nelson (2-71) who beat Corey Webster for a 61-yard score, an interception and a lost fumble. Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.

   "comment":"Green Bay's reeling defense on the entire drive, but Ponder was asked to throw inside the red zone. He scrambled right and didn't have anything, yet he still threw late across his body. The Packers snagged a very easy interception. Ponder just keeps getting worse. He now has 11 interceptions to just 10 touchdowns since Week 5. He's completed better than 54.3 percent of his passes just once since Week 7. He ruined what looked like a possible record-breaking day for Peterson, who was amazing. He rushed for 210 yards and a touchdown on 21 attempts. He eclipsed the 200-yard barrier early in the 4.h quarter, so it appeared as though he could break his own single-game rushing record of 296 yards. Unfortunately, the Vikings trailed because of Ponder's ineptitude, so they couldn't give Peterson enough carries.    The only Viking to catch more than 2 passes was Kyle Rudolph (6-51, TD). Ponder really misses Percy Harvin.    Speaking of injured wideouts, Jordy Nelson suffered a hamstring injury in the first quarter of this contest. He had just 1 catch for 10 yards. Greg Jennings, coming back from his own malady, managed just 4 receptions for 46 yards.    Despite a depleted receiving corps and a shaky offensive line, Aaron Rodgers went 27-of-35 for 286 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was unbelievable on third down, converting 9-of-16 attempts. Rodgers passed a second score to James Jones (2-40), but it was called back because of a hold. Rodgers' top targets were Randall Cobb (6-62) and Jermichael Finley (6-60).    It's surprising, but the Packers actually ran the ball well. Both backs were solid against Minnesota's weak front. James Starks (15-66) scored a touchdown, while Alex Green (12-58) had the better YPC average.    Two kicking notes: For the Packers, the struggling "

   "comment":"Green Bay gave him plenty of opportunities with mistakes of its own, but Cutler simply couldn't take advantage of them, leading his team to 190 total net yards and converting a pitiful 0-of-9 on third downs. Cutler went just 12-of-21 for 135 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That means in 8 games versus the Packers, he's 127-of-237 for 1,518 yards, 8 touchdowns and a whopping 18 interceptions. That gives him a completion percentage of 53.6 and a YPA of 6.4. You can't put this all on Cutler though. It's not even close to being all of his fault. There are 2 issues with Chicago's offense, 1 of which is the offensive line. The group once again couldn't block for him, allowing 4 sacks, 1 of which came when Green Bay rushed only TWO players! Clay Matthews, notched a pair in his first game back."
