The play was inconsequential - the call was overturned, so it wasn't even a real fumble - but this was a great effort play by the rookie quarterback, who will undoubtedly earn even more respect from his teammates.

The Bears couldn't challenge because of the NFL's stupid, new touchdown-replay rule.   "
