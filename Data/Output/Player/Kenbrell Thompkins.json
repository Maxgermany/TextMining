   "comment":"Thompkins in the end zone that fell incomplete. Of course, this is to be expected, given that Brady lost Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez and Wes Welker because of various reasons. But Buffalo not having Stephon Gilmore and Jairus Byrd should have offset that. That's exactly why Patriot fans should be incredibly concerned. Gronkowski may return in Week 3 or 4, but he may not be 100 percent. He's also at risk for further injury because he's not in playing shape.    Speaking of Patriots who are sure to get injured, Danny Amendola battled a groin injury the entire afternoon. He was wincing in pain throughout the entire contest. He still managed to haul in 10 grabs for 104 yards, but his durability is a major concern.    As for Brady's other weapons, Julian Edelman caught both touchdowns. His line of 7 catches for 79 yards will almost definitely be his best of the season, but he's worth picking up in fantasy leagues because it's not like Brady has many other options. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-42) struggled, as he screwed up 1 play in the red zone in which he ran into Edelman.    "

   "comment":"Thompkins (2-47) was bad - he ran a wrong route in the end zone during the second quarter and then dropped a touchdown just prior to halftime - but Aaron Dobson looked like the worst receiver in NFL history. I'm not exaggerating at all. Dobson caught 3 balls for 56 yards and a touchdown, but that's a very deceiving stat line. He dropped at least 5 passes. There was 1 occasion in which he wasn't even looking back for the football. He glanced at Tom Brady at the very last second, which caused a key drop. Dobson continuously screwed up, but Brady inexplicably kept going back to him. I didn't understand the logic behind that. Stevan Ridley was benched for 1 fumble last week, so why wasn't Dobson taken out of the game after his third, 4.h or fifth drop? With Dobson and Thompkins playing so poorly, Brady seemed so out of sync. He spent the entire first half yelling at his teammates, but he just seemed defeated after intermission. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes for the first time in a game since Week 15, 2009, going 19-of-39 for 185 yards and a touchdown. The score came on the first drive of the contest - an 81-yard possession. The Patriots mustered just 151 yards the rest of the way, compared to 318 for the Jets. They were just 4-of-18 on third down and managed just moved the chains 9 times in this entire contest. The Patriots will be better eventually, but they'll need Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola back. And who knows when they'll be available? In the meantime, all Brady will have to work with is Edelman (13-78), who was the lone bright spot for New England's offense - and even he wasn't flawless; he appeared to lose a fumble, but the call was reversed. I'm not sure what Bill Belichick can do in the short term. I joked on Twitter (): #Patriots should play "

The Patriots had the ball on the 1-inch line early in the 4.h quarter. I feel like Brady would've sneaked it in previous years, but New England went with a LeGarrette Blount run (he was stuffed), an inexplicable pass to left tackle-eligible Nate Solder and toss to Julian Edelman, who dropped the ball (albeit Jones made another good play). The Patriots probably would've scored on a Brady sneak attempt (or 2), so the thought process didn't make much sense. Brady finished 18-of-38 for 197 yards and the aforementioned pick. This game marked the first time in 52 occasions that Brady failed to fire a touchdown. This result was surprising because Cincinnati was missing a couple of defensive starters, while Danny Amendola returned to the lineup for the first time since Week 1. Amendola led the team with 55 receiving yards off 4 receptions. He nearly scored a touchdown, but rolled to the 1-inch line to begin that aforementioned dubious sequence.

   "comment":"Thompkins. Brady had his ups and downs in this performance. In terms of positives, Brady led that game-winning drive and also engineered many other scoring possessions. He was mostly responsible for picking up 26 first downs. Despite suffering through several drops, many of which were from Aaron Dobson (6-63), Brady went 25-of-43 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The negatives include that pick, which was an extremely careless throw into double coverage, as well as a poor overthrow of Danny Amendola for what should've been an 83-yard touchdown. Amendola beat safety Kenny Vaccaro, but Brady didn't put enough air under the ball. It is worth noting that Brady probable could've enjoyed a much better day if 2 things had happened: First, if Stevan Ridley (20-96) hadn't run into the end zone twice, and second, if the offensive line held up better. Brady was sacked 5 times, thanks in part to guard Dan Connolly going down with an injury. Something else that needs to be noted was some questionable play-calling on the Patriots' part. New England had the ball at the New Orleans 9-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but ran it 3 straight times and had to settle for a field goal as a consequence.    Meanwhile, the New England defense did a hell of a job on the Saints' scoring attack. I didn't think anything could be done to stop Jimmy Graham, but Bill Belichick, who specializes in shutting down 1 aspect of the opposing offense, has Aqib Talib blanket the All-Pro tight end. Graham, who was limited to no catches - he had 1 drop, which was really a great play by Kyle Arrington - was helped into the locker room with a leg injury in the second half. Drew Brees looked a bit flustered without being able to go to Graham very much. After all, when do you see his team have 3 3.and-outs in a single half? When does Griffin miss a wide-open receiver (Nick Toon) for a touchdown? Would anyone have ever imagined Brees completing fewer than half of his passes? All of that happened, as Brees went 17-of-36 for 236 yards, 2 scores and an interception that was a weird lob after he tried calling timeout but was not granted the stoppage. Brees had some great throws - including a 34-yard touchdown strike to Kenny Stills (3-64) on a third-and-20.    Brees' other aerial score was vultured by Travaris Cadet. Marques Colston surprisingly was limited to just 1 reception for 11 yards.    The Saints ran the ball well, which wasn't a surprise because Vince Wilfork's absence continues to be huge. Pierre Thomas gained 51 yards on 11 carries, but the big star was Khiry Robinson, who tallied 53 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries.    Moving back to New England, the team suffered a quartet of injuries. In addition to Connolly, Aqib Talib, Jerod Mayo and Danny Amendola all had to leave the game. Amendola's malady was a concussion, as safety Rafael Bush hit him fiercely, prompting his helmet to hit the turf. Amendola actually didn't do anything anyway; he caught 2 passes, but didn't gain a single yard. Julian Edelman (5-57) was much better, as was Thompkins (3-45), who caught the game-winning score.   "

He had a clutch 51-yard completion to Andre Holmes on a third-and-22 in the second half. Speaking of pick-sixes, Matt Schaub entered the game briefly in the second half when Carr hurt his ankle. The crowd booed him, and the Raiders had to take a timeout because they couldn't line up properly. Carr was able to reenter the game after the stoppage. Instead of an inevitable pick-six - Schaub seemed poised to throw 1 - the Raiders were able to preserve the field goal.    Oakland's leading receiver was Thompkins, who caught 5 balls for 90 yards. Only 2 other Raiders had 3 or more receptions: Holmes (3-73), who made a great, leaping catch over a defender, and Murray (3-22). "
