   "comment":"Kenbrell Thompkins in the end zone that fell incomplete. Of course, this is to be expected, given that Brady lost Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez and Wes Welker because of various reasons. But Buffalo not having Stephon Gilmore and Jairus Byrd should have offset that. That's exactly why Patriot fans should be incredibly concerned. Gronkowski may return in Week 3 or 4, but he may not be 100 percent. He's also at risk for further injury because he's not in playing shape.    Speaking of Patriots who are sure to get injured, Danny Amendola battled a groin injury the entire afternoon. He was wincing in pain throughout the entire contest. He still managed to haul in 10 grabs for 104 yards, but his durability is a major concern.    As for Brady's other weapons, Julian Edelman caught both touchdowns. His line of 7 catches for 79 yards will almost definitely be his best of the season, but he's worth picking up in fantasy leagues because it's not like Brady has many other options. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-42) struggled, as he screwed up 1 play in the red zone in which he ran into Edelman.    "

  "comment":"Kenbrell Thompkins, who was wide open downfield; and he was strip-sacked, which the Patriots returned for a touchdown to keep them in the game - but I would say that the positives far outweighed the negatives. Fitzpatrick went 26-of-41 for 296 yards and 3 touchdowns. He could've accumulated more yardage, but ",
