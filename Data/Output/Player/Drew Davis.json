The Falcons' biggest concern was pass protection. The Cardinals brought Ryan down on 4 occasions, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Ryan was constantly under pressure, and he actually looked very skittish in the pocket. As a result, he went 34-of-61 for 301 yards, 1 late touchdown and 4 interceptions. Three of the picks were ugly. Ryan didn't see stud inside linebacker "
