   "comment":"Tom Johnson and Everson Griffin (1.5) combined for 7 sacks. The day's total was the most sacks that Stafford had ever taken in a single game.    Detroit's leading rusher was Ameer Abdullah, who totaled 43 yards on 8 carries.    Eric Ebron led the Lions with 5 catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. Calvin Johnson had 86 yards on a handful of receptions with a score.    On the bright side for Detroit, young defensive tackle Caraun Reid had a superb game with 6 tackles, 1 sack and 4 for a loss. He was overwhelming the interior of the Vikings' offensive line. Ziggy Ansah, Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown."
