The ball was tipped into Alonso's arms.    Flacco's scores went to Torrey Smith and Brown. Smith had a huge game, especially when cornerback Aaron Williams exited with an injury, tallying 5 catches for 166 yards. Marlon Brown (4-34, TD) had a solid first half, but a thigh strain slowed him down after intermission.    It's hard to believe, but the Ravens ran the ball only 9 times. "

   "comment":"Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and Charles Clay (3-19). The former isn't worth rostering in 12-team leagues. Clay is an OK tight end, but you can usually do better.    LeSean McCoy had a decent outing overall, but it was disappointing after what DeAngelo Williams did to New England's stop unit in the season opener. McCoy gained 89 yards on 15 carries and caught all 3 of his targets for 27 receiving yards. McCoy had a great opening drive, but did nothing afterward, as the "
