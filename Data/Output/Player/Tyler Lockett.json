   "comment":"Lockett to score on the return. The Rams would go on to establish the lead, but the Seahawks eventually reclaimed it via a strip-sack returned for a touchdown by Cary Williams. With a 7-point advantage and just 4:39 remaining in regulation, it appeared almost guaranteed that Seattle would come away with a win. After all, the defense would just have to keep Nick Foles and his underwhelming supporting cast out of the end zone for less than 5 minutes. Well, it took less than 4. The Rams marched down the field on an 84-yard touchdown drive to tie the game, thanks to a 37-yard scored by Lance Kendricks, who beat Dion Bailey. Of course, Bailey is the player replacing holdout Kam Chancellor, who was the only Seahawk who won on that tying score. The other members of the Legion of Boom struggled in overtime, as Foles dropped a ball beautifully in between Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas. That set up a field goal, and Lynch was stuffed on the ensuing drive.    The big story within the game was the poor play of Seattle's offensive line. It simply couldn't pass protect for Russell Wilson, who took 6 sacks - a massive number for a player of his mobility. Wilson would often be under duress right after the ball got to his hands, which obviously disrupted so many drives. It's clearer than ever that the Seahawks miss Max Unger. The player they acquired for Unger, Jimmy Graham, logged 6 catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. Wilson overthrew Graham on 1 occasion, but the big tight end came back to haul in a score on the same drive.    As for Wilson, he went 32-of-41 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception to go along with 8 scrambles and 31 rushing yards. The completion percentage is legit, as Wilson definitely didn't struggle to throw, though his pick was a dumb attempt under pressure. It was the pass protection that betrayed him. Granted, the Rams have an elite defensive line, but this is going to be a theme all year.    Lynch struggled to run for the most part, save for a few attempts. He opened the game by carrying half-a-dozen Rams for 10 yards, prompting the crowd to boo. Lynch also had a 24-yard burst later in the contest, but he was otherwise bottled up. He managed 73 yards on 18 tries, though he helped out in the passing game, notching 5 catches for 31 receiving yards. He'll definitely have better games against weaker fronts.    The only Seahawk who rated higher in receiving than Graham was Jermaine Kearse (8-76). Don't get too excited, however, as a different wideout is expected to lead the Seahawks in yardage each week. Speaking of, Lockett (4-34) caught all the targets thrown to him, 3 of which came in the opening half. "

Graham exploded last week, but it appears as though that was a fluke. Wilson has to move around too much, so he doesn't have the time to find his athletic tight end.    As for the 49ers, they had yet another dreadful performance. They kept it close against the Giants and upset the Ravens, but those were 2 injured/bad teams. The Seahawks were far superior, so the 49ers had no chance with their depleted roster. They are, without a doubt, 1 of the worst squads in the NFL, and quite frankly, the organization deserves this after running Jim Harbaugh out of town. Getting rid of a top-3 NFL coach and replacing him with someone who looks like a pizza delivery guy is not a good idea, as it turns out. Jim Tomsula is utterly clueless, as highlighted by this exchange with Tracy Wolfson right before halftime: Wolfson: Coach, how do you find a rhythm in the second half? Tomsula: We gotta find a rhythm. My girlfriend, who doesn't know much about football, even laughed at this. Tomsula is a man with no answers, and he doesn't have the personnel to even find any.    "

Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a fourth score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game.

   "comment":"Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a fourth score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than "

   "comment":"Lockett snatching a 27-yard completion. Jadeveon Clowney had a third-down strip-sack on Wilson, but the ball flew forward and Seahawks tight end Luke Willson scooped up the ball at the 20 to give Seattle a lucky first down. Russell Wilson dodged Clowney and then found Paul Richardson for a 20-yard touchdown. That tied it at 14 to end the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, the Texans took the lead. Watson ran for 18 yards, and Houston made a fourth-down conversion with Miller. The Texans then picked on Sherman, with Hopkins getting him for 24 yards, and then Fuller getting open in the front of end zone for a 20-yard touchdown with Sherman getting turned around by the speedy receiver. The Seahawks came right back with Wilson hitting Tanner McEvoy for 53 yards to the Texans' 7-yard line. The next play saw Wilson roll out and hit Richardson for a short touchdown to tie the game at 21 at halftime. In the third quarter, Houston produced a field-goal drive. The Seahawks then got a 66-yard gain after Houston had busted coverage to let fullback Tre Madden get wide open. A 9-yard gain to Jimmy Graham moved the ball inside the 5-yard line, but Thomas Rawls dropped a touchdown, so Seattle settled for a tying field goal. Watson then had a critical mistake as he was pressured and threw off the mark, leaving Richard Sherman to pick him off deep in Houston territory. Seattle took the lead with a field goal to go up 27-24. The Texans came back with Watson hitting Hopkins for 34 yards and then Fuller for 36 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson made a phenomenal play to break a sack and throw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Miller. That put Houston up 31-27 with 9 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Wilson came right back, hitting Lockett for 55 yards to the Houston 20. The drive ended with Jimmy Graham getting wide open for a 1-yard touchdown. That put Seattle up 34-31 with 5 and half minutes remaining. The Texans caught Seattle in a great play call with a screen to Hopkins, and he exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. That gave the Texans a 38-34 with 4:49 remaining. Wilson quickly moved the ball across the midfield with a few completions and a 21-yard scramble to put Seattle inside the 30. Houston's defense finally came up with a big play, as cornerback "
