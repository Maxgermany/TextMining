   "comment":"Tyler Lockett, who caught all 5 targets thrown to him for 79 yards, including a 43-yard bomb for a touchdown. Meanwhile, Graham disappointed, hauling in just 2 of his 5 targets for 31 yards. Graham exploded last week, but it appears as though that was a fluke. Wilson has to move around too much, so he doesn't have the time to find his athletic tight end.    As for the 49ers, they had yet another dreadful performance. They kept it close against the Giants and upset the Ravens, but those were 2 injured/bad teams. The Seahawks were far superior, so the 49ers had no chance with their depleted roster. They are, without a doubt, 1 of the worst squads in the NFL, and quite frankly, the organization deserves this after running Jim Harbaugh out of town. Getting rid of a top-three NFL coach and replacing him with someone who looks like a pizza delivery guy is not a good idea, as it turns out. Jim Tomsula is utterly clueless, as highlighted by this exchange with Tracy Wolfson right before halftime: Wolfson: Coach, how do you find a rhythm in the second half? Tomsula: We gotta find a rhythm. My girlfriend, who doesn't know much about football, even laughed at this. Tomsula is a man with no answers, and he doesn't have the personnel to even find any.    "

His receivers made a few bad drops, but Palmer and this team as a group were not prepared for the intensity the Seahawks brought.    Besides Wilson's accuracy and poise, Tyler Lockett was a 1.man wrecking crew as a punt returner, reeling off returns of 66, 49 and 42 yards and finishing with a franchise record 139 punt-return yards in a single game.

Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game.

   "comment":"Tyler Lockett for what was nearly a touchdown. Wilson hit the speedster in stride, but Lockett went out of bounds at the 3-yard line. Wilson was also able to have an impact in terms of scrambling around. His mobility has returned as his ankle has gotten healthier, and that was on display today. He ran the ball 5 times for 23 yards, but he was also able to move around the pocket, avoid sacks, and complete passes downfield. On a trick play, he caught a 15-yard pass from Doug Baldwin went for a touchdown. Overall, this was a great day for Wilson, and he is certainly returning to his peak performance level.    Because of the improved play of Wilson, Seattle's receivers were able to find some success. Doug Baldwin (4-104) was the top target of the quarterback during the game. He was constantly getting open downfield, and he was able to get some serious yards after the catch as well. On 1 short completion, Baldwin managed to turn upfield and avoid tacklers to get a big gain. He should be a low-end WR1 so long as Wilson is healthy.    Jimmy Graham (3-46, 1 TD) was Wilson's second-favorite target. Graham put together yet another solid performance, and he continues to defy the odds coming off of a devastating knee injury. His touchdown was a highly impressive play, as he caught the ball and used his physicality to push the defender away as he brought it in. Graham then scampered to the end zone for the 35-yard touchdown. He is 1 of the top-five tight ends in fantasy right now.    Elsewhere, Tyler Lockett (2-39) looks to be at full speed again. He had just 2 catches, but he had some opportunities that were wiped out by penalties. He will be a factor down the stretch and is worth picking up if he is available in your league.
