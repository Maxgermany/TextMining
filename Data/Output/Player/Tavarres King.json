   "comment":"King twice for a couple of potential scores. Manning finished 20-of-36 for 220 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 in garbage time) and an interception. Manning played poorly, though he wasn't helped with numerous drops. That said, it was irresponsible of the Giants not to dress rookie quarterback Davis Webb. The 4.h quarter would've been a perfect opportunity to give Webb a look, but Geno Smith attempted a couple of passes instead.    Sterling Shepard led the Giants with 5 catches for 70 yards. However, he didn't have a solid performance, as he dropped a couple of passes. Most of his yardage came in garbage time. Elsewhere, Evan Engram (4-70) and King (3-33) both caught touchdowns. Engram's score came in meaningless action, but I'm sure his fantasy owners won't complain.    "
