   "comment":"Larsen was in the starting lineup as a fullback and the middle linebacker. Larsen also played special teams.    Give credit to the banged-up Broncos for winning this game. They were coming off a come-from-behind road victory at Cleveland, and it would have been understandable if they came up short against a hot Falcons squad. Even more amazing is that Denver was victorious despite being out-gained, 364-332, and losing the time of possession battle, 33:42 to 26:18.    When it came down to it, neither defense could stop the opposing offense. The difference was the interception "
