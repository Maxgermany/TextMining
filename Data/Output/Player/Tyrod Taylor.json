   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor then began screwing up, throwing an interception on a horribly inaccurate pass, allowing Malcolm Butler to come up with an impressive, diving catch, setting up yet another New England score. Taylor then took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, which was followed by a 33-yard punt. The Patriots established a 2.touchdown lead, yet the mistakes continued for the Bills. An illegal formation wiped out a 22-yard LeSean McCoy completion. A defensive hold negated a punting situation for the Patriots, which ultimately led to another New England score, thanks to a 40-yard catch by Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor made poor throws throughout, constantly missing his receivers and dumping passes at the ankles of his targets. There were numerous drops and missed tackles, and the penalty count was quite high. They committed a ridiculous 17 infractions. Seventeen! Many of them were painful, including a Taylor scramble touchdown that was nullified by 1 of the worst holding calls you'll ever see. Buffalo also had another score wiped out by a chop block. The officiating was horrendous; it was the same crooked ref from Monday night in the Colts-Jets game, except he has grown a mustache to perhaps fool everyone. I'm not saying this game was fixed, but as my picks podcast co-host Matvei texted, I wonder if you can call 12 men on the field on the Giants when the ref is on their team.    Despite all of that, Tyrod Taylor played poorly. Taylor's final numbers weren't bad - he went 28-of-42 for 274 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick, with another 2 scores negated by penalties - but most of that came in garbage time. By halftime, Taylor was 6-of-13 for only 36 yards and the interception, which was a great play by linebacker "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor got Buffalo a road win and improved the Bills to 3-2 under Rex Ryan.    Coming off a bye, the Titans had a horrendous start when Bishop Sankey fumbled the opening kickoff to the Bills inside the 5-yard line, but the NFL's most-penalized team struck again when Marcus Easley was offsides to force the Bills to re-kick. Late in the first quarter, Marcus Mariota put a field goal drive together where he converted a third down with legs and then added nice completions to Kendall Wright, Justin Hunter and Bishop Sankey. Mariota had Kendall Wright open for a deep touchdown, but threw it short, and that allowed the defense to come back for a breakup. That was the only score in the first half. In the third quarter, Denarius Moore was stripped on a punt return by Jalston Fowler, and the Titans recovered around the Bills' 40-yard line. Mariota went to work with clutch passes to Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to "

He went 15-of-22 but only threw for 111 yards during the game. Though some of that was not his fault, he was not as accurate as he could have been on some of his throws. With better protection, he may have done more, but he will need to improve regardless.    The real threat on offense for the Bills was "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor also was a major factor in the running game for the team. He toted the rock 7 times during the game, totaling 79 yards and a touchdown on the ground. While Taylor ran some designed runs, including a pretty 49-yard scamper on an option play where he beat the defense, he did a lot of damage scrambling from the pocket. The Cardinals really struggled to contain Taylor, and he moved around to make plays a lot. On his 20-yard touchdown run, Taylor was looking to pass but escaped to the outside and saw a lane to the endzone. Taylor played smart football, and his mobility was a major asset during this game. Through the air, Taylor had a solid showing as well. He went 14-of-25 for just 119 yards and 1 pick. However, Taylor was without Sammy Watkins during the game and had to make use of mediocre options for the entirety of the contest. "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor. Taylor was simply superb during the game against the Patriots. From the opening snap, Taylor just looked ready to go. He went 27-of-39 on the day for 246 yards and a touchdown. He was hyper accurate, and allowed the Bills to do a lot through the intermediate passing game. Taylor came up clutch on multiple occasions as well, throwing a bullet on a 2nd-and-20 to extend a drive. He also converted a couple of critical third downs to allow the Bills to control the game. Taylor was able to do some damage with his legs as well. He ran 5 times for 28 yards, but also used his mobility to move around the pocket. On 1 drive, Taylor scrambled out of multiple sacks before throwing the ball down the field. New England's defense looked helpless to stop him. Of course, Taylor did have some issues that he can improve upon. He overthrew a few passes, so he needs to be able to demonstrate better ball control in order to become a truly top-level quarterback. Still, his performance on Sunday was a strong 1.    One of the main beneficiaries of Taylor's performance was wide receiver "

He went 17-of-26 on the day with 179 yards and 2 passing touchdowns. Taylor was able to complete most of his short to intermediate level passes with great accuracy. He was throwing darts to his receivers that had the perfect touch on them. He could stand to improve his deep accuracy, but it has not been a major issue. Taylor also had an impact for the Bills on the ground. During the contest, he scrambled 8 times for 68 yards. He was able to make quick decisions about when to scramble, which really helped the Bills. His mobility also allowed him to scramble around the pocket and avoid San Francisco's defenders. Taylor's mobility saved him from a few sacks, and it was critical to his offense's success. In terms of receiving, Taylor once again relied on a couple of receivers to carry the load. "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor was constantly under pressure due to poor protection. Right tackle Jordan Mills looked particularly bad, and it looked like the Bills would have a lot of trouble against the Jaguars. McCoy made sure that changed in the second half. On the first play of the third quarter, he took a carry and made a jump cut to the outside. The talented runner blew by the defense and scampered into the end zone for a touchdown. From there, things got better. Buffalo's offense was run through McCoy, who ran for 103 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries. He was extremely impressive in the second half, and he helped to ice the game with a 7-yard run near the end of regulation.    In the passing game, Tyrod Taylor really had a hard time. He went 12-for-18 for 166 yards and a touchdown, but the numbers are misleading. Taylor gained 62 of those yards on 1 pass to "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor's arm and force a pick. That led to a touchdown. To end the game, he notched a strip sack of Taylor and recovered the fumble. It was a big-time play by the young pass-rusher.    For the Bills, this was an absolute abomination of a performance. They was in excellent position to pull off a massive upset, and they just fell flat. Blowing a huge lead is 1 thing, but the Bills looked absolutely terrible in the second half. One of the culprits of this was Tyrod Taylor. The second-year starter had what might have been 1 of his worst performances as a pro. He went 18-of-35 for the day with 191 yards and an interception. He did run 3 times for 30 yards and a touchdown, but he was unable to move around as much in the pocket. Taylor had serious issues getting the ball moving and really did not do much for the team. Part of the problem was the performance of the offensive line. Taylor was constantly under pressure from the Raiders' defense, and he was sacked 4 times. That is an incredibly high number for a mobile quarterback. The Bills need to do something about the right tackle position on their offensive line, as "

   "comment":"Tyrod Taylor is to be blamed for this. The third-year starter did not look good at all in Cincinnati, and it's clear that the Bills will need an upgrade over him if they want to be a legitimate contender. Taylor spent most of the day throwing from the pocket, and he just didn't look comfortable in there. Taylor held the ball for far too long, and as a result, he was sacked 6 times. The worst part was that Taylor continued to hold onto the ball despite being sacked. He didn't make the necessary adjustment to get the ball out quicker and give the Bills' offense a chance to win. When Taylor was able to get the ball out, his passes were erratic. This game was played in torrential rain at times, so perhaps that bothered him. But Taylor was inconsistent with his accuracy. He consistently overshot receivers downfield and underthrew his checkdowns. It wasn't all bad for Taylor, who had a beautiful touchdown pass to "

The Raiders, like the Bills, were missing multiple starters in the secondary, and Taylor took advantage of it. Taylor misfired just 7 times, going 20-of-27 for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The passing yardage number isn't an impressive figure, but because the Bills had the lead for most of the afternoon, Taylor didn't have to force anything downfield.

Taylor never had a chance to find his receivers consistently downfield, so it wouldn't have even mattered had Kelvin Benjamin been playing.    Taylor finished 29-of-40 for 285 yards and 2 passing touchdowns to go along with 6 scrambles for 35 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Stats can be misleading, however, and that's certainly the case in this situation. Taylor didn't play poorly, or anything; outside of a couple of dropped interceptions and a lost fumble late in the game, he did what he could. However, he just didn't have much of an opportunity to accomplish anything because of all the pressure he saw. Two of his touchdowns as well as a chunk of his yardage came in garbage time when the Jets were up 34-7.    What's truly amazing about this result is what "
