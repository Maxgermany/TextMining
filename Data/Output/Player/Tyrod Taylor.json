   "comment":"Taylor made poor throws throughout, constantly missing his receivers and dumping passes at the ankles of his targets. There were numerous drops and missed tackles, and the penalty count was quite high. They committed a ridiculous 17 infractions. Seventeen! Many of them were painful, including a Taylor scramble touchdown that was nullified by 1 of the worst holding calls you'll ever see. Buffalo also had another score wiped out by a chop block. The officiating was horrendous; it was the same crooked ref from Monday night in the Colts-Jets game, except he has grown a mustache to perhaps fool everyone. I'm not saying this game was fixed, but as my picks podcast co-host Matvei texted, I wonder if you can call 12 men on the field on the Giants when the ref is on their team.    Despite all of that, Tyrod Taylor played poorly. Taylor's final numbers weren't bad - he went 28-of-42 for 274 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick, with another 2 scores negated by penalties - but most of that came in garbage time. By halftime, Taylor was 6-of-13 for only 36 yards and the interception, which was a great play by linebacker "

   "comment":"Taylor got Buffalo a road win and improved the Bills to 3-2 under Rex Ryan.    Coming off a bye, the Titans had a horrendous start when Bishop Sankey fumbled the opening kickoff to the Bills inside the 5-yard line, but the NFL's most-penalized team struck again when Marcus Easley was offsides to force the Bills to re-kick. Late in the first quarter, Marcus Mariota put a field goal drive together where he converted a third down with legs and then added nice completions to Kendall Wright, Justin Hunter and Bishop Sankey. Mariota had Kendall Wright open for a deep touchdown, but threw it short, and that allowed the defense to come back for a breakup. That was the only score in the first half. In the third quarter, Denarius Moore was stripped on a punt return by Jalston Fowler, and the Titans recovered around the Bills' 40-yard line. Mariota went to work with clutch passes to Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to "

   "comment":"Taylor was on fire, and the Kansas City secondary had no answer for Sammy Watkins. However, the Chiefs finally got momentum going on offense and made the appropriate adjustments on defense to outscore the Bills 23-6 in the final 32 minutes of the game. Alex Smith played terrifically. I've been 1 of his main critics over the years, but I'll give him credit when he deserves it. That's most certainly the case here, as I thought the Chiefs were screwed when they were down 9 as a result of Smith's limitations. Smith was up to his old tricks early on, throwing a typical checkdown that wasn't even far enough on a third-and-4 try. However, something happened late in the game, and the light when on for Smith, who suddenly began throwing several deep passes. He began by launching a 37-yard reception to Jeremy Maclin, who was able to reel in the ball with a diving effort. This set up a touchdown. Smith then hurled a 41-yard score to Maclin, who beat Ronald Darby deep. Smith finished 19-of-30 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also did a great job of picking up some first downs on the ground on occasion, scrambling 6 times for 35 rushing yards. This was all very impressive considering that the Chiefs lost 2 offensive linemen early on. Guard Jeff Allen, perhaps the team's best blocker, and tackle Eric Fisher both exited with injuries. At 1 point, Kansas City had absolutely no backup linemen to use, but Allen was able to return to the field.    It helped Smith that he had a great performance from Spencer Ware. It appears as though it doesn't matter who the running back is for the Chiefs. Spencer, originally behind Jamaal Charles and Charcandrick West on the depth chart, ripped off 114 yards and a touchdown on only 19 carries. Had the Chiefs led throughout, Ware could've posted much greater numbers.    Smith's 2 touchdowns went to the usual suspects, Maclin and Travis Kelce. The former snatched 9 balls for 160 yards. Kelce, who was questionable heading into this contest, had 4 catches for 69 yards. Besides those 2. the only other Kansas City player to log multiple receiving yards was Albert Wilson (3-25).    As for the Bills, I mentioned that they had lots of success early in the afternoon. The Chiefs simply couldn't handle Watkins, who torched Sean Smith relentlessly. Watkins scored twice, with 1 pass dropped in perfectly by Taylor in between 2 defenders. The other was a grab over a helpless Smith. However, Watkins didn't catch a single pass after halftime, which is remarkable considering how dominant he was early in the contest. "

   "comment":"Taylor, the running of LeSean McCoy, and the vertical plays from Sammy Watkins.    Houston's defense came out flat, and Mike Gillislee (7-41) ripped off a 30-yard run to set up a first-and-goal. Three plays later, Sammy Watkins went over Kevin Johnson for a short touchdown catch. The Texans got going with Chris Polk gashing Buffalo for 20 yards, before Hoyer converted a third down with a pass to offensive lineman Kendall Lamm, and then Jonathan Grimes ran for 18 yards on a third-and-7. The Texans ran a quick play when the Bills defense wasn't even lined up, so Hoyer threw to the flat to Ryan Griffin, who walked into the end zone from a few yards out. Nick Novak missed the extra point. Buffalo came right back as McCoy bounced a run to the outside for 32 yards. More McCoy runs moved the ball inside the 10-yard line. Taylor finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans answered as Hoyer methodically moved the ball down the field before throwing an 11-yard touchdown to Polk. Watkins soon beat Johnson again for a 53-yard bomb inside the Houston 20. On third-and-goal, "

However, those aerial numbers are misleading; he was just 3-of-8 for 27 yards in the opening half. He didn't get much help from an offensive line that was completely overmatched, but he still made some crucial errors. For instance, he overshot a wide-open Sammy Watkins downfield for what would've been an early touchdown. Taylor had numerous overthrows, and some miserable play-calling didn't help. I can't imagine how frustrated Buffalo fans were when E.J. Manuel ran a dumb Wildcat play in the third quarter, which was followed by a useless field goal that turned a 21-0 deficit into a 21-3 score.    Despite Taylor's misses, Watkins still had a big stat line, logging 5 catches for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns. All of this came in garbage time, as Watkins caught only 1 pass in the opening half.   "

   "comment":"Taylor. If Taylor was less mobile, he could have been sacked 5 or more times. Speaking of Taylor, his debut was uninspiring at the best. He went 15-of-22 but only threw for 111 yards during the game. Though some of that was not his fault, he was not as accurate as he could have been on some of his throws. With better protection, he may have done more, but he will need to improve regardless.    The real threat on offense for the Bills was "

   "comment":"Taylor hit 2 receivers for touchdowns of 84 and 71 yards, and the Bills also returned a Jalin Marshall fumble for a score in the third quarter. Erase those 3 semi-fluky instances, and the Bills would've gotten crushed. Buffalo has many issues. The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front 7. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby, both of whom are very talented, were torched mercilessly. Ryan Fitzpatrick was mostly unstoppable. If the Bills couldn't contain such a pedestrian quarterback, how are they going to deal with some of the better signal-callers in the NFL? Fitzpatrick finished 24-of-34 for 374 yards and a touchdown. This was 1 of the best performances of his career. He was so incredibly accurate, especially on third down. The Jets were 8-of-13 in those situations. Fitzpatrick is going to wilt when the weather gets cold, like he usually does, but he at least proved that he has mentally recovered from his horrific Week 17 showing from last year.    All 3 of Fitzpatrick's primary receivers caught 6 passes. Brandon Marshall led the way with 101 yards, though there was a scary instance in which he was tackled awkwardly and was taken into the locker room. He didn't miss much time, however. Meanwhile, Eric Decker and Quincy Enunwa accumulated 126 and 92 yards, respectively. Decker had a big gain nullified by a penalty, while Marshall dropped a long pass, though he did draw an interference flag on Darby. As for Enunwa, I listed him as an add in fantasy heading into Week 2, and I obviously stand by that after his performance at Buffalo. Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    Matt Forte rushed for an even 100 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was a terrific fantasy performance, but Forte accumulated those yards on 30 carries, so his 3.33 YPC isn't very impressive, though he did get stronger as the evening progress. Still, I think the Jets are making a huge mistake by giving him so many touches; turning 31 soon, Forte is going to be run into the ground soon, and I think he'll be ineffective down the stretch if this continues.    Moving back to the Bills, their offense is also problematic. Taylor, as mentioned, hit a couple of big plays, but was otherwise very mediocre. His final stat line of 18-of-30 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception is very misleading. Take away those 2 deep throws, and Taylor would've gone 16-of-28 for only 142 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and an ugly pick in which he underthrew "

   "comment":"Taylor also was a major factor in the running game for the team. He toted the rock 7 times during the game, totaling 79 yards and a touchdown on the ground. While Taylor ran some designed runs, including a pretty 49-yard scamper on an option play where he beat the defense, he did a lot of damage scrambling from the pocket. The Cardinals really struggled to contain Taylor, and he moved around to make plays a lot. On his 20-yard touchdown run, Taylor was looking to pass but escaped to the outside and saw a lane to the endzone. Taylor played smart football, and his mobility was a major asset during this game. Through the air, Taylor had a solid showing as well. He went 14-of-25 for just 119 yards and 1 pick. However, Taylor was without Sammy Watkins during the game and had to make use of mediocre options for the entirety of the contest. "

He was hyper accurate, and allowed the Bills to do a lot through the intermediate passing game. Taylor came up clutch on multiple occasions as well, throwing a bullet on a 2nd-and-20 to extend a drive. He also converted a couple of critical third downs to allow the Bills to control the game. Taylor was able to do some damage with his legs as well. He ran 5 times for 28 yards, but also used his mobility to move around the pocket. On 1 drive, Taylor scrambled out of multiple sacks before throwing the ball down the field. New England's defense looked helpless to stop him. Of course, Taylor did have some issues that he can improve upon. He overthrew a few passes, so he needs to be able to demonstrate better ball control in order to become a truly top-level quarterback. Still, his performance on Sunday was a strong 1.    One of the main beneficiaries of Taylor's performance was wide receiver "

   "comment":"Taylor was another member of the Bills' offense who played a stellar game. Taylor has been efficient since the start of the season, but today he was better than that. He went 17-of-26 on the day with 179 yards and 2 passing touchdowns. Taylor was able to complete most of his short to intermediate level passes with great accuracy. He was throwing darts to his receivers that had the perfect touch on them. He could stand to improve his deep accuracy, but it has not been a major issue. Taylor also had an impact for the Bills on the ground. During the contest, he scrambled 8 times for 68 yards. He was able to make quick decisions about when to scramble, which really helped the Bills. His mobility also allowed him to scramble around the pocket and avoid San Francisco's defenders. Taylor's mobility saved him from a few sacks, and it was critical to his offense's success. In terms of receiving, Taylor once again relied on a couple of receivers to carry the load. "

   "comment":"Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a "

From there, things got better. Buffalo's offense was run through McCoy, who ran for 103 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries. He was extremely impressive in the second half, and he helped to ice the game with a 7-yard run near the end of regulation.    In the passing game, Tyrod Taylor really had a hard time.

   "comment":"Taylor Gabriel, who couldn't separate from the cornerback. It was very evident how much Ryan missed Jones and Sanu in that sequence, and their absences ended up costing the Falcons the game.    Ryan finished 24-of-42 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had 3 give-aways in the second half. He was strip-sixed and then forced a bad interception, which Micah Hyde snatched. His second pick bounced off the hands of someone named Nick Williams, who wouldn't have been on the field had Jones and Sanu been available.    With Jones (3-30) and Sanu (1-3) barely seeing any playing time, Tevin Coleman led the Falcons in receiving with 4 grabs for 65 receiving yards, followed by Austin Hooper (5-50). Hooper paced the Falcons with 7 targets.    Coleman also led the Falcons in rushing with 79 yards on just 9 carries. Devonta Freeman had double the attempts, but mustered only 58 yards. He did find the end zone, however.    As for the Bills, I don't want to take credit away from them just because the Falcons lost after Jones and Sanu left the game. They should be praised for the victory, as they had a terrific game plan prepared for an Atlanta defense that had absolutely no answer for Charles Clay. The Bills made sure to get the ball to Clay early and often, as he had a huge mismatch versus the mediocre Atlanta linebackers. Clay had a monstrous stat line, catching 5 balls for 112 yards. His numbers would've been even better had he not dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Clay accounted for more than half of Tyrod Taylor's passing yardage. Taylor went 12-of-20 for 182 yards and a touchdown to "

   "comment":"Taylor is to be blamed for this. The third-year starter did not look good at all in Cincinnati, and it's clear that the Bills will need an upgrade over him if they want to be a legitimate contender. Taylor spent most of the day throwing from the pocket, and he just didn't look comfortable in there. Taylor held the ball for far too long, and as a result, he was sacked 6 times. The worst part was that Taylor continued to hold onto the ball despite being sacked. He didn't make the necessary adjustment to get the ball out quicker and give the Bills' offense a chance to win. When Taylor was able to get the ball out, his passes were erratic. This game was played in torrential rain at times, so perhaps that bothered him. But Taylor was inconsistent with his accuracy. He consistently overshot receivers downfield and underthrew his checkdowns. It wasn't all bad for Taylor, who had a beautiful touchdown pass to "

Taylor finished 29-of-40 for 285 yards and 2 passing touchdowns to go along with 6 scrambles for 35 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Stats can be misleading, however, and that's certainly the case in this situation. Taylor didn't play poorly, or anything; outside of a couple of dropped interceptions and a lost fumble late in the game, he did what he could. However, he just didn't have much of an opportunity to accomplish anything because of all the pressure he saw.
