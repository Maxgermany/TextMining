His final numbers were 23-of-30 for 224 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his numbers following intermission were even more impressive (17-of-20, 179 yards, 1 touchdown). The Lions sacked Wilson a few times in the early going, but as the evening progressed, they suddenly couldn't put any sort of pressure on him. Wilson, as a result, didn't have to scramble at all. In fact, Wilson's only rushing stats were 3 kneel-downs. Wilson was helped by some outstanding catches by his teammates. "
