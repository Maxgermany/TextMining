   "comment":"Iloka. That clinched the game for Cincinnati.    Bortles completed 22-of-33 passes for 247 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He really should have thrown 3 or 4 interceptions and has to improve his decision-making.    Dalton completed 19-of-31 passes for 233 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also had bouts where he was careless with the football.    The real star of the game was Hill, as he ripped off 154 yards on 24 carries with 2 touchdowns in his first NFL start. With Hill running that well, Cincinnati may decide to hold out Gio Bernard (hip) again on Thursday night.    Defensively, Iloka played well for the Bengals. Dunlap got steady pressure on Bortles, while "
