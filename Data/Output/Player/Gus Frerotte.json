   "comment":"Gus Frerotte threw twice to Tahi on the opening possession. Fahi fumbled on his second reception. What the hell is Brad Childress doing? If you have Adrian Peterson, Chester Taylor, Bernard Berrian and Sidney Rice, why in the world are you calling plays for some sort of Japanese sushi dish?    It shouldn't be surprising that after Childress' genius plan blew up in his face, Tahi didn't catch a single pass the rest of the game. Bernard Berrian led the squad in yardage with 78, while Bobby Wade had the reception lead with 7 (75 yards). Gus Frerotte was 25-of-43 for 266 yards and an interception. That pick occurred late in the game and deep in Tennessee territory. I wouldn't put that on Frerotte; he was just trying to make a play in an unlikely comeback.    Adrian Peterson scored both of Minnesota's touchdowns. He had 80 yards on just 18 carries. Chester Taylor touched the ball only 1 time.    Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Gus Frerotte tossed picks up 7-0 in the first quarter, 14-7 at the end of the second quarter and 21-10 in the third quarter. All 3 interceptions led to Green Bay scores. One was returned for a touchdown. With that in mind, it's remarkable the Vikings were able to win this game. The team should buy its running backs a new car or something. "

   "comment":"Gus Frerotte pass, which predictably fell incomplete. Luckily, Tampa Bay subsequently fumbled on Minnesota's 28.    One can only wonder why Clueless called just 19 running plays for Adrian Peterson. It's not like the Buccaneers had much luck stopping him; he gained 85 yards on 19 carries. Peterson didn't even register a single carry in the 4.h quarter despite the fact that Minnesota trailed by just 1 score.    As a comparison, Gus Frerotte threw the ball 20 times. He completed 14 passes, totaling 138 yards and a score. No 1 on the Vikings caught more than 3 passes ("

   "comment":"Gus Frerotte made only 1 mistake, which wasn't enough to cost the Vikings the game. Frerotte went 12-of-20 for 120 yards. His pick came when Minnesota was up 17-10. I have no idea why, but Frerotte just loves tossing careless picks when his team has the lead.    Speaking of interceptions, Garrard had 2 of them. He compiled 317 yards and a touchdown, but his mistakes were too much for the Jaguars to overcome.    "
