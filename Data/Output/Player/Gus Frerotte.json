   "comment":"Frerotte threw twice to Tahi on the opening possession. Fahi fumbled on his second reception. What the hell is Brad Childress doing? If you have Adrian Peterson, Chester Taylor, Bernard Berrian and Sidney Rice, why in the world are you calling plays for some sort of Japanese sushi dish?    It shouldn't be surprising that after Childress' genius plan blew up in his face, Tahi didn't catch a single pass the rest of the game. Bernard Berrian led the squad in yardage with 78, while Bobby Wade had the reception lead with 7 (75 yards). Gus Frerotte was 25-of-43 for 266 yards and an interception. That pick occurred late in the game and deep in Tennessee territory. I wouldn't put that on Frerotte; he was just trying to make a play in an unlikely comeback.    Adrian Peterson scored both of Minnesota's touchdowns. He had 80 yards on just 18 carries. Chester Taylor touched the ball only 1 time.    Meanwhile, "
