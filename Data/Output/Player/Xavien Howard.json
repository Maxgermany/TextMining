   "comment":"Xavien Howard mercilessly, and all Dalton had to do was air the ball out to his dynamic receiver. The fact that Dalton threw just 1 touchdown is a disappointment, but he'll start firing more scores when Eifert returns. As for Green, he caught 10 passes for 173 yards and a touchdown, and his stats would've been even greater had the Dolphins kept up; the Bengals took the air out of the ball in the second half, throwing just 9 times compared to 22 in the opening half. No 1 in Miami's secondary could cover Green, who caught strikes of 51 and 47 yards. Green's best catch was a diving 21-yarder. There was a scary moment in which Green began limping after taking an uncalled late hit out of bounds, but he appeared to be fine eventually.    Speaking of banged-up players, the Bengals lost guard "
