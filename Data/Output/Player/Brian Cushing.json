He started slowly, like all of the other Texans, but he ultimately finished with 109 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 20 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 32 receiving yards.    Fitzpatrick also got hot late, and the loss wasn't on him because he would've been in position to win had Johnson not coughed up the ball late in the game. Fitzpatrick misfired on just 8 attempts, going 15-of-23 for 212 yards, 1 touchdown and the lost fumble. He had to deal with lots of pressure in the pocket, as the Colts mustered 5 sacks and hit him on many other plays. Fitzpatrick's sole score went to Johnson, who had a big game outside of that 1 fateful drive. Johnson logged 7 receptions for 99 yards. Hopkins, meanwhile, never rebounded from that early drop. He managed just 1 catch for 12 yards on the evening.   "

   "comment":"Cushing blew the coverage. However, the Texans answered with a long drive, as Johnson had his way with the Jaguars' secondary. The drive finished with Johnson beating Gratz for an 8-yard touchdown to give Houston a 21-17 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Watt burned Joeckel and the left guard with a spin move to get a safety of Bortles. Bortles had to get rid of the ball, yet held on too long. Jacksonville had 1 more chance, and Bortles converted a clutch 4.h-down pass to get into Houston territory. He then took off on a 34-yard run to the Texans' 10-yard line. Houston's defense though came up with a goal-line stand to clinch the victory.    Bortles finished completing only 14-of-33 passes for 117 yards. Until the final drive, he really didn't play well. The rookie was extremely inaccurate and dreadful on third down as he didn't convert a single third down all game (0-for-11). Bortles seemed scared to push the ball downfield and got lucky as Houston's defense dropped 3 would-be interceptions. "
