   "comment":"Matt Moore struggled early, but managed to go 21-of-33 for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns, hitting numerous big throws to Steve Smith (9 catches, 157 yards, TD). Moore really heated up in the 4.h quarter. With the Vikings placing more of a focus on containing Stewart, Moore was able to finish an amazing 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. - Brett Favre just had his third straight pedestrian performance. He was absolutely terrible at Arizona and was fortunate enough that the Bengals dropped multiple interceptions last week. Favre was 17-of-27 for 224 yards and an interception at Carolina. That doesn't seem that bad, and Favre made quite a few nice plays, but overall, he's not even close to the guy we saw dominate in November. - Perhaps the most confusing aspect of this game was Minnesota's inability to establish the run against a defense that had allowed 5 consecutive opponents to rush for 139 yards or more. Adrian Peterson compiled just 35 yards and a tough touchdown on 12 carries. He saved his fantasy owners with 3 receptions for 73 more yards (including a very impressive 63-yard run of the catch), but this is the second time in 3 weeks that the Vikings haven't been able to get Peterson going. - Also for the second time in 3 weeks, Minnesota struggled to protect Favre. After taking 3 sacks at Arizona, Favre went down 4 times at Carolina. Favre was getting hit so much that Brad Childress tried to pull him from the game. However, Favre refused to come out.    Other numbers for the Vikings: Sidney Rice led the receivers with 4 catches for 69 yards. Bernard Berrian and Visanthe Shiancoe had 3 receptions each for 25 and 24 yards, respectively. Percy Harvin caught just 1 ball for 10 yards and was targeted just 3 times. Harvin barely practiced this past week because of migraines.    As for the Panthers, I'm starting to really like this Matt Moore character. He had some shaky throws early on, but as the game progressed, it appeared as though John Fox and his staff had more confidence in him. As mentioned, he was 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. More importantly, in his 3 starts, he has turned the ball over only once. Moore is the guy Jake Delhomme was supposed to be - a steady, mistake-free quarterback who can make just enough throws to give the defense and running game a chance to win. Barring a massive meltdown the next 2 weeks, Moore needs to be the starter next year; not Delhomme.   Moore struggled early, but managed to go 21-of-33 for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns, hitting numerous big throws to Steve Smith (9 catches, 157 yards, TD). Moore really heated up in the 4.h quarter. With the Vikings placing more of a focus on containing Stewart, Moore was able to finish an amazing 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. - "

DeAngelo Williams managed 62 yards on 16 attempts, while Jonathan Stewart carried the ball only 5 times for 12 yards. I don't understand why Stewart touched the ball only 5 times. The coaching staff should be embarrassed - especially considering how crappy Matt Moore was. Moore went 14-of-33 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and 2 fumbles. His first interception was particularly ugly, as he lobbed the ball into quadruple coverage in the end zone. Moore could have easily tossed a 4.h interception, but the Giants dropped it in the second quarter. Unfortunately for Moore (and perhaps fortunately for the Panthers), Moore suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. Moore's 33 attempts.

Clausen went 7-of-13 for 59 yards and a pick. Considering that he had no reps during the week, nothing should be read into this outside of the fact that the Moore experiment has to conclude immediately. He's not talented to begin with, and he's making too many dumb throws. John Fox has to start Clausen next week.    Speaking of Fox, I really can't understand what he's doing.

As you may suspect, Moore went 22-of-33 for 197 yards and a touchdown, which is pretty impressive considering that his receivers dropped 3 passes in the first quarter alone. As you may suspect, Brandon Marshall (6-61) was guilty of doing so. - I hated Denver's play-calling in overtime. The team recovered a Moore fumble at Miami's 36-yard line, but ran with Lance Ball on 3 consecutive downs to set up a Matt Prater 52-yard field goal attempt."

The run blocking was also awesome, paving the way for Reggie Bush and rookie Daniel Thomas to pile up 173 combined yards rushing on 35 carries. This was in many ways a repeat of last year's meeting in Oakland, also won by Miami (33-17) although both featured running backs, and the quarterbacks were different.    Offensively, nothing worked for the Silver and Black. Unlike last week against the Bears, they really missed their speedy skill-position players. Darren McFadden being out has taken the explosion out of the running game, and in this 1. Michael Bush was totally bottled up (10-18). In the passing game, Chaz Schilens was the only reliable target (6-89). Earlier in the season, when rookie Denarius Moore was around, along with Jacoby Ford, Schilens was an afterthought. Early on, Miami looked like it would let the visitors hang around. Their first drive featured big plays from Bush and tight end "

And then all hell broke loose. Or rather, things reverted to what people expected back in September. The Dolphins spent the rest of the first half turning the ball over. They had as many give-aways (3) as first downs. The Eagles, meanwhile, had 13 first downs, as QBDK hooked up on multiple long gains to DeSean Jackson (4-59, TD) and LeSean McCoy.    McCoy carried the ball 27 times, which will make Eagle fans happy. However, McCoy had just 38 yards (though with 2 touchdowns). He also had 3 catches for 33 receiving yards.    As for QBDK (15-of-30, 208 yards, TD, INT), it was an up-and-down afternoon. He made some great throws that Vince Young would have tossed for interceptions. On the other hand, QBDK could have easily been guilty of 3 picks. His 1 interception was horrible, as he heaved a pass across his body in the third quarter.    Moore, meanwhile, was worse. He went 11-of-19 for 95 yards, the aforementioned touchdown to Marshall, and an interception. He also lost a fumble. Moore was pulled in favor of "

It should have gone for more but Brandon Marshall dropped his second touchdown of the game. He is 1 of the league leaders in drops, and his 2 early in the game looked like they would be costly. His concentration and focus are terrible. If Marshall could get his head straight, he would be a much better receiver. Moore blew a scoring chance in the third quarter when he fumbled the ball away deep in Buffalo territory. A bit later, Marshall made up for his drops with a 65-yard touchdown on a go route.

To answer, Jets' embattled offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer emptied the playbook with a gadget play. Wide receiver Jeremy Kerley threw a pass off an end around to Dustin Keller for a gain of 41 yards. The drive ended with Sanchez tossing a 1.yard touchdown pass to Keller. New York's lack of discipline was a crippler in the first half. The team had repeated false start penalties that turned a promising drive into a field goal.

New York played New England tough in an overtime loss a week ago, but the Jets looked like a team that belongs in the top 5 of the 2013 NFL Draft. Miami's special teams earned its franchise an early lead with a fabulous first half. It was 1 of the most impressive performances you'll ever see. Special teams pulled off an onside kick, a blocked a punt for a touchdown, a blocked a field goal and a long kick return by Marcus Thigpen.  The Jets were caught completely by surprise by the onside kick after the Dolphins had a field goal drive with the heavy lifting done by Reggie Bush (14-59). Miami lost starter Ryan Tannehill to quad and knee injuries early in the following a sack by Calvin Pace. The Dolphins took a 10-0 lead after a punt was blocked by Jimmy Wilson and recovered in the end zone by Olivier Vernon.    Mark Sanchez stunk up the field. He started the game slowly and couldn't sustain drives. Sanchez was strip-sacked on a corner blitz by Nolan Carroll. The ball ping-ponged around before Paul Soliai caught it. That led to a short Daniel Thomas (15-42) touchdown plunge.  Sanchez played brutal football in the third quarter to negate any comeback attempt. Carroll dropped an interception, and a few plays later, Sanchez had a terrible overthrow that was intercepted by Chris Clemons at the goal line. The signal-caller's next throw was a dropped interception by Reshad Jones.  Sanchez threw a touchdown to Chaz Schillens (4-29) in garbage time. He completed 28-of-54 passes for 283 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Sanchez was far worse than the numbers indicate.    Shonn Greene (15-77 rushing, 2-29 receiving) didn't pick up the slack and had almost half his yardage come on a carry of 36-yards. Clyde Gates (7-82), Dustin Keller (7-67) and Jeremy Kerley (5-43) had modest contributions.    The Jets inexplicably gave Tim Tebow hardly any playing time when Sanchez was awful. That made little sense since New York needed a change to somebody who could create some plays.    Miami's defense deserves some credit for playing very well. Carroll, Shaun Smith, Cameron Wake, Karlos Dansby all had good days. The team's young safety duo of Clemons and Jones did well, too.    The Dolphins' offense didn't have a big afternoon from any 1 player, but collectively handled business. Moore was 11-of-19 for 131 yards and a touchdown. "

The Cardinals were able to come back as a result to tie the game, but Moore was clutch on the final drive. Moore completed 3 of his 5 attempts for 47 yards, setting up the decisive field goal.    Tannehill and Moore's heroics were crucial, as the Dolphins couldn't run the ball against Arizona's stalwart front. Ajayi managed just 48 yards on 20 carries, and 13 of his yards came on 1 burst. As mentioned earlier, Ajayi should've caught a touchdown, but Tannehill overshot him. Ajayi was also robbed of another score, as a scamper of his into the end zone was nullified by a hold.    Thanks to the conditions, only 2 Dolphins accumulated more than 15 receiving yards. "

Moore misfired on just 6 attempts, going 12-of-18 for 236 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Moore was lucky to get away with a dropped pick in the first half, but he ate the Jets' secondary alive, as New York sent ineffective blitzes at him, exposing its horrible defensive backfield as a result. Moore's sole interception came on an underthrown pass. Now, before anyone gets excited, it needs to be noted that Moore was battling 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL.

   "comment":"Matt Moore's chances. The opening drive for the Patriots lasted nearly 8 minutes, as Tom Brady was a perfect 6-of-6 for 41 yards and a touchdown to start the game. The Dolphins had to punt away instantly, thanks to a Ja'Wuan James false start, and this led to another New England touchdown. Before the Dolphins knew what hit them, the Patriots were up 20-0. Miami, to its credit, attempted a comeback and drew to within 20-14. However, the Patriots responded with a 77-yard touchdown to Julian Edelman on third down. That put the game away for good, as the Dolphins didn't score after that, thanks in part to a Damien Williams fumble in the red zone that set up another quick New England score following a long return on the recovery.    Brady was nearly flawless, going 25-of-33 for 276 yards and 3 touchdowns. This result allowed him to set an NFL record for the best single-season touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history. He finished the year with 28 scores and just 2 picks. The previous record-holder was Nick Foles, who somehow managed a 27:2 ratio back in 2013. That required a lot of luck and dropped interceptions. Brady's new record, in contrast to Bradford's, is totally legitimate.    Brady's 3 touchdowns went to Edelman (8-151), Michael Floyd (3-36) and Martellus Bennett (3-33). Floyd is noteworthy, as his score was a great 1. he fought hard to reach the end zone, taking 6 Dolphins along for a ride. Floyd also had a crushing block on Edelman's long touchdown catch. With Rob Gronkowski out, a new weapon like Floyd is definitely welcome. Edelman, by the way, was guilty of a head-butting personal foul in the opening half. That was probably the only real blunder for New England's offense the entire afternoon.    The 2 Patriot running backs split carries evenly in the first half. Dion Lewis had 1 more attempt prior to halftime, but LeGarrette Blount finished with more tries, as Bill Belichick used the latter as an end-game hammer to run out the clock. Blount managed 51 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Lewis gained 48 yards on 11 attempts, all but 2 of which came in the opening half.    As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore didn't have a bad game, going 24-of-34 for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick really hurt, as it occurred when he hurled an underthrown pass while scrambling left. With the Patriots limiting Miami's possessions, every drive was going to be crucial, so the Dolphins couldn't afford that mistake. The same goes for the aforementioned Damien Williams fumble.
