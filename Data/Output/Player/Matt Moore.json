   "comment":"Matt Moore struggled early, but managed to go 21-of-33 for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns, hitting numerous big throws to Steve Smith (9 catches, 157 yards, TD). Moore really heated up in the 4.h quarter. With the Vikings placing more of a focus on containing Stewart, Moore was able to finish an amazing 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. - Brett Favre just had his third straight pedestrian performance. He was absolutely terrible at Arizona and was fortunate enough that the Bengals dropped multiple interceptions last week. Favre was 17-of-27 for 224 yards and an interception at Carolina. That doesn't seem that bad, and Favre made quite a few nice plays, but overall, he's not even close to the guy we saw dominate in November. - Perhaps the most confusing aspect of this game was Minnesota's inability to establish the run against a defense that had allowed 5 consecutive opponents to rush for 139 yards or more. Adrian Peterson compiled just 35 yards and a tough touchdown on 12 carries. He saved his fantasy owners with 3 receptions for 73 more yards (including a very impressive 63-yard run of the catch), but this is the second time in 3 weeks that the Vikings haven't been able to get Peterson going. - Also for the second time in 3 weeks, Minnesota struggled to protect Favre. After taking 3 sacks at Arizona, Favre went down 4 times at Carolina. Favre was getting hit so much that Brad Childress tried to pull him from the game. However, Favre refused to come out.    Other numbers for the Vikings: Sidney Rice led the receivers with 4 catches for 69 yards. Bernard Berrian and Visanthe Shiancoe had 3 receptions each for 25 and 24 yards, respectively. Percy Harvin caught just 1 ball for 10 yards and was targeted just 3 times. Harvin barely practiced this past week because of migraines.    As for the Panthers, I'm starting to really like this Matt Moore character. He had some shaky throws early on, but as the game progressed, it appeared as though John Fox and his staff had more confidence in him. As mentioned, he was 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. More importantly, in his 3 starts, he has turned the ball over only once. Moore is the guy Jake Delhomme was supposed to be - a steady, mistake-free quarterback who can make just enough throws to give the defense and running game a chance to win. Barring a massive meltdown the next 2 weeks, Moore needs to be the starter next year; not Delhomme.   "

DeAngelo Williams managed 62 yards on 16 attempts, while Jonathan Stewart carried the ball only 5 times for 12 yards. I don't understand why Stewart touched the ball only 5 times. The coaching staff should be embarrassed - especially considering how crappy Matt Moore was. Moore went 14-of-33 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and 2 fumbles. His first interception was particularly ugly, as he lobbed the ball into quadruple coverage in the end zone. Moore could have easily tossed a 4.h interception, but the Giants dropped it in the second quarter. Unfortunately for Moore (and perhaps fortunately for the Panthers), Moore suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. "

   "comment":"Matt Moore was a sterling 14-of-20 for 160 yards and 3 touchdowns. Moore's progression from what we witnessed against the Jets in that Monday night contest to what we're seeing now is remarkable. The Dolphins are winning themselves out of the Robert Griffin, Matt Barkley and Landry Jones sweepstakes, but they won't need any of those quarterbacks if Moore keeps playing this way. Of course, this strategy didn't exactly work out for the Panthers a couple of years ago.    Moore's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Matt Moore, and the team committed dumb penalties. It's a miracle that they still somehow found a way to win. Romo was dreadful for 3 quarters of this contest. He went 22-of-34 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of horrible interceptions in the first quarter. Romo kept Miami in the game with his poor decision-making, but really made up for it when it mattered most with an impressive final drive to put his team in field goal range.    Both of Romo's scores went to Laurent Robinson, who was Dallas' most productive receiver by far (7-79), though he had a couple of key drops in the first half. Jason Witten (4-43) and Dez Bryant (3-35) didn't really do anything until the aforementioned game-winning drive. Witten made a few catches, while Bryant had a nice punt return.    DeMarco Murray had another solid outing. He rushed for 87 yards on 22 carries with 41 receiving yards off 4 receptions. Felix Jones didn't even get a single attempt.    As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore really continues to impress. He went 19-of-32 for 288 yards and a touchdown, and his numbers are definitely as good as advertised. He made some really great throws, including 41- and 39-yard strikes to "

The Cardinals were able to come back as a result to tie the game, but Moore was clutch on the final drive. Moore completed 3 of his 5 attempts for 47 yards, setting up the decisive field goal.    Tannehill and Moore's heroics were crucial, as the Dolphins couldn't run the ball against Arizona's stalwart front. Ajayi managed just 48 yards on 20 carries, and 13 of his yards came on 1 burst. As mentioned earlier, Ajayi should've caught a touchdown, but Tannehill overshot him. Ajayi was also robbed of another score, as a scamper of his into the end zone was nullified by a hold.    Thanks to the conditions, only 2 Dolphins accumulated more than 15 receiving yards. "

Moore misfired on just 6 attempts, going 12-of-18 for 236 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Moore was lucky to get away with a dropped pick in the first half, but he ate the Jets' secondary alive, as New York sent ineffective blitzes at him, exposing its horrible defensive backfield as a result. Moore's sole interception came on an underthrown pass. Now, before anyone gets excited, it needs to be noted that Moore was battling 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. We'll see what happens against legitimate NFL personnel.    Moore hit some big plays to "

   "comment":"Matt Moore. The veteran quarterback was a solid game-manager, going 16-of-30 for 233 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was very costly, as it came in the end zone and cost the team points heading into halftime. That said, Moore was able to keep Miami's offense moving, and he opened things up for the running game.    Once again, the Dolphins rode Jay Ajayi to a huge performance. The second-year star saw 32 carries and turned them into a ridiculous 209 yards. He also ran for a touchdown. Ajayi looked very strong, yet also displayed a lot of speed. He was able to rip mercilessly through the Buffalo front, thanks to some poor tackling by the Bills. Change-of-pace back "

   "comment":"Matt Moore's chances. The opening drive for the Patriots lasted nearly 8 minutes, as Tom Brady was a perfect 6-of-6 for 41 yards and a touchdown to start the game. The Dolphins had to punt away instantly, thanks to a Ja'Wuan James false start, and this led to another New England touchdown. Before the Dolphins knew what hit them, the Patriots were up 20-0. Miami, to its credit, attempted a comeback and drew to within 20-14. However, the Patriots responded with a 77-yard touchdown to Julian Edelman on third down. That put the game away for good, as the Dolphins didn't score after that, thanks in part to a Damien Williams fumble in the red zone that set up another quick New England score following a long return on the recovery.    Brady was nearly flawless, going 25-of-33 for 276 yards and 3 touchdowns. This result allowed him to set an NFL record for the best single-season touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history. He finished the year with 28 scores and just 2 picks. The previous record-holder was Nick Foles, who somehow managed a 27:2 ratio back in 2013. That required a lot of luck and dropped interceptions. Brady's new record, in contrast to Bradford's, is totally legitimate.    Brady's 3 touchdowns went to Edelman (8-151), Michael Floyd (3-36) and Martellus Bennett (3-33). Floyd is noteworthy, as his score was a great 1. he fought hard to reach the end zone, taking 6 Dolphins along for a ride. Floyd also had a crushing block on Edelman's long touchdown catch. With Rob Gronkowski out, a new weapon like Floyd is definitely welcome. Edelman, by the way, was guilty of a head-butting personal foul in the opening half. That was probably the only real blunder for New England's offense the entire afternoon.    The 2 Patriot running backs split carries evenly in the first half. Dion Lewis had 1 more attempt prior to halftime, but LeGarrette Blount finished with more tries, as Bill Belichick used the latter as an end-game hammer to run out the clock. Blount managed 51 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Lewis gained 48 yards on 11 attempts, all but 2 of which came in the opening half.    As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore didn't have a bad game, going 24-of-34 for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick really hurt, as it occurred when he hurled an underthrown pass while scrambling left. With the Patriots limiting Miami's possessions, every drive was going to be crucial, so the Dolphins couldn't afford that mistake. The same goes for the aforementioned Damien Williams fumble.    Moore's touchdowns went to "
