Darryl Morris dropped a potential interception in the end zone, but the Texans settled for a field goal. The Colts had a chance after they were set up in the red zone by a 41-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, and they turned that into a screen pass to Frank Gore for an 18-yard touchdown. Down 16-10, Colts moved into position to take the lead on a drive that had a completion to Chester Rogers for 21 yards, a 13-yard run by Gore, and then a 28-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, which set up the Colts at the 5.yard line. On third-and-goal, however, Clowney slammed into Luck for a blind-side strip-sack. That loose ball was recovered by Houston's "

   "comment":"Clowney sacked Bortles to disrupt the drive. Bortles eventually scored on the ground off Osweiler's second interception, and as mentioned, Jacksonville had a kickoff return touchdown. Otherwise, the Jaguars couldn't move the chains at all, mustering only 150 net yards of offense. Bortles, to put it nicely, was awful. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 12-of-28 for 92 yards, a rushing touchdown and an interception, which the CBS announcer deemed to be a bad decision. Bortles' passes were all over the place, as he showed poor mechanics and constantly fired ugly throws off his back foot. Bortles has regressed this year, and if the Jaguars had a viable alternative, I'm sure they would've benched Bortles by now.    Bortles' struggles once again ruined a game for "
