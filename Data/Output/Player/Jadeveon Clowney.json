Russell Wilson dodged Clowney and then found Paul Richardson for a 20-yard touchdown. That tied it at 14 to end the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, the Texans took the lead. Watson ran for 18 yards, and Houston made a 4.h-down conversion with Miller. The Texans then picked on Sherman, with Hopkins getting him for 24 yards, and then Fuller getting open in the front of end zone for a 20-yard touchdown with Sherman getting turned around by the speedy receiver. The Seahawks came right back with Wilson hitting Tanner McEvoy for 53 yards to the Texans' 7.yard line. The next play saw Wilson roll out and hit Richardson for a short touchdown to tie the game at 21 at halftime. In the third quarter, Houston produced a field-goal drive. The Seahawks then got a 66-yard gain after Houston had busted coverage to let fullback Tre Madden get wide open. A 9.yard gain to Jimmy Graham moved the ball inside the 5.yard line, but Thomas Rawls dropped a touchdown, so Seattle settled for a tying field goal. Watson then had a critical mistake as he was pressured and threw off the mark, leaving Richard Sherman to pick him off deep in Houston territory. Seattle took the lead with a field goal to go up 27-24. The Texans came back with Watson hitting Hopkins for 34 yards and then Fuller for 36 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson made a phenomenal play to break a sack and throw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Miller. That put Houston up 31-27 with 9 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. Wilson came right back, hitting Lockett for 55 yards to the Houston 20. The drive ended with Jimmy Graham getting wide open for a 1-yard touchdown. That put Seattle up 34-31 with 5 and half minutes remaining. The Texans caught Seattle in a great play call with a screen to Hopkins, and he exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. That gave the Texans a 38-34 with 4:49 remaining. Wilson quickly moved the ball across the midfield with a few completions and a 21-yard scramble to put Seattle inside the 30. Houston's defense finally came up with a big play, as cornerback Marcus Williams jumped a route for an interception. The Seahawks were able to get a stop and get the ball back. They were at their 20-yard line with 1:39 left. Wilson promptly connected with Richardson for 47 yards. Wilson then hit Lockett for 19 yards and before throwing an 18-yard touchdown to Graham. In the final seconds, Sherman picked off Watson on a desperation throw to clinch the 41-38 win for Seattle.    Wilson completed 26-of-41 passes for 452 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He also was Seattle's leading rusher with 30 yards on the ground.    Lockett (6-121), Richardson (6-105-2) and Graham (4-39-2) all made clutch receptions and beat up on Houston's secondary.    Watson was 19-of-30 for 402 yards with 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He also ran for 67 yards.    Hopkins had 8 receptions for 224 yards with a touchdown. Fuller (5-125-2) and Miller (21-54-1, 3-19-1) also played well.    Defensively, both teams saw their secondaries really struggle. Sherman had 2 interceptions, but he and Shaq Griffin were torched by the Texans' receivers. Houston's secondary was completely incapable of defending the Seahawks' receivers. Jadeveon Clowney was excellent for Houston with a sack, a forced fumble, 3 tackles for a loss and multiple quarterback hits. "
