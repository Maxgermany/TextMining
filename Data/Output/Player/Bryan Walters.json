   "comment":"Bryan Walters fumbled the ball away to set up the Chiefs inside Jacksonville's 25-yard line, which set up Foles to hit Albert Wilson for a 23-yard touchdown pass a couple of plays later. Early in the second quarter, Bortles threw a terrible interception right into the hands of Ramik Wilson, and then Bortles was called for a personal foul going for the knees of a defender. That set up Kansas City at the Jaguars' 14-yard line, but the Chiefs were held to a field goal. Late in the first half, Jacksonville moved the ball with passes to Marcedes Lewis for 17 yards and Allen Robinson for 20 yards to get into Kansas City territory. A 25-yard pass to Marqise Lee then moved the Jaguars to inside the 10-yard line. Bortles lucked out with an easy interception dropped by Ron Parker in the end zone, and on the next play, Bortles threw a 1.yard strike to Robinson, who had managed to separate from Parker. The Chiefs took a 10-7 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, T.J.Yeldon fumbled the ball away to Kansas City and Cairo Santos drilled a 51-yard field goal. Bortles continued to struggle as Stephen Nelson dropped an interception, and Bortles also missed Robinson running wide open for a would-have-been 60-yard touchdown. A 37-yard punt return from Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and a penalty on the Jaguars started the Chiefs' offense at the 30-yard line, but Foles' struggles once again led to Kansas City settling for a field goal. Jacksonville put of a bit together in response, but Jason Myers missed on a 54-yard field goal attempt. The Chiefs got moving on a third-down completion to Travis Kelce to move deep into Jaguars territory. But a few plays later after getting interfered with in the end zone, Kelce lost his cool at the officials, who hadn't thrown any flags, and his temper tantrum landed him 2 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and ejection. The 30-yard loss killed the drive, but Santos hit a field goal to produce a 19-7 lead. The Jaguars got close to the end zone with a long pass to Marqise Lee (4-84) for 51 yards. However, 2 plays later, Chris Ivory fumbled the ball into the end zone, and it was recovered by Marcus Peters. The Jaguars got the ball back and were able to get points with a 14-yard scoring pass to Yeldon. Soon afterward, Sen'Derrick Marks got a third-down sack to get the ball back for Jacksonville with 3 minutes remaining. Bortles took off on a 27-yard run to get into Kansas City territory, but Dontari Poe blew up a Yeldon run on third down and Stephen Nelson broke up a 4.h-down pass intended for Bryan Walters to clinch the win for Kansas City.    The change in coordinators didn't make a difference for Bortles, as he was 10-of-19 for 90 yards at halftime. He finished completing 22-of-41 passes for 252 yards with 2 scores and an interception, but he was inaccurate and careless with the football. He didn't look any better this week. In fact, you could say Bortles was less effective in the second half than he typically is.    Ivory (18-107) led the Jaguars in rushing, but had a critical fumble and picked up almost half of his yards on 1 carry.
