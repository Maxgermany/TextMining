   "comment":"Jeremy Zuttah to an injury late in the game. They're fortunate they have a bye coming up, so Zuttah will have an extra week to get healthy.    As for Mettenberger, he had a horrific second half. He completed just 3 passes following intermission, as it hurt him that he was missing "

   "comment":"Jeremy Zuttah also suffered an injury, and that had a major affect on Baltimore's offense in the 4.h quarter. Zuttah's replacement had a huge issue snapping the ball, and Flacco consequently took some losses. However, he did a great job of moving his team down the field on the final possession - despite more bad snaps and Smith's absence - and setting Tucker up with the decisive field goal. Flacco went 25-of-37 for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). He only had a couple of poor throws, including 1 dropped potential pick-six early on, but he carved up a San Diego team that couldn't tackle whatsoever. The Chargers' effort on this side of the ball was embarrassing, but they can be excused a bit. Eric Weddle was out, and they lost "
