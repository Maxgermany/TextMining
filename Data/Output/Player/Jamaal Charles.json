   "comment":"Jamaal Charles had just 4 rushes, but managed 33 yards. I say this every week, but there is no reason that the archaic Johnson should be getting more touches than Charles.    Norv Turner had 1 of the dumbest challenges ever in this game. In the first quarter, Gates dropped a touchdown that bobbled out of his hands. The thought of challenging didn't even enter my mind. When Norv threw the red flag, CBS announcer Dick Enberg laughed and said, I don't think this has a chance. When a nice guy like Enberg makes fun of you, you know you've epically failed.   "

Charles opened up with an 80-yard touchdown run, but things just went downhill from there. Ryan Succop missed a 27-yard field goal to go up 10-0. Dwayne Bowe go hurt. Cleveland's Travis Benjamin scored on a 93-yard punt return. And then the defense just seemed to give up in the second half, as the Browns tallied 204 net yards of offense after the break compared to Kansas City's 73.    Brady Quinn was terrible. He finished 10-of-21 for 159 yards and an interception. He was almost picked in a first-quarter trip to the end zone, and he went just 5-of-11 for 58 yards and an interception after intermission, as he looked lost without Bowe. He should not be allowed to start another NFL game ever again, but Romeo Crennel is going to keep sticking with him for some reason.    Charles finished with 165 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. The only skill-position player of note was Bowe (2-70); as mentioned, he left the game in the first quarter with a rib injury.    As for the Browns, "

Smith continues to ruin Charles coming out of the backfield. Smith could've easily tossed a second pick, but the Titans dropped the ball. Tennessee defensed Smith extremely well in the second half, limiting him to 7-of-14 for 55 yards and the interception following the break.    Smith continues to ruin Dwayne Bowe's fantasy value. Bowe had 4 catches for 35 yards, but 1 was a fluke grab off a tipped pass. Bowe actually made a mistake by catching it because it allowed precious time to tick off the clock at the end of the first half. Donnie Avery, meanwhile, led the team with 91 receiving yards off 3 catches.    Charles once again had a huge performance. He rushed for 108 yards and a touchdown to go along with 5 catches for 37 receiving yards.

Smith, who is a sub-par quarterback being coached up to playing above-average football, is the primary reason I never slotted Kansas City above No. 8 in my .    I mentioned that Bowe had a deep drop, but he played well otherwise despite his arrest during the week, as he led the team in receiving with 4 catches for 57 yards and a legitimate touchdown in the second quarter. Charles, however, wasn't a big factor in the passing game, hauling in just 2 balls for a loss of 6 receiving yards. He also notched 78 rushing yards on 16 carries.    Two other notable Chiefs: "

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles gains. Smith misfired just 4 times, going 24-of-28 for 226 yards. He struggled with pressure early - his offensive line couldn't deal with Charles gains. Smith misfired just 4 times, going 24-of-28 for 226 yards. He struggled with pressure early - his offensive line couldn't deal with Robert Quinn's great pressure - but the Chiefs made the appropriate second-half adjustments. It also helped that the Rams displayed very poor tackling after halftime and couldn't maintain possession on offense because of their injury woes. Smith did a good job of spreading the ball around, as a quintet of Chiefs had 4 or more targets, yet none of them saw more than 6. Dwayne Bowe (6-64) and Travis Kelce (4-45) led the way.    Charles, meanwhile, mustered 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 13 carries to go along with 4 catches and 44 receiving yards. Most of his production came in the second half, as he messed up early with a lost fumble on a handoff. This didn't hurt the Chiefs, however, as the Rams whiffed on that aforementioned field goal. Knile Davis (16-49) also scored, though that occurred in garbage time.   "

Smith was very inconsistent. As mentioned, he was horrible early on. His throws were low and behind his targets, and Kansas City, as a result, averaged a hideous 3.3 yards per play during the first half. Smith, however, finished 20-of-36 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire during a portion of the second half, but his limitations were pretty prevalent on a failed final drive despite that the Raiders began celebrating early, allowing a big return and nearly getting whistled for being way offsides prior to the final play of the game.    Charles didn't have the big game everyone was expecting. He touched the ball only 23 times, which is simply unacceptable. He had 19 carries go for 80 rushing yards, but he at least scored a touchdown as a pass-catcher, logging 4 grabs for 42 receiving yards. Charles also should've drawn a pass interference in the end zone at 1 point during the second quarter, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag.    Yet another week, and yet another game in which no Kansas City wideouts scored a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles hurt his fantasy owners, as Andy Reid, once again, inexplicably refused to run the ball. Charles gained 52 yards on just 12 carries. He was knocked out of the game with a head injury - he was cleared of a concussion - but that was at the end of the third quarter, so he still didn't see enough opportunities. I have no idea why Reid refuses to give his best player enough touches. It can't even be argued that he's saving him for the playoffs because there's no guarantee that Kansas City will even be there, given the frantic race for the AFC wild-card spots.    Speaking of not running the ball enough, the Raiders were guilty of that as well. At 1 point in the second quarter, Carr had 12 attempts compared to 5 runs from "

He didn't get many carries, gaining 29 rushing yards on 9 attempts, though he did contribute in the passing game, snatching 5 balls for 48 receiving yards. I'd love to know what Reid is thinking by repeatedly failing to give the ball to his best player.    Andy Reid made some other blunders in this game. In addition to once again failing to feed the ball to Charles, he foolishly went for it in the red zone on a 4.h down with about 20 seconds remaining in the first half. Even if he had converted, it's unlikely the Chiefs would've found the end zone anyway, since they had just 1 timeout. Had Reid taken 3 points, he could've gone for it on a late 4.h-and-3, down 20-12 instead of 20-9, at the Pittsburgh 9-yard line toward the end of regulation.   "

The Texans' first offensive play from scrimmage saw Hoyer make a terrible pass that was easily intercepted by rookie corner Marcus Peters. That set up the Chiefs at the Houston 13-yard line. Two plays later, Smith hit Travis Kelce in the middle of the end zone for a score. Later in the first quarter, Kelce got wide open in busted coverage for a 42-yard touchdown. Hoyer answered with a drive led by passes to Nate Washington, Cecil Shorts, Jonathan Grimes, and a typical great catch by DeAndre Hopkins, who leapt over Peters for the score. The Chiefs responded with a field goal drive thanks to receptions by Kelce, Maclin, and a run by Knile Davis (6-16). On the next drive, Maclin got open for a 20-yard catch to set up another Kansas City field goal. Justin Houston then strip-sacked Hoyer with the ball recovered by the Chiefs. For the very next play, Smith threw a 7.yard touchdown pass to Charles. Before the half, the Texans tacked on a field goal to make it 27-9 at intermission, but the Houston defense had allowed 221 yards across the first 2 quarters.

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles, who suffered a non-contact knee injury on a red-zone run in the third quarter. Charles looked like he was enjoying a solid afternoon with 58 yards on 12 carries to go along with a 26-yard reception when his knee buckled on him. It doesn't look good for Charles, who could be out for the year with what Kansas City fears is a torn ACL. If so, it's a shame; Charles is a high-character guy who was nearing the middle of what appeared to be a great season. Without him, Kansas City can't possibly climb out of its 1-4 hole. We actually saw a preview of life without Charles in this contest. Kansas City could barely move the chains following Charles' injury. The team scored zero points on every drive following the 1 in which Charles left. The Chiefs had a field goal blocked, but they had major problems picking up first downs without their best player, and understandably so. The worst part is that Kansas City was so challenged versus 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL.

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles and a 26-yard pass to Albert Wilson. Charles finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown. The Chiefs had another good drive going with a 38-yard pass to Jeremy Maclin, but they missed a 38-yard field goal. On the final play of the first half, Janikowski hit a 46-yard field goal to cut Kansas City's lead to 13-10 at the half. Following intermission, the Chiefs' defense dominated. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Ware ripped off a 45-yard run to the Raiders' 3-yard line. The Chiefs then ran a screen with a quick lateral going to Dontari Poe, who plunged into the end zone for the score. Kansas City was set up for more points thanks to a 50-yard punt return from Tyreek Hill. Ware ripped off 30 yards on a wheel route to get inside the 10, setting up a Kansas City field goal for a 23-10 lead. Ware ran well again to set up Cairo Santos for a 44-yarder and a 26-10 lead early in the 4.h quarter. Oakland moved into Kansas City territory, but Dee Ford strip-sacked Carr and Tamba Hali recovered to take points away from Oakland midway through the 4.h quarter. That turnover pretty much ended any hopes for a Raiders comeback, and Ford added a 4.h down sack in garbage time.    Derek Carr was 22-of-34 for 225 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Carr was fortunate a few passes weren't picked off. Amari Cooper was excellent with 10 catches for 129 yards.    Once again, the Raiders didn't have much of a running game as they were led by DeAndre Washington (10-49) with Latavius Murray out.    Alex Smith was 19-of-22 for 224 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Jeremy Maclin led the Chiefs in receiving with 3 receptions for 49 yards. Travis Kelce was held to 3 catches for 32 yards and wasn't targeted much.    Spencer Ware was superb, running for 131 yards and a score on 24 carries with 2 catches for 32 yards. Jamaal Charles had 9 carries for 33 yards with a score and 2 receptions for 14 yards.    Defensively, Charles and a 26-yard pass to Albert Wilson. Charles finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown.
