   "comment":"Jamaal Charles wrapped up for a 5-yard loss, but the quick back shed all of those tackles and sprinted for an 8-yard gain. It truly was pathetic. The Texans were getting run over, and they just didn't look like they cared at all. DeMeco Ryans' torn Achillies' 10.on didn't help, but that occurred near halftime, so it's not like Ryans was out for most of the game.    And I'm saying this amid a Houston victory. Matt Schaub and Andre Johnson really saved this team from losing its third of 4. Schaub went 25-of-33 for 305 yards and 2 touchdowns. In the second half alone, he was 17-of-23 for 232 yards and a score. Kansas City's secondary simply had no answer for Johnson, who caught 8 balls for 138 yards and a touchdown. Owen Daniels also showed some life with 5 receptions for 79 yards.    Arian Foster had a big fantasy day, rushing for 71 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also caught 6 balls for 26 receiving yards.    As mentioned earlier, Houston's defense had no answer for Kansas City's offense despite the fact that 90 percent of Matt Cassel's throws were short dump-offs. Cassel had 1 really nice pass where he zipped a 17-yard dart to Bowe for a touchdown. Cassel went 20-of-29 for 201 yards and 3 scores.    The Texans' run defense simply didn't show up. Thomas Jones and Jamaal Charles combined for 193 rushing yards and a touchdown on 35 carries. Of course, Jones had more attempts (19) than Charles (16) for a lower YPC. That's just how Todd Haley rolls.    Speaking of Haley, his failed gambles in the Colts game didn't deter him from making a few ballsy calls in this contest. He went for it thrice on 4.h down in the first half. The first 2 attempts were successful, though the first was a questionable pass interference on "

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles fumbles that gave San Diego the ball deep in Kansas City territory on both occasions. The Chargers scored 1 touchdown off of the fumbles, but Philip Rivers tossed a lazy interception after the other. If that wasn't bad enough, Cassel followed everything up with 2 interceptions late in the first half. One was way behind Tony Moeaki and returned for 6 by emerging inside linebacker Donald Butler. The other was tipped off the hands of Dexter McCluster. The crowd was booing fiercely beforehand, but they barely made a sound after that last 1. It was just sad at that point. Cassel finished 24-of-42 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Cassel's yardage numbers are bogus; he was able to compile them when the Chargers were playing prevent in the second half. Kansas City needs to move on from Cassel after this season. The team cannot bench him now, unfortunately, because it doesn't have anyone behind him.    Jamaal Charles had a nice fantasy day, rushing for 92 yards on just 17 carries, catching 3 balls for 23 more yards and scoring a pair of touchdowns. Unfortunately, those 2 aforementioned fumbles really cost his team.    Dwayne Bowe caught 7 balls for 108 yards. He was the only Chief with more than 4 receptions and 50 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Chargers surprised many by giving "

They also failed to capitalize on a potential Raider mistake when Brandon Flowers dropped a Carson Palmer interception in the red zone. As for the play-calling, Jamaal Charles had just 5 carries. Sure, he rushed for only 4 yards, but there's no reason for him to handle the ball so infrequently. The Raiders didn't have a double-digit lead until the third quarter, so it's not like the Chiefs had to abandon their ground attack super early. This is a fireable offense for coordinator Brian Daboll.    Cassel's meaningless touchdown went to "

He could've enjoyed a much brighter afternoon, but he left the game in the third quarter with a quad injury. Charles did return to rush the ball once in the 4.h quarter, but Kansas City didn't need him on the field because this game was such a blowout. Still, it's highly encouraging that Charles was able to take the field after getting dinged.    Smith, meanwhile, went 21-of-34 for 173 yards and a pair of scores. Smith obviously didn't trail by more than 2 throughout the afternoon, so he was able to do what he does best - check the ball down to his targets. Smith will have much greater issues when facing large deficits and tougher defenses, but he lives for games like this.    The 1 player hurt by Smith's constant checkdowns is "

The Bills also had their issues. They did a good job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon, but kept finding ways to shoot themselves in the foot. I already mentioned the pick-six and the fumble returned for a touchdown. That interception was 1 of 2 from Tuel, who went 18-of-39 for 229 yards and a touchdown otherwise. Tuel's other pick was an overthrow. He also fired way too high for "

But I suppose that's like saying the fattest man in the world wouldn't have suffered a heart attack if he wasn't so obese. Reid gets the most out of his players, but as Philadelphians very well know, he'll keep making the same mistakes over and over.    The 49ers may have dissension in their locker room toward head coach Jim Harbaugh, but San Francisco fought hard to get a needed win over the Chiefs. Kicker Phil Dawson was excellent for the 49ers as he was clutch all game, hitting long field goals and putting 16 points on the board.    Kansas City's offense started the game strongly, but the Chiefs couldn't put together any point-producing drives in the 4.h quarter in part because of a lack of receiving weapons. Kansas City got on the board first as the Chiefs moved the ball down the field. Jamaal Charles ran the ball well, while Junior Hemingway (5-40) led the Chiefs through the air."

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles more touches and hadn't bungled game management late in regulation. But I suppose that's like saying the fattest man in the world wouldn't have suffered a heart attack if he wasn't so obese. Reid gets the most out of his players, but as Philadelphians very well know, he'll keep making the same mistakes over and over.    The 49ers may have dissension in their locker room toward head coach Jim Harbaugh, but San Francisco fought hard to get a needed win over the Chiefs. Kicker Phil Dawson was excellent for the 49ers as he was clutch all game, hitting long field goals and putting 16 points on the board.    Kansas City's offense started the game strongly, but the Chiefs couldn't put together any point-producing drives in the 4.h quarter in part because of a lack of receiving weapons. Kansas City got on the board first as the Chiefs moved the ball down the field. Jamaal Charles ran the ball well, while Junior Hemingway (5-40) led the Chiefs through the air."

It's clear that Brandon Mebane, who was lost with an injury, is sorely missed. Kansas City's next drive also resulted in a touchdown, though they did it quickly with numerous explosive plays. The Chiefs moved the chains in a variety of ways throughout the afternoon, and the Seahawks struggled to get their defense off the field. Kansas City punted only twice, while facing only 6 third-down situations throughout the contest. The Chiefs averaged an impressive 6.5 yards per play.    Charles had a fantastic afternoon. He carried the ball just 20 times, but managed to accumulate 159 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also caught 2 balls for 19 receiving yards. His only blemish on the afternoon was when he lost a fumble near midfield in the third quarter, which led to a Seattle score. "

He was knocked out of the game with a head injury - he was cleared of a concussion - but that was at the end of the third quarter, so he still didn't see enough opportunities. I have no idea why Reid refuses to give his best player enough touches. It can't even be argued that he's saving him for the playoffs because there's no guarantee that Kansas City will even be there, given the frantic race for the AFC wild-card spots.    Speaking of not running the ball enough, the Raiders were guilty of that as well. At 1 point in the second quarter, Carr had 12 attempts compared to 5 runs from "

   "comment":"Jamaal Charles hurt his team with a big fumble in Pittsburgh territory. He didn't get many carries, gaining 29 rushing yards on 9 attempts, though he did contribute in the passing game, snatching 5 balls for 48 receiving yards. I'd love to know what Reid is thinking by repeatedly failing to give the ball to his best player.    Andy Reid made some other blunders in this game. In addition to once again failing to feed the ball to Charles, he foolishly went for it in the red zone on a 4.h down with about 20 seconds remaining in the first half. Even if he had converted, it's unlikely the Chiefs would've found the end zone anyway, since they had just 1 timeout. Had Reid taken 3 points, he could've gone for it on a late 4.h-and-3, down 20-12 instead of 20-9, at the Pittsburgh 9-yard line toward the end of regulation.   "

I don't understand why Andy Reid wasn't utilizing Charles very much prior to this contest, but there was at least an explanation this week, as Charles hobbled off the field in the first half.    Daniel deserves some credit for this win, but Kansas City's defense was most responsible. Several defenders were awesome, including Houston. "

Charles looked like he was enjoying a solid afternoon with 58 yards on 12 carries to go along with a 26-yard reception when his knee buckled on him. It doesn't look good for Charles, who could be out for the year with what Kansas City fears is a torn ACL. If so, it's a shame; Charles is a high-character guy who was nearing the middle of what appeared to be a great season. Without him, Kansas City can't possibly climb out of its 1-4 hole. We actually saw a preview of life without Charles in this contest. Kansas City could barely move the chains following Charles' injury. The team scored zero points on every drive following the 1 in which Charles left. The Chiefs had a field goal blocked, but they had major problems picking up first downs without their best player, and understandably so. The worst part is that Kansas City was so challenged versus 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. Charles' replacement, some guy named "
