   "comment":"David Harris combined for a sack, but otherwise Brady had all day to throw the ball. New York's offense is devoid of play-makers. The team had numerous opportunities to get the ball in the end zone, but had to settle for 4 field goals. Sanchez played pretty well, completing 28-of-41 passes for 328 yards, a touchdown and interception, but he also left points on the field that would've made the difference for the Jets to get a win.
