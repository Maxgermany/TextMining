That was just the excuse McDaniels needed to have Knowshon Moreno as his every-down runner. Moreno rushed for 97 yards on 18 attempts. Buckhalter had just 11 yards on 2 carries.    Marshall had those 2 aforementioned touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 134 yards. It's a shame that Simms ruined what could have been a career day for Marshall.    Tony Scheffler (4 catches, 29 yards) and Eddie Royal (2-21) both posted mediocre numbers. As mentioned earlier, Royal was robbed of a long score because of Orton's ineptness.

   "comment":"Eddie Royal lost a fumble in the red zone. His own teammate, D.J. Fluker, accidentally punched the ball out in a scrum. - Ryan Mathews dropped a screen pass in the red zone with plenty of blockers in front of him. A potential touchdown turned into a field goal. - Eric Weddle foolishly hit Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. "

   "comment":"Eddie Royal returned a punt to the red zone for 58 yards, setting up the only field-goal attempt in which Novak was successful. I have no idea what Gase was trying to do, but he nearly cost his team the game; had the Chargers converted a touchdown off Royal's return, Rivers would've been only a few yards away from tying the contest at the very end.    The Chargers played some tough red-zone defense and did a good job of limiting Denver's offense to 22 points, but they killed themselves on the other side of the ball. They made dumb mistakes throughout the afternoon. For instance, an offensive pass interference negated a nice gain. "
