If Simms isn't cut in the next few days, we'll know that Simms has naked photos of Josh McDaniels.    Correll Buckhalter lost a fumble early on and didn't see another carry afterward. That was just the excuse McDaniels needed to have Knowshon Moreno as his every-down runner. Moreno rushed for 97 yards on 18 attempts. Buckhalter had just 11 yards on 2 carries.    Marshall had those 2 aforementioned touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 134 yards. It's a shame that Simms ruined what could have been a career day for Marshall.    Tony Scheffler (4 catches, 29 yards) and Eddie Royal (2-21) both posted mediocre numbers. As mentioned earlier, Royal was robbed of a long score because of Orton's ineptness.    You can make all the excuses about Orton being out, but anyone who defends the Broncos here has to answer for the defense. How in the world does "

   "comment":"Royal for what would have been a 70-yard score. Chris Simms stepped in for Orton and was just 3-of-13 for 13 yards and a pick in the second half. If Simms isn't cut in the next few days, we'll know that Simms has naked photos of Josh McDaniels.    Correll Buckhalter lost a fumble early on and didn't see another carry afterward. That was just the excuse McDaniels needed to have Knowshon Moreno as his every-down runner. Moreno rushed for 97 yards on 18 attempts. Buckhalter had just 11 yards on 2 carries.    Marshall had those 2 aforementioned touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 134 yards. It's a shame that Simms ruined what could have been a career day for Marshall.    Tony Scheffler (4 catches, 29 yards) and Eddie Royal (2-21) both posted mediocre numbers. As mentioned earlier, Royal was robbed of a long score because of Orton's ineptness.    You can make all the excuses about Orton being out, but anyone who defends the Broncos here has to answer for the defense. How in the world does "

   "comment":"Royal to a groin injury, Tebow had to play wideout. He was used in the slot, but didn't catch any passes. He blocked primarily.    The Broncos held the lead throughout, so the fans didn't get a chance to chant for Tebow. Orton went 15-of-25 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns, including an impressive 52-yard bomb to Eric Decker (5-113, 2 TDs). Orton was pretty mediocre otherwise, but was missing Brandon Lloyd and Royal.    "

Oakland did answer with Palmer spreading the ball around before finding Ford for a doozy of a touchdown reception to put the Raiders ahead by double digits again at 24-14.

Keenan Allen performed well again (3-67), though all of his production came in the first half. Antonio Gates caught 6 balls, but managed only 31 yards.    One of the reasons Rivers is playing so well is because of Danny Woodhead's presence. The tiny back rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown on 9 carries and also caught 4 passes for 47 receiving yards. Ryan Mathews, meanwhile, had another strong outing with 110 yards and a score on 21 attempts.    As for the Jaguars, they were inept offensively until garbage time. They generated 353 net yards, but only 95 came in the first half. They couldn't get anything on the ground - Maurice Jones-Drew registered 37 yards on 9 attempts - which forced Chad Henne to air it out 36 times. That's not a recipe for victory. Henne went 23-of-36 for 318 yards and an interception. One of his top receivers had a solid statistical outing, but it wasn't Justin Blackmon (6-58). Cecil Shorts, who wasn't expected to play earlier in the week, caught 8 balls for 80 yards.    As if the Chargers didn't have it easy enough, both the officials and the Jaguars helped them out. One key play in this game saw defensive tackle Sen'Derrick Marks give San Diego a first down on what would've been a third-and-33 because of a personal foul. Later on, Royal fumbled in the red zone, and the Jaguars recovered what should've been a touchback. However, senile official Walt Coleman overturned the call after reviewing it despite the fact that it was painfully obvious that Royal wasn't down by contact. I'll repeat, Coleman is way too old and way too inept to have a high-profile officiating job like this. He needs to be removed. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Fluker, accidentally punched the ball out in a scrum. - Ryan Mathews dropped a screen pass in the red zone with plenty of blockers in front of him. A potential touchdown turned into a field goal. - Eric Weddle foolishly hit Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. "

   "comment":"Royal on a 4.h-and-6 and Dontrelle Inman on a 4.h-and-10 with the game (and season) on the line. Two plays after the Inman reception, Rivers found Malcom Floyd in the end zone for a 12-yard score. The 49ers won the coin toss in overtime following a 60-yard Phil Dawson whiff. They moved it into San Diego territory, but Quinton Patton lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and thanks to some Rivers completions and tough runs from Ronnie Brown, they moved it into range for Nick Novak, who converted to keep the season alive. San Diego, now 9-6, still needs some help to earn 1 of the 2 wild-card spots, but at least it has a chance.    Rivers finished 33-of-54 for 356 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. It was ugly early; Rivers' first pick wasn't too bad, as Perrish Cox had great coverage, but his next 1 was returned for 6. as it was heaved right to Antoine Bethea. Rivers' third interception came after halftime; it was a high throw that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. As mentioned though, Rivers caught fire at the very end to help his team's hopes alive.    Rivers' main targets were Royal (10-94, TD) and Antonio Gates, who had 7 catches for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns."
