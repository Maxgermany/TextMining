Tebow ran for 16 yards on 2 carries and Willis McGahee ran up the middle for 24 yards. Broncos kicker Matt Prater made a 37-yard field goal to eke out another win for Denver. All game, San Diego's pass rush was pathetic. Tebow had all day to throw the ball on many pass plays. The Chargers' offensive line also struggled with the Broncos edge rushers. Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 3 sacks on the afternoon."
