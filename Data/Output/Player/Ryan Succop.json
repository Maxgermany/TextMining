I was distraught as well; the kick would have covered the game for Kansas City. Haley tried to spark his team early. He called for an onside kick to start the contest, but the attempted failed. I liked the idea though; if Sean Payton's try didn't work in the Super Bowl, everyone would have called him an idiot, right? And it's not like Peyton Manning can't score on a long field. Haley attempted another ballsy move later in the first quarter. He went for it on 4th-and-2 inside Indianapolis' 5-yard line, but didn't get it. This move would really prove to be costly later; had the Chiefs kicked the field goal there, they could have went for it at the end of the game instead of asking Succop to try a 51-yarder.    You have to admire Kansas City's effort, so it's a shame that the team is really limited by "

Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by Matt Giordano on third down, blowing a chance to take the lead. The long return of the pick set up the Raiders, but the Chiefs quickly forced third down, and Palmer (16-of-26, 237 yards, TD, 2 INTs) squandered a potential long field-goal attempt opportunity by tossing an interception to Javier Arenas. Starting at the 2.minute warning, Kansas City again moved the ball with double-digit yardage passes to rookie wide receiver Jonathan Baldwin, Dwayne Bowe and tight end Leonard Pope. Let me backtrack for a moment though, because prior to the Pope gain, the Chiefs were at the the Raiders' 23-yard line. I was thinking field goal, but interim head coach Romeo Crennel was thinking touchdown. Orton threw incomplete and was flagged for grounding (loss of 11 yards). Flags for delay of game and false start seemingly put them out of scoring range, but the pass to Pope salvaged a Succop attempt. "
