By my count, Haley has only succeeded twice on these unwise 4.h-down gambles this year.    Kansas City ran all over Buffalo's dreadful run defense. "

Proving that icing the kicker is a waste, Succop hit the decisive field goal following the return from commercial break.    Mariota, still not 100 percent, went 21-of-34 for 203 yards.

Fortunately for the Titans, they have a bye next week, so perhaps Mariota will be 100 percent by Week 9.
