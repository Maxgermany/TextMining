Kansas City's offensive line didn't play very well. Smith was sacked on just 2 occasions, but that's only because he released the ball so quickly for minimal gains. Center "

Peyton Manning gave it right back when he threw a floater downfield that was batted around before Quentin Demps controlled the ball for a pick. Smith came back to hit Junior Hemingway (3-42) for a 17-yard score. The Broncos answered with a 34-yard screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. Manning then threw a perfect strike on a deep post to Decker for a 41-yard touchdown. Decker beat Brandon Flowers on the play. The Chiefs took that 7 right back as Knile Davis returned the kickoff 108-yards to put Kansas City back in front. Manning tried to go back to Decker, but the veteran signal-caller had the underthrown ball fall short to Marcus Cooper for an interception that set up the Chiefs inside Broncos' territory. Smith took advantage with a touchdown pass to Fasano. Manning answered by hitting Decker for a gain of 42 yards to the 3.yard line. That led to a short touchdown toss to Moreno and a 21-14 Kansas City lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Decker burned the Chiefs' secondary again. Manning had a beautiful throw as Decker burned Flowers and Demps for a 37-yard touchdown. Manning kept pushing the ball down the field as "

At least Oakland has its franchise quarterback, right? Jim Nantz exclaimed that the Raiders finally found their guy in Carr once this game was over. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Carr made some very nice throws in this contest, but he could have been picked at least 5 times. The Raiders were very unfortunate that the Chiefs dropped all of those potential interceptions, as a loss would have really helped them. Carr finished 18-of-35 for 174 yards and a touchdown.

The win snapped a 6.game losing streak by the Titans (2-6) and was their first victory since the season opener against Tampa Bay. For the Saints (4-5), the loss ended a 3.game winning streak. The loss came as rumors continue to fly about the future of Saints coach Sean Payton. There were reports Sunday morning that the Saints would allow Payton to explore other jobs in the offseason. Payton, who has been with the Saints since 2006, reportedly could draw interest from the Miami Dolphins and other teams.    Mariota had the best game of his young career. He completed 28-of-39 passes for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns with no interceptions. Mariota was calm and composed throughout the game. Despite his team's record, Mariota is worth starting on your fantasy team in favorable matchups.    Tight end "

   "comment":"Fasano was able to fall on the loose ball. Henry, meanwhile, looked much fresher, accumulating 60 yards and a touchdown on just 8 attempts.    The best running back on the field, at least statistically, was Jordan Howard, who gained 84 rushing yards on 18 carries to go along with 3 catches for 43 receiving yards. Stats can be misleading, however, and that would be the case here, as Howard dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which was in the end zone. Also, 22 of Howard's 84 rushing yards came on 1 burst that caught the Titans off-guard.    Speaking of misleading stats, Matt Barkley was 28-of-54 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. However, Barkley was just 7-of-16 for 63 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick by halftime. Most of his positive stats came after halftime when the exhausted Titans, who haven't had a week off yet, forgot to cover the horrible Chicago receivers. They nearly paid the price, but managed to hold on. Now, they'll be able to enjoy their bye week before entering the final quarter of the season. If you're wondering about Barkley's interceptions, only 1 was his fault. His first was wrestled away by linebacker "
