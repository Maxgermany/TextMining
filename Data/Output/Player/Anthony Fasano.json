They should have beaten the Colts and they could have beaten the Jaguars. They finally earned their first victory, but 3-2 would sound a lot better than 1-4 right now.    The Texans barely beat the Dolphins, who were 1-15 last year, but they deserve lots of credit. I didn't think they could recover from last week's depressing loss. "

   "comment":"Anthony Fasano with a 5-yard touchdown pass to seal the victory. The win snapped a 6.game losing streak by the Titans (2-6) and was their first victory since the season opener against Tampa Bay. For the Saints (4-5), the loss ended a 3.game winning streak. The loss came as rumors continue to fly about the future of Saints coach Sean Payton. There were reports Sunday morning that the Saints would allow Payton to explore other jobs in the offseason. Payton, who has been with the Saints since 2006, reportedly could draw interest from the Miami Dolphins and other teams.    Mariota had the best game of his young career. He completed 28-of-39 passes for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns with no interceptions. Mariota was calm and composed throughout the game. Despite his team's record, Mariota is worth starting on your fantasy team in favorable matchups.    Tight end "
