They should have beaten the Colts and they could have beaten the Jaguars. They finally earned their first victory, but 3-2 would sound a lot better than 1-4 right now.    The Texans barely beat the Dolphins, who were 1-15 last year, but they deserve lots of credit. I didn't think they could recover from last week's depressing loss. "

They should have lost, as they have a better strength of schedule than the Jaguars. Many teams will be dying to trade up for Marcus Mariota, and now the Jaguars will be the fortunate franchise to acquire a boatload of picks. Check out my for more.    At least Oakland has its franchise quarterback, right? Jim Nantz exclaimed that the Raiders finally found their guy in Carr once this game was over. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Carr made some very nice throws in this contest, but he could have been picked at least 5 times. The Raiders were very unfortunate that the Chiefs dropped all of those potential interceptions, as a loss would have really helped them. Carr finished 18-of-35 for 174 yards and a touchdown.

The win snapped a 6.game losing streak by the Titans (2-6) and was their first victory since the season opener against Tampa Bay. For the Saints (4-5), the loss ended a 3.game winning streak. The loss came as rumors continue to fly about the future of Saints coach Sean Payton. There were reports Sunday morning that the Saints would allow Payton to explore other jobs in the offseason. Payton, who has been with the Saints since 2006, reportedly could draw interest from the Miami Dolphins and other teams.    Mariota had the best game of his young career. He completed 28-of-39 passes for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns with no interceptions. Mariota was calm and composed throughout the game.

   "comment":"Anthony Fasano was able to fall on the loose ball. Henry, meanwhile, looked much fresher, accumulating 60 yards and a touchdown on just 8 attempts.    The best running back on the field, at least statistically, was Jordan Howard, who gained 84 rushing yards on 18 carries to go along with 3 catches for 43 receiving yards. Stats can be misleading, however, and that would be the case here, as Howard dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which was in the end zone. Also, 22 of Howard's 84 rushing yards came on 1 burst that caught the Titans off-guard.    Speaking of misleading stats, Matt Barkley was 28-of-54 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. However, Barkley was just 7-of-16 for 63 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick by halftime. Most of his positive stats came after halftime when the exhausted Titans, who haven't had a week off yet, forgot to cover the horrible Chicago receivers. They nearly paid the price, but managed to hold on. Now, they'll be able to enjoy their bye week before entering the final quarter of the season. If you're wondering about Barkley's interceptions, only 1 was his fault. His first was wrestled away by linebacker "
