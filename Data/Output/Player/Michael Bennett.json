Later in the 4.h quarter, Jones beat Talib and the safety in zone coverage for a 49-yard pass to the Bucs' 10-yard line. Jones had to stop and wait for the ball, and a better pass would have been a score. Ryan finished the drive on the next play with a 10-yard touchdown to Gonzalez. Ryan later had White for a potential touchdown, but his No. 1 wideout dropped the ball. Atlanta had to settle for a field goal and never got the ball back because Tampa Bay was able to run out the clock.    Each team featured a young defensive tackle that was a disruptive force in the game. For Atlanta, third-year pro "

   "comment":"Bennett dominated the Cowboys' line. The Tampa Bay defenders produced sacks at clutch times to negate potential points. McCoy had a sack-fumble on Tony Romo to bail out Tampa Bay from allowing at least a field goal. McCoy rocked Romo again in the 4.h quarter, and Dallas was lucky that its quarterback held onto the ball. Doug Free was getting whipped by Bennett for pressures, hits and holding calls. He had a sack-fumble of Romo in the third quarter to set up the Bucs at the Cowboys 31-yard line, but the Dallas defense forced a punt.    The Cowboys' first score was set up by a Josh Freeman interception. The ball was deflected into the air by running back D.J. Ware and was snatched by "

He had some nice plays and some duds, but Cleveland's offense doesn't have the talent to really challenge a defense like Seattle's.    Duke Johnson had 4 carries for 46 yards with 5 receptions for 39 yards. He continues to flash serious play-making ability, but doesn't get a lot of touches.    Cleveland tight end Gary Barnidge logged 29 yards on 3 catches with a score. The leading Browns wide receiver was Travis Benjamin with only 3 catches for 26 yards.

   "comment":"Bennett sack, Manziel was picked off by Marcus Burley, and the Seahawks ran out the clock.    Russell Wilson was 21-of-30 for 249 yards with 3 touchdowns. He also ran for 46 yards on 5 carries. Wilson was excellent against Cleveland with accurate passing and good decision-making.    Doug Baldwin had 4 catches for 45 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jermaine Kearse (7-110) and Tyler Lockett (5-55-1) also played well for Seattle.    Christine Michael led the Seahawks' rushing attack with 84 yards on 12 carries.    Johnny Manziel was 19-of-161 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He had some nice plays and some duds, but Cleveland's offense doesn't have the talent to really challenge a defense like Seattle's.    Duke Johnson had 4 carries for 46 yards with 5 receptions for 39 yards. He continues to flash serious play-making ability, but doesn't get a lot of touches.    Cleveland tight end Gary Barnidge logged 29 yards on 3 catches with a score. The leading Browns wide receiver was Travis Benjamin with only 3 catches for 26 yards.    The Seahawks' defense got a impressive games from Michael Bennett, Brandon Mebane, K."
