On his first play, the football hit him right on the helmet on an attempted throw. Bush later dropped an easy pass on third down that would have set the Saints up on a first-and-goal. Afterward, Bush fumbled a punt return, setting up the Cowboys with a short field and a subsequent touchdown. Williams, meanwhile, dropped a pass, but was ultimately responsible for the loss. He took a long completion deep into New Orleans territory, but fumbled the ball away. The Saints scored the winning touchdown on the next possession. One has to wonder why Williams continues to see so many snaps.    "

He had a good hole to get to the second level of the defense. About 10 yards downfield, Bush broke tackles from Aaron Ross and Kenny Philips with a spin move. The Dolphins finished the drive on 4.h-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Moore ran a bootleg and coasted into the end zone to give the Dolphins a 14-3 lead. The Giants were able to answer the score.

Every single 1 agreed that the Dolphins should have let the Cowboys score when Dallas was running out the clock to set up the decisive field goal. Of course, Phil My Son is Better than Andrew Luck Simms said that Miami was doing the right thing, and of course, the Dolphins lost at the buzzer. It really didn't make any sense. The Cowboys had at 35-yard field goal set up, at the very worst, with a minute on the clock and a timeout remaining for Miami. Allowing Dallas to score would have given them a 6.point deficit, but they at least would have had a chance.   "

   "comment":"Bush lost a fumble after a 15-yard gain on the second drive. Tennessee took over, and Locker quickly threw a touchdown to Kendall Wright. Later on, a Ryan Tannehill pass was tipped, picked and returned for 6. Tannehill would then toss another interception because he forced a throw. This led to another Titan score. As all of this was going on, the Dolphins were killing themselves with penalties (5 in the first half). Mix in poor tackling on both Chris Johnson and Locker, and that was the perfect recipe for their complete first-half meltdown.    CJ2K - I feel like I can call him that again - had yet another monstrous performance. He rushed for 126 yards and a touchdown on 23 tries. He still looked 10.ative while looking for running room, but the difference is that his blockers are doing a better job.    Locker finished with 9 completions out of 21 attempts for 122 yards. However, he threw 2 touchdowns and scrambled for 36 yards (Cam Newton, take note of another running quarterback who is actually running).    No Titan logged more than 2 receptions. In fact, only a pair of Titans - Kenny Britt (2-36) and Damian Williams (2-31) - had more than 1 catch. Locker's scores went to Jared Cook (26 yards) and Wright (9 yards).    Meanwhile, the Dolphins had a rough outing offensively. I mentioned the early turnovers; Ryan Tannehill threw yet another interception later on. He finished 23-of-39 for 217 yards and 3 picks and failed to complete a pass longer than 17 yards. This was a reality check after an alleged hot start.    Brian Hartline had a solid fantasy outing despite Tannehill's struggles, catching 8 balls for 79 yards.    Bush, who had the aforementioned fumble, had just 4 carries for some strange reason, turning them into 21 yards. "

Buffalo had a chance to make this a close contest, but it had a dropped Stevie Johnson touchdown and 3 key turnovers, which derailed its efforts. Buffalo actually outgained Miami by 80 yards, but the 3 giveaways were killers. The first occurred when Johnson (4-44) fumbled in the red zone. Dorin Dickerson them fumbled in Dolphins' territory. After that, Ryan Fitzpatrick coughed the ball up, setting up a Miami score. Give credit to the Dolphins though, as they took advantage of Buffalo's mistakes. Bush gained 65 yards on the ground (19 carries) and 42 yards aerially (4 catches) and scored thrice in the process. Miller, meanwhile, mustered 73 yards on 10 attempts.

   "comment":"Bush dropped a pass in the red zone on the opening drive. A field goal attempt was aborted because of a bobbled hold. Calvin Johnson let the ball hit the ground on a potential touchdown. A chop block nullified a pick-six. Brandon Pettigrew lost a fumble. The team burned a timeout in the beginning of the third quarter. Basically another day at the office for this team. The Lions look great at times, but these errors will cost them games down the road. They're just fortunate that the Vikings made similar mental mistakes.    It really helped the Lions that Ponder was so inept. He went 18-of-28 for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and a fumble. He didn't even attempt a pass in the first quarter, as the coaching staff clearly doesn't trust him. Plus, there's always Adrian Peterson, who opened the contest with a 78-yard score. Peterson did nothing after that, however, mustering just 15 yards the rest of the way. His final numbers were 93 yards and 3 total touchdowns on 18 attempts.    The only Viking receiver with more than 35 yards was Jerome Simpson (7-140), who should be ignored in all fantasy leagues. Greg Jennings predictably did nothing, mustering just 3 receptions for 33 yards. It sucks that Jennings threw away his NFL career for slightly more money.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, Megatron snagged just 4 balls for 37 yards. It's a shame because he just missed out on a huge day. He couldn't hold on to the ball in the first quarter - it was 1 of those process of the catch things that screwed him in Week 1 a few seasons ago - and he later couldn't get a second foot inbounds when hauling in a potential touchdown.    Bush also lost 2 touchdowns. Both missed opportunities came on reviews. He was otherwise brilliant, collecting 90 rushing yards (21 carries) and 101 receiving yards (4 catches). He did manage to score once. Bush dislocated his thumb in this game, but said that he's fine.    Save for an interception on a tipped pass, Stafford was outstanding. He went 28-of-43 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He distributed the ball evenly, with 6 Lions catching at least 3 balls. Stafford's scores went to Bush and undrafted rookie tight end "

   "comment":"Bush lost the ball on a handoff at the Arizona 10-yard line in the third quarter. The turnover led to a Cardinals' field goal. - Defensive end Willie Young was guilty of illegal hands to the face on what should've been on Arizona punt. The Cardinals were awarded a free first down and eventually managed another field goal, thanks to a roughing-the-passer infraction. - Dwight Bullet Bill Bentley committed a terrible pass interference on Andre Roberts in the 4.h quarter - his second of the game - setting up an Arizona touchdown. The Lions had 5 penalties in the second half.    Bush, who had the aforementioned fumble - though it was officially credited to Matthew Stafford - suffered what looked to be a serious injury in the first half."

   "comment":"Bush dropped a pass in the red zone, Calvin Johnson had 1 foot inbounds in the end zone, Tony Scheffler dropped a pass on third down that could've moved the chains, and Matthew Stafford was throwing late and inaccurately. Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by Julius Peppers, who beat Riley Reiff. Stafford's numbers could've been a lot better though; he missed a wide-open Ryan Broyles for a touchdown, and as mentioned, Megatron (4-44, TD) just missed out on a score.    With Stafford and Johnson not playing their best, Reggie Bush was a huge spark for this offense. He made the Bears look silly, rushing for 139 yards and a touchdown on just 18 carries. He also caught 4 balls for 34 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Bush and Calvin Johnson both lost fumbles in Dallas territory. The Lions were whistled for unnecessary roughness on top of the Megatron cough-up, which gave the Cowboys 3 free points because they couldn't move the chains, but were set up in field-goal range. The Cowboys kicked a field goal to go up 30-24 with a minute remaining, but there would've been 20 seconds or so on the clock had they not committed a holding penalty. Jim Schwartz smartly declined the infraction, saving 40 seconds. This gave Matthew Stafford enough time to hit Kris Durham for a 40-yard bomb, ultimately setting up a 1-yard sneak for the go-ahead sneak score in which he fooled everyone - including his own linemen - by faking to spike the ball. This is a great win for the Lions, who needed to prevail like this. They need to avoid mistakes - 4 turnovers against quality opponents usually won't cut it - but perhaps this victory can be used as momentum to fix things going forward. On the flip side, there's no telling what a defeat like this will do for the Cowboys. Sure, it's just a non-divisional loss, and Dallas still has control of the NFC East, but Dez Bryant's sideline tirade could really hurt the team. Bryant spent so much of the second half incoherently yelling at coaches and players. It all started when Bryant shouted get me the ball to Tony Romo repeatedly. He then barked at some coaches and Romo some more. Following Detroit's touchdown, Bryant was seen screaming at Jason Witten, with DeMarcus Ware trying to break the 2 up. Ware then grabbed Bryant and yelled at him. It was an ugly scene, reminiscent of Terrell Owens' antics. Bryant has been a good soldier this season, but this could be a very dark cloud hovering over the team in the second half of the year, despite what the Cowboy players may have told the media.    The most prominent number in this contest was 329. That's the amount of receiving yards Calvin Johnson accumulated, highlighted by an 87-yard gain in which Brandon Carr missed a tackle and Barry Church took a horrible angle. Megatron caught 14 balls to reach that total, which included a touchdown. He fell just 7 yards short of Flipper Anderson's all-time record of 336 yards in a single contest.    Johnson had about 2.thirds of Stafford's yards. Stafford was brilliant if you exclude the 2 picks, as he went 33-of-48 for 488 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) otherwise. He was especially brilliant after halftime. He let the ball hit the ground just 5 times, going 20-of-25 for 296 yards and the rushing score following the break.    Only 4 Lions caught more than 1 pass: Johnson, Durham (4-54), Brandon Pettigrew (3-31) and Bush, whose 8 catches for 30 receiving yards complemented his 92 rushing yards and touchdown on 21 carries. Bush wasn't perfect though; in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble, he also dropped a pass, which has been a problem for him this year.    As for the Cowboys' offense, they had to rely on big plays to score in this contest. They had trouble sustaining drives - 3-of-13 on third downs - because Detroit put immense pressure on Romo. It seemed like he was being blasted on almost every single attempt, which would explain why he was only able to complete half of his passes. He went 14-of-30 for 206 yards and 3 touchdowns. Two of Romo's scores went to Bryant (3-72), who broke free with a 50-yard scamper along the sidelines and also had a David Tyree-esque catch in which he pinned the ball to the side of his helmet. "

   "comment":"Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte. He returned the interception 35 yards to the Lions' 9.yard line. A justified holding call on Matt Slausson took away a Matt Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Chris Houston, but the review of the play took the touchdown away as Jeffery had to re-control the ball when he landed on his back out of bounds. The Bears settled for a field goal and a 14-13 deficit. Conte came back with a clutch breakup covering Johnson in the end zone. David Akers missed the field goal, but it didn't matter as Stafford and Bush (14-105) moved the ball into Chicago territory on Detroit's next possession. Johnson beat Tillman in man coverage for a 14-yard score to give the Lions an 8.point lead with a little more than 2 minutes remaining. Josh McCown came in for the Bears' final drive of the game. "

   "comment":"Bush were awful in this game. Stafford took a bad sack on third down of the opening drive, but his most egregious errors were a pair of interceptions. He fired a pick right to Justin Tuck at the end of the first half, prompting heavy boos from the crowd. Stafford finished 25-of-42 for 222 yards and the 2 interceptions, displaying awful mechanics throughout. Just as he did at Lambeau earlier in the year, Stafford struggled mightily without Calvin Johnson. Megatron did suit up despite Sunday morning reports that he would be a game-time decision, but he was highly ineffective. Constantly leaving and reentering the game, Johnson was limited to just 3 catches for 43 yards. Without a solid second option to throw to, Stafford couldn't sustain drives. When he wasn't firing picks and incompletions, he was checking the ball down to Joique Bell, who had 10 grabs for 63 receiving yards. Megatron was second in receiving, tying Joseph Fauria (3-43), who caught a 2.point conversion.    Bell was playing quite frequently because the coaching staff got fed up with Bush, who lost a fumble near midfield in the first half. Bush got another chance following intermission, but he dropped a pass on what would have resulted in a big gain. He was also ineffective when running the ball, gaining just 34 yards on 12 carries. Bell was so much more potent, tallying 91 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts in addition to his receiving yardage.

   "comment":"Bush was the 1 guilty of turning the ball over when the team was melting down late last year. - Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown. This was followed by 1 of the botched field goal tries. - Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. Golden Tate (5-57) also contributed, while Jed Collins logged Stafford's sole touchdown.    It was surprising that Reggie Bush wasn't used much at all, especially considering that Bell fumbled. Bush had 8 touches, carrying the ball 6 times for 26 yards and catching 2 passes for only 6 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Bush was the 1 guilty of turning the ball over when the team was melting down late last year. - Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown. This was followed by 1 of the botched field goal tries. - Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. Golden Tate (5-57) also contributed, while Jed Collins logged Stafford's sole touchdown.    It was surprising that Reggie Bush wasn't used much at all, especially considering that Bell fumbled. Bush had 8 touches, carrying the ball 6 times for 26 yards and catching 2 passes for only 6 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Bush. The Lions, however, struggled after that despite having the luxury of Rolando McClain out of the game with an obscure injury. Stafford was nearly intercepted in the red zone at the end of the first half when he carelessly flung the ball into double coverage. He was then picked right after the break because of a tipped pass by Jeremy Mincey. Stafford topped that off with 2 fumbles on the final drive of the game. He was fortunate to get the first back because the Dallas defender also coughed up the ball, but he didn't have the same luck the second time.    Stafford finished 28-of-42 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown, the interception and 2 lost fumbles. As mentioned, he was hot early on, but was just 11-of-18 for 132 yards and 3 turnovers following halftime. Much like Romo has done in the past, Stafford choked down the stretch.    Stafford's sole score was the 51-yarder to Tate, who led the team with 89 receiving yards on 6 catches. Calvin Johnson (5-85) fell just short of the team lead.    The Lions ran the ball well early on, but Bell mustered only 10 yards after halftime. Bell finished with 43 yards on just 12 carries.

Bush sucked yet again; he dropped a pass on third down during the opening drive and then missed a big hole for a long gain, choosing to go outside for barely any yardage. He is a terrible player the 49ers should not be using right now. It's a complete mystery as to why he's ahead of Jarryd Hayne on the depth chart. Hayne should've been active tonight instead of Bush, but Tomsula is too busy delivering pizzas to realize this.    Another receiver worth mentioning is "
