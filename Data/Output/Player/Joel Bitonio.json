   "comment":"Bitonio and John Greco to explode down the field for an 85-yard touchdown run. Promptly, Joe Haden picked off Flacco to set up the Browns at the Ravens' 27-yard line. McCown converted a third down to Barnidge (4-37) before throwing a quick pass to Coleman in the flat, and Coleman made a tackler miss to get into the end zone from 11 yards out. However, the extra point was blocked and returned by the Ravens for a 2.point conversion. Cleveland had a 20-2 lead and couldn't muster any points the rest of the game. After trading some punts, the Ravens got moving with a 30-yard pass to Dennis Pitta, a 22-yard completion to Crockett Gilmore and a roughing-the-passer penalty. Baltimore finished the drive with Flacco throwing a dart to Mike Wallace (4-41) for a 7-yard score. The Ravens quickly got the ball back as a McCown overthrow floated to Eric Weddle for an interception. That gave them the ball close to midfield with 42 seconds left. That set up a 52-yard field goal for Justin Tucker, and the Browns took a 20-12 lead into halftime. To open the third quarter, Flacco moved the ball down the field with a 19-yard completion to Steve Smith and then a 31-yard pass to Smith (3-64). To finish the drive, Wallace got open for a 17-yard touchdown strike and the Ravens kicked the point to make it 20-19. Baltimore got moving again with a completion to Breshad Perriman (2-32), but Haden came through with an interception in the end zone to protect Cleveland's slim lead. To end the third quarter, McCown hit a 47-yard completion to Coleman as he made a leaping grab over Shareece Wright. However, a few plays later, Coleman got flagged for slugging Jimmy Smith, and that was critical lost yards for Cleveland as Patrick Murray then missed a 52-yard field goal. On the game-winning drive, Flacco hit Pitta (9-102) for a 28-yard gain down the middle of the field, and that set up Tucker to connect on a 49-yard field goal to give the Ravens a 22-20 lead. They tacked on another field goal to extend the lead to 25-20 with just under 3 minutes remaining. McCown had 1 more shot and moved the ball to the Ravens 30 before throwing a ball up for grabs in a crowd of defenders. C.J. Mosley made a leaping interception just in front of the goal line to clinch the victory for Baltimore.    Flacco completed 25-of-45 for 302 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Terrance West (11-42) and Justin Forestt (14-37) were held in check by the Browns.    McCown completed 20-of-33 for 260 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Coleman was impressive with 5 receptions for 104 yards with 2 scores, but his mental mistake and penalty was costly. Terrelle Pryor (3-32) wasn't a factor.    Crowell (18-133-1) was held in check aside from his 85-yard touchdown run.    Defensively, the Ravens played very well after the first quarter and were very stout in the second half. Timmy Jernigan picked up a sack, and rookie Michael Pierce beat Joel Bitonio for a sack. Baltimore's front 7 pounded McCown, and the veteran quarterback played through what looked like a painful shoulder injury. With the Browns' pass protection, it won't be too long before Cody Kessler is playing for Cleveland.   "
