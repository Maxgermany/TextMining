The Chiefs will only get better defensively, as it's a great sign that they're 4-2 right now with Justin Houston not even seeing any game action yet. It'll be up to the offense to produce, and it's too bad for them that they don't get to beat up on the Saints' sorry defense every week. Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. Most of his throws were of the short variety, as you might expect, though he did connect on a long touchdown to Tyreek <strike>Lanister</strike> Hill for a 38-yard strike. He also made an impressive completion to Chris Conley toward the end of the game. It was a third-and-17, and Smith hit Conley for a gain of 18, as Conley somehow managed to tap both toes inbounds before falling out of play.    Both Jeremy Maclin and Travis Kelce disappointed their fantasy owners, especially when considering the promising matchup. Maclin had 4 catches for 40 yards, while Kelce logged just 2 receptions for 24 yards.    Another Chief who disappointed his fantasy owners was Jamaal Charles, though no 1 should have started him after he sustained an injury in practice. There was a question of whether Charles would even play. He touched the ball once, gaining nothing on the carry. He tried to get the edge on the play, but couldn't do it. Charles clearly wasn't 100 percent, so it's strange that he even dressed. Besides, Kansas City has the luxury of having Spencer Ware in the backfield, so Charles isn't really necessary at this point. Ware was terrific once again, gaining 77 yards on 17 carries and also caught a 46-yard touchdown. Thanks to Ware, the Chiefs should just rest Charles until he's absolutely 100-percent healthy.    As for the rest of the Saints' offense, rookie Michael Thomas caught a whopping 10 balls for 130 yards. He outgained both Thomas for a big gain on a third down at the end of the opening half, and he should've been picked off another time, but Ron Parker dropped the ball.

   "comment":"Michael Thomas hit the ball up into the air and served it on a platter to the defense. On the other, Brees missed the safety and lobbed the ball a bit too much. That said, Brees' touchdowns were all solid. However, the last 1 stood out. With the Saints trailing by 6. Brees lofted a pass to Brandin Cooks in the end zone, and Brees perfectly fit it into the window between 2 players. Cooks came down with the ball in what was a huge moment for the team. Brees has to keep making plays like this to continue be 1 of the best quarterbacks in the league.    Despite Brees' success, his top receivers had some issues. Cooks (3-98, 1 TD) did not record a catch until there were 3 minutes left in the second half. He still managed to make some big plays that helped the team a great deal and should continue to be the top receiver for the team. The second-best receiver on the day was Willie Snead (5-47, 2 TD). Snead was actually a red-zone threat despite his size, and he really helped to energize the Saints. He should continue to be a favorite of Brees moving forward. The biggest disappointment of the day was the performance of rookie Michael Thomas. Thomas caught 4 passes for 40 yards, but he was responsible for 3 turnovers. The first was the aforementioned interception he caused, and the other 2 were lost fumbles. He needs to improve his ball security, or he could lose playing time moving forward.    Thomas (8-87, 1 TD) and Emmanuel Sanders (5-54) to lead the way. Thomas was particularly good on the day, and he made a nice 1.handed catch on an early drive. Thomas was able to catch a critical touchdown as well, and he used his size to jump over the New Orleans defensive back who was covering him. Thomas should be a high-end WR2 in most weeks, though he could have issues if Siemian struggles. Meanwhile, Sanders had some nice catches, but he played second fiddle to Thomas today. Sanders is still a strong option in fantasy, but occasionally, he will underproduce depending on the matchup.    The running game for the Broncos was not particularly strong. "

   "comment":"Michael Thomas. Thus, Goff's stat line could've been much better despite the poor blocking. However, the other end of the spectrum needs to be considered as well. Goff had an interception dropped by Thomas Rawls was swallowed up at the line of scrimmage by Aaron Donald, and Seattle, as a result, was constantly stuck in long-yardage situations. That changed after intermission, as the Seahawks opened things up aerially. This should've been the strategy in the first place, as the Rams had 3 missing defensive backs entering this contest and eventually lost a 4.h. Russell Wilson consequently posted a terrific stat line. Wilson misfired just 7 times, going 19-of-26 for 229 yards, 3 touchdowns and a late, careless interception. Wilson's sole mistake, save for that play, was earlier in the red zone, when he lofted an underthrown pass to Jimmy Graham. The ball appeared to be picked off, but it was ruled incomplete on the field and also upon a replay review. It should've been changed to an interception, and I'm saying this as someone who had a wager on the Seahawks. The officials were completely incompetent in this game, blowing numerous decisions and spots.    Rawls, meanwhile, managed just 34 yards on 21 carries. He had a nice, 12-yard burst in the second half, but couldn't find any running room otherwise. Rawls is a decent back, but the Seahawks will be thrilled to have C.J. Prosise back in the lineup soon.    Wilson's scores went to 3 different players: Tyler Lockett (7-130), Doug Baldwin (5-35) and Luke Willson (3-19). Jimmy Graham was a disappointment for his fantasy owners, catching only 1 pass for 31 yards. He was targeted on only 1 other occasion, and that was the aforementioned near-interception.    Before moving on to the Rams, a couple of injuries are noteworthy: Michael Bennett appeared to be knocked out with a concussion. This happened just 1 play after he was flagged 15 yards for twerking following a sack that would've forced 4.h down. The play never should've happened, so it seems like Bennett was being penalized karmically for doing something a grown, big man should never do. Meanwhile, punter Jon Ryan was knocked out following a fake punt. The fake punt was a curious decision, as the Seahawks ran it from their own 27, up 24-3 with 6 minutes remaining in regulation. Many took issue with this, but I didn't mind it, as NFL teams should be encouraged to embarrass their divisional rivals. Meanwhile, Kam Chancellor left the game at 1 point, but only did so temporarily. Losing him would've been a massive blow for Seattle's playoff chances.    As for the Rams, this performance gave their few fans very little hope that Jared Goff could evolve into a franchise quarterback. Goff barely completed half of his passes, going 13-of-25 for only 135 yards. Goff was victimized by several drops, including a deep ball that should've been caught by Michael Thomas. Thus, Goff's stat line could've been much better despite the poor blocking. However, the other end of the spectrum needs to be considered as well. Goff had an interception dropped by "

   "comment":"Michael Thomas (6-91) and Alvin Kamara (6-75, 1 TD).Thomas (6-91) and Alvin Kamara (6-75, 1 TD). Thomas saw a team-high 11 targets and was able to find space against Washington's secondary. On 1 nice catch, Thomas caught a short pass and proceeded to spin away from the defenders and push ahead for an extra 6 yards. As for Kamara, he did a lot of damage as a receiver and was able to catch what turned out to be the tying touchdown pass. Kamara was heavily targeted by Brees out of the backfield during the 2-minute drill in the first half. Kamara's versatility makes him a huge threat, and he can be trusted as a high-end RB2. . Brees' other favorite targets were tight end "
