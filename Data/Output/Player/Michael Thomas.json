   "comment":"Michael Thomas for a big gain on a third down at the end of the opening half, and he should've been picked off another time, but Ron Parker dropped the ball.    The Chiefs will only get better defensively, as it's a great sign that they're 4-2 right now with Justin Houston not even seeing any game action yet. It'll be up to the offense to produce, and it's too bad for them that they don't get to beat up on the Saints' sorry defense every week. Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. Most of his throws were of the short variety, as you might expect, though he did connect on a long touchdown to Tyreek <strike>Lanister</strike> Hill for a 38-yard strike. He also made an impressive completion to Chris Conley toward the end of the game. It was a third-and-17, and Smith hit Conley for a gain of 18, as Conley somehow managed to tap both toes inbounds before falling out of play.    Both Jeremy Maclin and Travis Kelce disappointed their fantasy owners, especially when considering the promising matchup. Maclin had 4 catches for 40 yards, while Kelce logged just 2 receptions for 24 yards.    Another Chief who disappointed his fantasy owners was Jamaal Charles, though no 1 should have started him after he sustained an injury in practice. There was a question of whether Charles would even play. He touched the ball once, gaining nothing on the carry. He tried to get the edge on the play, but couldn't do it. Charles clearly wasn't 100 percent, so it's strange that he even dressed. Besides, Kansas City has the luxury of having Spencer Ware in the backfield, so Charles isn't really necessary at this point. Ware was terrific once again, gaining 77 yards on 17 carries and also caught a 46-yard touchdown. Thanks to Ware, the Chiefs should just rest Charles until he's absolutely 100-percent healthy.    As for the rest of the Saints' offense, rookie Michael Thomas caught a whopping 10 balls for 130 yards. He outgained both "

   "comment":"Michael Thomas hit the ball up into the air and served it on a platter to the defense. On the other, Brees missed the safety and lobbed the ball a bit too much. That said, Brees' touchdowns were all solid. However, the last 1 stood out. With the Saints trailing by 6. Brees lofted a pass to Brandin Cooks in the end zone, and Brees perfectly fit it into the window between 2 players. Cooks came down with the ball in what was a huge moment for the team. Brees has to keep making plays like this to continue be 1 of the best quarterbacks in the league.    Despite Brees' success, his top receivers had some issues. Cooks (3-98, 1 TD) did not record a catch until there were 3 minutes left in the second half. He still managed to make some big plays that helped the team a great deal and should continue to be the top receiver for the team. The second-best receiver on the day was Willie Snead (5-47, 2 TD). Snead was actually a red-zone threat despite his size, and he really helped to energize the Saints. He should continue to be a favorite of Brees moving forward. The biggest disappointment of the day was the performance of rookie Michael Thomas. Thomas caught 4 passes for 40 yards, but he was responsible for 3 turnovers. The first was the aforementioned interception he caused, and the other 2 were lost fumbles. He needs to improve his ball security, or he could lose playing time moving forward.    "

Ginn had a long touchdown this week, and is a potentially game-breaking athlete who could serve as a boom-or-bust FLEX play most weeks. He's not usually a recommended start, but he can be stashed on a bench as a depth guy. <b>Final Note:</b> New Orleans' defense has come out of nowhere to be 1 of the best units in the NFL. "

   "comment":"Michael Thomas (8-65) and Ginn (4-59, 1 TD). Thomas should continue to be a WR2 in fantasy, though his touchdown production hasn't been quite as good this season. He is the top option for the Saints' passing attack, and he should do well down the stretch. Ginn had a long touchdown this week, and is a potentially game-breaking athlete who could serve as a boom-or-bust FLEX play most weeks. He's not usually a recommended start, but he can be stashed on a bench as a depth guy. <b>Final Note:</b> New Orleans' defense has come out of nowhere to be 1 of the best units in the NFL. "
