He wasn't sacked a single time, and there were instances in which he stood in the pocket for 6 or more seconds without anyone even coming close to him. It's mind-boggling that the Giants' high-priced defensive line couldn't generate an sort of heat on Rodgers.    "

   "comment":"Apple blew the coverage. And just like that, the Rams carried a 27-10 lead into halftime, and New York couldn't muster anything in the second half because of the team's severe limitations.    Goff finished 14-of-22 for 311 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was excellent once again, taking advantage of a New York defense missing numerous key players. In addition to Jenkins, Olivier Vernon and top linebacker B.J. Goodson were both out, and Goff had a terrific performance as a consequence.    Given that Woods and Watkins both had big gains of 50-plus yards, it's not a surprise that they led the team in receiving. Woods caught 4 balls for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Watkins' 67-yard score was his only reception. "
