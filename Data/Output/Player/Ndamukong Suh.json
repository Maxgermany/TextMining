He went 17-of-30 for 210 yards, 1 touchdown and a really stupid interception that he tossed with the lead late in the 4.h quarter. McNabb and Grossman were sacked 6 times.    Yet another game where Santana Moss caught 6 or more passes; Moss had 6 grabs for 56 yards. Anthony Armstrong paced the Redskins with 92 yards on 3 catches.    Ryan Torain really disappointed fantasy owners; he mustered just 10 yards on 9 carries.    Having said all that, the Lions ultimately won this game, and they deserve the credit. It's really a shame because this is what we were supposed to see all year. Finally healthy, Matthew Stafford went 26-of-45 for 212 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Stafford started slow and appeared rusty early on, but really picked it up in the second half.    Calvin Johnson is a monster. He caught 9 passes for 101 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brandon Pettigrew hauled in Stafford's other score.    Jahvid Best rushed for just 48 yards on 12 carries, but also had 5 receptions for 31 more yards.    Ndamukong Suh appears as though he'll be running away with the Defensive Rookie of the Year Award. In addition to the aforementioned touchdown, Suh had 2 sacks, bringing his season total to 6.5.   "

Detroit definitely made the plays down the stretch and deserved to win the game, but Oakland head coach Hue Jackson cost his team a chance to seal the game on more than 1 occasion. His aggressive nature did not pay off on the failed 4.h down costing a field-goal opportunity, and after pounding Bush to try to run out the clock, Jackson might have been able to secure the win simply by running him once or twice more late in the game. The decision to kick an extra point while up by 12 midway through the 4.h quarter might have been the worst decision though, and hopefully, he will learn from these mistakes for the sake of Raider Nation. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Suh tipped pass that was caught by DeAndre Leavy for an interception in the end zone. Cutler wasn't same by the end of the first half as he hobbled with his hip injury, a new ankle injury and a swollen hand. In the third quarter, Reggie Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte. He returned the interception 35 yards to the Lions' 9.yard line. A justified holding call on Matt Slausson took away a Matt Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Chris Houston, but the review of the play took the touchdown away as Jeffery had to re-control the ball when he landed on his back out of bounds. The Bears settled for a field goal and a 14-13 deficit. Conte came back with a clutch breakup covering Johnson in the end zone. David Akers missed the field goal, but it didn't matter as Stafford and Bush (14-105) moved the ball into Chicago territory on Detroit's next possession. Johnson beat Tillman in man coverage for a 14-yard score to give the Lions an 8.point lead with a little more than 2 minutes remaining. Josh McCown came in for the Bears' final drive of the game. Nick Fairley had a unnecessary roughness that gave Chicago a first down, but he recorded a sack. McCown moved the ball with some intermediate passes before hitting Marshall for an 11-yard touchdown. It was a great throw by McCown to get Marshall (7-139) open in the end zone. The 2.point conversion fell incomplete, but Willie Young was hit with a personal foul helmet-to-helmet hit on McCown to give Chicago another attempt. On the retry, a run by Forte was blown up by Fairley for a loss. The Lions recovered the onside kick to clinch the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished completing 18-of-35 for 219 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. The unsung hero was Detroit's offensive line. The Bears' defense that ravaged Green Bay was held without a sack.    Cutler was 21-of-40 for 250 yards with a score and a pick. He played well considering his injuries. The Lions' defense was led by Fairley and Suh as each recorded sacks, but Detroit's secondary really struggled to cover Marshall and Jeffery. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Ziggy Ansah then took over on the next drive. He snuffed out a reverse and was able to tackle Jarvis Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - Matthew Stafford launched a pass toward Megatron deep downfield, but Brent Grimes was able to snare it with an amazing 1.handed catch. It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because "

The Bears' final hope ended as Glover Quin recorded his 7.h interception of the year.    Stafford was 22-of-39 for 243 yards with 2 interceptions. He didn't have his best game, but moved the ball well. Calvin Johnson led the Lions with 6 catches for 103 yards.    Clausen played well for Chicago and did a nice job of throwing the ball accurately while seeing a steady pass rush from the Lions' defense. His receivers really let him down, as the Bears totaled 7 dropped passes. Jeffery was the biggest culprit. Clausen was 23-of-39 for 181 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.    Defensively, Suh was phenomenal with 2 sacks, 4 tackles and a ton of disruption. "

   "comment":"Suh hit Brady low, prompting the New England quarterback to hobble around. Brady only appeared to twist his ankle though, and he remained on the field until close to the very end. Once it was clear that Brady was going to have to throw, it was apparent that the Patriots were definitely going to be in trouble. Brady had absolutely no time in the pocket, and I'm not exaggerating. He was often hit by multiple defenders before moving to his second read. This obviously affected his accuracy, as he was way off the mark all afternoon whenever he tried to go downfield. Brady finished 12-of-21 for 134 yards, and most of that came on a 68-yard checkdown to "

   "comment":"Suh inadvertently stepped on his foot. On the next play, Wilson waved the white flag, throwing the ball into the dirt. It appeared as though he might leave the game, as Trevone Boykin began warming up, but to Wilson's credit, he did not miss a single snap. He showed great toughness by remaining on the field, but wasn't nearly as effective because he lost his mobility. Wilson's elusiveness is so important to his game, especially considering the state of his offensive line. If he can't move around like he normally does, Seattle's offense is going to be severely limited. Wilson finished 27-of-43 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and early interception where he threw the ball up for grabs while under pressure, giving the Dolphins a free field goal. However, he rushed for only 16 yards, and the Seahawks had trouble maintaining drives as a consequence. Wilson did manage to step up when it counted most though, leading his team to a game-winning touchdown at the end of regulation. That said, the touchdown never should've counted because the officials missed a blatant offensive pass interference in the end zone.    Wilson's game-winning touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Suh and company no chance to pressure him. It was working great - Garoppolo's first incompletion came after he began 8-of-8 for 116 yards and a touchdown - but then disaster struck. Kiko Alonso, who missed a tackle early in the game to set up a New England touchdown, pummeled Garoppolo into the ground, and the young quarterback sustained an injured shoulder as a result. Garoppolo, who was having the game of his life - 18-of-27, 234 yards and 3 touchdowns in a quarter-and-a-half - was knocked out for the rest of the afternoon and will miss the next 6 weeks. I'm sure panic set in for New England fans until they realized that they were up big and had to spend just 2 more weeks without Tom Brady, 1 of which will be against Buffalo. Third-round rookie Jacoby Brissett stepped in and wasn't nearly as effective. He went 6-of-9 for 92 yards, but most of his plays featured screens and play-action fakes. The Dolphins were able to roar back, turning a 31-3 deficit into a 31-24 margin with 6 minutes remaining. It appeared as though they'd be able to tie the game, and all they'd have to do was stop the Patriots and their third-string quarterback just once and then score again versus a tired defense. The Dolphins, however, couldn't stop a New England offense featuring LeGarrette Blount running in between the tackles behind 3 rookie linemen. That's right - star players like Ndamukong Suh, Cameron Wake and Mario Williams were trampled by Blount and 3 rookies."
