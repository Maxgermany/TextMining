   "comment":"Ndamukong Suh.    McNabb didn't play particularly well, but shouldn't have been benched. He went 17-of-30 for 210 yards, 1 touchdown and a really stupid interception that he tossed with the lead late in the 4.h quarter. McNabb and Grossman were sacked 6 times.    Yet another game where Santana Moss caught 6 or more passes; Moss had 6 grabs for 56 yards. Anthony Armstrong paced the Redskins with 92 yards on 3 catches.    Ryan Torain really disappointed fantasy owners; he mustered just 10 yards on 9 carries.    Having said all that, the Lions ultimately won this game, and they deserve the credit. It's really a shame because this is what we were supposed to see all year. Finally healthy, Matthew Stafford went 26-of-45 for 212 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. Stafford started slow and appeared rusty early on, but really picked it up in the second half.    Calvin Johnson is a monster. He caught 9 passes for 101 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brandon Pettigrew hauled in Stafford's other score.    Jahvid Best rushed for just 48 yards on 12 carries, but also had 5 receptions for 31 more yards.    Ndamukong Suh appears as though he'll be running away with the Defensive Rookie of the Year Award. In addition to the aforementioned touchdown, Suh had 2 sacks, bringing his season total to 6.5.   "

It turned an incompletion on a third down to a first down around midfield. Romo's next play was a 37-yard pass to Witten. That led to a field goal and a 30-17 lead. After the Lion defense got Stafford back in the game, he returned the favor in the 4.h quarter when he finally got the ball into the end zone. Stafford threw a jump ball in the end zone for Johnson, and Megatron out leaped 2 defenders to come down with a 23-yard touchdown catch. After a 3.and-out, the Lions moved the ball, but sloppy play and penalties forced Detroit to settle for a field goal to make it a 3.point game. Detroit put up 10 more points to narrow it to 30-27. With just over 4 minutes remaining, Romo was pressured by Suh. He tossed a ball up for Witten that was short of his tight end. Linebacker "

Detroit definitely made the plays down the stretch and deserved to win the game, but Oakland head coach Hue Jackson cost his team a chance to seal the game on more than 1 occasion. His aggressive nature did not pay off on the failed 4.h down costing a field-goal opportunity, and after pounding Bush to try to run out the clock, Jackson might have been able to secure the win simply by running him once or twice more late in the game. The decision to kick an extra point while up by 12 midway through the 4.h quarter might have been the worst decision though, and hopefully, he will learn from these mistakes for the sake of Raider Nation. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Brady only appeared to twist his ankle though, and he remained on the field until close to the very end. Once it was clear that Brady was going to have to throw, it was apparent that the Patriots were definitely going to be in trouble. Brady had absolutely no time in the pocket, and I'm not exaggerating. He was often hit by multiple defenders before moving to his second read. This obviously affected his accuracy, as he was way off the mark all afternoon whenever he tried to go downfield. Brady finished 12-of-21 for 134 yards, and most of that came on a 68-yard checkdown to "

   "comment":"Ndamukong Suh inadvertently stepped on his foot. On the next play, Wilson waved the white flag, throwing the ball into the dirt. It appeared as though he might leave the game, as Trevone Boykin began warming up, but to Wilson's credit, he did not miss a single snap. He showed great toughness by remaining on the field, but wasn't nearly as effective because he lost his mobility. Wilson's elusiveness is so important to his game, especially considering the state of his offensive line. If he can't move around like he normally does, Seattle's offense is going to be severely limited. Wilson finished 27-of-43 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and early interception where he threw the ball up for grabs while under pressure, giving the Dolphins a free field goal. However, he rushed for only 16 yards, and the Seahawks had trouble maintaining drives as a consequence. Wilson did manage to step up when it counted most though, leading his team to a game-winning touchdown at the end of regulation. That said, the touchdown never should've counted because the officials missed a blatant offensive pass interference in the end zone.    Wilson's game-winning touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Ndamukong Suh and company no chance to pressure him. It was working great - Garoppolo's first incompletion came after he began 8-of-8 for 116 yards and a touchdown - but then disaster struck. Kiko Alonso, who missed a tackle early in the game to set up a New England touchdown, pummeled Garoppolo into the ground, and the young quarterback sustained an injured shoulder as a result. Garoppolo, who was having the game of his life - 18-of-27, 234 yards and 3 touchdowns in a quarter-and-a-half - was knocked out for the rest of the afternoon and will miss the next 6 weeks. I'm sure panic set in for New England fans until they realized that they were up big and had to spend just 2 more weeks without Tom Brady, 1 of which will be against Buffalo. Third-round rookie Jacoby Brissett stepped in and wasn't nearly as effective. He went 6-of-9 for 92 yards, but most of his plays featured screens and play-action fakes. The Dolphins were able to roar back, turning a 31-3 deficit into a 31-24 margin with 6 minutes remaining. It appeared as though they'd be able to tie the game, and all they'd have to do was stop the Patriots and their third-string quarterback just once and then score again versus a tired defense. The Dolphins, however, couldn't stop a New England offense featuring LeGarrette Blount running in between the tackles behind 3 rookie linemen. That's right - star players like Ndamukong Suh, Cameron Wake and Mario Williams were trampled by Blount and 3 rookies."
