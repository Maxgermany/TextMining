   "comment":"Doug Martin fumbled the ball away at midfield. That spotted Arizona 3 points. With 3 minutes remaining, Mike Glennon was intercepted by Peterson on a poorly thrown pass as Peterson had Vincent Jackson (2-27) perfectly covered. Peterson's return set up the Cardinals at the Bucs' 13-yard line. The next play saw Carson Palmer throw a strike to Larry Fitzgerald (6-68) for a touchdown. He beat Darrelle Revis to get open in the end zone. That tied the game at 10 with 3 minutes remaining. Glennon was soon sacked by Dontay Moch at the 1-yard line and a punt set up Arizona at the Tampa Bay 38. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for 19 yards and a Dashon Goldson unnecessary roughness penalty set up an easy game-winning field goal for Jay Feely. Peterson iced the game with his second interception at midfield.    The Bucs benched Josh Freeman because of turnover and accuracy problems, but got the exact same thing from Mike Glennon. Nobody should be surprised because Glennon was inaccurate and threw a lot of picks at N. C. State. The rookie completed 24-of-43 passes for 193 yards with 2 interceptions and a touchdown to Mike Williams (4-38). Glennon's score came after a Rashard Mendenhall fumble.    The Bucs' defense played well, but blew a 4.h-quarter lead for the third time in 4 games. Gerald McCoy was phenomenal for Tampa Bay. He had a sack, recovered a fumble and was in the backfield all day. Revis played well too, as he held Fitzgerald without a catch in the first half. In Buccaneers' territory, Revis picked off a pass intended for Fitzgerald in the third quarter. Revis also forced a fumble late in the 4.h quarter. Tampa Bay rookie corner Johnthan Banks made an awesome interception in the end zone with a leaping catch to take points away from Arizona.    Palmer was 21-of-38 for 248 yards with a touchdown and those 2 picks. Against a team with a decent offense, he wouldn't have played well enough to win. Michael Floyd was his top receiver as he caught 5 for 87 yards. WalterFootball.com caught up with Fitzgerald after the game, and he summed up the game nicely, The first half that [sic] was some ugly ball in the first half. All around. The defense kept fighting and fighting to keep the game manageable for us. Those guys played their tail off. They got banged up and we lost lots of bodies last week, but guys continued to step up in their roles and that is what a team is about.    Mendenhall was terrible for the Cardinals. Early on, he dropped an easy pass and fumbled the ball away after running into Fitzgerald. Mendenhall also fumbled the ball out of bounds after a strip by Revis inside the Bucs' 10-yard line when Arizona was setting up the go-ahead field goal. The Cardinals should bench Mendenhall and let young backs Andre Ellington (4-29 rushing, 3-22 receiving) and Stepfan Taylor see if they can produce more.    Cardinals linebacker Karlos Dansby played really well with 9 tackles, but he dropped an interception that could have put up easy points for Arizona. Veterans Calais Campbell, Darnell Dockett and Yeremiah Bell all looked good for the Cardinals.    Doug Martin ran for 45 yards on 27 carries. If he's on your fantasy team and you have a talented backup, you might want to bench Martin if you have solid, alternative options. Cardinals rookie "

Instead, we'll give Smith a pass and credit for showing some guts.    Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has taken some recent criticism from fans for not coming up with big plays, but he made 1 against the Falcons. On the final play of overtime, McCoy got to Matt Ryan and tied the quarterback's legs up, forcing an incompletion.    Tampa Bay's defense had a huge outing, forcing 4 turnovers that were converted into 20 points. Rookie middle linebacker Kwon Alexander was a force, coming up with a fumble recovery and an interception.    Winston didn't have a big fantasy day, but he had a solid reality day. He completed 16-of-29 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, Winston didn't throw an interception for the third-straight game, and he showed plenty of poise late in the game.    Atlanta's defense clearly was focused on slowing running back Doug Martin, and that strategy worked. Martin was held to 71 yards on 23 carries, ending his streak of 100-yard games at 3.

   "comment":"Doug Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with "

Smith is a coach with a defensive background. But his defense hasn't been very good in his first 2 seasons with the Bucs. Tampa Bay has drafted only 1 defensive player in the last 2 years. That needs to change. The Bucs need to add a pass rusher, and Penn State's Carl Nassib could be a very nice fit. The Bucs also need some help in the defensive secondary, and that likely will come in the second or third round of the draft.    There's no question the Bucs made the right call with the first pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. Quarterback "

Speaking of Martin, he had a tough time finding any running room, gaining 63 yards on 24 carries, and this includes a gain of 12, meaning his other 23 attempts went for only 51 yards. Martin at least helped his team as a receiver, but he dropped a pass on what appeared to be a very promising screen.    Moving on to the Chiefs, "

Martin can definitely get the job done in short-yardage situations, but the team should look to mix Sims in a bit more. Sims only saw 4 carries on Sunday, but he turned them into 17 yards.
