   "comment":"Martin runs and Josh Freeman precision passes. It ended with a short touchdown pass from Freeman to Mike Williams (2-12). The Panthers had zero pass rush as Freeman had all day to throw the ball in the first half. They played better in the second half and were able to sack Freeman a couple of times.    Carolina's offense showed signs of life in the second half, too. Newton hit Steve Smith for 32 yards. Newton then had a nice third-down conversion to tight end Greg Olsen, before capping the drive with a touchdown strike to Brandon LaFell, who beat rookie safety Mark Barron to get wide open. Newton dropped in a bomb for 51 yards to Louis Murphy after he beat Talib down the field with 5 minutes in the 4.h quarter. The drive stalled inside the 5.yard line and Carolina settled for a field goal.    Tampa Bay ran out the clock with Martin to seal the win for new head coach Greg Schiano. The rookie running back totaled 95 yards on 24 carries. "

   "comment":"Martin (24-138) had some big runs to move the ball down the field in the extra session. Freeman then threw to a wide open Dallas Clark (7-58) for the game-winning 15-yard score.    The Panthers helped Tampa Bay to an early lead after Captain Munnerlyn fumbled a punt away. That set up the Bucs for an easy touchdown on a pass from Freeman to Nate Byham. Tampa Bay was up 10-0 and driving in Carolina territory when Freeman was pressured and threw a ball up for grabs. Munnerlyn chased the ball down and took off down the field for a 74-yard return for a score. The Panthers took the lead on a drive that featured a 30-yard screen to Jonathan Stewart and 17-yard pass to Steve Smith (5-61). Mark Barron was flagged for a pass interference on a third-and-goal in the end zone to give Carolina a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Stewart (15-43) powered into the end zone on the next play to give Carolina a 14-10 lead. The Panthers were on the move a bit later when Newton had a run of about 15-yards on a third-and-13. He juked Barron to get the extra yards needed. Newton lofted in a 32-yarder to Greg Olsen (2-42) a few plays later. Carolina blew the drive with a missed 40-yard field goal.  The Panthers went for an idiotic fake punt in their own territory in the third quarter and it was easily stopped. Freeman threw an interception on the next play to Haruki Nakamura. The Bucs went for a 4.h-and-1 from the Panthers 1-yard line early in the 4.h quarter. Martin plunged into the pile and fumbled the ball away on a hit from Thomas Davis."

   "comment":"Martin added another touchdown to make it 21 unanswered for the home team and a 21-10 lead. Late in the 4.h quarter, Foles turned into Brett Favre with 2 jaw-dropping touchdown drives to get a walk-off winner. The rookie quarterback dominated Tampa Bay's anemic secondary. To get the comeback started, Foles had a superb possession that ended with a touchdown toss to Clay Harbor (6-52). The 2-point attempt went incomplete and left Philadelphia needing another touchdown. Foles' final drive was legendary as he ripped the ball down the field. On 4.h-and-5, the rookie drilled a 22-yard bullet to Avant to the 1-yard line. The Eagles managed to spike the ball fast enough to leave 2 seconds on the clock and time for 1 more play. Foles rolled out and threw a fastball to Jeremy Maclin (9-104) for a touchdown.    Foles finished 32-of-51 for 381 yards with 2 scores throwing, 1 rushing and zero interceptions. He was utterly amazing in crunch time. If Foles has a good NFL career ,this will be the game that is remembered as the start of it all.    Freeman was hot garbage in the first half and the Bucs were shut out. He was 5-of-16 for 61 yards. Martin had only 34 yards on 9 carries as the Eagles' defense was owning the line of scrimmage. "

   "comment":"Martin (24-65) never got going because Tampa Bay couldn't open holes, and the Jets were superb in their gap integrity. Freeman had some accuracy issues, but I don't think it is fair to pin the loss on him considering his offensive line was God awful at opening running lanes and giving him time to throw. His line allowed 3 sacks and a ton of pressure. Donald Penn was beaten for sacks by Muhammed Wilkerson and Antwaun Barnes. Freeman was 15-of-31 for 210 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Geno Smith's first pass was a 26-yard gain to Jeremy Kerley (3-45), and the rookie improved as the game progressed. Smith definitely had moments where he looked like a rookie. Smith panicked under heavy blitzes. On 1. he held onto the ball too long and Mason Foster (2 sacks) managed a strip-sack inside the Jets' 5.yard line that was recovered by Tampa Bay. That set up a 5.yard touchdown run from Martin. Smith later gave it back to the Bucs with a terribly inaccurate pass intercepted by Lavonte David. Smith had a nice drive just before halfime, making 2 good throws to "

   "comment":"Martin fumbled the ball away at midfield. That spotted Arizona 3 points. With 3 minutes remaining, Mike Glennon was intercepted by Peterson on a poorly thrown pass as Peterson had Vincent Jackson (2-27) perfectly covered. Peterson's return set up the Cardinals at the Bucs' 13-yard line. The next play saw Carson Palmer throw a strike to Larry Fitzgerald (6-68) for a touchdown. He beat Darrelle Revis to get open in the end zone. That tied the game at 10 with 3 minutes remaining. Glennon was soon sacked by Dontay Moch at the 1-yard line and a punt set up Arizona at the Tampa Bay 38. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for 19 yards and a Dashon Goldson unnecessary roughness penalty set up an easy game-winning field goal for Jay Feely. Peterson iced the game with his second interception at midfield.    The Bucs benched Josh Freeman because of turnover and accuracy problems, but got the exact same thing from Mike Glennon. Nobody should be surprised because Glennon was inaccurate and threw a lot of picks at N. C. State. The rookie completed 24-of-43 passes for 193 yards with 2 interceptions and a touchdown to Mike Williams (4-38). Glennon's score came after a Rashard Mendenhall fumble.    The Bucs' defense played well, but blew a 4.h-quarter lead for the third time in 4 games. Gerald McCoy was phenomenal for Tampa Bay. He had a sack, recovered a fumble and was in the backfield all day. Revis played well too, as he held Fitzgerald without a catch in the first half. In Buccaneers' territory, Revis picked off a pass intended for Fitzgerald in the third quarter. Revis also forced a fumble late in the 4.h quarter. Tampa Bay rookie corner Johnthan Banks made an awesome interception in the end zone with a leaping catch to take points away from Arizona.    Palmer was 21-of-38 for 248 yards with a touchdown and those 2 picks. Against a team with a decent offense, he wouldn't have played well enough to win. Michael Floyd was his top receiver as he caught 5 for 87 yards. WalterFootball.com caught up with Fitzgerald after the game, and he summed up the game nicely, The first half that [sic] was some ugly ball in the first half. All around. The defense kept fighting and fighting to keep the game manageable for us. Those guys played their tail off. They got banged up and we lost lots of bodies last week, but guys continued to step up in their roles and that is what a team is about.    Mendenhall was terrible for the Cardinals. Early on, he dropped an easy pass and fumbled the ball away after running into Fitzgerald. Mendenhall also fumbled the ball out of bounds after a strip by Revis inside the Bucs' 10-yard line when Arizona was setting up the go-ahead field goal. The Cardinals should bench Mendenhall and let young backs Andre Ellington (4-29 rushing, 3-22 receiving) and Stepfan Taylor see if they can produce more.    Cardinals linebacker Karlos Dansby played really well with 9 tackles, but he dropped an interception that could have put up easy points for Arizona. Veterans Calais Campbell, Darnell Dockett and Yeremiah Bell all looked good for the Cardinals.    Doug Martin ran for 45 yards on 27 carries. If he's on your fantasy team and you have a talented backup, you might want to bench Martin if you have solid, alternative options. Cardinals rookie "

Smith has his share of detractors, but the win (as the Bucs head into a bye week) should silence the doubters for a while.    Martin's 2-year slump appears to be over. He's running the way he did as a rookie in 2012. Martin had his second-straight 100-yard rushing game. He finished with 123 yards on 24 carries and had 3 catches for 35 yards. Martin had 2 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown. The most impressive part might have been that Martin was running behind a make-shift offensive line.

Instead, we'll give Smith a pass and credit for showing some guts.    Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has taken some recent criticism from fans for not coming up with big plays, but he made 1 against the Falcons. On the final play of overtime, McCoy got to Matt Ryan and tied the quarterback's legs up, forcing an incompletion.    Tampa Bay's defense had a huge outing, forcing 4 turnovers that were converted into 20 points. Rookie middle linebacker Kwon Alexander was a force, coming up with a fumble recovery and an interception.    Winston didn't have a big fantasy day, but he had a solid reality day. He completed 16-of-29 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, Winston didn't throw an interception for the third-straight game, and he showed plenty of poise late in the game.    Atlanta's defense clearly was focused on slowing running back Doug Martin, and that strategy worked. Martin was held to 71 yards on 23 carries, ending his streak of 100-yard games at 3.

   "comment":"Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with "

   "comment":"Martin ran into the end zone. However, this score was nullified by a hold, forcing the team to kick a field goal. Much later, Mike Evans dropped a deep pass that would've set up Tampa with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line. Instead, another field goal had to be attempted, and this 1 was missed. The third screw-up is something I'll mention later. The errors ruined what could've been a solid game for Jameis Winston, who went 20-of-36 for 245 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception. Thanks to Winston, the Buccaneers were 7-of-13 on third down. He was mostly precise when it mattered most in the opening half, and his numbers would've been much better had Evans hauled in that aforementioned pass. That said, Winston struggled in the second half when the Colts began putting more pressure on him. The heat he was under forced some poor throws as the game progressed.    Thanks to his blunder, Evans was second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 64 yards. Vincent Jackson (4-76) was ahead of him, with both receivers seeing 10 targets. Meanwhile, Winston's sole score went to someone named Cameron Brate (5-53), who was playing in place of Austin Seferian-Jenkins. This offense will be much better once Seferian-Jenkins returns.    Martin also just missed out on a great game. He gained 97 yards on 14 just carries, as he wasn't able to touch the ball as often as he should have because the Buccaneers were playing catch-up throughout the second half. As mentioned, Martin also scored, but had the touchdown wiped out because of a penalty.    The Colts, on the other hand, were not able to run the ball at all, so they had trouble putting this game away when they were up in the second half. "

   "comment":"Martin had at winning the rushing title went out the window when the Bucs fell behind early. Martin carried only 15 times for 48 yards.    Smith is a coach with a defensive background. But his defense hasn't been very good in his first 2 seasons with the Bucs. Tampa Bay has drafted only 1 defensive player in the last 2 years. That needs to change. The Bucs need to add a pass rusher, and Penn State's Carl Nassib could be a very nice fit. The Bucs also need some help in the defensive secondary, and that likely will come in the second or third round of the draft.    There's no question the Bucs made the right call with the first pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. Quarterback "

   "comment":"Martin was lost with a hamstring. Winston threw 2 more interceptions, 1 of which came when the Buccaneers still had a chance to make a comeback. Down 20, the Buccaneers once again had a promising drive in the works, but Winston launched a high pass to Sims, which was tipped into the air. The ball fell right into Cooper's hands, and Cooper ran it back for a touchdown. Cooper replaced the woefully inept Brandon Williams at corner and was so much better. Winston finished 27-of-52 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown, 4 interceptions and a lost fumble. While the score was a nice 1 - it was a beautiful back-shoulder throw to Mike Evans, who was seeing coverage from Patrick Peterson - Winston's stat line could've been even worse than it was because the Cardinals dropped at least 3 more potential interceptions. One was thrown right to Peterson, who somehow couldn't come up with the turnover.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, really needed to rebound following the loss to New England last week. Carson Palmer was better in this contest, going 18-of-31 for 308 yards and 3 touchdowns, but some of his passes were still off the mark, and he just doesn't look the same. It's worth noting that his stat line is inflated by a 58-yard reception by David Johnson, who was able to break free after catching a short pass because Kwon Alexander whiffed on a tackle. Palmer also should've thrown an interception in the end zone, though it's unclear if Johnson ran the wrong route. Brent Grimes dropped the ball, killing Tampa's chances of mounting a comeback because the Cardinals ended up scoring a touchdown on that drive, putting the game out of reach.    Speaking of Johnson, he didn't do much besides that long reception, managing just 45 yards on 12 carries. He was given just 2 attempts following halftime, as the Cardinals correctly decided to preserve him. Johnson also caught 3 balls for 98 receiving yards.    Larry Fitzgerald continues to dominate. Fitzgerald caught 6 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. He nearly found the end zone again, but was tackled just shy of the goal line. Palmer's other scores went to Michael Floyd (2-8) and Jaron Brown (2-78). As for John Brown, he continued to do nothing, hauling in 1 pass for 14 yards. He's not healthy, and Palmer isn't as sharp as he's been in past years.    Going back to the Buccaneers, despite Winston's struggles, Evans still caught 6 balls for 70 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. However, he did so on 17 targets. Evans had issues getting open against Peterson. He also dropped a pass and was called for offensive pass interference. Winston's other primary receivers were Vincent Jackson (4-44) and Adam Humphries (6-67), who ruined an early drive because he collapsed on third down just over midfield.    Martin going down was huge for the Buccaneers. Martin was able to pick up 23 yards on 7 carries. Sims gained 24 yards on 9 tries. He also caught 3 passes, but for only 4 receiving yards. He also hurt his team by knocking the ball out of Winston's hands.    Much won't be made of this because the kick was inconsequential, but Robert Aguayo whiffed from 45, sailing the ball wide right.   "

Martin can definitely get the job done in short-yardage situations, but the team should look to mix Sims in a bit more. Sims only saw 4 carries on Sunday, but he turned them into 17 yards. Though the numbers have not been great, the running back group for the Buccaneers appears to be a solid 1.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Martin. The drive end with a short touchdown toss to Howard. Taylor to move the ball through the Bucs' defense, connecting with O'Leary for 32 yards to convert a third-and-long. That set up Stephen Hauschka, who, this time, was good on a 52-yard field goal. Tampa Bay responded with Winston finding Howard wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. The Bills left Howard completely uncovered after a boot action. Taylor soon snatched 23 yards with Deonte Thompson getting wide open, but then Lavonte David stripped McCoy of the ball, and David recovered it for Tampa Bay near midfield. Winston was able to take advantage with a touchdown strike to Evans after he got a step on Tre'Davious White while running across the back of the end zone. That gave Tampa Bay a 27-20 lead late in the 4.h quarter. Buffalo immediately responded as Taylor connected with Thompson for 44 yards and Robert McClain was hit with a 15-yard penalty to move the ball inside the 20. A couple plays later, McCoy redeemed himself with a 7-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 27. The Bucs' next offensive play saw Adam Humphries get stripped by White and the Bills first-round pick recover the fumble. The Bills then ran down the clock before Hauschka hit a short field goal to give them the win.    Taylor was 20-of-33 for 268 yards with 1 touchdown through the air. He ran for 53 yards on 6 carries.    McCoy had 91 yards on 23 carries with 2 touchdowns. He had 5 receptions for 31 yards, but also fumbled.    Thompson was signed on Tuesday of this week, and he had a phenomenal game for Buffalo with 4 receptions for 107 yards.    Winston finished completing 32-of-44 for 382 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Evans had 7 catches for 86 yards and a touchdown. Howard entered this game with only 5 receptions on the season, but he broke out with 6 catches for 98 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Martin ran for 49 yards on 20 carries with 2 catches for 31 yards.    Defensively, David played really well for Tampa Bay with 14 tackles and a forced fumble. The Bucs' "
