   "comment":"Henderson for a touchdown, making it 48 straight games that he found a receiver in the end zone. Brees endured some rough spots in this game despite the fact that he went 29-of-45 for 370 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He too frequently threw behind his receivers; he was guilty of his sole pick on 1 such occasion. The problem was 2.fold. First, his offensive line once again struggled to pass protect, surrendering 3 sacks, which is a ton for a quarterback who releases the ball as quickly as Brees. Second, Jimmy Graham suffered an ankle injury in the second quarter. He returned to the game but was clearly hobbled. He couldn't get open and only served as a decoy.    Brees was awesome in the 4.h quarter, so I don't want to take any credit away from him or his teammates, but the officials had a huge say in this game. The Chargers actually had a pick-six in the third quarter, but the turnover was nullified by a helmet-to-helmet hit on Brees. That was a legitimate penalty, but the refs made some very ticky-tack calls on big Charger gains on the final drive. At 1 point, San Diego was whistled for 3 consecutive penalties and found itself in a 2nd-and-37, only to be bailed out by a good hands-to-the-face call, though that strangely gave the Chargers a first down despite the fact that it was just a 5.yard infraction. I'll never understand why that's an automatic first down, and I never will. Ultimately though, it didn't matter because Rivers was strip-sacked in Saints' territory. Martez Wilson easily got around laboring left tackle Jared Gaither, who couldn't move because his back apparently flared up.    The antics on the final drive ruined a great performance from Rivers, who went 27-of-42 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Rivers should have thrown a third score, but the ball was knocked out of Antonio Gates' hands at the last second.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Robert Meachem, who caught 3 balls for 67 yards. It seemed like the Chargers were determined to get the ball to Meachem in an attempt to stick it to the Saints. Before you get excited, however, Meachem was targeted only 5 times in Rivers' 42 attempts. Malcom Floyd (5-108) was much more involved on offense. Gates (3-19) did nothing, killing his fantasy owners with that dropped touchdown.    Ryan Mathews ran with purpose in attempt to win back the faith of Norv Turner. He rushed for 80 yards and a touchdown on just 12 carries and also chipped in with 6 catches for 59 receiving yards. The discouraging thing is that he was replaced by Jackie Battle in a goal-line situation. He also saw Ronnie Brown get touches on the final drive.    As for the Saints, Henderson (8-123) had a breakout performance, which included the record-setting score, but it was Marques Colston who posted the best numbers, snagging 9 balls for 131 yards and a whopping 3 touchdowns."

Had Henderson made the reception, the Saints would have scored at least 3 points, meaning it would've been just a 1.possession game at halftime. Instead, they were down 10 and then 17 following the opening third-quarter possession, forcing the Saints to be completely 1.dimensional, which further magnified the pass-protection issues. Brees was 14-of-28 for 135 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception when the Saints punted the ball away, down 31-10 with a 4th-and-1 on their own 29. That's when they waved the white flag. Brees compiled some junk yardage and a meaningless touchdown, finishing 22-of-42 for 213 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Clearly bothered by the pressure, Brees' passes were all over the place.
