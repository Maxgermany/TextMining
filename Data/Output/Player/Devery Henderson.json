Brees endured some rough spots in this game despite the fact that he went 29-of-45 for 370 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He too frequently threw behind his receivers; he was guilty of his sole pick on 1 such occasion. The problem was 2.fold. First, his offensive line once again struggled to pass protect, surrendering 3 sacks, which is a ton for a quarterback who releases the ball as quickly as Brees. Second, "

   "comment":"Devery Henderson's hands at the end of the first quarter. Had Henderson made the reception, the Saints would have scored at least 3 points, meaning it would've been just a 1.possession game at halftime. Instead, they were down 10 and then 17 following the opening third-quarter possession, forcing the Saints to be completely 1.dimensional, which further magnified the pass-protection issues. Brees was 14-of-28 for 135 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception when the Saints punted the ball away, down 31-10 with a 4th-and-1 on their own 29. That's when they waved the white flag. Brees compiled some junk yardage and a meaningless touchdown, finishing 22-of-42 for 213 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Clearly bothered by the pressure, Brees' passes were all over the place. He threw behind many of his targets.    Brees' touchdowns went to "
