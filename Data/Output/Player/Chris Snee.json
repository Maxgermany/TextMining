   "comment":"Chris Snee, ruined their chances of scoring on a 1st-and-goal at the Chargers 4-yard line, up late 17-14. New York had to settle for a field goal, allowing Rivers to engineer his game-winning drive. Also an issue was pass protection. New York surrendered 5 sacks to a previously challenged San Diego defense.    At least the Giants were able to run the ball on San Diego.
