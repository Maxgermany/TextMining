   "comment":"Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on Coty Sensabaugh to move the ball down the field. To end the drive, he went over Sensabaugh for a 15-yard touchdown. Texans safety Eddie Pleasant soon ripped the ball from Antonio Andrews for an interception at Tennessee's 34-yard line. A few plays later, Weeden threw a well-placed pass to Nate Washington for a 16-yard touchdown. A field goal drive expanded the Texans lead to 34. In the fourth quarter, on a third-and-goal, J.J. Watt strip-sacked Zach Mettenberger and Houston recovered.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 117 yards and a score. What he's done this year with Houston's 4 different starting quarterbacks is truly remarkable.    Weeden was 15-of-24 for 200 yards with 2 touchdowns and a running score. Daniels was used as a read-option quarterback with 6 carries for 6 yards and 1 completion for 7 yards on 2 pass attempts.    David Cobb had 7 carries for 18 yards and Bishop Sankey had 2 for 11. Sankey also caught 3 passes for 43 yards.    Titans tight end Delanie Walker had 9 receptions for 59 yards. Harry Douglas led Tennessee's receivers with 6 catches for 79 yards. Kendall Wright snagged 3 passes for 18 yards before leaving with a knee injury. Dorial Green-Beckham was held without a catch.    The Titans maintain the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft with this loss. Tennessee leads the NFL with 50 sacks allowed, and building around Marcus Mariota will be critical. Thus, Ole Miss left tackle Laremy Tunsil is making all kinds of sense. On a related note, Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan left the game with a concussion.    The Texans got a good game out of their secondary with nice performances by their trio of first-round cornerbacks Johnathan Joseph, Kevin Johnson and Kareem Jackson. Watt had 4 tackles with his strip-sack and drew 2 holding penalties. In the fourth quarter, however, "

   "comment":"Jacksonville offense that has been a steady point-machine this season. The Jaguars finished 5-11 in 2015, and Blake Bortles showed great improvement under new offensive coordinator Greg Olson, but improving the offensive line and defense are critical for 2016 with Gus Bradley entering the season on the hot seat. Luke Joeckel was the No. 2-overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, but he is a liability for the Jaguars' offense. Going against Joeckel, Watt and Whitney Mercilus combined for 5 sacks ((2 strip-sacks). Joeckel looked pathetic trying to block them.    The Texans' second possession produced a field goal as they got close to the end zone thanks to a completion to DeAndre Hopkins and a 20-yard pass to rookie Jaelen Strong. On their next drive, they moved methodically down the field before Hoyer connected with Jonathan Grimes for a 14-yard touchdown. The Jaguars answered as blown coverage by Brian Cushing let Allen Robinson get open and take off down the field for a gain of 36 yards. That led to a Jacksonville field goal. "
