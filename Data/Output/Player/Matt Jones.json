The Jaguars were successful from 4.h-and-one on their own 41 in their first quarter. Though the drive didn't go anywhere, I have to applaud Jack Del Rio's aggression. It makes me sick when ultra-conservative coaches like Herm Edwards and Eric Mangini don't take chances.    "

   "comment":"Matt Jones, a third-round rookie running back. Jones generated 123 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns, and also caught 3 passes for 23 receiving yards. The numbers are completely legit; Jones looked every bit as good as the stats indicate. He ran with great power and explosion, and St. Louis looked completely helpless to stop him. He opened the game with a 39-yard scoring run, and he managed to out-carry "

   "comment":"Matt Jones fumbled the ball into the end zone, resulting in a touchback. As you can tell, this was a horrible coaching effort by the Redskins. They didn't seem prepared to play, as Tom Coughlin coached circles around Jay Gruden. The Giants, meanwhile, improved to 1-2. They could - not should, like Jim Nantz repeatedly said - be 3-0 right now had they not blown consecutive double-digit leads in the 4.h quarter. They managed to hold on this time, at least, albeit against an opponent they've dominated for years.    Kirk Cousins had an awful game. The final numbers weren't bad - 30-of-48, 316 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but most of his yardage came in garbage time. By the time the score was 25-6 late in the second half, Cousins was just 11-of-19 for 132 yards and the 2 picks. That means that nearly 200 yards and a touchdown occurred when the game was out of hand, and the Giants were playing a simple prevent defense. Cousins is most definitely not the long-term solution for the Redskins. Both picks were poor throws, including his first 1 that he telegraphed, which showed how 10.ative he was. He could've thrown multiple scores, but his passes were underthrown and/or late. He was hurt by some drops, but many of his long-range passes were off the mark, at least when the verdict of this game was still up in the air.    The Redskins were expected to run the ball well in this contest; New York's ground defense hasn't been very good, while Matt Jones and Alfred Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents."

He looked explosive against the Cowboys' weak defensive line and had a couple of nice gains on the day. The team really needs him to improve as the roster does not really have any other viable ball-carriers.    In terms of the pass game, the Redskins were really able to spread the ball around. Ten different receivers caught passes for the team, and their 2 tight ends "

Late in the first quarter, the Redskins got on the move with a completion to Niles Paul taking the ball across midfield. They moved the ball close to the end zone, but Matt Jones had his second fumble of the game and the Lions recovered the ball in the end zone to take points away from Washington.
