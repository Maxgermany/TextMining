   "comment":"Jones-Drew looked like they were running in quicksand, as they totaled just 31 yards on 14 carries.    The defense was a problem as well; the Jaguars made Chris Johnson look like the second coming of Marshall Faulk. In his first NFL game, Johnson rushed for 93 yards and caught 3 passes for 34 more yards and a score. LenDale White received the same amount of carries as Johnson (15), but collected just 40 yards. Johnson's role in this offense will continue to grow. Meanwhile, when the Titans inserted a real quarterback into the lineup, they were able to move the chains through the air as well; Kerry Collins was 2-of-2 for 65 yards.    Of course, the fake quarterback I'm referring to is Vince Young, who was 12-of-22 for 110 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions before he left the game with a leg injury. Young also fumbled once. On the ground, he totaled just 4 yards. I know his receivers suck, but Kerry Collins was able to manage more than half the passing yardage Young had in 20 less throws. I'm being facetious here, as most of Collins' yardage came after the catch, but the fact remains that Young was once again struggling.    The 1 bright spot for the Jaguars was Matt Jones. Now free of coke and master of the playbook, Jones led the squad with 6 receptions and 80 yards.    The Jaguars were successful from fourth-and-1 on their own 41 in their first quarter. Though the drive didn't go anywhere, I have to applaud Jack Del Rio's aggression. It makes me sick when ultra-conservative coaches like Herm Edwards and Eric Mangini don't take chances.    "

   "comment":"Jones fumbled the ball into the end zone, resulting in a touchback. As you can tell, this was a horrible coaching effort by the Redskins. They didn't seem prepared to play, as Tom Coughlin coached circles around Jay Gruden. The Giants, meanwhile, improved to 1-2. They could - not should, like Jim Nantz repeatedly said - be 3-0 right now had they not blown consecutive double-digit leads in the fourth quarter. They managed to hold on this time, at least, albeit against an opponent they've dominated for years.    Kirk Cousins had an awful game. The final numbers weren't bad - 30-of-48, 316 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but most of his yardage came in garbage time. By the time the score was 25-6 late in the second half, Cousins was just 11-of-19 for 132 yards and the 2 picks. That means that nearly 200 yards and a touchdown occurred when the game was out of hand, and the Giants were playing a simple prevent defense. Cousins is most definitely not the long-term solution for the Redskins. Both picks were poor throws, including his first 1 that he telegraphed, which showed how tentative he was. He could've thrown multiple scores, but his passes were underthrown and/or late. He was hurt by some drops, but many of his long-range passes were off the mark, at least when the verdict of this game was still up in the air.    The Redskins were expected to run the ball well in this contest; New York's ground defense hasn't been very good, while Matt Jones and Alfred Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents."

I'll have more on this later, but the books are having such a bad year that some of the squarer shops may have to either take out huge loans or close down.    The Redskins spent much of the day targeting Atlanta cornerback Robert Alford because they didn't want to mess with Desmond Trufant on the other side. That plan ended up biting the Redskins when it mattered most. Alford intercepted a Kirk Cousins pass on the first drive of overtime and returned it for a game-winning touchdown. The pass was intended for Ryan Grant, who slipped on the play. The win wasn't particularly impressive for the Falcons, but it pushed their record to 5-0. The Falcons are 5-0 for only the second time in franchise history. They started 8-0 in 2012. However, this victory wasn't easy for Atlanta. The Falcons trailed for much of the game as quarterback Matt Ryan uncharacteristically struggled at home for much of the day. But Ryan got hot at the end to put the Falcons ahead with less than a minute left in regulation. The Redskins (2-3) forced overtime when Dustin Hopkins hit a 52-yard field goal as time expired.    Ryan threw 2 horrible interceptions earlier in the game and wasn't as accurate as usual. He completed 24-of-42 passes for 254 yards with no touchdowns on a day when Washington did a good job of keeping Julio Jones and Roddy White quiet."

   "comment":"Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the fourth quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a fourth-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over Josh Norman, for what was called a touchdown, but upon review, Perriman only got 1 foot down and it was overturned to an incompletion. On fourth down, Will Compton broke up a pass intended for Wallace.    Joe Flacco was 30-of-46 for 210 yards and 1 touchdown. Baltimore's offensive line had problems protecting Flacco in the second half. Terrance West (11-95) led the Ravens on the ground.    Mike Wallace (7-63) was Baltimore's leading receiver. Dennis Pitta (7-59) played well, while Steve Smith (3-29) left the game with an ankle injury. Midway through the game, Breshard Perriman (2-11) dropped a perfect bomb for what should have been a 50-yard touchdown and didn't get his second foot down on the end-zone catch in the fourth quarter.    Kirk Cousins was 29-of-41 for 260 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Garcon led the Redskins receiving. Jordan Reed (8-53) could have had a bigger game, but Cousins missed some throws.    Matt Jones (14-31 rushing, 2-25 receiving) was contained by the Ravens' defense.    Washington's front 7 won the line of scrimmage in the second half with sacks coming from "
