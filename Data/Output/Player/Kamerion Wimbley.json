However, the fumble was ruled an incomplete pass because Rodgers was tucking the ball back in. I'm sure Woodson, who forced that now infamous non-fumble when he was with the Raiders, had to be chuckling when the referee uttered the word tuck after returning from the replay booth to overturn the call. Also of note, Rodgers had a little extra motivation for this 1 dating back to his college days. He is still bitter about his California Bears being stiffed for a Rose Bowl berth in favor of the Texas Longhorns. Current Raider Wimbley returned it for a touchdown.
