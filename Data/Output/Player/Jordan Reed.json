Pierre Garcon had an inefficient evening, catching 5 of his 12 targets for 64 yards. Don't blame Garcon though; Cousins had him open for a touchdown, but the ball was underthrown.

   "comment":"Jordan Reed. Cousins nearly made another mistake on an incompletion in the end zone, but it worked out for the Redskins, as Eric Kendricks and Anthony Barr collided. Kendricks, who had been missing the past couple of weeks, was knocked out for the afternoon with a hip injury, which ended up being a huge blow because the Redskins were able to use bootlegs to fool the Minnesota linebackers on misdirection throughout the afternoon. Cousins was also able to torch Barr on a deep touchdown to Vernon Davis on the ensuing drive. Cousins ended up missing on a few deep shots, but he was pretty accurate for the most part. He spent most of the second half targeting Mackensie Alexander after Xavier Rhodes was knocked out with a concussion. It goes without saying that as with Kendicks' absence, Rhodes being out was absolutely huge. The Redskins' offense simply couldn't be stopped following intermission after the Vikings seemed to perhaps figure things out in the second quarter. Cousins finished 22-of-33 for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, his accuracy was very good, and he was able to throw some perfect dimes at times. Sure, the Vikings were missing Kendricks for the entire game and Rhodes for the final quarter, but Cousins' performance was impressive nonetheless, especially when considering that Trent Williams was out of the lineup, while right tackle Morgan Moses got banged up. Moses sustained an injury, but returned after missing a few plays. He wasn't completely healthy though, as he was limping around.    Robert Kelley made the start for the Redskins, as Matt Jones was a healthy scratch. Kelley ran well, gaining 97 yards on 22 carries. Kelley had some spurts in this contest that would've gone for losses, but he was able to power his way forward for pick-ups of 3 to 4 yards at a time. He's a strong runner, and he appears to definitely be an upgrade over the fumble-prone Jones.    With DeSean Jackson out, Pierre Garcon saw the most targets (10) and led the team with 6 catches for 81 yards. Davis (3-66) and Jamison Crowder (4-37) caught touchdowns, while Jordan Reed disappointed, finishing with just 2 grabs for 41 yards.    As for the Vikings, they have only themselves to blame for this loss. Despite Cousins' strong performance, the Vikings were in position to win. They led 20-14 at halftime, but poor play-calling crushed them in the second half. For example, "

   "comment":"Jordan Reed, meanwhile, snatched 5 of his 6 targets for 79 yards. He dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Kelley, meanwhile, continued to impress after supplanting Matt Jones as the starting running back. Kelley scored a whopping 3 touchdowns, generating 139 yards on 24 carries. A big chunk of his yardage came at the very end following a Green Bay fumble that effectively ended the game, but Kelley was once again an extremely strong runner, moving the pile on most occasions to pick up 3 or 4 yards when he had no running room. Kelley's sole mistake was a dropped pass in the opening half.    As for Rodgers, he started very slowly. In fact, the Packers didn't pick up a first down on their opening 3 drives in a game for the first time since 2010. The heavy winds really bothered Rodgers, unlike Cousins, which would explain why he generated most of his production in the second and 4.h quarters when he was playing with the wind. Rodgers finished 26-of-41 for 351 yards and 3 touchdowns. The numbers look great, and while Rodgers didn't play poorly or anything, he still wasn't quite himself. He didn't see some things the Rodgers of old would've noticed. He also was errant on some passes that pre-2015 Rodgers would've completed in his sleep. There were 2 occasions in which Rodgers was guilty of a delay-of-game penalty, though he got to use a timeout to negate 1. His head just doesn't seem to be completely in the game.    Rodgers' score went to "

   "comment":"Jordan Reed (4-37) had a nice drive that saw him notch a few catches. Rigth now, there is no de facto top receiver, so it's hard to recommend any as a fantasy option. Doctson probably has the most upside, but even he is inconsistent.    With Robert Kelley out, the Redskins relied on Thompson to carry the load. He received 16 carries but was only able to get 33 yards. Thompson was bottled up in the second half for the most part. Samaje Perine also got a fair amount of action, and he was marginally better, gaining 23 yards on 9 carries. The team will be better off when Kelley is back to action, as the Redskins need a true power back for their offense.    In the first half, the San Francisco offense was completely lifeless. Under Brian Hoyer, the unit was barely able to accomplish anything. The 49ers were down 17-0 and Hoyer was 4-of-11 for just 34 yards before Kyle Shanahan chose to remove Hoyer from the game and play "
