   "comment":"Reed (4-37) moved the chains with an 18-yard run on a read option and 2 third-down conversions on receptions against Eric Weddle. Robert Griffin III hit Pierre Garcon for 30 yards, but the drive stalled inside the 10. A chip-shot field goal was blocked by Lawrence Guy. Chargers' punter Mike Scifres had 2 punts down to the 1-yard line. The second punt resulted in a defensive touchdown for San Diego. Griffin had a pass batted by Guy, and it ping-ponged off a few linemen before Sean Lissemore was able to control it for a pick-6. Just when the Chargers were looking like they were taking control of the game, Rivers and wide receiver Vincent Brown weren't on the same page as Brown cut outside when Rivers thought he would go to the inside. The ball floated to E.J. Biggers for an interception. A Griffin pass to Leonard Hankerson (5-55) and 2 runs by Alfred Morris ate up the remaining 30-plus yards and a touchdown for Morris. San Diego took the lead just before halftime. D.J. Fluker had a great block on a wide receiver screen to Eddie Royal (4-56) for a 15-yard touchdown. Corey Liuget batted 2 passes just before halftime and blocked a long field goal attempt on the final play. In the third quarter, Garcon (7-172) made a highlight reel 38-yard catch where he batted the ball up with 1 hand and controlled it after the ball bounced off Derek Cox. An option run to Santana Moss went for 18-yards and Darrel Young plowed into the end zone to tie the game. The next drive saw Young dive in for his second touchdown. Rivers threw to a perfectly covered Keenan Allen early in the fourth quarter and David Amerson cut underneath for an interception. That led to a 47-yard field goal for Washington. Rivers came back to lead a nice drive with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Allen (8-128), who beat Amerson with a double move. With a few minutes remaining, Rivers engineered a great drive. He converted a fourth down with a 26-yard completion to Allen, who was left uncovered. A pass to Danny Woodhead took the ball to the 6-inch line, but a great tackle by Amerson kept Woodhead (7-21 rushing, 9-77 receiving) out of the end zone. The Redskins came up with a clutch goal-line stand to force a field goal and overtime. The Chargers had terrible play-calling by Ken Whisenhunt, as San Diego threw the ball twice despite having timeouts available and being less than a yard from a game-winning touchdown. In overtime, Morris (25-121) had a nice run, and Griffin had great throws to Reed and Garcon to move the ball down the field. Young (5-12) scored his third touchdown from a few yards out to win the game for Washington.    Griffin was 23-of-32 for 291 yards with an interception. He also ran for 17 yards.    Rivers was 29-of-46 for 341 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. "

   "comment":"Reed, Pierre Garcon and Santana Moss in the end zone.    Ponder, despite the dubious first possession, had a pretty solid outing. He let the ball hit the ground just 3 times, going 17-of-21 for 174 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was going up against a putrid defense, but the fact remains that he played very well after the ugly interception. Ponder also had a 14-yard scramble that appeared to be another score, but replay showed that the ball was fumbled and dribbled out of bounds just short of the goal line. Unfortunately, Ponder suffered an injury on the dive and had to leave the game. Matt Cassel - not Josh Freeman - took over for Ponder and also looked decent, completing 4-of-6 passes for 47 yards. Ponder hit a key throw that allowed Minnesota to bleed out the clock.    The Redskins couldn't exactly concentrate on Ponder (or Cassel) because they had to worry about wrapping up Adrian Peterson. The stud back didn't have a great YPC - he gained 75 yards on 20 carries - but he scored twice and ran really tough, dragging defenders with him on multiple occasions.    John Carlson had a big game for Minnesota. Taking over for the injured Kyle Rudolph, Carlson led the Vikings with 7 catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. Cordarrelle Patterson also scored, as he caught both of his passes (for 22 yards) on a single drive. Meanwhile, Greg Jennings struggled yet again with 3 catches for only 18 yards.    As for Girffin, he went 24-of-37 for 281 yards and 3 touchdowns, along with 7 scrambles for 44 rushing yards. He was masterful until the middle of the third quarter; at 1 point, he was 18-of-24 for 221 yards and the 3 scores. He was particularly lethal on third down, converting 9 of 16 tries, including a third-and-15 to Garcon. However, Griffin finished just 6-of-13 for 60 yards because the Minnesota pressure got to him. Kevin Williams dominated the interior of the line of scrimmage, collecting 2.5 sacks.    Griffin's scores went to Garcon (7-119), Reed (6-62) and Logan Paulsen."

   "comment":"Reed. Up 11-0, Washington looked like it was in great shape, while a reeling Rodgers was just 1-of-8 for 11 yards, missing open receivers and looking skittish. And then, everything changed, and I mean everything. The Redskins scored just 1 touchdown after that, while Rodgers caught fire. Following his 1-of-8 start, Rodgers went 20-of-28 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns the rest of the way. The quarterback who couldn't fire a pass within 10 yards of his receivers disappeared, and the Rodgers of old abused Washington's miserable secondary. He was the primary factor for the Packers outscoring the Redskins, 35-7, following that 11-0 start by Washington.    Rodgers' final numbers were 21-of-36 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns. He sparked the Packers' offense surge in the second quarter, while the running game capped things off. Rodgers threw just 8 times following intermission, which was for the best, given the windy conditions. Eddie Lacy and James Starks trampled the Redskins in the second half. I was surprised they didn't accomplish that prior to intermission, given how poor Washington was versus the run to close out the season. However, they got rolling as the game progressed. Lacy and Starks each were given 12 carries, which they turned into 63 and 53 yards, respectively. Both scored as well. Lacy had a sequence in which he converted a fourth-and-1 with a 13-yard burst, followed by a 30-yard gallop, setting up the Starks score, which put the Packers up for good.    Rodgers' 2 scores went to Davante Adams (4-48) and Randall Cobb (3-38). Both had some negative moments, however. Cobb dropped a pass, while Adams sustained a knee injury in the second half. It's a shame, as Adams was having a rare, great performance, which included an amazing catch. James Jones (7-81) paced the team with 11 targets.    Unlike Rodgers, Cousins regressed as the evening went on. Cousins went 12-of-18 for 127 yards and a touchdown in the first half, but couldn't do anything following the opening drive of the third quarter. The Packers put a great amount of pressure on him, sacking him a whopping 6 times. Cousins ultimately finished 29-of-46 for 329 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and a lost fumble. He was very fortunate not to be intercepted, as Green Bay had chances to pick him off on multiple occasions. Cousins played well overall, but Green Bay overwhelmed him in the second half. The offensive line will have to be upgraded, which is what I have happening in the day(-2 rounds of my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    Cousins had the most success throwing to Jordan Reed, whom the Packers couldn't cover. Reed caught 9 of his 17 targets for 120 yards and a touchdown.    Aside from Reed, only 2 Redskins logged more than 20 receptions: "

   "comment":"Reed. Cousins nearly made another mistake on an incompletion in the end zone, but it worked out for the Redskins, as Eric Kendricks and Anthony Barr collided. Kendricks, who had been missing the past couple of weeks, was knocked out for the afternoon with a hip injury, which ended up being a huge blow because the Redskins were able to use bootlegs to fool the Minnesota linebackers on misdirection throughout the afternoon. Cousins was also able to torch Barr on a deep touchdown to Vernon Davis on the ensuing drive. Cousins ended up missing on a few deep shots, but he was pretty accurate for the most part. He spent most of the second half targeting Mackensie Alexander after Xavier Rhodes was knocked out with a concussion. It goes without saying that as with Kendicks' absence, Rhodes being out was absolutely huge. The Redskins' offense simply couldn't be stopped following intermission after the Vikings seemed to perhaps figure things out in the second quarter. Cousins finished 22-of-33 for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, his accuracy was very good, and he was able to throw some perfect dimes at times. Sure, the Vikings were missing Kendricks for the entire game and Rhodes for the final quarter, but Cousins' performance was impressive nonetheless, especially when considering that Trent Williams was out of the lineup, while right tackle Morgan Moses got banged up. Moses sustained an injury, but returned after missing a few plays. He wasn't completely healthy though, as he was limping around.    Robert Kelley made the start for the Redskins, as Matt Jones was a healthy scratch. Kelley ran well, gaining 97 yards on 22 carries. Kelley had some spurts in this contest that would've gone for losses, but he was able to power his way forward for pick-ups of 3 to 4 yards at a time. He's a strong runner, and he appears to definitely be an upgrade over the fumble-prone Jones.    With DeSean Jackson out, Pierre Garcon saw the most targets (10) and led the team with 6 catches for 81 yards. Davis (3-66) and Jamison Crowder (4-37) caught touchdowns, while Jordan Reed disappointed, finishing with just 2 grabs for 41 yards.    As for the Vikings, they have only themselves to blame for this loss. Despite Cousins' strong performance, the Vikings were in position to win. They led 20-14 at halftime, but poor play-calling crushed them in the second half. For example, "

   "comment":"Reed, meanwhile, snatched 5 of his 6 targets for 79 yards. He dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Kelley, meanwhile, continued to impress after supplanting Matt Jones as the starting running back. Kelley scored a whopping 3 touchdowns, generating 139 yards on 24 carries. A big chunk of his yardage came at the very end following a Green Bay fumble that effectively ended the game, but Kelley was once again an extremely strong runner, moving the pile on most occasions to pick up 3 or 4 yards when he had no running room. Kelley's sole mistake was a dropped pass in the opening half.    As for Rodgers, he started very slowly. In fact, the Packers didn't pick up a first down on their opening 3 drives in a game for the first time since 2010. The heavy winds really bothered Rodgers, unlike Cousins, which would explain why he generated most of his production in the second and fourth quarters when he was playing with the wind. Rodgers finished 26-of-41 for 351 yards and 3 touchdowns. The numbers look great, and while Rodgers didn't play poorly or anything, he still wasn't quite himself. He didn't see some things the Rodgers of old would've noticed. He also was errant on some passes that pre-2015 Rodgers would've completed in his sleep. There were 2 occasions in which Rodgers was guilty of a delay-of-game penalty, though he got to use a timeout to negate 1. His head just doesn't seem to be completely in the game.    Rodgers' score went to "

   "comment":"Reed (6-48) led the team in catches and yardage, and he could have done better had he not missed part of the second half with an injury. The other top targets were Jamison Crowder (4-47) and Terrelle Pryor (2-31). Crowder was much better after his abysmal opener, but he still didn't get enough space to make explosive plays. He is a WR3, at best for now, until Cousins improves. Meanwhile, Pryor was a major disappointment as he had only 1 catch before the final drive. He had another brutal drop and doesn't have chemistry with Cousins. Pryor is not a guy who should be relied on in most formats.    The real stars of the game on the Redskins' offense were Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson. The 2 running backs were the leaders of the offensive attack, and Kelley looked excellent in the first half. He totaled 78 yards on 12 carries before he went down with a rib injury that kept him out of the rest of the contest. That injury should be monitored, and the team needs to hope it isn't too serious. If he's out for an extended period of time, Samaje Perine (21 carries, 67 yards) will be the man to add. He looked decent in a lot of late action, but he hasn't fully adapted to the NFL yet. Thompson was absolutely electric for the Redskins. He had a couple of touchdowns on 3 carries, and that included a 61-yard burst on a delayed handoff. The scary thing is Thompson could have been better had he not dropped a pass when he was wide open over the middle of the field. He is worth adding in PPR leagues, as he appears to be 1 of Cousins' preferred targets and a legitimate touchdown threat.    The Redskins suffered a lot of injuries in this game. Kelley, Reed, Morgan Moses, Josh Norman, Zach Brown and Mason Foster were all off the field at various points."

   "comment":"Reed (4-37) had a nice drive that saw him notch a few catches. Rigth now, there is no de facto top receiver, so it's hard to recommend any as a fantasy option. Doctson probably has the most upside, but even he is inconsistent.    With Robert Kelley out, the Redskins relied on Thompson to carry the load. He received 16 carries but was only able to get 33 yards. Thompson was bottled up in the second half for the most part. Samaje Perine also got a fair amount of action, and he was marginally better, gaining 23 yards on 9 carries. The team will be better off when Kelley is back to action, as the Redskins need a true power back for their offense.    In the first half, the San Francisco offense was completely lifeless. Under Brian Hoyer, the unit was barely able to accomplish anything. The 49ers were down 17-0 and Hoyer was 4-of-11 for just 34 yards before Kyle Shanahan chose to remove Hoyer from the game and play "
