   "comment":"Ryan Clady had a tough game, starting with wrecking Denver's next drive with a holding penalty leading to a quick punt. Oakland punted right back though, and Tebow really made his presence known even as the crowd chanted his name followed by a word that rhymes with ducks. He faked the handoff to McGahee, a regular play on the afternoon, and ran for 32 yards. Two plays later, he hit "

   "comment":"Ryan Clady. Manning, however, was fortunate. Clady recovered the first fumble, while the second was negated by a defensive hold. Manning finished with meager numbers by his standards, going 14-of-20 for 233 yards and a touchdown. The issue was that Manning missed a valuable chance for a 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter, and then the Denver coaching staff called a ton of rushing plays in the second half. Manning obviously didn't have much of a chance to post great fantasy numbers with just 8 passes in more than a half of action.    The Broncos ran the ball a whopping 35 times. Anderson led the way again, though he didn't find much room against San Diego's improved front, gaining just 85 yards on 29 carries. He appeared to score once, but the officials ruled he was short of the goal line following a replay. Anderson also suffered what seemed like a serious injury after a big hit at 1 point, but he was able to reenter the game after a brief absence.    Only 1 of Manning's targets had a decent outing. "
