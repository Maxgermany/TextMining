Glennon missed some routine throws, including 1 to an open Vincent Jackson in the end zone during the fourth quarter (before Jackson's actual score a bit later). There were also some mental errors, including an untimely delay of game and a false start. However, Glennon proved to be a major upgrade over Josh McCown, and he'll at least keep the Buccaneers competitive in the near future.    Jackson, who secured the decisive touchdown, caught just 3 of his 10 targets for 32 yards otherwise. As mentioned, Glennon missed him, so the inefficiency wasn't all his fault, though he did drop a pass. Evans (4-65) hauled in Glennon's other score, but he injured his groin in the third quarter. "

   "comment":"Evans is proving to be an excellent pick from the new regime, as he destroyed the Redskins to the tune of 209 yards and 2 touchdowns on only 7 receptions. To make this win possible, Washington's offensive line was completely incompetent and allowed 6 sacks. Robert Griffin III held onto the ball too long, but the Redskin blockers made Tampa Bay resemble the line of its late-90s playoff teams.    The inept football got started immediately as the Redskins turned the ball over on their first play from scrimmage. After Lavonte David forgot to tackle Griffin for a sack, Griffin rolled out and threw to Niles Paul. He deflected the ball into the air and linebacker Danny Lansanah snatched the pass for an interception. Josh McCown then fumbled the ball on a strip-sack by Trent Murphy, but Tampa Bay recovered to set up a short field goal. The Bucs added a touchdown after Larry English tipped a Griffin pass that was picked off by Johnthan Banks. He ran it into the end zone from 19 yards out. Clinton McDonald had a nice sack to end a Redskins drive, but Marcus Thigpen muffed the punt, and the Redskins recovered at the Bucs' 17-yard line. Alfred Morris ripped off an impressive run aided by a Lavonte David facemask. Gerald McCoy and Jacquies Smith came up with sacks, and that led to Washington missing a 47-yard field goal. McCown threw a pass up to Mike Evans for a 51-yard gain to set up another field goal. The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by "

   "comment":"Evans was whistled for taunting, which gave the Bears a very short field. Bears: Chicago did nothing with the short field position, as there was a dropped interception. Robbie Gould followed that up with a missed field goal, albeit from 54 yards. The Bears then allowed a completion to Vincent Jackson on a third-and-23. Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims. Both turnovers led to touchdowns. Thanks to a Vincent Jackson fumble (a terrible call by Walt Coleman, who failed to overturn it via replay because he was too senile to remember where he was) and several awful sacks by McCown allowed Chicago to clinch this win and cover.    McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. His play made Jay Cutler look like a quarterback god even though he struggled as well. Cutler, who went 17-of-27 for 130 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, was booed heavily throughout the entire afternoon, particularly when Tampa dropped a potential interception of his on third down. He had some bad incompletions that weren't even close, and he was only able to generate 204 net yards of offense on just 3.6 yards per play. Chicago would have lost this game had its opponent not self-destructed.    With Cutler struggling, Brandon Marshall (3-32) and Alshon Jeffery (3-22) struggled to get yardage, though the latter reeled in a touchdown. Martellus Bennett (4-37) led the team in receiving yards.    Matt Forte was the only Chicago skill-position player to produce much, gaining 89 yards and 2 touchdowns on 23 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 23 receiving yards.    As for the Buccaneers, 2 receivers eclipsed the century mark, and neither was Mike Evans. Jackson (5-117) and Murphy (6-113) were the players, though Evans (3-47) reeled in McCown's sole touchdown.    "

Evans probably shouldn't have even played, but then again, he was a distraction. He's a nice buy-low target; his owners have to feel very frustrated right now, but Winston's solid performance bodes well for his future.    Seferian-Jenkins caught 2 passes for 29 yards, but should've had a better fantasy outing, as Winston missed him in the end zone on a high pass. He remains a low-end TE1 option.    "

   "comment":"Evans dropped a deep pass that would've set up Tampa with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line. Instead, another field goal had to be attempted, and this 1 was missed. The third screw-up is something I'll mention later. The errors ruined what could've been a solid game for Jameis Winston, who went 20-of-36 for 245 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception. Thanks to Winston, the Buccaneers were 7-of-13 on third down. He was mostly precise when it mattered most in the opening half, and his numbers would've been much better had Evans hauled in that aforementioned pass. That said, Winston struggled in the second half when the Colts began putting more pressure on him. The heat he was under forced some poor throws as the game progressed.    Thanks to his blunder, Evans was second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 64 yards. "

He dropped another pass, but he would've enjoyed a much better game had Winston not missed him on numerous occasions. Seferian-Jenkins, meanwhile made only 3 grabs for 29 yards, but he was able to haul in a touchdown at the very end.    Doug Martin and Charlie Sims both ran extremely well. Martin burst for 91 yards on just 18 carries, while Sims (7-50) also posted an impressive stat line. It was odd to see the Rams struggle so much versus the run. However, they did manage to stuff Martin on a fourth down before halftime, and they were able to force him into a fumble.    Some Rams fans were trying to chant Keep the Rams! Keep the Rams! Perhaps St. Louis would keep its team if more fans showed up. Here's a shot of the stands 20 minutes prior to kickoff last Sunday versus the Lions. Try not to laugh too hard:   "

   "comment":"Evans, who was seeing coverage from Patrick Peterson - Winston's stat line could've been even worse than it was because the Cardinals dropped at least 3 more potential interceptions. One was thrown right to Peterson, who somehow couldn't come up with the turnover.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, really needed to rebound following the loss to New England last week. Carson Palmer was better in this contest, going 18-of-31 for 308 yards and 3 touchdowns, but some of his passes were still off the mark, and he just doesn't look the same. It's worth noting that his stat line is inflated by a 58-yard reception by David Johnson, who was able to break free after catching a short pass because Kwon Alexander whiffed on a tackle. Palmer also should've thrown an interception in the end zone, though it's unclear if Johnson ran the wrong route. Brent Grimes dropped the ball, killing Tampa's chances of mounting a comeback because the Cardinals ended up scoring a touchdown on that drive, putting the game out of reach.    Speaking of Johnson, he didn't do much besides that long reception, managing just 45 yards on 12 carries. He was given just 2 attempts following halftime, as the Cardinals correctly decided to preserve him. Johnson also caught 3 balls for 98 receiving yards.    Larry Fitzgerald continues to dominate. Fitzgerald caught 6 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. He nearly found the end zone again, but was tackled just shy of the goal line. Palmer's other scores went to Michael Floyd (2-8) and Jaron Brown (2-78). As for John Brown, he continued to do nothing, hauling in 1 pass for 14 yards. He's not healthy, and Palmer isn't as sharp as he's been in past years.    Going back to the Buccaneers, despite Winston's struggles, Evans still caught 6 balls for 70 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. However, he did so on 17 targets. Evans had issues getting open against Peterson. He also dropped a pass and was called for offensive pass interference. Winston's other primary receivers were "

   "comment":"Evans. which was huge for the Broncos. Elsewhere, Denver was able to sack Winston on a whopping 5 occasions. Derek Wolfe led the way, getting to Winston 2.5 times. Wolfe is a force to be reckoned with, and he may now be the best 3-4 end in all of the NFL. Shaq Barrett and Sylvester Williams each contributed 1 sack, while Von Miller was able to record a half sack on the day.    For Tampa Bay, the offense was just abysmal. The Bucs battled 1 of the league's top defensive units and lost miserably. As mentioned earlier, Jameis Winston was constantly under pressure and just could not get anything done in the passing game. He finished the day a lowly 17-of-35 for 179 yards and threw the 2 picks. On the bright side, Winston did manage to scramble for the team's lone touchdown. Though he made some poor throws, the entire performance was hardly his fault. Every single time Winston dropped back, a Broncos player immediately broke through the line. The Buccaneers have to do something about this issue, or Winston's confidence may get rattled again in the future. Or worse, he could get hurt. Because of the problems on the offensive line, Tampa Bay's receiving corps did not do much outside of garbage time. The team was led in receiving by tight end Cameron Brate (5-67). Brate is establishing himself as a decent starter, and he can be considered a good TE2 in fantasy. Meanwhile, Mike Evans recorded 5 catches for 59 yards. The Broncos did a good job of keeping Evans in check early in the afternoon. About half of his yards came after the game was out of reach. "

Winston lofted a perfect pass into a small window that allowed Shepard to go up and catch the pass. It was definitely Winston's best throw of the game. The final score went to Evans as well. Winston put the pass up where only his tall receiver could get it. It was a smart play that really helped to solidify the lead for the Buccaneers. If Winston can continue to play like this against major competition, that would be great for Tampa. They definitely need him to play well if they want to have any chance of competing in the future.    In terms of the receivers, Evans and Shepard really led the way for the team. They combined to catch 13 of Winston's 21 completions. It looks like they will be the top guys moving forward. Aside from those 2, tight end "

Winston was 6-of-12 for 81 yards and an interception on a Hail Mary at intermission. Winston caught fire coming out of the locker room, leading the Buccaneers on 2 touchdown drives. The Buccaneers, trailing 17-3 at 1 point, were able to take a 20-17 lead, and it appeared as though Tampa would be able to pull the upset. Winston simply couldn't miss. And then, Winston's roller-coaster ride went downhill, as he went 3-and-out on almost every series after that. It wasn't all his fault, as Dallas defensive tackle David Irving caused major problems by flooding the backfield on seemingly every play. It began when Winston was picked off on an overthrow on third-and-long, which was caused by Irving smacking Winston's elbow upon his release. Winston then overthrew an open receiver near the end zone and missed Mike Evans on the penultimate offensive drive of the game. Winston was given 1 more chance, but was picked off in desperation time. Winston finished 17-of-35 for 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. I don't understand how Winston can be so inconsistent over the course of 60 minutes of action. He looked like 3 different quarterbacks in this game. It hurt that right tackle Demar Dotson was out, but there was very little excuse for some of his fourth-quarter misses.    Winston's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Evans. So after 3 quarters, the Saints held a 28-21 lead. The Buccaneers had chances in the fourth quarter, but Winston was without Brate, which put the second-year signal-caller in a tough place, especially as the field shrunk the closer he got to the end zone.    Winston has shown improvement this season, and you can tell a top quarterback is just waiting to come out, but he's still a bit erratic. Winston also doesn't have many weapons to throw to. The Buccaneer loss gives the Atlanta Falcons the NFC South. Tampa Bay's only chance now is to beat the Panthers next week and have Washington lose to the Giants and Green Bay to lose to Detroit. A number of other things need to happen as well, including the 49ers beating the Seahawks.    The Saints are always at their best as a team when they are balanced, as seen over their last 8 games, when Ingram tops 14 carries they've won. The Saints, however, were eliminated from any chance of getting in the playoffs despite their win.   "

   "comment":"Evans missed out on some opportunities as well. He appeared to have a touchdown in the second quarter, but the play was overturned by replay review. Evans also had several drops, including a potential 18-yard reception and another possible touchdown. Despite this, the Buccaneers prevailed, as Folk overcame his earlier troubles to nail the decisive 34-yard kick.    Winston went 22-of-38 for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, Winston should've had a fourth score to Evans. He had a strong performance, considering the mistakes his teammates made. He had some odd misfires, but his game-winning drive at the end more than made up for it. He keeps improving, as it seems as though he's making the next step in his career to becoming an elite quarterback.    Evans, meanwhile, really needs to clean up his drops. He caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a touchdown, but he easily could've found the end zone thrice in this game. He converted fewer than half of his 11 targets, as he was extremely inefficient.    Tampa's leader in receiving yards was "

Buffalo answered with Taylor, connecting for a pair of 26-yard gains, with the first being a completion to Nick O'Leary (2-58) and the second coming on Taylor scrambling to convert a third-and-10. The Bills also settled for a field goal. Tampa Bay responded with another field goal drive. Buffalo quickly responded with LeSean McCoy ripping off 23 yards. Taylor used his legs to move the ball some more before McCoy scored from a few yards out to go up 10-6. A Buffalo edge rusher later burned Bucs left tackle Donovan Smith for a strip sack. The Bills recovered the ball, but a missed field goal bailed out Tampa Bay. With about 30 seconds before halftime, Winston threw a terrible pass to a double-covered and blanketed Cameron Brate (6-60). The pass was easily picked off by Bills linebacker Matt Milano, setting up Buffalo inside the Bucs' 30. However, Buffalo had terrible clock management to let the clock run out inside the 15-yard line without getting a field goal attempt off before the half. In the third quarter, the Bills moved the ball down the field with McCoy before Taylor found tight end Logan Thomas for a 22-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay responded with a long completion to DeSean Jackson (5-73), but a holding call on Donovan Smith canceled out the gain of 54 yards. Winston came back to move down the field using Evans with some runs from Doug Martin."
