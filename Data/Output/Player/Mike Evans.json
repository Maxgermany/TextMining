   "comment":"Mike Evans is proving to be an excellent pick from the new regime, as he destroyed the Redskins to the tune of 209 yards and 2 touchdowns on only 7 receptions. To make this win possible, Washington's offensive line was completely incompetent and allowed 6 sacks. Robert Griffin III held onto the ball too long, but the Redskin blockers made Tampa Bay resemble the line of its late-90s playoff teams.    The inept football got started immediately as the Redskins turned the ball over on their first play from scrimmage. After Lavonte David forgot to tackle Griffin for a sack, Griffin rolled out and threw to Niles Paul. He deflected the ball into the air and linebacker Danny Lansanah snatched the pass for an interception. Josh McCown then fumbled the ball on a strip-sack by Trent Murphy, but Tampa Bay recovered to set up a short field goal. The Bucs added a touchdown after Larry English tipped a Griffin pass that was picked off by Johnthan Banks. He ran it into the end zone from 19 yards out. Clinton McDonald had a nice sack to end a Redskins drive, but Marcus Thigpen muffed the punt, and the Redskins recovered at the Bucs' 17-yard line. Alfred Morris ripped off an impressive run aided by a Lavonte David facemask. Gerald McCoy and Jacquies Smith came up with sacks, and that led to Washington missing a 47-yard field goal. McCown threw a pass up to Mike Evans for a 51-yard gain to set up another field goal. The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by "

Seferian-Jenkins caught 2 passes for 29 yards, but should've had a better fantasy outing, as Winston missed him in the end zone on a high pass. He remains a low-end TE1 option.    "

   "comment":"Mike Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Mike Evans. which was huge for the Broncos. Elsewhere, Denver was able to sack Winston on a whopping 5 occasions. Derek Wolfe led the way, getting to Winston 2.5 times. Wolfe is a force to be reckoned with, and he may now be the best 3-4 end in all of the NFL. Shaq Barrett and Sylvester Williams each contributed 1 sack, while Von Miller was able to record a half sack on the day.    For Tampa Bay, the offense was just abysmal. The Bucs battled 1 of the league's top defensive units and lost miserably. As mentioned earlier, Jameis Winston was constantly under pressure and just could not get anything done in the passing game. He finished the day a lowly 17-of-35 for 179 yards and threw the 2 picks. On the bright side, Winston did manage to scramble for the team's lone touchdown. Though he made some poor throws, the entire performance was hardly his fault. Every single time Winston dropped back, a Broncos player immediately broke through the line. The Buccaneers have to do something about this issue, or Winston's confidence may get rattled again in the future. Or worse, he could get hurt. Because of the problems on the offensive line, Tampa Bay's receiving corps did not do much outside of garbage time. The team was led in receiving by tight end Cameron Brate (5-67). Brate is establishing himself as a decent starter, and he can be considered a good TE2 in fantasy. Meanwhile, Mike Evans recorded 5 catches for 59 yards. The Broncos did a good job of keeping Evans in check early in the afternoon. About half of his yards came after the game was out of reach. "

   "comment":"Mike Evans for a big gain on a slant and then was flagged for a personal foul when he headbutted a Dallas linebacker after the play was over. Winston was 6-of-12 for 81 yards and an interception on a Hail Mary at intermission. Winston caught fire coming out of the locker room, leading the Buccaneers on 2 touchdown drives. The Buccaneers, trailing 17-3 at 1 point, were able to take a 20-17 lead, and it appeared as though Tampa would be able to pull the upset. Winston simply couldn't miss. And then, Winston's roller-coaster ride went downhill, as he went 3.and-out on almost every series after that. It wasn't all his fault, as Dallas defensive tackle David Irving caused major problems by flooding the backfield on seemingly every play. It began when Winston was picked off on an overthrow on third-and-long, which was caused by Irving smacking Winston's elbow upon his release. Winston then overthrew an open receiver near the end zone and missed Mike Evans on the penultimate offensive drive of the game. Winston was given 1 more chance, but was picked off in desperation time. Winston finished 17-of-35 for 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. I don't understand how Winston can be so inconsistent over the course of 60 minutes of action. He looked like 3 different quarterbacks in this game. It hurt that right tackle Demar Dotson was out, but there was very little excuse for some of his 4.h-quarter misses.    Winston's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Mike Evans. So after 3 quarters, the Saints held a 28-21 lead. The Buccaneers had chances in the 4.h quarter, but Winston was without Brate, which put the second-year signal-caller in a tough place, especially as the field shrunk the closer he got to the end zone.    Winston has shown improvement this season, and you can tell a top quarterback is just waiting to come out, but he's still a bit erratic. Winston also doesn't have many weapons to throw to. The Buccaneer loss gives the Atlanta Falcons the NFC South. Tampa Bay's only chance now is to beat the Panthers next week and have Washington lose to the Giants and Green Bay to lose to Detroit. A number of other things need to happen as well, including the 49ers beating the Seahawks.    The Saints are always at their best as a team when they are balanced, as seen over their last 8 games, when Ingram tops 14 carries they've won. The Saints, however, were eliminated from any chance of getting in the playoffs despite their win. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Mike Evans missed out on some opportunities as well. He appeared to have a touchdown in the second quarter, but the play was overturned by replay review. Evans also had several drops, including a potential 18-yard reception and another possible touchdown. Despite this, the Buccaneers prevailed, as Folk overcame his earlier troubles to nail the decisive 34-yard kick.    Winston went 22-of-38 for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, Winston should've had a 4.h score to Evans. He had a strong performance, considering the mistakes his teammates made. He had some odd misfires, but his game-winning drive at the end more than made up for it. He keeps improving, as it seems as though he's making the next step in his career to becoming an elite quarterback.    Evans, meanwhile, really needs to clean up his drops. He caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a touchdown, but he easily could've found the end zone thrice in this game. He converted fewer than half of his 11 targets, as he was extremely inefficient.    Tampa's leader in receiving yards was "
