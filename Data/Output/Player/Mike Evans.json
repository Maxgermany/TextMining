Glennon missed some routine throws, including 1 to an open Evans pulled up lame. This win was great, and both he and his team should enjoy it, but there are some concerns. Glennon missed some routine throws, including 1 to an open Vincent Jackson in the end zone during the 4.h quarter (before Jackson's actual score a bit later). There were also some mental errors, including an untimely delay of game and a false start. However, Glennon proved to be a major upgrade over Josh McCown, and he'll at least keep the Buccaneers competitive in the near future.    Jackson, who secured the decisive touchdown, caught just 3 of his 10 targets for 32 yards otherwise. As mentioned, Glennon missed him, so the inefficiency wasn't all his fault, though he did drop a pass. Evans (4-65) hauled in Glennon's other score, but he injured his groin in the third quarter. "

   "comment":"Mike Evans is proving to be an excellent pick from the new regime, as he destroyed the Redskins to the tune of 209 yards and 2 touchdowns on only 7 receptions. To make this win possible, Washington's offensive line was completely incompetent and allowed 6 sacks. Robert Griffin III held onto the ball too long, but the Redskin blockers made Tampa Bay resemble the line of its late-90s playoff teams.    The inept football got started immediately as the Redskins turned the ball over on their first play from scrimmage. After Lavonte David forgot to tackle Griffin for a sack, Griffin rolled out and threw to Niles Paul. He deflected the ball into the air and linebacker Danny Lansanah snatched the pass for an interception. Josh McCown then fumbled the ball on a strip-sack by Trent Murphy, but Tampa Bay recovered to set up a short field goal. The Bucs added a touchdown after Larry English tipped a Griffin pass that was picked off by Johnthan Banks. He ran it into the end zone from 19 yards out. Clinton McDonald had a nice sack to end a Redskins drive, but Marcus Thigpen muffed the punt, and the Redskins recovered at the Bucs' 17-yard line. Alfred Morris ripped off an impressive run aided by a Lavonte David facemask. Gerald McCoy and Jacquies Smith came up with sacks, and that led to Washington missing a 47-yard field goal. McCown threw a pass up to Mike Evans for a 51-yard gain to set up another field goal. The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by "

Robbie Gould followed that up with a missed field goal, albeit from 54 yards. The Bears then allowed a completion to Vincent Jackson on a third-and-23. Bucs: McCown, who was nearly picked a second time just prior to halftime (a FOX announcer said, He better get down on both knees and be thankful that wasn't intercepted), lost a fumble on a strip-sack and then fired a pick on a high throw to Charles Sims. Both turnovers led to touchdowns. Thanks to a Vincent Jackson fumble (a terrible call by Walt Coleman, who failed to overturn it via replay because he was too senile to remember where he was) and several awful sacks by McCown allowed Chicago to clinch this win and cover.    McCown had a miserable performance for the ages, going 25-of-48 for 341 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL.

Chicago would have lost this game had its opponent not self-destructed.

   "comment":"Mike Evans, meanwhile, failed to haul in a single ball. He saw just 3 targets go his way, and he appeared to be hobbled. Evans probably shouldn't have even played, but then again, he was a distraction. He's a nice buy-low target; his owners have to feel very frustrated right now, but Winston's solid performance bodes well for his future.    Seferian-Jenkins caught 2 passes for 29 yards, but should've had a better fantasy outing, as Winston missed him in the end zone on a high pass. He remains a low-end TE1 option.    "

Instead, another field goal had to be attempted, and this 1 was missed. The third screw-up is something I'll mention later. The errors ruined what could've been a solid game for Jameis Winston, who went 20-of-36 for 245 yards, 1 touchdown and a late interception. Thanks to Winston, the Buccaneers were 7-of-13 on third down. He was mostly precise when it mattered most in the opening half, and his numbers would've been much better had Evans hauled in that aforementioned pass. That said, Winston struggled in the second half when the Colts began putting more pressure on him. The heat he was under forced some poor throws as the game progressed.    Thanks to his blunder, Evans was second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 64 yards. "

Evans, who was seeing coverage from Patrick Peterson - Winston's stat line could've been even worse than it was because the Cardinals dropped at least 3 more potential interceptions. One was thrown right to Peterson, who somehow couldn't come up with the turnover.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, really needed to rebound following the loss to New England last week. Carson Palmer was better in this contest, going 18-of-31 for 308 yards and 3 touchdowns, but some of his passes were still off the mark, and he just doesn't look the same. It's worth noting that his stat line is inflated by a 58-yard reception by David Johnson, who was able to break free after catching a short pass because Kwon Alexander whiffed on a tackle. Palmer also should've thrown an interception in the end zone, though it's unclear if Johnson ran the wrong route. Brent Grimes dropped the ball, killing Tampa's chances of mounting a comeback because the Cardinals ended up scoring a touchdown on that drive, putting the game out of reach.    Speaking of Johnson, he didn't do much besides that long reception, managing just 45 yards on 12 carries. He was given just 2 attempts following halftime, as the Cardinals correctly decided to preserve him. Johnson also caught 3 balls for 98 receiving yards.    Larry Fitzgerald continues to dominate. Fitzgerald caught 6 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. He nearly found the end zone again, but was tackled just shy of the goal line. Palmer's other scores went to Michael Floyd (2-8) and Jaron Brown (2-78). As for John Brown, he continued to do nothing, hauling in 1 pass for 14 yards. He's not healthy, and Palmer isn't as sharp as he's been in past years.    Going back to the Buccaneers, despite Winston's struggles, Evans still caught 6 balls for 70 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. However, he did so on 17 targets. Evans had issues getting open against Peterson. He also dropped a pass and was called for offensive pass interference. Winston's other primary receivers were "

After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from "

The second touchdown went to Evans (8-96) after Winston moved around the pocket and stepped up into open space. It was a nice display of his mobility. The second touchdown went to Russell Shepard (5-77). Winston lofted a perfect pass into a small window that allowed Shepard to go up and catch the pass. It was definitely Winston's best throw of the game. The final score went to Evans as well. Winston put the pass up where only his tall receiver could get it. It was a smart play that really helped to solidify the lead for the Buccaneers. If Winston can continue to play like this against major competition, that would be great for Tampa. They definitely need him to play well if they want to have any chance of competing in the future.    In terms of the receivers, Evans and Shepard really led the way for the team. They combined to catch 13 of Winston's 21 completions. It looks like they will be the top guys moving forward. Aside from those 2. tight end "

It wasn't all his fault, as Dallas defensive tackle David Irving caused major problems by flooding the backfield on seemingly every play. It began when Winston was picked off on an overthrow on third-and-long, which was caused by Irving smacking Winston's elbow upon his release. Winston then overthrew an open receiver near the end zone and missed Mike Evans on the penultimate offensive drive of the game.

He keeps improving, as it seems as though he's making the next step in his career to becoming an elite quarterback.    Evans, meanwhile, really needs to clean up his drops. He caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a touchdown, but he easily could've found the end zone thrice in this game. He converted fewer than half of his 11 targets, as he was extremely inefficient.    Tampa's leader in receiving yards was Evans missed out on some opportunities as well. He appeared to have a touchdown in the second quarter, but the play was overturned by replay review. Evans also had several drops, including a potential 18-yard reception and another possible touchdown. Despite this, the Buccaneers prevailed, as Folk overcame his earlier troubles to nail the decisive 34-yard kick.    Winston went 22-of-38 for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns.

Buffalo answered with Taylor, connecting for a pair of 26-yard gains, with the first being a completion to Nick O'Leary (2-58) and the second coming on Taylor scrambling to convert a third-and-10. The Bills also settled for a field goal. Tampa Bay responded with another field goal drive. Buffalo quickly responded with LeSean McCoy ripping off 23 yards. Taylor used his legs to move the ball some more before McCoy scored from a few yards out to go up 10-6. A Buffalo edge rusher later burned Bucs left tackle Donovan Smith for a strip sack. The Bills recovered the ball, but a missed field goal bailed out Tampa Bay. With about 30 seconds before halftime, Winston threw a terrible pass to a double-covered and blanketed Cameron Brate (6-60). The pass was easily picked off by Bills linebacker Matt Milano, setting up Buffalo inside the Bucs' 30. However, Buffalo had terrible clock management to let the clock run out inside the 15-yard line without getting a field goal attempt off before the half. In the third quarter, the Bills moved the ball down the field with McCoy before Taylor found tight end Logan Thomas for a 22-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay responded with a long completion to DeSean Jackson (5-73), but a holding call on Donovan Smith canceled out the gain of 54 yards. Winston came back to move down the field using Evans with some runs from Doug Martin."
