He finished 31-of-49 for 313 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. A bulk of Carr's yardage came on a meaningless drive in the 4.h quarter. He didn't look like himself, and it didn't appear as though the Raiders were willing to trust him in the early going, as they called for a run on a third-and-2 play. Carr spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, so it's fair to wonder when he'll be 100 percent.    While Carr regressed, the same could be said for "
