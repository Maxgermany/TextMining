With a skeleton-crew offense, Ryan couldn't muster much by himself and transformed into a turnover machine in the second half. The end result was an upset victory by the upstart Bills, who have improved to a very surprising 3-1 record. Ryan had a chance to take the lead at the very end, but no 1 could get open on the final drive. This forced Ryan to throw the ball away twice, and on 4.h down, he tried to get the ball to Taylor Gabriel, who couldn't separate from the cornerback. It was very evident how much Ryan missed Jones and Sanu in that sequence, and their absences ended up costing the Falcons the game.    Ryan finished 24-of-42 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had 3 give-aways in the second half. He was strip-sixed and then forced a bad interception, which "
