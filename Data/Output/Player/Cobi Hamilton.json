   "comment":"Cobi Hamilton for the win.    I would say the Browns lost on purpose so they could get the No. 1 pick, but they sure did a good job of pretending to mess up royally if they did. They ended this season with just the 1 win last week against the Chargers, but Hue Jackson will get another season to get this team on track.    One player whose future continues to look bright is Terrelle Pryor, who caught 7-of-11 targets for 94 yards. He topped 1,000 receiving yards in his first full season as a receiver. This, of course, was with some bad quarterbacks at the helm.    The Steelers will move into the playoffs well rested to face the Miami Dolphins at Heinz Field.   Hamilton for the win.
