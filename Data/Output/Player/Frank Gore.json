Oh, and in case you didn't know, O'Sullivan sucks, and is far from the Super Awesome Quarterback No. 1 Martz described him as a few weeks ago. O'Sullivan somehow threw 3 touchdowns, but he also tossed 3 picks and failed to complete 50 percent of his passes. His YPA was a minuscule 4.5. On San Francisco's final offensive play, O'Sullivan needed to convert a 4.h-and-long. Instead of firing the ball downfield, he attempted some sort of weird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar-like hook shot.

Jamaal Charles once again had fewer carries than Thomas Jones. Despite this, Charles had more rushing yards - which shouldn't surprise anyone except for Todd Haley. Charles turned 12 rushes into 97 yards, while Jones had 19 attempts go for 95 yards and a score. Charles also had 3 catches for 57 receiving yards.    As for San Francisco, Gore was able to save his fantasy day with 9 catches for 102 receiving yards. He was the only 49er to have more than 3 catches, including "

   "comment":"Gore run later, San Francisco went up by 8. covering the spread by 1. As if my bad call on the October NFL Pick of the Month wasn't enough.    My degenerate gambling 10.encies aside, this was 1 of the ugliest games I've ever seen. Both quarterbacks were awful, and until very late, both teams were limited to fewer than 200 total yards.    Starting with the winners, Alex Smith went 16-of-33 for 196 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers don't explain how terrible he was. Smith began the contest 2-of-10. Throughout the afternoon, he continuously missed wide-open receivers downfield on blown coverages by the Oakland safeties. The crowd, as you might expect, kept booing him until the 49ers finally established the lead in the 4.h quarter.    The Raiders did a good job bottling up Frank Gore until he sprinted for a 64-yard gain late in the contest. "

Finally, Dallas caught a huge break when Ahmad Brooks lined up offsides on a failed third down as time was running out in the half. Given a second chance to convert, some guy named Tramine Brock out of Belhaven College (think the 49ers need to draft a cornerback?) fell down in coverage, and 53 yards later, "

   "comment":"Gore who finished with 42 yards on 17 carries. This is not lazy analysis - I am serious. Both defenses played well in this game obviously, with the final total yards going to Cincinnati just barely at 228-226. Cincinnati's 5 sacks were crucial in getting their defense off the field. Only once did the 49ers get a first down on a drive following a sack, and it was the result of a penalty. Meanwhile San Francisco's defense was getting it done on third down, stopping 9 out of 10 conversion attempts. If not for a Frank Gore fumble early in the 4.h quarter, the Bengals would not have scored after the opening drive. "

   "comment":"Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper. The icing on the cake was Akers striking the extra point to make it 24-23. Still, the Dream Team had a full 3 minutes to answer the bell. Short passes put them just inside San Francisco territory. A pass to Maclin had them at the 32 and pretty much in field goal range, assuming Henery was up to it. One problem - Justin Smith forced a fumble, and a pack of 49ers was there to cover it and end the threat. Again, it wasn't over until Philly's defense let Gore run for 4, 8, 4, 5 and 5 yards on consecutive plays when it knew what was coming. How do you let an injured running back average over 5 yards per carry on a drive like that with the game on the line? There is plenty of blame to go around, but clearly this team of stars lacks heart and finishing skills.    On the other side, San Francisco got decent play from Alex Smit,h whose only turnover was a lost fumble. They have something brewing in the backfield with Gore and Hunter (11 touches for 100 yards). The passing game was littered with big plays from Crabtree, Morgan and tight end "

Whatever works, right? Those key plays helped them take the lead 12-10. After a quick San Francisco punt opened the second half, Detroit drove for a field goal on a march fueled by consecutive passes to Jahvid Best (6 receptions for 73 yards) covering 53 yards. Those big gains were wasted when Stafford threw 3 straight incompletions going to Nate Burleson, Pettigrew and rookie Titus Young from the 6-yard line. He knows Calvin Johnson (6 receptions for 102 yards) is on his team right? The kick gave them a 13-12 lead. The 49ers answered immediately with another long run from Gore covering 55 yards plus an extra 15 on a questionable horse-collar personal foul. This time, the Lions stood up in the red zone, forcing a pair of incompletions, though an Akers field goal put the visitors back ahead 15-13.

Eventually, I figured Smith would throw an interception even though he entered the game with just 1 on the season. An exchange of punts later, I was right. It looked like the 16-0 dream would continue for Detroit when they took over at the San Francisco 49-yard line just before the end of the third quarter. They took small gains to march down for the touchdown, then failed at math by trying for 2 points after taking a 19-15 lead with a Stafford-to-Burleson touchdown pass.

His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal. After getting the ball back thanks to a sack from Larry Grant, the San Francisco offense kept its collective foot on the pedal as the half wound down, however Chris Long ended the threat with a sack. To its credit, St. Louis came to play defensively. Following the break, things started to unravel for the Rams. After quickly moving down the field on passes to Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs. Then Alex Smith dropped a 52-yard bomb to Crabtree for a touchdown and the 16-0 lead. If St. Louis had any hope, it was extinguished right there. San Francisco overcame a penalty to open their next drive and ended up with a field goal to extend its advantage, leaving it 19-0 at the end of the third quarter. At the start of the 4.h quarter, Alex Smith hit Kyle Williams who did all the work for a 56-yard touchdown to make the final margin 26-0. It was another ho-hum day for Smith (17-of-23, 274 yards, 2 TDs), although he was sacked 4 times. Gore was contained (21 rushes for 73 yards) and a lot of the rushing yardage for San Francisco came on gimmick plays to receiving threats who picked up 55 yards on 3 attempts. Most importantly, the 49ers did not turn the ball over and played smothering defense. The Rams' running back Steven Jackson and his backup, "

In the third quarter, Miami gifted a touchdown to the 49ers. Marcus Thigpen muffed a punt inside the 10-yard line that San Francisco recovered. Gore (16-63 rushing, 2-22 receiving) banged the ball into the end zone a few plays later.  Kaepernick then dropped in a perfectly thrown bomb in the end zone to "

   "comment":"Gore touchdown toward the end of the second quarter. Kaepernick went 16-of-30 for 227 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception to go along with 7 scrambles for 98 rushing yards. The pick was a telegraphed throw, picked off by Tramon Williams, who nearly had an earlier interception that was dropped in the end zone. Micah Hyde also had his hands on a ball that he couldn't reel in. This occurred on the final drive of the game, so it ultimately cost Green Bay a victory. Outside of these 3 passes, Kaepernick played a brilliant game.    It should be noted that Kaepernick did all of this against a Green Bay defense that was missing so many players. Clay Matthews, of course, was already out, but the Packers lost 3 defenders to injury. Stud corner Sam Shields, as well as linebackers Mike Neal and Andy Mulumba, all suffered knee injuries. Losing Shields was huge, as Green Bay couldn't do anything to stop Kaepernick. The team also saw left tackle David Bakhtiari go out with an injury.    The Packers at least did a good job of stuffing Gore. The aging back was limited to 66 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. Wipe out a 10-yard burst, and Gore mustered a meager line of 19-56-1.    As you might be able to tell, Crabtree had a huge game. He led the 49ers in receiving yardage by a wide margin, snatching 8 balls for 125 yards, including a 1.handed acrobatic catch in the first quarter. Not bad for a receiver coming off an Achilles injury. "

   "comment":"Gore touchdown. In total, San Francisco was guilty of 16 yellow flags for a whopping 118 yards, and those are just the 1. that were accepted. They got away with a blatant delay-of-game infraction on their opening-drive score that inexplicably wasn't called. Those weren't the only unforced errors San Francisco committed. The team wasted timeouts in the second half and was called for a ridiculous delay-of-game penalty on the final drive. Colin Kaepernick was most culpable. He couldn't read blitzes at all and took 4 sacks as a consequence. He failed to identify open receivers downfield. Kaepernick was also wildly inaccurate. He went 21-of-34 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 ugly interceptions and a lost fumble. He had a couple of possible picks dropped as well. It didn't appear as though Kapernick prepared for this Chicago defense at all. He must have seen the Bills succeed against it and just assumed he could #yolo his way to a victory. That's not how things work in the NFL - unless you're playing the Raiders or Jaguars, of course.    The only 49er player to record more than 41 receiving yards was Michael Crabtree, who hauled in 7 balls for 82 yards and a touchdown. Vernon Davis (3-39) had to leave on the penultimate drive because he bent backward awkwardly while being tackled. Kaepernick tossed a pick a couple of plays later, which wasn't a surprise because he has often struggled without his favorite target.    It was surprising that the 49ers didn't rush the ball very well. Kaepernick got his scrambling yardage (9-66), but Frank Gore (13-63, TD) and Carlos Hyde (4-0) combined for just 3."

After that, San Francisco had 2 special-teams gaffe, getting surprised by an onside kick and then botching a field goal when a bad snap forced Andy Lee to pick up the ball and attempt a desperation heave downfield. This looked exactly like a play that the Giants had go against them in a wild-card playoff game following the 2002 season, so it took them 14 years, but they finally got revenge. The Giants outclassed the 49ers, committing 5 turnovers. All of them were Eli Manning interceptions. Because Eli had an epically brutal performance, cementing himself as the worst quarterback of the 3 Manning brothers, let's delve into all of his picks: Manning's first interception was telegraphed. His second was 1 of the worst throws in NFL history. It was unclear whom Manning was targeting because he lofted a weak-armed duck to a 49er player with no teammate in the vicinity. His third was a terrible overthrow. His 4.h occurred because he was hit as he released the ball. The fifth should've never happened; after stupidly throwing 3 fades in the red zone - horrible play-calling because fades seldom work - the Giants should've tried a field goal. They were down 6 with 4:30 remaining on the clock, so going for 3 made a lot of sense. Tom Coughlin foolishly went for it, and Manning proceeded to throw his fifth pick on a deflection.    Manning finished 22-of-45 for 280 yards, 1 touchdown and the 5 picks. He had some nice throws during the afternoon, but his interceptions were back-breakers. The Giants played evenly with the 49ers, but the turnovers were the difference.    The silver lining for the Giants was that Odell Beckham looked great once again. He caught 6 balls for 93 yards, including a fantastic sideline grab. Rueben Randle actually outgained Beckham, snatching 7 passes for 112 yards. Larry Donnell (3-54) secured Manning's sole touchdown.    The Giants were expected to be more competitive in this game because they finally had a threat in their backfield. Rashad Jennings was sorely missed because Andre Williams was dreadful as a replacement. Jennings (18-59) didn't actually fall forward for 2 yards every time.    The 49ers predictably ran better than the Giants. Gore gained 95 yards on 19 carries, but he had that aforementioned fumble that helped the Giants hang around.    Kaepernick needed Gore to run well, as he struggled in this contest. Barely completing half of his passes, Kaepernick went 15-of-29 for 193 yards and a touchdown. He had accuracy issues, and he was lucky to even get 16 points, as a bogus "

   "comment":"Gore on a routine checkdown. He followed that up with an awful pick, which Richard Sherman snatched out of the air; the pass was way behind the intended target. Sherman, who intercepted Kaepernick a second time in the final quarter on a late, forced throw, nearly picked Kaepernick off on a third occasion during the second quarter. In between, Kaepernick missed open receivers, didn't see his targets who were available for big gains, and even botched the clock management right before halftime. The 49ers might as well just pack it in if Kaepernick keeps performing like this. His regression has been inexplicable, and it's a huge mystery why the 49ers didn't design any runs for him. Kaepernick caused major problems for the Seahawks in the NFC Championship with his rushing ability, yet he scrambled only 3 times for 17 yards. Instead, Kaepernick, instead, spent the entire night targeting Sherman, who is now responsible for 5 of Kaepernick's 24 career interceptions, including the tip to Malcolm Smith. Sherman spent the entire 4.h quarter trolling the 49er fans in the stands.    The difference in this game was the quarterback play. Russell Wilson, who told the media during the week that he and his team had their swagger back during the week, backed up his talk by going 15-of-22 for 236 yards and a touchdown to go along with 7 scrambles for 35 rushing yards. Wilson, who was infinitely more precise with his throws than Kaepernick, should have thrown a second score, but a ticky-tack offensive pass interference negated his third-quarter touchdown to Paul Richardson. Wilson's best play of the evening was when he somehow avoided 3 sacks and found an open Tony Moeaki for a gain of 63 yards. The Seahawks can make another Super Bowl run if Wilson continues to play like this. The Seahawks won't have homefield advantage, in all likelihood, but they just proved they can win on the road. They hadn't prevailed in San Francisco since 2010, so this victory was highly impressive.    Marshawn Lynch broke the century mark again, gaining 104 yards on 20 carries. He missed some action with a tight back, but he looked strong in the second half. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, Robert Turbin reeled in Wilson's only touchdown when Lynch was out of the game.    Excluding Moeaki and Turbin, Seattle's leading receiver was Luke Willson (4-39), who nearly had a fifth catch at the very end of the game. Pete Carroll, for some reason, challenged the play despite the fact that the victory was well in hand. Like Carroll, I thought Wilson caught the ball before sliding out of bounds, but throwing the red flag was rubbing it in. Meanwhile, Doug Baldwin (2-28) and Jermaine Kearse (3-34) once again produced pedestrian numbers.    The 49ers had some disappointing receivers as well. Thanks to Kaepernick's immense struggles, Anquan Boldin (3-18), Vernon Davis (2-13) and Michael Crabtree (3-10) all disappointed their fantasy owners.    Frank Gore struggled as well. The Seahawks, who failed to contain the run for a stretch a couple of weeks ago, restricted Gore to just 28 yards on 10 carries. With "

   "comment":"Gore and Colin Kaepernick were running all over the Chargers in the first half, eventually establishing a 28-7 lead in the process, I never imagined that San Diego would be able to win. Philip Rivers did not look right at all, and the Chargers were outgained by about 130 net yards by intermission. And then, things just clicked for San Diego. Rivers went from throwing weak passes to the other team to converting first down after first down on crucial, late-game possessions. Rivers was 24-of-40 for 273 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception in the second half and overtime. It was clear that Rivers was hindered by a back problem, so this was an extremely gutsy victory on his part, especially considering that he was missing 2 linemen; deep-reserve center Chris Watt was helped off the field with an ankle injury early on, while guard Johnnie Troutman also left the field. The Chargers managed to tie the game with 2 clutch catches by Eddie Royal on a 4.h-and-6 and Dontrelle Inman on a 4.h-and-10 with the game (and season) on the line. Two plays after the Inman reception, Rivers found Malcom Floyd in the end zone for a 12-yard score. The 49ers won the coin toss in overtime following a 60-yard Phil Dawson whiff. They moved it into San Diego territory, but Quinton Patton lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and thanks to some Rivers completions and tough runs from Ronnie Brown, they moved it into range for Nick Novak, who converted to keep the season alive. San Diego, now 9-6, still needs some help to earn 1 of the 2 wild-card spots, but at least it has a chance.    Rivers finished 33-of-54 for 356 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. It was ugly early; Rivers' first pick wasn't too bad, as Perrish Cox had great coverage, but his next 1 was returned for 6. as it was heaved right to Antoine Bethea. Rivers' third interception came after halftime; it was a high throw that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. As mentioned though, Rivers caught fire at the very end to help his team's hopes alive.    Rivers' main targets were Royal (10-94, TD) and Antonio Gates, who had 7 catches for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns. Floyd (4-50) secured the 4.h score. Meanwhile, someone named Dontrelle Inman, who had never caught a pass in the NFL prior to Saturday night, logged 7 receptions for 79 yards, stepping in for an injured Keenan Allen, as well as an ineffective Seyi Ajirotutu following halftime. Inman's numbers included a key grab on 4.h-and-10 of the final drive of regulation. He's worth picking up in dynasty formats.    With Ryan Mathews out, the Chargers utilized a 3.headed platoon at running back, with Branden Oliver leading the way. He paced the team in rushing with 53 yards on 13 carries and also had 3 catches for 28 receiving yards. He had some nice spurts where he avoided 49er defenders, but the Chargers went with Ronnie Brown (7-33) when the game was on the line. Donald Brown (4-12) didn't do as much.    As mentioned in the opening paragraph, Kaepernick and Gore trampled San Diego early on. Both players actually eclipsed 150 yards on the ground. Gore rumbled for 158 yards and a touchdown on 26 attempts. Coming off a concussion on a short work week, Gore ran with great power, but the 49ers made the mistake of not handing the ball enough to him after halftime; he was given just 12 carries in the second half and overtime.    Kaepernick, meanwhile scrambled 7 times for 151 rushing yards, 90 of which came on an impressive sprint into the end zone in the third quarter, featuring a crazy juke on "

Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking.

   "comment":"Gore was showing great burst on his runs, and Adam Vinatieri was perfect on his field goals. Are we sure that this is still 2015, or did we travel back in time to 2006? There was major concern with Hasselbeck entering this contest. Andrew Luck was the 1 with the shoulder injury, but Hasselbeck spent time in a hospital on Tuesday morning with flu-like symptoms. A report by Stacy Dales prior to kickoff seemed to indicate that Hasselbeck may not make it through the entire game. Despite this, however, Hasselbeck was terrific. He fired sharp, accurate passes to his receivers and lofted some perfect throws to his targets for significant gains. A beautiful ball to Andre Johnson for 24 yards set up a touchdown, while a 43-yard bomb to T.Y. Hilton sealed the game at the very end. Hasselbeck finished 18-of-29 for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns amid zero turnovers despite not practicing at all this week. His numbers could've been even better, but he suffered through a couple of drops. Houston's anemic defense had something to do with it, of course, but Hasselbeck played extremely well. He tearfully told Tracy Wolfson after the game that he had nothing left.    While Hasselbeck was great, the big story was Andre Johnson. The veteran receiver, making his return to Houston, had looked completely done through 3 games. He was targeted heavily, but could do nothing with those opportunities. It seemed like he would ultimately get phased out of the offense completely, but this resurgence came out of nowhere. Johnson reeled in 6 of the 7 balls thrown to him for 77 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a big pick-up on 4.h down. None of this was fluky; Johnson dominated, which has to be very promising for the Colts (and fantasy owners) going forward.    The third veteran I mentioned earlier, Gore ripped through Houston's defense, which once again had major issues versus the run. He nearly hit the century mark, going 98 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries. He had some big lanes to run through, as the Colts did a good job neutralizing "

He went 23-of-37 for 312 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick-six, though that wasn't his fault (more on that in a second.) Brady took advantage of some blown coverages by the Colts, but he struggled to move the chains in the second half, save for the short drive following that absurd fake punt play.

   "comment":"Gore lost a fumble. Hasselbeck later took a bad sack on a third-and-1 when he had enough space to step up into the pocket and scramble for the first down. In the third quarter, an awful hands-to-the-face ticky-tack penalty, which had nothing to do with the play, gave the Falcons a first down when they would've been forced into a field goal. A few plays later, Matt Ryan found Leonard Hankerson in the end zone to go up 2 touchdowns. Hasselbeck followed that up with a horrible pick into double coverage. And yeah, the Colts somehow won! It was a combination of factors that did the Falcons in, beginning with Matt Ryan. Atlanta's signal-caller was guilty of 3 interceptions himself. The first wasn't really his fault, as it was a tipped pass that appeared to hit the ground. Mike Carey said that it should've been ruled incomplete. Ryan's third pick was on a Hail Mary attempt that was actually snatched by Coby Fleener. The middle interception was the horrible 1. as the Falcons were backed up on their own 1-yard line. Ryan dropped back to pass and inexplicably didn't see D'Qwell Jackson, who scored the easiest pick-six of his life. Ryan also missed plenty of open receivers. One play stands out in the 4.h quarter, as Ryan had an open Julio Jones on third down. Converting would've moved the chains and put the Falcons close to midfield to potentially win the game, but Ryan simply sailed the ball wide of his stud receiver. Ryan finished 25-of-46 for 280 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The trio of scores helped his few fantasy owners, but don't let those fool you into thinking that Ryan had a decent performance. He was awful by his standards, and it's not like this is a 1.game abberation. Ryan has been struggling all season, and I have to wonder if he's playing through an undisclosed injury.    Another reason the Falcons fell to the Colts was Devonta Freeman's concussion. Freeman left in the middle of the opening quarter, leaving Tevin Coleman as the primary ball-carrier. Coleman proved to be a massive downgrade, mustering just 48 yards on 17 carries as well as a lost fumble. Freeman, by comparison, nearly had as much yardage (43) on just 3 attempts.    Some of Atlanta's receivers had some drops as well. Leonard Hankerson had a crucial ball slip through his hands, though he did enjoy a strong fantasy performance because of a touchdown. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards. He was second on the team in receiving, trailing Jones, who logged 9 receptions for 160 yards. Meanwhile, Roddy White continues to be very inefficient; he saw 9 targets, but reeled in just 4 of them for 24 yards. The sooner the Falcons stop using him, the better. He's done.    Hasselbeck, remarkably, was the better quarterback in this matchup. I referenced his 2 interceptions already, but he was solid otherwise, going 23-of-32 for 213 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Hasselebck, at 1 point, completed 10 consecutive passes. He nearly had a third score, but Andre Johnson was able to get just 1 foot inbounds in the end zone. Hasselbeck was limited to a dink-and-dunk approach, as none of his receivers accumulated more than 50 yards. His leader was Gore, who caught all 5 of his targets for 46 yards. Fleener (3-45) and "

   "comment":"Gore was the catalyst for Indianapolis' offense for most of the afternoon. He ripped through the Dolphins' defense, gaining 85 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries. Miami was guilty of countless missed tackles, which is why Gore was so effective. That said, I'm wondering why Gore had just 15 carries compared to 29 passing attempts from Hasselbeck and Whitehurst combined. The offensive play-calling was terrible, and this has to make you think where the Colts would be had they decided to stick with Bruce Arians as their head coach instead of Chuck Pagano. Then again, as 1 Hall of Fame running back once said, Hindsight is 50-50.    Thanks to the horrible passing numbers from Hasselbeck and Whitehurst, only 1 Colt accumulated more than 40 receiving yards. That was "

   "comment":"Gore started by dropping a pass. Dwayne Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, Phillip Dorsett was a disappointment, catching 3 passes for 27 yards. Jack Doyle (6-65) and Dwayne Allen (3-35) picked up the slack with Donte Moncrief being out. Allen, as mentioned, dropped a touchdown.    Right after Allen missed out on a score, Frank Gore took advantage with an end zone trip of his own. He gained 82 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. "

Moving back to the Bears, Meredith will be seen as the goat for losing that key fumble, so it's a shame that it spoiled such a terrific afternoon. He caught a whopping 9 passes for 130 yards and a touchdown. He served as Hoyer's favorite target, as Jeffery (5-77) once again didn't look 100 percent, though he was certainly improved. Remember, Jeffery should've had a game-winning score, but Hoyer didn't see him. Meanwhile, "

One thing no 1 talked about is how Chuck Pagano helped cost the Colts a victory with some horrid decision-making. Late in the third quarter, the Colts had a 4.h-and-1 in the red zone. Pagano hesitated to make up his mind, so the Colts had to waste a timeout. He then passed on a field goal, and the Colts had Luck in a shotgun snap. Indianapolis predictably couldn't convert. Pagano hit the trifecta: the wasted timeout, the decision to pass on points, and the poor play call. Pagano needed to be replaced following the disappointing 2015 campaign along with Grigson, but Jim Irsay was too busy sending out stupid tweets during the offseason to make any sort of move.   "

Also, Gore had 2 touchdown runs that helped to drive the Colts' offense. The first touchdown was a result of impressive blocking from the line on a pitch play. Gore was able to walk in untouched. On the second, he plowed through the offensive line and some Packers defenders to reach the end zone. It will definitely be interesting to see if Gore continues to be a red-zone threat for Indianapolis, especially given Andrew Luck's trouble with turnovers of late.

That pushed the Raiders' lead to 33-7. The Colts finnaly got going again with a pass to T.Y. Hilton going for 39 yards to the 5-yard line. That set up a short touchdown pass from Luck to Robert Turbin. Early in the 4.h quarter, Carr suffered his injury, leaving his team visibly crushed. Luck then moved the ball down the field before running a short touchdown into the end zone and converting a 2.point conversion to Hilton. At 33-22, the Colts got the ball back and promptly Luck hit Hilton on the run for 39 yards. The Colts settled for a field goal to make it 33-25 with 2:30 remaining. McGloin made a great throw to Cooper to get a first down on a third-and-long conversion just before the 2-minute warning. That allowed the Raiders to run out the clock on the Colts.    Carr was 20-of-30 for 228 yards with 3 touchdowns prior to the injury. Cooper had 4 catches for 72 yards.    DeAndre Washington was excellent for the Raiders with 12 carries for 99 yards with 2 scores and an 18-yard reception. Jalen Richard had 66 yards on 6 carries with 3 receptions for 13 yards and a touchdown.    Luck was 19-of-29 for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Colts' offensive line didn't give up a sack, but that was because of Luck. Indianapolis' blockers really struggled with Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin, allowing Luck to take a lot of hits and forcing him to throw before he was ready.    Gore notched 13 carries for 73 yards.
