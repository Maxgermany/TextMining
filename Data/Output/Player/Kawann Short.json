   "comment":"Short slammed the door on the Bears as he started 1 sack and got a strip-sack of Cutler on the Bears' final play.    Cutler completed 28-of-36 for 289 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He ran for 22 yards and a score, too. Cutler had some other mental mistakes as he took some sacks in obvious blitzes when he needed to throw quickly. Forte had 17 carries for 62 yards with 12 receptions for 105 yards and the score, but his 4.h-quarter fumble was a backbreaker for Chicago.    Newton was 19-of-35 for 255 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He had only 9 yards on the ground as he clearly isn't himself running the ball. Olsen led the Panthers with 72 yards on 6 receptions and 2 scores. Jerricho Cotchery (3-46) and Jason Avant (2-42) chipped in.    Defensively, Luke Kuechly was all over the place, totaling 15 tackles, including some clutch open-field hits on Forte. Kawann Short played really well for Carolina.   "

Both picks occurred inside the Carolina 30-yard line - 2 of Denver's 3 give-aways took place there - as 1 was tipped at the line of scrimmage, while the other 1 transpired as Siemian was under pressure and threw off his back foot. I won't blame Siemian for the first pick, but the second 1 was inexcusable. That was 3 easy points off the board, which would've made a huge difference had Gano nailed that field goal. Siemian also got lucky on 1 occasion, when he had an open Virgil Green in the end zone, but underthrew him with a pass that was nearly picked off. It's too bad that Siemian is just a bridge to Paxton Lynch, because I think there's something there. Siemian is a smart, gritty quarterback who, at the very least, proved that he can be a viable backup quarterback in this league.    "
