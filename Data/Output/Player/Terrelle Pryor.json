He went with Matt Leinart. Matt Leinart? Matt Leinart!? Why!? Haven't we seen enough proof that he sucks? I guess Allen is too young to remember when Leinart played for Arizona. Leinart was predictably horrible, going 16-of-32 for 115 yards and an interception to set up a Carolina touchdown right before halftime. Most of his completions were checkdowns. As for Pryor, he played a handful of snaps. He completed a 5-yard pass, rushed for 2 yards and hauled in a 22-yard reception. And that was it. Nice job, Dennis.    "

Now, before anyone gets too excited, remember that Indianapolis' defense is probably the worst stop unit in the NFL. The lack of 1 talent is 1 thing, but they were just so poorly coached. Matvei, whom I enter the Las Vegas Hilton Supercontest with, texted me and said that Chuck Pagano studied film of last year's 49ers-Packers tilt. That's exactly what it looked like. It seemed as though the Colts had no idea that Pryor could run the football. They didn't set the edge at all and looked completely unprepared.

I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that "

   "comment":"Pryor to kick off the game. This was Oakland's longest run in franchise history, barely eclipsing a 92-yard scamper by Bo Jackson. - The Steelers had a blocked punt, setting up an Oakland touchdown. - Shaun Suisham whiffed on field-goal tries from 34 and 32 yards. - Ben Roethlisberger (29-of-45, 275 yards) tossed 2 interceptions (he could've easily thrown a couple more), including an errant deep shot downfield and a tipped pass. He did make up for it with a touchdown, however, thanks to a holding penalty on the Raiders that negated a third pick that Roethlisberger carelessly tossed into the end zone. - Antonio Brown (9-82) dropped a deep pass on a third-and-15 in the 4.h quarter that would've moved the chains. This forced Pittsburgh to punt, allowing the Raiders to bleed more time off the clock.    The Steelers also struggled to run the ball. This isn't totally surprising because the Raiders have a surprisingly good run defense, but I thought Bell would have more success than gaining just 24 yards on 13 carries. Luckily for his fantasy owners, he was able to find the end zone.    The Raiders, meanwhile, ran all over Pittsburgh until late in the game when Dick LeBeau's defense stacked the box. Darren McFadden gained 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 attempts. Pryor, meanwhile, scrambled 9 times for 106 yards and a score, most of which came on that 93-yard scamper. Pryor actually didn't have a very good performance if that long run is excluded. He went 10-of-19 for only 88 yards and 2 interceptions. He did endure a drop and did a good job of avoiding some sacks, but 1 of his picks was awful. He showed terrible mechanics, failing to set his feet as he threw across his body. The result was an overthrow that sailed right to "

   "comment":"Pryor telegraphed an interception that was returned by Terrell Thomas to the Oakland 3-yard line. Left tackle Khalif Barnes also ruined 3 drives with penalties. Pryor then had another turnover when he was strip-sacked after holding on to the ball forever. It's amazing how much Pryor has regressed since getting off to his hot start. He was just 11-of-26 for 122 yards and an interception, though he did help out his fantasy owners with 19 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Pryor had a nice play in this game when he broke out of a sack and found a receiver downfield, but he struggled throughout (2-of-12 on third down!) and hasn't played well since that weird, 11:30 p.m. San Diego contest. To give you an idea, here's a cool stat that the Associated Press' Josh Dubow came up with: Pryor has gone 112 passes without a touchdown pass (8 interceptions). JaMarcus Russell's longest drought was 104 attempts (5 picks).    Manning, meanwhile, wasn't much better. He went 12-of-22 for 140 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-six. His 1 score went to "

Miami managed to take the lead, but the Browns struck back with multiple scores and put themselves in position to kick a game-winning field goal. Cody Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards. He was an absolute monster, and it makes me wonder what Oakland's offense would look like if it had Pryor in addition to "

The Browns got the ball back and used Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. Terrelle Pryor pulled up on a route, and that allowed a pass to float to Marcus Gilchrist for an interception."

Then, with a first-and-goal from the 2.yard line, Cleveland proceeded to lose 13 yards on a wide receiver screen and ended up kicking a 34-yard field goal, which Landry Jones then answered with his own drive, but his finished with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Cobi Hamilton for the win.    I would say the Browns lost on purpose so they could get the No. 1 pick, but they sure did a good job of pretending to mess up royally if they did. They ended this season with just the 1 win last week against the Chargers, but Hue Jackson will get another season to get this team on track.    One player whose future continues to look bright is Terrelle Pryor, who caught 7-of-11 targets for 94 yards. He topped 1,000 receiving yards in his first full season as a receiver. This, of course, was with some bad quarterbacks at the helm.    The Steelers will move into the playoffs well rested to face the Miami Dolphins at Heinz Field.   "

The play would have been called back due to a penalty anyway. Cousins ended up going 23-for-40 with 240 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. However, the stat line is a bit misleading, as Cousins was only able to put together a couple of good drives, at best. Additionally, he lost 2 fumbles on the day, but that was less of his fault.    The Redskins' offensive line has continued to struggle after a poor preseason performance. Against the Eagles, the unit struggled to deal with the team's strong pass-rushers. "
