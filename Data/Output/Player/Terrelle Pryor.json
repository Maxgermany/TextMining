He went with Matt Leinart. Matt Leinart? Matt Leinart!? Why!? Haven't we seen enough proof that he sucks? I guess Allen is too young to remember when Leinart played for Arizona. Leinart was predictably horrible, going 16-of-32 for 115 yards and an interception to set up a Carolina touchdown right before halftime. Most of his completions were checkdowns. As for Pryor, he played a handful of snaps. He completed a 5-yard pass, rushed for 2 yards and hauled in a 22-yard reception. And that was it. Nice job, Dennis.    "

This was Oakland's longest run in franchise history, barely eclipsing a 92-yard scamper by Bo Jackson. - The Steelers had a blocked punt, setting up an Oakland touchdown. - Shaun Suisham whiffed on field-goal tries from 34 and 32 yards. - Ben Roethlisberger (29-of-45, 275 yards) tossed 2 interceptions (he could've easily thrown a couple more), including an errant deep shot downfield and a tipped pass. He did make up for it with a touchdown, however, thanks to a holding penalty on the Raiders that negated a third pick that Roethlisberger carelessly tossed into the end zone. - Antonio Brown (9-82) dropped a deep pass on a third-and-15 in the 4.h quarter that would've moved the chains. This forced Pittsburgh to punt, allowing the Raiders to bleed more time off the clock.    The Steelers also struggled to run the ball. This isn't totally surprising because the Raiders have a surprisingly good run defense, but I thought Bell would have more success than gaining just 24 yards on 13 carries. Luckily for his fantasy owners, he was able to find the end zone.    The Raiders, meanwhile, ran all over Pittsburgh until late in the game when Dick LeBeau's defense stacked the box. Darren McFadden gained 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 attempts. Pryor, meanwhile, scrambled 9 times for 106 yards and a score, most of which came on that 93-yard scamper. Pryor actually didn't have a very good performance if that long run is excluded. He went 10-of-19 for only 88 yards and 2 interceptions. He did endure a drop and did a good job of avoiding some sacks, but 1 of his picks was awful. He showed terrible mechanics, failing to set his feet as he threw across his body. The result was an overthrow that sailed right to "

Cody Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards.

Isaiah Crowell promptly plunged into the end zone. The Browns got the ball back and used Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse.

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor was having a great year. What an accomplishment! Griffin actually threw to Pryor this week, which was quite impressive for him. Baby steps.    Even when the Browns seem to have a chance coming into games, they absolutely flounder. That was the case against the Bills on Sunday, when they kept it close for a couple of quarters, and then ultimately imploded. They put on a horrific showing, and it looks like they will become the second team in NFL history to go 0-16. The story of the game was the utter domination by LeSean McCoy. Many expected the strong lead back to have a terrific day against the hapless Browns, but he was really able to outdo himself. From the get-go, McCoy was absolutely stellar. He seemingly broke off 10-yard runs every single time he touched the ball and did a great job of following his blockers. McCoy is the poster child for patience at the NFL level, as he allows his blockers to open up lanes for him. That was apparent today, and it really helped McCoy to put up some huge numbers. Overall, McCoy saw 19 carries on the day and turned them into a whopping 153 yards. He also scored 2 very impressive touchdowns. On the first 1. it was a 3-yard plunge where he followed his blockers straight into the end zone. He was virtually untouched. The second 1 was 1 of the best plays of the day for the Bills, as he stutter-stepped and then ran to the outside. He used his speed to get outside of 5 Cleveland defenders and walk in. That play helped to seal the deal for Buffalo. Mike Gillislee also saw a good deal of action on the ground. He got 9 carries for 37 yards and got an early touchdown as well. He continues to see some goal-line work, but he is not a recommended start in any fantasy formats.    In the passing game, the Bills had a fairly strong performance. The performance of Tyrod Taylor was pretty solid, and he made a case to keep his starting job for next season. Taylor was near-perfect statistically, going 17-for-24 with 174 yards and a touchdown. Taylor displayed some great accuracy, and he really has the potential to be a better player. Despite playing with only a couple of legitimate receiving options, Taylor was able to help the offense put up 33 points. He had a very nice throw on his touchdown pass, where he had gotten crushed by 3 Browns, but was still able to get the ball to Charles Clay down the field. Once again, Taylor's biggest asset was his mobility. Taylor had 7 scrambles on the day and turned them into 49 yards. He had 1 very nice run where he rounded the corner and worked his way down the sideline before being shoved out. The play netted the team 28 yards. The Bills need to consider starting Taylor next year. He is still a work in progress, but he has proven at times to be a solid option. Even if the franchise parts way with Rex Ryan, Taylor should begin 2017 as the quarterback.    Thanks to Taylor's success, the Bills were able to support some solid receiving performances. The leader on the day was Charles Clay (7-72, 1 TD), and it was definitely the tight end's best game of the year. Clay was able to matchup well against the Browns' linebackers and was Taylor's favorite target. Most weeks, Clay is nothing more than a TE2. However, he could fare well in the team's matchup with the Jets next week. The other top receivers on the day were Marquise Goodwin (3-43) and LeSean McCoy (3-16). Both Sammy Watkins (1-10) and Robert Woods (1-5) were major disappointments, as they struggled to separate from the Cleveland corners.    Defensively, Kyle Williams and Lorenzo Alexander each had big days. Both men recorded 1.5 sacks, and Williams' return allowed the team to play much better run defense. Alexander continues to have a Pro Bowl-caliber season.    For the Browns, this was yet another embarrassment. They dropped to a lowly 0-14 on the season, and they seem to have no chance of winning. They are not helping themselves out by continuing to start Robert Griffin III. At a glance, Griffin's numbers are not altogether awful. He went 17-of-28 for 196 yards and did not commit a turnover. However, he really was not as good as those numbers indicate. He played a very poor game and spent most of the day dinking and dunking to his running backs. The coaching staff also ensured that he could toss a lot of screens to Terrelle Pryor, but he rarely threw the ball downfield. He had 1 nice downfield pass, but that was about it. The 1 area where Griffin looked to have some ability was on the ground. He had 8 scrambles for 48 yards and a touchdown. The touchdown was an 18-yard run that can only be described as vintage RG3. He ran around a few Bills defenders before laying out to get the ball over the end line. Still, it was not enough to look like anything more than a backup. The Browns definitely should go into the last couple of weeks of the season with Cody Kessler as the starter. At least he will give them a glimpse of hope in the future.    Thanks to Griffin's issues, Pryor was having a great year. What an accomplishment! Griffin actually threw to Pryor this week, which was quite impressive for him. Baby steps.    Even when the Browns seem to have a chance coming into games, they absolutely flounder. That was the case against the Bills on Sunday, when they kept it close for a couple of quarters, and then ultimately imploded. They put on a horrific showing, and it looks like they will become the second team in NFL history to go 0-16. The story of the game was the utter domination by "

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor were both virtual non-factors. Doctson had another drop on a catchable ball. Cousins put in on his body, and though Doctson had to come back to it, the ball hit him in the arms. Meanwhile, Pryor just didn't see many targets and failed to log a catch. Neither player is worth owning in fantasy at the time.    In the run game, the Redskins once again had trouble gaining yards on the ground. Though Rob Kelley returned and had a nice 3-yard touchdown run, he simply couldn't get much going. The Cowboys were able to stuff him at the line, and the makeshift offensive front the Redskins fielded didn't help the cause. Kelley finished the day with 8 carries for 19 yards and didn't see much action in the second half. Pryor were both virtual non-factors. Doctson had another drop on a catchable ball.
