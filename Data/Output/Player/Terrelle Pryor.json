   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor was absolutely brilliant. Pryor went 19-of-29 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (1 pick was legitimate; the other came on a desperation attempt at the end of the contest). Pryor was most lethal on the ground though, compiling 112 yards on 13 carries. He actually had more rushing yards than any other NFL player following the 1 p.m. games. Now, before anyone gets too excited, remember that Indianapolis' defense is probably the worst stop unit in the NFL. The lack of 1 talent is 1 thing, but they were just so poorly coached. Matvei, whom I enter the Las Vegas Hilton Supercontest with, texted me and said that Chuck Pagano studied film of last year's 49ers-Packers tilt. That's exactly what it looked like. It seemed as though the Colts had no idea that Pryor could run the football. They didn't set the edge at all and looked completely unprepared. Fortunately for the Colts, this all didn't matter because "

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor was having a great year. What an accomplishment! Griffin actually threw to Pryor this week, which was quite impressive for him. Baby steps.    Even when the Browns seem to have a chance coming into games, they absolutely flounder. That was the case against the Bills on Sunday, when they kept it close for a couple of quarters, and then ultimately imploded. They put on a horrific showing, and it looks like they will become the second team in NFL history to go 0-16. The story of the game was the utter domination by LeSean McCoy. Many expected the strong lead back to have a terrific day against the hapless Browns, but he was really able to outdo himself. From the get-go, McCoy was absolutely stellar. He seemingly broke off 10-yard runs every single time he touched the ball and did a great job of following his blockers. McCoy is the poster child for patience at the NFL level, as he allows his blockers to open up lanes for him. That was apparent today, and it really helped McCoy to put up some huge numbers. Overall, McCoy saw 19 carries on the day and turned them into a whopping 153 yards. He also scored 2 very impressive touchdowns. On the first 1. it was a 3-yard plunge where he followed his blockers straight into the end zone. He was virtually untouched. The second 1 was 1 of the best plays of the day for the Bills, as he stutter-stepped and then ran to the outside. He used his speed to get outside of 5 Cleveland defenders and walk in. That play helped to seal the deal for Buffalo. Mike Gillislee also saw a good deal of action on the ground. He got 9 carries for 37 yards and got an early touchdown as well. He continues to see some goal-line work, but he is not a recommended start in any fantasy formats.    In the passing game, the Bills had a fairly strong performance. The performance of Tyrod Taylor was pretty solid, and he made a case to keep his starting job for next season. Taylor was near-perfect statistically, going 17-for-24 with 174 yards and a touchdown. Taylor displayed some great accuracy, and he really has the potential to be a better player. Despite playing with only a couple of legitimate receiving options, Taylor was able to help the offense put up 33 points. He had a very nice throw on his touchdown pass, where he had gotten crushed by 3 Browns, but was still able to get the ball to Charles Clay down the field. Once again, Taylor's biggest asset was his mobility. Taylor had 7 scrambles on the day and turned them into 49 yards. He had 1 very nice run where he rounded the corner and worked his way down the sideline before being shoved out. The play netted the team 28 yards. The Bills need to consider starting Taylor next year. He is still a work in progress, but he has proven at times to be a solid option. Even if the franchise parts way with Rex Ryan, Taylor should begin 2017 as the quarterback.    Thanks to Taylor's success, the Bills were able to support some solid receiving performances. The leader on the day was Charles Clay (7-72, 1 TD), and it was definitely the tight end's best game of the year. Clay was able to matchup well against the Browns' linebackers and was Taylor's favorite target. Most weeks, Clay is nothing more than a TE2. However, he could fare well in the team's matchup with the Jets next week. The other top receivers on the day were Marquise Goodwin (3-43) and LeSean McCoy (3-16). Both Sammy Watkins (1-10) and Robert Woods (1-5) were major disappointments, as they struggled to separate from the Cleveland corners.    Defensively, Kyle Williams and Lorenzo Alexander each had big days. Both men recorded 1.5 sacks, and Williams' return allowed the team to play much better run defense. Alexander continues to have a Pro Bowl-caliber season.    For the Browns, this was yet another embarrassment. They dropped to a lowly 0-14 on the season, and they seem to have no chance of winning. They are not helping themselves out by continuing to start Robert Griffin III. At a glance, Griffin's numbers are not altogether awful. He went 17-of-28 for 196 yards and did not commit a turnover. However, he really was not as good as those numbers indicate. He played a very poor game and spent most of the day dinking and dunking to his running backs. The coaching staff also ensured that he could toss a lot of screens to Terrelle Pryor, but he rarely threw the ball downfield. He had 1 nice downfield pass, but that was about it. The 1 area where Griffin looked to have some ability was on the ground. He had 8 scrambles for 48 yards and a touchdown. The touchdown was an 18-yard run that can only be described as vintage RG3. He ran around a few Bills defenders before laying out to get the ball over the end line. Still, it was not enough to look like anything more than a backup. The Browns definitely should go into the last couple of weeks of the season with Cody Kessler as the starter. At least he will give them a glimpse of hope in the future.    Thanks to Griffin's issues, "

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor. Then, with a first-and-goal from the 2.yard line, Cleveland proceeded to lose 13 yards on a wide receiver screen and ended up kicking a 34-yard field goal, which Landry Jones then answered with his own drive, but his finished with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Cobi Hamilton for the win.    I would say the Browns lost on purpose so they could get the No. 1 pick, but they sure did a good job of pretending to mess up royally if they did. They ended this season with just the 1 win last week against the Chargers, but Hue Jackson will get another season to get this team on track.    One player whose future continues to look bright is Terrelle Pryor, who caught 7-of-11 targets for 94 yards. He topped 1,000 receiving yards in his first full season as a receiver. This, of course, was with some bad quarterbacks at the helm.    The Steelers will move into the playoffs well rested to face the Miami Dolphins at Heinz Field.   "

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor. Cousins threw a perfect ball with just the right amount of arm strength. The throw hit Pryor right in the hands, but he dropped it. The play would have been called back due to a penalty anyway. Cousins ended up going 23-for-40 with 240 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. However, the stat line is a bit misleading, as Cousins was only able to put together a couple of good drives, at best. Additionally, he lost 2 fumbles on the day, but that was less of his fault.    The Redskins' offensive line has continued to struggle after a poor preseason performance. Against the Eagles, the unit struggled to deal with the team's strong pass-rushers. "

   "comment":"Terrelle Pryor (2-31). Crowder was much better after his abysmal opener, but he still didn't get enough space to make explosive plays. He is a WR3, at best for now, until Cousins improves. Meanwhile, Pryor was a major disappointment as he had only 1 catch before the final drive. He had another brutal drop and doesn't have chemistry with Cousins. Pryor is not a guy who should be relied on in most formats.    The real stars of the game on the Redskins' offense were Rob Kelley and "
