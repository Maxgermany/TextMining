   "comment":"Andre Brown (13-64, TD) and Ahmad Bradshaw (10-58, TD). It also blocked well for Eli Manning, who was sacked only once. Meanwhile, the Packers' linemen couldn't block the Giants whatsoever. Rodgers was constantly under pressure, getting sacked 5 times. Mathias Kiwanuka recorded 2 sacks, while Osi Umenyiora, who registered a sack and a forced fumble, showed signs of life for the first time all season. Having a healthy Antrel Rolle was also a major boost. Rodgers ended up 14-of-25 for 219 yards, an early touchdown to Jordy Nelson (2-71) who beat Corey Webster for a 61-yard score, an interception and a lost fumble. Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.    Only 3 Packer non-running backs made receptions: Nelson, Jermichael Finley (3-51) and Randall Cobb (4-39). Finley dropped a pass, but he showed great awareness by running from out of the screen and catching a ball that was tipped in the air.    Going back to Manning, he displayed no remnants of a tired arm that plagued him prior to the bye. Save for an ugly overthrow in the end zone on the opening drive, Manning was pretty much flawless, going 16-of-30 for 249 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Manning's scores went to Hakeem Nicks (5-77), Victor Cruz (3-36) and Rueben Randle (2-26). Cruz dropped a couple of passes, so he'll need to shore that up in December and beyond.    Unfortunately for the Giants, this victory came at a price. Andre Brown broke his fibula and could be out for the rest of the year. Safety "

Seeing his first action of the season, Brown carried the ball 30 times for 115 yards and a touchdown despite the fact that the team told the media that he would be limited in his initial game off the PUP list. It all worked out, as Brown was instrumental in the bleeding the clock out on the final drive. The Raiders simply couldn't tackle him before he pummeled forward for 4-5 yards a pop.    The Raiders, meanwhile, were missing their starting running back, as Darren McFadden was out yet again. "

   "comment":"Andre Brown ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. In crunch time, Romo came through for Dallas. The Cowboys were in a third-and-long situation, but Romo hit Dez Bryant for 18 yards to move the chains. Another completion to Bryant (9-102) moved the ball into Giants territory. Passes to Miles Austin (1-17) and Cole Beasley (2-13) got Dallas in field goal range. One more completion set up a 35-yard field goal for Dan Bailey to knock home the game winner.    Romo finished completing 23-of-38 passes for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.    Manning was 16-of-30 for 174 yards and 2 scores. Andre Brown was very impressive with 127 yards on 21 carries. The Cowboys' defense came up with timely stops. "

   "comment":"Andre Brown lost fumble, but backup tight end Dorin Dickerson dropped a key pass that forced Detroit to relinquish possession in overtime. The Giants took over, and following 2 long completions, Josh Brown nailed a 45-yard field goal to clinch the upset.    Eli Manning may have won this game, but he didn't play very well. He missed some big gains because of errant passes. Rueben Randle was open for a long completion early on when Manning misfired. Hakeem Nicks could've scored his first touchdown of the season, but Manning overthrew him. Manning did eventually get something going with Jerrel Jernigan (6-80, TD), who manned Victor Cruz's slot position, but that was pretty much it. Manning finished 23-of-42 for 256 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception in Detroit territory at the end of regulation.    Four Giants caught more than 2 passes, including Jernigan. Nicks (4-52), Brandon Myers (4-53) and Randle (4-40) followed Jernigan on the box score.    I mentioned Andre Brown earlier. He had a rough outing, gaining just 40 yards on 16 carries, culminating with the lost fumble. Adding injury to insult, Brown suffered a concussion on the play.   "
