Manziel didn't even have his team ready coming out of the 2-minute warning, forcing the Browns to use a timeout. His offensive line surrendered a sack on a play in which Manziel misread the read-option. "

That, unfortunately, came to an end versus the Titans, as Thomas tore his triceps in the third quarter. Thomas' streak ended at 10,363 snaps, which is arguably more impressive than the Cal Ripken Jr. streak of consecutive games played, given that baseball players don't do anything but stand around most of the time. Oddly enough, however, the Browns nearly won their first game of the season despite losing Thomas. They actually took the Titans to overtime, but some abysmal quarterbacking did them in. The Titans squeaked out a slim victory in a game that should've been well in hand. Tennessee allowed Cleveland to hang around because of some unforced errors. It started early when "
