   "comment":"Deonte Thompson (1-45). Sounds like 4 players that the Madden random name generator came up with. Cutler was great, and none of the 3 interceptions were his fault. The first came on a tipped pass, while the other 2 occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. The offensive line is something else Chicago needs to upgrade this spring.    Perhaps playing his final game at Soldier Field, "
