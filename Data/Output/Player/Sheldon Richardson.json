   "comment":"Sheldon Richardson had the entire first quarter off as a result of a strange coaching decision by Todd Bowles. Ajayi finished with 111 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He picked up consecutive 12-yard bursts in the 4.h quarter, as the Jets, as previously mentioned, were wearing down.    As for Ryan Tannehill, well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that Tannehill wasn't guilty of a turnover. He also did a good job of moving the chains at times, especially in the first half, when he was 11-of-13 for 98 yards and a touchdown. The bad news is that Tannehill nearly had a meltdown following intermission. His stat line in the second half was hideous: 6-of-15, 51 yards. He also was nearly responsible for a potential pick-six that was dropped in the red zone. Tannehill refused to challenge Darrelle Revis deep, and he was extremely fortunate that he was bailed out by a Kenyan Drake kickoff return, which was the result of the Jets foolishly being offside on a kickoff. Had Drake not scored, Tannehill would've been asked to drive down the field with a 23-20 deficit, and based on how he was perfoming in the second half, I don't think he could've done that.    Tannehill's sole touchdown went to some tight end named Dominique Jones, who sadly happened to be the team's leader in receiving yardage (3-42). Jarvis Landry was next with 3 grabs for 33 yards, and he just missed out on a score as he was tackled at the 1-yard line. DeVante Parker (2-8) barely did anything.    The Jets, meanwhile, seemed like they would win this game. With Tannehill sputtering, they took advantage of a dropped punt, and Ryan Fitzpatrick fired a touchdown to take the lead. As mentioned, however, a penalty allowed Miami to score on a decisive kickoff return. It wasn't the first time that the Jets were guilty of a costly penalty, as it was actually a problem all afternoon. For example, Buster Skrine and Calvin Pryor were flagged for consecutive personal fouls on a first-half drive, which ultimately led to Ajayi's touchdown. Sheldon Richardson was called for unnecessary roughness on Miami's next drive. Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, was responsible for his own blunders. He missed Richardson had the entire first quarter off as a result of a strange coaching decision by Todd Bowles. Ajayi finished with 111 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He picked up consecutive 12-yard bursts in the 4.h quarter, as the Jets, as previously mentioned, were wearing down.    As for Ryan Tannehill, well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that Tannehill wasn't guilty of a turnover. He also did a good job of moving the chains at times, especially in the first half, when he was 11-of-13 for 98 yards and a touchdown. The bad news is that Tannehill nearly had a meltdown following intermission. His stat line in the second half was hideous: 6-of-15, 51 yards. He also was nearly responsible for a potential pick-six that was dropped in the red zone. Tannehill refused to challenge Darrelle Revis deep, and he was extremely fortunate that he was bailed out by a Kenyan Drake kickoff return, which was the result of the Jets foolishly being offside on a kickoff. Had Drake not scored, Tannehill would've been asked to drive down the field with a 23-20 deficit, and based on how he was perfoming in the second half, I don't think he could've done that.    Tannehill's sole touchdown went to some tight end named Dominique Jones, who sadly happened to be the team's leader in receiving yardage (3-42). Jarvis Landry was next with 3 grabs for 33 yards, and he just missed out on a score as he was tackled at the 1-yard line. DeVante Parker (2-8) barely did anything.    The Jets, meanwhile, seemed like they would win this game. With Tannehill sputtering, they took advantage of a dropped punt, and Ryan Fitzpatrick fired a touchdown to take the lead. As mentioned, however, a penalty allowed Miami to score on a decisive kickoff return. It wasn't the first time that the Jets were guilty of a costly penalty, as it was actually a problem all afternoon. For example, Buster Skrine and Calvin Pryor were flagged for consecutive personal fouls on a first-half drive, which ultimately led to Ajayi's touchdown. Sheldon Richardson was called for unnecessary roughness on Miami's next drive. Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, was responsible for his own blunders. He missed "

   "comment":"Sheldon Richardson, Frank Clark and Michael Bennett look like a fearsome trio, though Bennett was dealing with injury problems during the game.Richardson that hung up just long enough in the perfect place for the receiver to haul it in. Overall, Wilson ended up going 14-for-27 with 158 yards and a fumble. It wasn't the best stat line but again, it wasn't his fault. Seattle needs to get him some offensive line help, or it is not going to be able to compete in the postseason.    The Seahawks got a pretty nice performance from their receivers in this contest. Doug Baldwin (4-63) and Paul Richardson (4-59) both looked good on the field. Baldwin was an efficient player as always and ran crisp routes for the team. However, he will be limited in fantasy because of the lack of time Wilson has in the pocket. For that reason, Baldwin is capped as a WR2 most weeks. Meanwhile, Richardson keeps improving with each game he plays. He is worth monitoring for now, but Wilson seems to like throwing to him. "
