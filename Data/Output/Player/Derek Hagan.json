   "comment":"Derek Hagan. Buffalo then recovered an onside kick and made another field goal. On the next kick, Miami made the recovery and was able to drain the clock.    Fitzpatrick was 31-of-47 for 316 yards with 2 scores and 3 interceptions. Spiller had a very good game for the Bills with 91 yards rushing and 76 yards receiving with 2 touchdowns, 1 on the ground and the other through the air.    Marshall (3-84) led the Dolphins in receiving, while Moore completed 10-of-20 passes for 217 yards and 2 scores. Even though both teams entered the game way below .500, Miami is clearly more talented and closer to competing with the elite of the conference (or even the division). Buffalo just has way too many injuries and needs to improve its pass rush.   "
