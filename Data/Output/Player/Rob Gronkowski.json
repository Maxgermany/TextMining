New England had been hearing how bad it was following a loss to Seattle and a near-defeat to the pathetic Jets, so perhaps this long trip across the Atlantic Ocean is exactly what this team needed. Tom Brady, who had been heavily criticized, went 23-of-35 for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns despite missing Aaron Hernandez. Brady was incredibly sharp; not even included in those statistics are 3 pass-interference penalties, all of which were committed by cornerback Bradley Fletcher.    A pair of Brady's touchdowns went to Rob Gronkowski (8-146) while the other 2 went to Brandon Lloyd (2-28)."

He was guilty of 2 interceptions into New England's talented secondary, and both turnovers led to New England touchdowns. The Dolphins actually had this at 14-13 at halftime, and they were outgaining the Patriots by about 170 yards. However, the Patriots broke free in the third quarter, outscoring Miami 24-0 in that frame. Before long, this was a complete blowout, as the Patriots preserved the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski when Edelman was briefly out of the lineup with a minor injury. Brady was fantastic. The completion percentage doesn't look good at first glance, but keep in mind that he endured 4 drops, all by different players. He could've enjoyed a much better statistical performance, but he was able to hand the ball off to Blount, who did most of the work for him.    Speaking of Blount, the monstrous back abused the Colts once again, gashing them for 148 yards and 3 touchdowns on 30 carries. Blount ran like a truck on most plays, but showed some shiftiness and made some juke moves a man his size shouldn't be able to do. Blount abused a poor defense that needs to improve this offseason.    The Patriots ran some trick plays with previously ineligible players once again. Some didn't work, but 1 produced a touchdown when Brady found left tackle Nate Solder on a short pass, and he saw the tackle lumber into the end zone. No word if John Harbaugh called in to yell at the officials some more.    Brady's other touchdowns went to Rob Gronkowski (3-28) and fullback James Develin. Gronkowski, who had a drop, nearly secured a second touchdown, but was interfered with in the end zone. The official inexplicably didn't throw the flag even though the defensive back clearly had his arm wrapped around Gronkowski's mid-section. Edelman, meanwhile, logged 9 receptions for 98 yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    As for the Colts' offense, they just couldn't generate anything outside of 1 possession that featured a Vince Wilfork penalty on a third down and an amazing sideline catch by T.Y. Hilton, which Bill Belichick nearly challenged (he would've lost). Otherwise, Indianapolis couldn't get out of its own way. Luck missed Reggie Wayne on the first drive, which was a 3.and-out. Joshua Cribbs muffed a punt when Indianapolis forced a 3.and-out on its own, which led to a New England touchdown. The following possession saw Robert Herron screw up with 2 drops, and Adam Vinatieri was way wide right from 51 yards out. The Colts scored their sole touchdown after that to make it 14-7, but the Patriots posted 10 points right before halftime and after intermission. Before the Colts knew what hit them, it was 31-7 in the middle of the third quarter. Luck had to start forcing the issue, which led to a pair of desperate interceptions.    Luck finished 12-of-33 for 126 yards and 2 picks. He didn't play well, but he wasn't as awful as his putrid numbers indicate. Some drops hurt him, and he didn't get the appropriate protection to help him maintain drives. He was just 5-of-14 for 37 yards and 2 interceptions following intermission when the game was mostly out of hand.    Hilton was Indianapolis' leading receiver even though he had just 1 catch - the aforementioned sideline grab - which went for 36 yards. Coby Fleener (3-30) and Dwayne Allen (4-30) were the only other Colts to register more than 15 receiving yards.    Daniel Herron had a nice yards-per-carry average - he tallied 51 yards on 10 carries - but the Colts just weren't in a position to run the ball all that much. Herron hurt his team with a couple of drops, including 1 near the end zone. The alien known as Zurlon Tipton (5-14) vultured a touchdown. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span> <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski with 2 minutes remaining when his team went down 20-10. It was the right decision, but an alarming 1 at the same time. The Patriots are in serious trouble because they can't block whatsoever.    Getting some players back will help New England a bit, but it might not be enough, and they may not be 100 percent anyway. Brady needs someone to throw to besides Gronkowski, who had just 2 catches for 18 yards on 7 targets. "

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski for a 36-yard touchdown. It was a play over the middle that very few, if any defenders, could have stopped and very few tight ends could have made. The Brady-Gronkowski connection sets the New England offense apart, as we could see when they hooked up for a 37-yard reception, which was the key play on the Patriots' last scoring drive, and 1 they dial up whenever they are in need.    Even though receiving specialist James White was able to score, this game would easily be considered a Blount game. Blount, who was dismissed from the Steelers due to walking off the field while time still remained on the clock, might have had some revenge on his mind this week, as he accumulated 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 touches. He was the closer in this 1. with the bulk of his yards coming in the second half to salt the earth.    "

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long. Of all the corners on the field on Sunday, the worst may have been Stephon Gilmore. He was terrible in this game. Something must be wrong with him. Gilmore was torched repeatedly by the Patriots, and he allowed a 53-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    "

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski. Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to Tyler Lockett for 36 yards in the early going. He also dropped in a beautiful bomb to C.J. Prosise for a 38-yard connection late in the contest, and he managed to do so while taking a big hit. Wilson didn't post any rushing numbers of consequence (3 carries, 6 yards), but he maneuvered the pocket well and did a good job of escaping potential sacks and keeping plays alive, as he's been wont to do throughout his career. Wilson didn't make very many mistakes. There were a couple, as 2 potential interceptions were dropped. However, he also should've thrown a 4.h score, but Jermaine Kearse let the ball slip through his hands on the team's first offensive drive of the evening. One of Wilson's touchdowns occurred at the end of the first half in which he engineered a terrific scoring drive with 70 seconds remaining on the clock following a New England score. The drive was capped off with a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin.    Speaking of Baldwin, he was the recepient of all of Wilson's touchdowns. He hauled in 6 of his 8 targets for 59 yards. He trailed Tyler Lockett (3-72), who looked healthy once again.    C.J. Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving. He was a monster in the passing game. He snatched all 7 of his targts for 87 receiving yards, and he also rushed for 66 yards on 17 carries. He had way more of a workload than Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year. Brady made up for it later by completing a third-and-25 pass to Julian Edelman to set up a score.    Brady's top receiver wasn't Julian Edelman or Rob Gronkowski; it was Martellus Bennett, who reeled in all 7 of his targets for 102 yards."

   "comment":"Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. That can be chalked up to Brady's knee injury though. He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, "

He has been carrying the Patriots so far this season and is currently 1 of the leaders of the MVP race.    Aside from the running backs, Brady's top receivers were Gronkowski (5-57, 1 TD) and Hogan (5-60). Gronkowski didn't make a lot of catches, but he had the touchdown catch and made the big play on the final drive when it counted. He is still the best tight end in football and should have some big performances as the year goes along. Meanwhile, Hogan made a nice catch over the middle of the field and continued to operate as the team's top deep threat. Elsewhere, "
