   "comment":"Gronkowski. The Giants took advantage and started moving the ball. Manning had good gains to Victor Cruz and Jake Ballard. That set up a field goal for New York. On the next New England possession, Brady got hit as he reared back to throw the ball and it came loose. The sack-fumble was recovered by the Giants at the Patriots' 10-yard line. The next play saw Brandon Jacobs run up the gut into the end zone, virtually untouched. Special teams became a liability for both teams in the second half. First, a muffed punt by Giants cornerback Aaron Ross was recovered by New England. That set up the Patriots for a field goal. A short time later, New England committed their fourth turnover when Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich forced a fumble from Julian Edelman in punt coverage. On the drive, Manning moved the ball with a couple of good passes along the sideline. The Giants got inside the 10-yard line when Manning hit Michael Clayton in the back of the end zone. His catch was tossed because he had stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, Manning threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone after throwing off his back foot. Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington spun off of his man and made a leaping interception to negate scoring chance. It was Arrington's fifth interception of the season. Brady answered with a big 27-yard toss to Welker in the middle of zone coverage. They hooked up again for 28 yards to get inside the 20. Brady finished the drive with a touchdown strike to Hernandez. He caught the ball short of the end zone and made a few defenders miss before charging in for the game-tying score. Brady led another a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead in the fourth quarter. The Giants came up with a big answer. Manning made a few good throws to move the ball down the field. He was aided by a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Arrington. On 3rd-and-5, Manning made a perfect throw to Mario Manningham, who got by Arrington running through the end zone. The 10-yard score gave the Giants a 17-13 lead. A penalty on Manningham after the play helped give the Patriots good field position. Brady got to work with a good pass to Deion Branch, and then a 19-yard pass to Gronkowski brought it to the Giants' 15 yard-line. A few plays later, and Brady had a 4th-and-8 at the Giants' 14-yard line. He threw a strike to Gronkowski in the front of the end zone for the lead. To start the game-winning drive, Manning got a huge gain to Ballard. Manning tossed a ball down the seam, and Ballard made a leaping catch for 28 yards. Manning then scrambled for 12 yards. On the next play, he threw incomplete for Victor Cruz in the end zone but pass interference was called. That put the ball on the Patriot's 1-yard line. Manning threw incomplete for Ballard. Jacobs got stuffed on the next play. On third-and-goal, with 19 seconds remaining, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Ballard running an out route in the end zone. That completed New York's massive road win and saw the Giants improve to 6-2 on the season. For the night, Manning was 20-of-39 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacobs ran for 72 yards on 18 carries, while Cruz led the Giants in receiving with 6 receptions for 91 yards. Ballard caught 4 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28-of-49 passes for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Giants had a good rush, but Brady missed some open receivers whom he normally hits. Brady seemed off against New York. Welker led New England in receiving with 9 receptions for 136 yards. Gronkowski had 8 grabs for 101 yards and 1 touchdown.   "

Buffalo jumped out a 21-7 lead after 2 Scott Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score. He beat corner Kyle Arrington and safety Patrick Chung took a bad angle. Brady answered by catching fire. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Woodhead. Brady then moved the ball with passes to Wes Welker, and the signal-caller ran the ball into end zone on a short scramble. Brady followed that by throwing a strike to Ron Gronkowski for a 28-yard score. New England ran in short touchdowns with "

   "comment":"Gronkowski mimicking the royal guard after a touchdown, the Brits were having a jolly good time. This was every bit the domination that the score indicates. New England had been hearing how bad it was following a loss to Seattle and a near-defeat to the pathetic Jets, so perhaps this long trip across the Atlantic Ocean is exactly what this team needed. Tom Brady, who had been heavily criticized, went 23-of-35 for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns despite missing Aaron Hernandez. Brady was incredibly sharp; not even included in those statistics are 3 pass-interference penalties, all of which were committed by cornerback Bradley Fletcher.    A pair of Brady's touchdowns went to Rob Gronkowski (8-146) while the other 2 went to Brandon Lloyd (2-28)."

   "comment":"Gronkowski broke his forearm. He'll be out 4-6 weeks, so he should be back for the team's playoff run. Remember that Aaron Hernandez will return soon.    Andrew Luck has been great for the Colts thus far, but he's not ready to take down the elite of the AFC. The defending conference champions took the rookie to the woodshed in a dominating second half. This young Indianapolis team wasn't ready to win a shootout with Tom Brady, as the Colts' defense couldn't stop the Patriots' scoring machine. Indianapolis is still in good position to land a wild card, but this performance illustrated that the team's ceiling is a wild-card berth rather than a run in January.    The Colts started the game well. Luck engineered a first-quarter, 7-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a Delone Carter (2-21) touchdown run. Brady answered with an 8-play, 81-yard drive of his own that ended with a 4-yard scoring pass to Gronkowski. Luck came right back moving the ball downfield and threw a 14-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Gronkowski's return has always been seen as a beacon of hope for the Patriots. Tom Brady had been struggling, but all he needed was his favorite intermediate target to get out of his funk. Well, it appears as though that's not the case. Gronkowski didn't play all of the snaps in this contest - for example, he was on the field for 23 of 36 plays in the first half - but he did lead the Patriots with 8 receptions for 114 yards. He also drew a holding penalty. However, Brady still barely completed half of his passes and failed once again to throw a touchdown. He continued to struggle to loft the football, unnecessarily throwing lasers downfield without any touch. He nearly lost a fumble, and Worst of all, he tossed a pick-6 despite nursing a 21-10 advantage in the third quarter. Brady went 22-of-46 for 228 yards and the pick. He had a chance to win the game in overtime, but completed just 1 of 4 passes in the extra session. His incompletions weren't even close. It must be noted that the Jets' defensive line did a great job of controlling the line of scrimmage. Their 4 sacks aren't indicative of how much New York's line dominated New England's front.    A bit more on Gronkowski: He had 2 chances to find the end zone, but he and Brady had a miscommunication of sorts in the fourth quarter. A bit later, Gronkowski dropped a 1-handed attempt. With Gronkowski eating up targets - including penalties, he saw a whopping 19 balls go his way - the other New England players saw a statistical regression. "

That set up a field goal for New England. After the Brady interception, Ryan Tannehill moved the chains with some big completions to Charles Clay (5-37). Tannehill finished the drive with a clutch third-and-goal toss to Brandon Gibson. The second-year signal-caller followed it up with another nice drive featuring some good runs from Daniel Thomas (9-47). On third-and-3 at the 5-yard line, Tannehill threw a bullet to Thomas for a touchdown and a 17-3 halftime lead. The Dolphins were moving well in the third quarter before Rob Ninkovich came with a pressure that set up a sack for Dont'a Hightower. That pushed Miami back and led to a 46-yard missed field goal by Caleb Sturgis. After that miss, it was all Patriots the rest of the way. New England moved the ball down the field with Brady hitting Aaron Dobson (4-60) for a 14-yard touchdown. The ensuing possession saw Logan Ryan (2 sacks) come unblocked on a blind-side blitz and hit Tannehill for a forced fumble. The ball was recovered by Ninkovich. A pass to Danny Amendola (3-15) set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Brandon Bolden (8-22). A holding penalty on Nate Solder canceled out a 30-yard touchdown catch by Gronkowski, so the Patriots settled for a 48-yard field goal and a 20-17 lead.

He let the ball hit the ground just 5 times in the second half, going 18-of-23 for 263 yards and a touchdown following the break. The Patriots' offense, transforming into a deadly machine, scored on all but 1 possession in the final 2 quarters. Brady's final numbers looked like this: 29-of-41, 371 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. Brady, who had a potential third score dropped by Brandon Bolden, had a strong connection going with Gronkowski and Edelman after the early mistakes. Gronkowski had 6 grabs for 127 yards and a score, while Edelman led the team with 9 receptions for 101 yards. Gronkowski hurt his ankle during the game, but remained on the field. It's reportedly not serious at all.    Stevan Ridley didn't see any action because of his chronic fumbling problems. "

Gronkowski (3-44) made his fantasy owners happy with a touchdown, but he should have reeled in a second score, but flat out dropped it. The ball was actually in his hands, and it simply appeared as though he let it fall out intentionally.    It's amazing the Raiders nearly won this game despite "

Gronkowski (7-94) and Edelman (9-91) didn't find the end zone, but they both made big contributions. The former appeared to hurt his shoulder in the second half, but he didn't miss much action.

   "comment":"Gronkowski drop helped their cause - but Tom Brady eventually got into a rhythm and began dissecting Detroit's vaunted stop unit. By halftime, Brady generated 233 passing yards on 21-of-27 passing, as the Patriots held a 24-6 lead. Brady had a couple hiccups in the second half when he fired an interception in the red zone on a forced pass and then overthrew an open Brandon LaFell for a potential score. However, he got things together and continued to shred Detroit's overwhelmed secondary. He finished 38-of-53 for 349 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. With Gronkowski healthy, and a strong running game in support, it's difficult to imagine Brady slowing down anytime soon.    Speaking of the powerful ground attack, it was someone completely different this week. Jonas Gray rumbled for 201 yards and 4 scores Sunday night against the Colts, but he was nowhere to be seen in this game. Gray didn't even have a single touch despite being active, as Bill Belichick wanted to teach him a lesson for showing up late for practice. Gray may have lost his job permanently, as "

   "comment":"Gronkowski, etc. should be able to gain 1 yard. The issues persisted, when Brady and Belichick left too much time on the clock at the end of the first half, allowing Rodgers to score a touchdown on a 45-yard dart to Jordy Nelson, who beat Darrelle Revis for the only time on the afternoon. It was a bad scheme that allowed Nelson to run past Revis and the other Patriots for the touchdown. This was huge, as the Packers had issues in the red zone the entire game. Belichick then went on to waste a timeout early in the third quarter, which he sorely needed at the end of the contest. Of course, the killer for the Patriot bettors occurred at the end of the game when Stephen Gostkowski whiffed on a 47-yarder to cover the spread, which was his first real missed field goal of the year. Of course, Mason Crosby was errant on a try earlier and Davante Adams dropped a touchdown, so you can't exactly call that a bad beat - just a frustrating 1.    Hats off to Rodgers through, who continued his brilliant play at home. Despite Revis locking down Nelson, save for that 1 play, Rodgers managed to go 24-of-38 for 368 yards and 2 touchdowns, with a third throw that should've gone into the end zone to Adams. Rodgers injured his hand on 1 of his scrambles (5 carries, 22 rush yards), but didn't appear to be affected by it. He was helped by his offensive line, which provided tremendous protection. The Patriots barely put any pressure on him.    With Nelson smothered - he didn't even see a target until the 7:55 mark in the second quarter - Adams and Randall Cobb tied for the team lead with 11 targets. Adams and Cobb tallied 121 and 85 yards, respectively. Neither found the end zone, but Adams easily could have twice. I already mentioned his drop; he nearly had a touchdown in the first half, but managed to get just 1 foot inbounds. Meanwhile, Nelson managed just 2 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. Richard Rodgers (2-35) secured Aaron Rodgers' other score.    The Packers ran the ball well, especially in the first half. Eddie Lacy gained 98 yards on 21 carries. He had some big gains on the opening drive that really got things rolling for Green Bay.    As for the Patriots, Brady didn't have his best outing. Unlike Rodgers, Brady didn't have very good protection and had to rush some of his throws. His offensive line cost him big time on a third down of the final offensive drive for his team. He took a sack, which ended the drive and made Gostkowski's cover-killing field goal that much harder. Brady finished 22-of-35 for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns. He made some clutch throws, including a fourth-and-3 to Julian Edelman and a third-and-7 to Gronkowski on the same drive. However, Brady missed Gronkowski in the end zone at the very end of the game, which could've been the decisive score.    Gronkowski led the team with 98 receiving yards off 7 catches. Julian Edelman also had 7 grabs, tallying 48 yards. "

He did have help from Julian Edelman, however, who broke out of a tackle to score from 69 yards out. It helped Brady that the Chargers struggled to punt, as Scifres was knocked out of the game as a result of that block. Bill Belichick brilliantly had 2 punt returners on the field, just in case Scifres' replacement hit a bad boot, which proved to be the case on several occasions.    Edelman and Gronkowski both tied for the team lead with 8 receptions for 141 and 87 yards, respectively. Both scored once. "

He was guilty of 2 interceptions into New England's talented secondary, and both turnovers led to New England touchdowns.

Brady finished 21-of-35 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which came early when Jason Trusnik tipped and picked off a pass. Brady was on fire in the second half, going 13-of-20 for 205 yards and a pair of scores following intermission. Brady had some awesome throws, fitting in a tight ball to Gronkowski for a touchdown.

   "comment":"Gronkowski when Edelman was briefly out of the lineup with a minor injury. Brady was fantastic. The completion percentage doesn't look good at first glance, but keep in mind that he endured 4 drops, all by different players. He could've enjoyed a much better statistical performance, but he was able to hand the ball off to Blount, who did most of the work for him.    Speaking of Blount, the monstrous back abused the Colts once again, gashing them for 148 yards and 3 touchdowns on 30 carries. Blount ran like a truck on most plays, but showed some shiftiness and made some juke moves a man his size shouldn't be able to do. Blount abused a poor defense that needs to improve this offseason.    The Patriots ran some trick plays with previously ineligible players once again. Some didn't work, but 1 produced a touchdown when Brady found left tackle Nate Solder on a short pass, and he saw the tackle lumber into the end zone. No word if John Harbaugh called in to yell at the officials some more.    Brady's other touchdowns went to Rob Gronkowski (3-28) and fullback James Develin."

   "comment":"Gronkowski early on, but Davon House made a nice pass-breakup - 1 of the few, quality plays that Jacksonville's defense enjoyed this afternoon. Brady went to Danny Amendola shortly afterward for the milestone. Brady finished 33-of-42 for 358 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jacksonville's inept stop unit offered absolutely no resistance. It was pathetic. Brady remains the quarterback to own in daily formats, as the pissed-off Patriots want to humiliate teams by running up the score.    Brady's touchdowns went to Amendola (5-39) and Keshawn Martin (3-33). Amendola saw just 5 targets on the afternoon and is just a PPR reserve. Martin isn't worth owning, and neither is Aaron Dobson, who fell back down to Earth following last week's productive performance. Dobson caught 1 ball for 5 yards. He drew a deep pass interference flag, but also dropped a ball.    Gronkowski didn't find the end zone, but he broke the century receiving mark, snatching 4 balls for 101 yards. He nearly scored, so there's nothing to worry about there. Meanwhile, "

On the second play of the game, Chandler Jones tracked down Ryan Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5, and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when "

   "comment":"Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, sucked big time. This includes his offensive line, which couldn't block whatsoever. Brady was constantly under siege, as the 4 sacks he took weren't nearly indicative of the amount of pressure he faced. Brady had to throw numerous passes away, and it's astonishing that he wasn't flagged for intentional grounding on a couple of occasions. Von Miller terrorized him, logging 2.5 sacks and an interception. Meanwhile, Manning opened the game by throwing the ball into the dirt, which made me question what the hell I was betting on. However, Manning rebounded with some solid throws on a pair of third downs, and the opening drive culminated with a touchdown to Owen Daniels. Manning continued to play well throughout, abusing a secondary that hadn't been tested much all year because of a ridiculously easy schedule. Manning, for the first time all season, didn't throw an interception in a game that he started, though he did technically commit a turnover on a pass in which he threw backward. Bill Belichick successfully challenged, and it turned into New England's sole touchdown of the afternoon until the very end. The Broncos controlled the game throughout, never trailing, but there was some concern as the game progressed. Denver lost numerous key defenders to injury, including T.J. Ward, who was Denver's best solution against Rob Gronkowski. "

As for Gronkowski, he was very quiet despite having a decent matchup. It appears as though Gronkowski is still not fully healthy, as he was not on the field for all of the Patriots' snaps.

Even though receiving specialist James White was able to score, this game would easily be considered a Blount game. Blount, who was dismissed from the Steelers due to walking off the field while time still remained on the clock, might have had some revenge on his mind this week, as he accumulated 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 touches. He was the closer in this 1, with the bulk of his yards coming in the second half to salt the earth.    "

He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, "

   "comment":"Gronkowski reception. Nevertheless, New England was up 10, and it didn't seem like the Chiefs would keep it close. In the end, 1 team won by 15, and its quarterback threw for 368 yards and 4 touchdowns - and it wasn't the Patriots and Tom Brady! Kansas City generated 537 yards of offense, most of which came on big chunk plays. We're used to the Chiefs dinking and dunking, but they were explosive in their season debut. Kareem Hunt and Tyreek Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns. What's crazy is that Travis Kelce had just 40 of those yards (5 catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no 1 should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. Eric Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high Disaster Grade for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just 2 of his 6 targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. "
