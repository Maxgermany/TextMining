He didn't even look like he belonged in the league, and if he has several more starts like this, he'll be out of the NFL in the near future, and the Browns will have to research the quarterbacks available in the 2016 NFL Draft - and only because they're out of position to land either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston. I can't believe how bad Manziel was. He didn't even look functional. It didn't seem like he prepared for this game at all, and his teammates played the same way. They were guilty of numerous false starts. "

   "comment":"Johnny Manziel. Davis finished 25-of-38 for 230 yards and the pick. Much of those positive numbers came in garbage time. The Browns didn't seem to show any interest in playing hard for Davis, and it appears as though Pettine has lost the locker room.    With all of the injuries, Brian Hartline led the team with 8 catches for 83 yards. "

   "comment":"Johnny Manziel's performance: Manziel has been good when he hasn't been terrible. Manziel did a number of positive things in this contest. He led numerous scoring drives and was able to hit his receivers for some long gains. His final numbers were solid, as he went 21-of-31 for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, Manziel made some bone-headed decisions in this game that would've cost his team had they been battling a more-competitive opponent. For instance, Manziel had 1 of the worst picks I've ever seen. He scrambled left, and in desperation, he heaved the ball way late and way over the middle of the field. It was 1 of the most pathetic throws you'll ever see. Manziel also took a horrible sack because he held on to the ball too long, and then was nearly guilty of a safety, but was fortunate to be bailed out by a "

He threw an interception when he telegraphed a pass, allowing "
