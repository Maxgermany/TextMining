   "comment":"Alex Smith (20-37, 177 yards, TD) launched 3 interceptions in Eagles territory. Delanie Walker, meanwhile, fumbled in the red zone when the score was just 7-3. The Eagles took over and went 94 yards for a touchdown, giving them a sizable lead that they would never relinquish.    Though he tossed 2 interceptions, Donovan McNabb otherwise played pretty well, going 21-of-36 for 306 yards and a touchdown. He hit 3 plays of 39 yards or more. Two of McNabb's big gainers (39, 59) went to DeSean Jackson, who finished with 6 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown. The other was to Brent Celek (43), who notched 4 catches for 73 yards.    Leonard Weaver led the team with 17 carries for 52 yards. LeSean McCoy rushed the ball just 9 times, but gained 48 yards and a score.    Frank Gore, meanwhile, led all backs in rushing with 107 yards on just 16 attempts. It's a shame the 49ers fell behind early; otherwise, Gore would have had more opportunities.    Strangely, neither Vernon Davis (3-43) nor Michael Crabtree (4-26) led the 49ers in receiving. Josh Morgan did that, snagging 7 balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Davis received a verbal lashing from Mike Singletary for not making an attempt to break up Alex Smith's first interception.    I thought this could be a potential stink bomb game from Andy Reid. The Eagles won, but Big Red still made a huge error. On 4th-and-inches in the first quarter, Reid decided to go for it on his own 29! Philadelphia wasn't able to convert, giving the 49ers a short field. Fortunately for them, Walker had that aforementioned fumble.    Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender. The time kept ticking down, but Weaver was killing the Eagles because he wasn't paying attention. "

Smith went into Beast Mode and simply was unstoppable. However, he played just like this against the Saints on Monday Night Football, so there's no reason to think that this will carry over to next week's game against Oakland. Smith does seem to perform better in the no-huddle, 2.minute drill style of offense, so San Francisco should think about playing this way going forward.    In total, Smith went 25-of-39 for 309 yards, 3 touchdowns, 2 interceptions and a horrifying fumble returned for an Eagles score.    On the bright side, "

   "comment":"Alex Smith, it was no surprise to 49er fans who have seen his follies all too often. Amazingly, the ball bounced right back up to Smith, who threw deep, almost connecting for a touchdown and getting a pass interference call on the Cowboys to boot. Breaks like that helped San Francisco scrap its way to a 14-0 lead. A pass interference penalty (25 yards) set them up at the 1-yard line for a short Frank Gore touchdown run, and in the second scoring drive, a bunch of short plays did the trick after starting at the Dallas 48. Finally, Dallas caught a huge break when Ahmad Brooks lined up offsides on a failed third down as time was running out in the half. Given a second chance to convert, some guy named Tramine Brock out of Belhaven College (think the 49ers need to draft a cornerback?) fell down in coverage, and 53 yards later, Miles Austin cut the lead to 14-7 at the break.    Speaking of Austin, that final drive marked his first catch of the game after the Cowboys failed to find him on 5 targets in the first half. Then he caught all 9 passes thrown his way for 143 yards and a touchdown hat trick. Unfortunately, Austin pulled his hamstring and could be out a few weeks. The passing game took on increased importance because Felix Jones hurt his shoulder early. He had just 9 carries for 25 yards, and caught a pass for 5 yards. DeMarco Murray (6-21) and Tashard Choice (5-5) were not effective in relief.    While on the subject of injuries, Tony Romo was hit by Carlos Rogers toward the end of the second quarter and did not come out ready to play in the second half. It was Jon Kitna time and you know what that means - touchdowns, yards and interceptions. Kitna completed his first 3 passes before Donte Whitner intercepted him when Jason Witten did not go where he expected him to on a deep route. Witten saw a hefty 15 targets, catching 7 passes for 102 yards. Both quarterbacks looked at him, so if Romo's ribs keep him out, fantasy owners should not be worried about putting the tight end in the lineup. That interception was offset by a pick from Alan Ball who was starting at cornerback as part of a makeshift Dallas secondary. Five plays later, Kitna found Austin to tie the game at 14.    Where was Ted Ginn? Glad I am pretending you asked. Ginn was another heavily targeted player, leading the 49ers with 7. but he caught just 4 passes for 38 yards. He also was not a factor in the return game after housing a punt and kickoff to ice last week's win over Seattle. However, rookie Kendall Hunter did have a big kickoff return for 43 yards following the tying score. Unfortunately it was wasted when DeMarcus Ware started that drive with 1 of his 2 sacks. Kitna's next interception was a pass thrown behind Kevin Ogletree. Alex Smith immediately hit Delanie Walker who was matched up with Anthony Spencer and predictably ran right past him for a 29-yard score to make it 21-14.Smith, it was no surprise to 49er fans who have seen his follies all too often.

   "comment":"Alex Smith, it was no surprise to 49er fans who have seen his follies all too often. Amazingly, the ball bounced right back up to Smith, who threw deep, almost connecting for a touchdown and getting a pass interference call on the Cowboys to boot. Breaks like that helped San Francisco scrap its way to a 14-0 lead. A pass interference penalty (25 yards) set them up at the 1-yard line for a short Frank Gore touchdown run, and in the second scoring drive, a bunch of short plays did the trick after starting at the Dallas 48. Finally, Dallas caught a huge break when Ahmad Brooks lined up offsides on a failed third down as time was running out in the half. Given a second chance to convert, some guy named Tramine Brock out of Belhaven College (think the 49ers need to draft a cornerback?) fell down in coverage, and 53 yards later, Miles Austin cut the lead to 14-7 at the break.    Speaking of Austin, that final drive marked his first catch of the game after the Cowboys failed to find him on 5 targets in the first half. Then he caught all 9 passes thrown his way for 143 yards and a touchdown hat trick. Unfortunately, Austin pulled his hamstring and could be out a few weeks. The passing game took on increased importance because Felix Jones hurt his shoulder early. He had just 9 carries for 25 yards, and caught a pass for 5 yards. DeMarco Murray (6-21) and Tashard Choice (5-5) were not effective in relief.    While on the subject of injuries, Tony Romo was hit by Carlos Rogers toward the end of the second quarter and did not come out ready to play in the second half. It was Jon Kitna time and you know what that means - touchdowns, yards and interceptions. Kitna completed his first 3 passes before Donte Whitner intercepted him when Jason Witten did not go where he expected him to on a deep route. Witten saw a hefty 15 targets, catching 7 passes for 102 yards. Both quarterbacks looked at him, so if Romo's ribs keep him out, fantasy owners should not be worried about putting the tight end in the lineup. That interception was offset by a pick from Alan Ball who was starting at cornerback as part of a makeshift Dallas secondary. Five plays later, Kitna found Austin to tie the game at 14.    Where was Ted Ginn? Glad I am pretending you asked. Ginn was another heavily targeted player, leading the 49ers with 7. but he caught just 4 passes for 38 yards. He also was not a factor in the return game after housing a punt and kickoff to ice last week's win over Seattle. However, rookie Kendall Hunter did have a big kickoff return for 43 yards following the tying score. Unfortunately it was wasted when DeMarcus Ware started that drive with 1 of his 2 sacks. Kitna's next interception was a pass thrown behind Kevin Ogletree. Alex Smith immediately hit Delanie Walker who was matched up with Anthony Spencer and predictably ran right past him for a 29-yard score to make it 21-14.Smith, it was no surprise to 49er fans who have seen his follies all too often.

He dropped back and had plenty of time to throw, but made a bad read on a throw to Kellen Winslow. The pass was picked off by Carlos Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead.

The 49ers went to Gore 3 times in a row to start the drive totaling 21 yards, then went away from him and failed to muster 3 yards on 2 plays to force a long field goal. David Akers, 1 of the most valuable players for them this season, was good from 52 yards out to make it 3-0. The Redskins tried to mount an answer with Jabar Gaffney (4-40) catching 2 passes to convert third downs. However, on the second 1. Trent Williams was nailed for a totally unnecessary smack in the back of Justin Smith for a 15-yard personal foul to force a punt following a pass to Helu. Now that I mention it, passing to him was a large part of the offense. He set a team mark with 14 receptions, putting Art Monk out of the record book in the process, for 105 yards. Following another exchange of punts, San Francisco took over at its own 45. Alex Smith scrambled for 8 yards on first down and Gore (19-107) had his longest run of the game chugging down field for a gain of 27. Two runs by Smith was crunched by rookie Ryan Kerrigan for a sack.

From the 6-yard line, Frank Gore tried to do the rest, but 3 runs came up short. On the second attempt, linebacker James Laurinaitis saved a touchdown, and San Francisco went up 6-0 with a short field goal. Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal. After getting the ball back thanks to a sack from Larry Grant, the San Francisco offense kept its collective foot on the pedal as the half wound down, however Chris Long ended the threat with a sack. To its credit, St. Louis came to play defensively. Following the break, things started to unravel for the Rams. After quickly moving down the field on passes to Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs.

At the start of the 4.h quarter, Alex Smith hit Kyle Williams who did all the work for a 56-yard touchdown to make the final margin 26-0.Smith, who had a huge game, recovering. From the 6-yard line, Frank Gore tried to do the rest, but 3 runs came up short. On the second attempt, linebacker James Laurinaitis saved a touchdown, and San Francisco went up 6-0 with a short field goal. Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal. After getting the ball back thanks to a sack from Larry Grant, the San Francisco offense kept its collective foot on the pedal as the half wound down, however Chris Long ended the threat with a sack. To its credit, St. Louis came to play defensively. Following the break, things started to unravel for the Rams. After quickly moving down the field on passes to Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs. Then Alex Smith dropped a 52-yard bomb to Crabtree for a touchdown and the 16-0 lead. If St. Louis had any hope, it was extinguished right there.

One of their many MVPs this season, kicker David Akers, couldn't make good from 52 yards out though. Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back "

   "comment":"Alex Smith was just 12-of-19 for 143 yards. The 49ers' demolition was all about great running and just watching Mark Sanchez attempt futile passes all afternoon. It's really laughable how bad Sanchez is. He takes stupid sacks, makes careless mistakes and can't fire accurate accurate passes consistently. Sanchez went 13-of-29 for 103 yards an interception and a lost fumble on a third down in San Francisco territory. Sanchez nearly tossed a couple of other picks, as the crowd booed him mercilessly throughout the entire contest. I tweeted () the following during the third quarter following 1 of Sanchez's turnovers: Hey Jets, it's Tebow time. It really is. It has to be. Even if you're not a Tebow believer, you have to at least agree that it's time for New York to give up on Sanchez, and Tebow is the only alternative. Tebow was on the field on several occasions. He completed his only pass attempt for 9 yards, on a 3rd-and-1. However, his tight end fumbled the football after a fierce hit and the 49ers recovered it.    That wasn't the only instance in which an injured Jet coughed up the football while writhing in pain. Santonio Holmes hauled in a rare Sanchez completion but suffered a non-contact injury to his foot (though at the time, it seemed like he hurt his knee). As Holmes went down, he flipped the ball away carelessly like a selfish POS, seemingly giving up because he perhaps knew that his season was over. Carlos Rogers scooped up the ball and ran it in for 6. Holmes, meanwhile, was carted off into the locker room. He finished with 4 catches for 29 yards.    The Jets, of course, couldn't run the football either because Shonn Greene is terrible. He gained just 34 yards on 11 carries.    As for the 49ers, I mentioned earlier that they pounded the ball very well. Their front line pushed New York's defense around, as the Jet players couldn't tackle whatsoever. San Francisco ran a number of plays out of the Wildcat with Colin Kaepernick, who rushed for 50 yards and a touchdown on 5 attempts. Frank Gore (21-62, TD) and Kendall Hunter (8-56, TD) also couldn't be stopped.    With the runners gashing the Jets easily, Alex Smith didn't have to do much. He finished with essentially the same line as posted above (12-21, 143 yards), and none of his receivers had more than 3 receptions. Both Smith was just 12-of-19 for 143 yards.

The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by "

   "comment":"Alex Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure.

He missed some open receivers, including 1 in the end zone for a potential touchdown because he floated the ball out of bounds. He also took a whopping 6 sacks. Amazingly, Jason Campbell outplayed Smith. Campbell went 22-of-36 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is crazy considering that he was battling the NFL's top defense without any sort of running game. He also endured lots of drops from his receivers, mostly Smith. With many clueless former NFL players foolishly lauding him as this great game-winner, anyone who has really watched these games knows that he's just not very good.

But a 7.point output against the Colts? That's pretty eye-opening. Smith was terrible against a defense that hasn't been able to stop anyone recently. His final numbers don't look too bad (16-of-29, 153 yards, 2 interceptions), but by the time the Colts made this a 23-7 score with 2:47 remaining in the third quarter, he was 10-of-18 for 79 yards and a pick. He generated some garbage yardage in the final frame, but ultimately tossed his second interception on an underthrown touch pass. Smith enjoyed so much success last week because the Raiders inexplicably had no idea that the Chiefs would be running screen plays. The Colts were more prepared for that, limiting Charles to 38 receiving yards on his 5 receptions. Charles did rush for 106 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries though, but he obviously couldn't do much more because his team trailed throughout.    The Colts, meanwhile, played so much better offensively than they have in recent weeks. That's obvious just by looking at the result, but their offensive line performed extremely well. If Indianapolis' front can continue to play like this, the team will be a tough out in the playoffs because Smith paired with receivers who can't catch the ball and an offensive line that has trouble blocking at times, so it wouldn't have been a surprise if they had posted minimal production in a playoff lose in January.

Kansas City never relinquished its lead and held a double-digit advantage for most of the afternoon. Kansas City's defense took over in the second half, preventing the Jets from scoring a single point. Part of that was the quarterback getting hurt, but QBDK wasn't going to lead the Jets to victory anyway. While he made some nice plays - particularly 1 instance in which he eluded a sack and found Chris Johnson for a big gain - he was just too overwhelmed with pressure. Combine that with some red-zone ineptitude, and it's no wonder that New York didn't score at all following the break. QBDK wasn't awful though, as he went 21-of-28 for 196 yards and a touchdown to Eric Decker (9-63). He got hurt on a 4.h-down attempt in the red zone on a play in which his team was flagged for offensive pass interference. He was able to enter the game later in the 4.h quarter, but it was too late by then. Still, it was a reminder of how brittle QBDK is, and why teams simply can't rely on him to be a starter. Simms, by the way, did nothing in QBDK's absence, going 3-of-8 for 39 yards.    Percy Harvin was the primary reason why the Jets were able to move the chains and enter the red zone on some instances. Harvin caught a whopping 11 balls for 129 yards, and he also had a good kickoff return at the end of the first half to set up the team in field goal range. It's obviously very encouraging that Harvin was able to be such a huge part of this offense despite being in New York for only 2 weeks.    Chris Johnson complained about his usage this past week, and the Jets' coaching staff obviously listened. Johnson had more carries than Chris Ivory (11-8), and Johnson outgained Ivory, 69-22. CJ0K also caught 2 passes for 32 receiving yards. He actually looked decent for a change, but his troublesome antics during the week is exactly why bringing him into the team was a huge mistake. He's not nearly the player he once was, so his poor locker room attitude isn't worth it. The Jets, now 1-8, have to regret bringing him in, but it's not like they had the talent to win anyway.    As for the victors, Alex Smith was very economical, going 21-of-31 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He didn't make any mistakes, but then again, he didn't really need to force anything into New York's anemic secondary, who left receivers open all afternoon. I already mentioned that Smith somehow found Fasano for a fluke touchdown in the first half.

   "comment":"Alex Smith touchdown run because Leodis McKelvin muffed a punt. The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion. The crowd let the officials have it for what they thought was an awful call - there were several shady penalties, including an early ticky-tack roughness on Smith that gave the Chiefs a field goal - but it ultimately allowed Kansas City to prevail. Kyle Orton, meanwhile, was also responsible for leaving some points off the board. He was very inaccurate in crucial moments, missing multiple touchdowns to open players. He had Chandler and Robert Woods available for scores at various points of the game, but he just completely whiffed on his throws. Orton finished 29-of-48 for 259 yards and a touchdown to Chris Hogan. He had some issues with the Kansas City pass rush, and it was evident at times that he was concerned with his protection. Orton was brought down only once, but that's not even close to being indicative of the amount of pressure he was under.    Both Sammy Watkins and Fred Jackson were game-time decisions, but both played. Neither did much, however. Watkins saw 10 targets come his way, but snared only 4 of them for just 27 yards. He didn't look completely healthy and probably should have rested. Jackson, meanwhile, didn't get much of a workload, carrying the ball just 3 time for 10 yards. He was a bigger contributor in the passing game, hauling in 4 balls for 39 receiving yards.    Brown and Anthony Dixon shouldered most of the carries. Dixon (9-62) outgained Brown (7-35), but the latter led the team in receiving. He caught 6 balls for 65 receiving yards, but had that costly fumble. Coughing the ball up was his problem in Philadelphia, so the turnover was far from a surprise. It's discouraging to see that he hasn't been able to remedy his primary issue.    As for the victors, Alex Smith also had problems with the opposing pass rush. He was sacked a whopping 6 times, as Smith touchdown run because Leodis McKelvin muffed a punt. The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion.

   "comment":"Alex Smith didn't have a chance in this game. His dreadful offensive line took 6 sacks. I have no idea what Eric Fisher was trying to do on some of the plays, as he looked more like a 7.h-round prospect than a No. 1 overall pick. Six different Chiefs registered at least half a sack, and it's a miracle that Smith made it out of this game without an injury. 3. Bad luck/coaching for Kansas City: This was 1 of those days where nothing went right for the Chiefs. They accepted a penalty on a Denver punt and then watched the Broncos convert a fake. Smith had an interception tipped by Terrance Knighton that floated perfectly into DeMarcus Ware's arms. The Chiefs dropped 3 interceptions from Manning. The Broncos were able to recover a muffed punt when a clueless Kansas City player had the ball bounce off his leg after a poor kick, and coincidentally, the senile Walt Coleman missed that the recovering player didn't make an attempt to come inbounds after being pushed out, which should have been flagged. And, to put the cherry on top, Donnie Avery lost a fumble in Denver territory with about 4 minutes remaining. It also must be noted that Jamaal Charles had just 14 touches in this game. Reid had 10 days to prepare for this key divisional battle, and that's what he came up with? Granted, Charles gained just 35 yards on his 10 carries, but he's Kansas City's best player, by far. He needs the ball in his hands as much as possible. Fortunately for Charles' fantasy owners, he saved them with 4 catches for 24 receiving yards and a touchdown.    Alex Smith went 15-of-23 for 153 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned tipped interception. He had 1 very poor pass when he threw behind Smith didn't have a chance in this game.

The Cardinals did a great job of pressuring him and forcing quick, errant throws. Once Smith had to come back from a deficit, he just couldn't get the job done because he's so limited.

Never change. </i>    Jeremy Hill got of the doghouse in a big way as he found the end zone 3 times against Kansas City. That puts him at 5 touchdowns on the season and makes his fumbling issues and benching seem like a distant tale told by old men in a lightless tavern, trying to 1.up each other with their fantasy football nightmares.    Another Cincinnati running back also found the end zone and just missed another touchdown that Hill went on to vulture. That Bengal was named Giovani Bernard, well, I guess he's still named that. Hill and Bernard put the Bengals at 4 rushing touchdowns for the day. Over the previous 20 games, Kansas City's defense had allowed a total of 4 rushing touchdowns by running backs. So now, the Chiefs have to go 19 games without allowing 1. so they don't look so bad.    With 4 rushing touchdowns, you can of course infer that Andy Dalton didn't have his best fantasy game ever. And your inference would be correct, but even with 4 touchdowns that are in no way credited to his fantasy day, he ended up throwing for 321 yards and a touchdown. This was his first game of the season with fewer than 2 touchdowns, and it shouldn't deter you from believing Dalton could have thrown 5 touchdowns in this game if the coaches had pushed the offense that way.    On the other side of the field was a team that was much less efficient near the end zone. Kansas City scored 21 points, but did not score 1 touchdown. That should be a riddle for middle-schoolers. And the answer would be Cairo Santos, who kicked a whopping 7 field goals, setting a Kansas City record. That's good for him, especially on a day when missed field goals were the norm, but when you give up 5 touchdowns, you can't reply with 7 field goals.    The Chiefs were able to move the ball, and their play-makers had good yardage games. Jamaal Charles totaled 145 yards - 75 on the ground and 70 through the air.

   "comment":"Alex Smith at this point of his career, and that is most definitely not a compliment, despite all of the fake positive things Trent Dilfer has to say about Smith. Manning was lucky to get away with another pick that was dropped by T.J. Carrie. If you can get something decent for him in fantasy, don't hesitate to pull the trigger.    The Raiders, meanwhile, would've had the win if they didn't shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly. It started early when a false start, a Carr sack and a blocked field goal ruined a scoring opportunity. Sebastian Janikowski later missed a 40-yard field goal, and then a Derek Carr pick-six iced the victory for Denver. Carr had 2 receivers in the area, but neither inexplicably looked back for the ball. Oakland and Denver had about the same amount of net yardage (the visitor accumulated 9 more), but the mistakes the host made allowed the Broncos to improve to 5-0.    Carr went 26-of-39 for 249 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick-six to go along with a lost fumble. He moved the chains well throughout most of the afternoon, and he launched a deep bomb late that drew a pass interference flag, but he dinked and dunked more than he should have. Perhaps the worst instance of that occurred on a 4.h-and-19 with about 4 minutes remaining. Doing his best impersonation of Alex Smith, Carr inexplicably tossed a checkdown that went nowhere. It's almost as if the Raiders didn't know it was 4.h down. And no, Dilfer, that's not a good play.    With Carr limited, it's no surprise that none of his receivers accumulated more than 54 yards. Smith at this point of his career, and that is most definitely not a compliment, despite all of the fake positive things Trent Dilfer has to say about Smith.

   "comment":"Alex Smith went 4.and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision. Bridgewater looked good overall, but he'll need to clean up these sloppy errors when he starts playing better opponents.    It was odd to see Adrian Peterson struggle so much. The Chiefs had a terrific performance from Jaye Howard again, who helped clog the trenches. Peterson, as a result, was limited to 60 yards on 26 carries, and much of that came on a 23-yard burst. Peterson just didn't have any room to run. For instance, on 1 play, he was forced into foolishly reversing field, which resulted in a 6-yard loss.    Bridgewater targeted 2 receivers 9 times each. One was Mike Wallace, who continued to be very inefficient, hauling in just 2 passes for 23 yards. He dropped a pass in the early going. Fifth-round rookie Stefon Diggs, on the other hand, was so much better, logging 7 receptions for 129 yards. Diggs is definitely worth adding in fantasy.    Kyle Rudolph caught Bridgewater's sole touchdown. However, he did nothing otherwise, catching 2 passes for only 9 yards.    As for the Chiefs, they were just very inconsistent on offense. Jamaal Charles was clearly missed, while West definitely did not serve as an effective replacement. Adding injury to insult, Jeremy Maclin left with a concussion, making Kansas City's scoring unit even more ineffective. West split touches with Knile Davis early on. He had the majority of the workload in the second half, but managed only 33 yards on 9 carries with just 1 catch for 6 receiving yards. West looked slow and sluggish, and he was stopped on a 4.h-down run in the red zone when Sharrif Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    Smith went 4.and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision.

   "comment":"Alex Smith, on the other hand, was moving the ball with 160 yards at halftime, but no touchdowns and 3 Cairo Santos field goals. This has been a familiar refrain for this Kansas City offense.    After half, Kansas City found the end zone as Charcandrick West saw 3 goal-line attempts, but was able to get in for his first touchdown of his career and the first rushing touchdown the Steelers had allowed this season. West had a bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but overall played a nice game, rushing for 110 yards on 22 carries for 5 yards per attempt. This comes against a Steelers' defense that had been giving up just 3.5 yards per carry on the season.    West's touchdown was then matched when Jones hit Bryant again, but this time for a 19-yard touchdown, bringing the Steelers within 6 points just before the third quarter ended. Bryant now has 3 touchdown receptions in his first 2 games back and amazingly, Bryant caught all of those touchdown passes from Landry Jones. When Ben Roethlisberger returns, this offense could be special.    The Steelers then made another push, aided by Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley."

   "comment":"Alex Smith as a runner. He appeared very poised, and I was highly impressed. Unfortunately for the Bengals, Denver figured out McCarron pretty quickly. McCarron was 10-of-18 for only 81 yards and a lost fumble after the break. His passes were off the mark, as he missed Green for a deep touchdown. The fumble ended the game, with McCarron mishandling the shotgun snap. McCarron actually fumbled on the previous play as well, but the NFL officials botched the replay review. Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here. The inconsistency is troubling, but Denver has 1 of the top defenses in the NFL.    Green happened to be Cincinnati's leading receiver, catching 5 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown, though all of this production came in the first half. Tyler Kroft (4-46), starting for the injured Tyler Eifert, was next. Kroft made an impressive play to break a tackle and move the team into field goal range at the end of the 4.h quarter.    Jeremy Hill looked good at times, gaining 63 yards on 19 carries. He outgained Giovani Bernard (8-14), who also caught 4 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Vontaze Burfict killed his team in overtime. He allowed the Broncos to advance the ball into Cincinnati territory after he was guilty of a late hit out of bounds on Virgil Green. It was a truly stupid play. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   Smith as a runner.

Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here. The inconsistency is troubling, but Denver has 1 of the top defenses in the NFL.    Green happened to be Cincinnati's leading receiver, catching 5 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown, though all of this production came in the first half. Tyler Kroft (4-46), starting for the injured Tyler Eifert, was next. Kroft made an impressive play to break a tackle and move the team into field goal range at the end of the 4.h quarter.    Jeremy Hill looked good at times, gaining 63 yards on 19 carries. He outgained Giovani Bernard (8-14), who also caught 4 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Vontaze Burfict killed his team in overtime. He allowed the Broncos to advance the ball into Cincinnati territory after he was guilty of a late hit out of bounds on Virgil Green. It was a truly stupid play. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

Charcandrick West dropped a pass, but scored a touchdown to complement his 17-61 line. Spencer Ware, meanwhile, was nowhere to be seen for some reason. Knile Davis (6-30) shared the workload with West, but was guilty of a key fumble when the score was 14-6 in the third quarter.    As for Smith, he played the best he could have, but proved to be just too limited. He made some sharp throws, even converting some third-and-long situations, including 1 play in which he dodged 3 potential sacks to find Jason Avant for a 26-yard gain. However, Smith struggled in the red zone, which was expected. Smith went 29-of-50 for 246 yards and a touchdown, which doesn't look that bad at first glance, but his YPA (4.92) is pretty brutal. Smith did, however, make up for it by picking up 44 yards on the ground. That said, Smith is just way too limited to lead a team deep into the playoffs. He can beat up on bad teams during the regular season, but he'll never overcome top-level competition.    It didn't help Smith's cause that "

Smith was just 8-of-16 for 53 yards in the first half, and his only throw of longer than 17 yards was a 34-yarder to Spencer Ware that was just a short toss in which the Texans forgot to cover him out of the backfield. This was a typical Alex Smith-type performance against a strong defense. Smith just doesn't have the physical skill set to beat superior opponents. Of course, it didn't help that he was missing his 2 starting guards. Smith had a terrific comeback performance last week, but struggled mightily in this contest. He went 20-of-37 for 186 yards.

Two of Roethlisberger's touchdowns went to Antonio Brown, who caught 4 balls for 64 yards. He was once again whistled for taunting in the end zone after doing an inappropriate dance following a touchdown, though it wasn't as egregious as his twerking earlier in the year. Roethlisberger's other scores went to Darrius Heyward-Bey (1-31), Markus Wheaton (1-30) and Jesse James (2-15). Sammie Coates had a solid showing for once, snatching 6 balls for 79 yards. He also led the team with 8 targets. Coates has immense upside, so perhaps he's finally beginning to live up to expectations.    Le'Veon Bell made his 2016 debut in this debut following his 3.game suspension. Bell didn't disappoint, generating 144 yards on only 18 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 34 receiving yards. The only downside was that DeAngelo Williams (4-7) vultured a touchdown late in the evening.    Before moving on to the Chiefs, it's worth mentioning that the Steelers sustained ankle injuries to Marcus Gilbert and Jarvis Jones. A Gilbert loss would be substantial against teams with better pass rushes.    Speaking of Jones, he caught Alex Smith's single interception when it slipped out of his hands and was tipped by Cameron Heyward."

   "comment":"Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. Most of his throws were of the short variety, as you might expect, though he did connect on a long touchdown to Tyreek <strike>Lanister</strike> Hill for a 38-yard strike. He also made an impressive completion to Smith's departure. However, it appears as though the stop unit is rounding into 2015 form. One week after limiting the Raiders' offense to just 10 points, the Chiefs stomped all over Drew Brees, basically allowing nothing to him until very late in the game when they were up multiple scores. It didn't help the Saints that Terron Armstead sustained an injury on the second drive, but New Orleans couldn't block the Chiefs' defensive front. The sack count might not seem low - Drew Brees was brought down only once - but the Saints' blockers were responsible for numerous holding penalties, which disrupted drives in the opening half. As a result, Brees was constantly stuck in third-and-long situations, and he threw a pick-six on the second drive, which was deflected. Stats can be deceiving, and that's the case here, as Brees went 37-of-48 for 367 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick-six. Brees definitely did not play poorly at all, but he wasn't as great as those stats indicate. He was very jittery in the pocket, as it was apparent that the Chiefs' pressure rattled him. The crowd noise was bothersome as well, as Brees took a delay-of-game penalty and had to waste a precious second-half timeout. He also missed some receivers, including Michael Thomas for a big gain on a third down at the end of the opening half, and he should've been picked off another time, but Ron Parker dropped the ball.    The Chiefs will only get better defensively, as it's a great sign that they're 4-2 right now with Justin Houston not even seeing any game action yet. It'll be up to the offense to produce, and it's too bad for them that they don't get to beat up on the Saints' sorry defense every week. Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns.

   "comment":"Alex Smith had a solid afternoon except for 1 glaring error. That occurred in the second half, as he entered the red zone. Smith threw a pass into the end zone, but he telegraphed it, and the Buccaneers were able to snatch the interception and return it to midfield. This was a crushing blow for the Chiefs, who may have won the game had they just settled for a field goal on that drive. Smith finished 24-of-31 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and that interception. He also found the end zone on a second occasion on the ground, though he scrambled just twice for 10 yards.    Smith's 1 aerial score didn't go to the usual suspects, as Smith this offseason, but still had a great corner in Peters. He was set to cover Evans, but wasn't around to do so. As a result, Evans had a big performance, catching 6 of 13 targets for 105 yards. He didn't reach the end zone, but came very close; Steven Nelson knocked a potential touchdown out of Evans' hands at the last second in the opening half.    Despite Evans having a big performance, Winston was able to spread the ball around very well, as he had a strong afternoon following a weird fumble on the opening drive in the red zone, where the ball inexplicably slipped out of his hands. Winston was almost picked off in the end zone as well, but improved as the afternoon progressed. Including Evans, 5 Buccaneers reeled in at least 3 receptions. Cecil Shorts (5-62) and Russell Shepard (3-54) were next on the receiving list, followed by Adam Humphries (4-47) and Doug Martin (3-42).    Speaking of Martin, he had a tough time finding any running room, gaining 63 yards on 24 carries, and this includes a gain of 12, meaning his other 23 attempts went for only 51 yards. Martin at least helped his team as a receiver, but he dropped a pass on what appeared to be a very promising screen.

Fifteen minutes of game action later, the Chiefs put themselves in position to win, thanks to a controversial move by Gary Kubiak, and the kick hit the upright - except that it deflected inside the other upright to give Kansas City the victory.

The Chiefs came into this divisional battle extremely banged up, but 1 player they had back from injury happened to be Houston. He was on the field last week, but didn't quite look like himself. Well, he's definitely back, as he racked up 3 sacks and a forced fumble. That doesn't tell the whole story though, as he completely dominated the line of scrimmage, especially in the first half. He may have cost Ty Sambrailo his job, as the Colorado State product was benched in favor of Donald Stephenson, who was yanked last week. One of Houston's sacks featured a strip in the end zone, resulting in a safety. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyreek Hill scored a touchdown on the return. Thus, Houston was effectively responsible for 9 early Kansas City points.    Speaking of Hill, he also had a huge performance. In addition to his return touchdown on the free kick, he caught 9 of the 10 targets thrown his way for 52 yards. He also reached the end zone on offense, which was the touchdown that sent the game to overtime. It appeared as though Hill was tackled short of the goal line, and that's how the officials ruled it at first, but following replay review, it was stated that Hill didn't have full possession when he was touched, and by the time he obtained the ball, he had crossed the goal line.    Alex Smith finished 26-of-44 for 220 yards and a touchdown. He was dreadful in the opening half, as he was 5-of-12 for only 26 yards prior to intermission.

The Broncos looked like they had never seen 1 before, and Kelce took advantage of terrific blocking to scamper 80 yards into the end zone. Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault.

   "comment":"Alex Smith put together 1 of the best performances of his season on Sunday afternoon. The veteran quarterback was his usual, accurate self, but he added a lot to the game by virtue of his mobility. Smith scrambled for 21 yards on 6 carries during the matchup with the Chargers. He also added a touchdown with his legs. On the score, he ran a read-option play that he was able to execute perfectly. He read the opponent and got outside leverage before getting to the pylon. On the other scrambles, Smith showed tremendous speed and was able to make quick decisions. That really helped to get his passing game going. In that department, Smith went 21-of-28 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He was able to demonstrate excellent accuracy and delivered a lot of on-target passes to his receivers. If Smith can play like this in the postseason, he will give the Chiefs a chance to win their divisional round matchup.    Smith's strategy of spreading the ball around worked very well for the Chiefs on Sunday. Four different receivers saw at least 5 targets, and the leader of the group was "

At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders.

   "comment":"Alex Smith has reverted to his 2016 form, and Kareem Hunt looks like he has hit the rookie wall. The 6-4 Chiefs have to turn things around quickly to have any hopes of competing with the Steelers and Patriots in January. With the meaningless win, the 2-8 Giants could end up hurting their draft positioning, but as of right now, they remain in the third slot behind the Browns and 49ers.    With both offenses struggling, there were a few trick plays tried in this game. Giants converted a fake punt in the first half to pick up a first down near midfield. New York went to another gadget play near the end zone with Shane Vereen throwing a pass on a halfback option, but the ball was picked off by Kansas City safety Daniel Sorensen. The Chiefs gave it right back when they tried a shovel pass to Travis Kelce, which was deflected up in the air and then caught by Giants defensive tackle Snacks Harrison for an interception. That put New York at the Kansas City's 26. A pass interference on Marcus Peters in the end zone moved it to the 1-yard line and New York scored with Orleans Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a 4.h-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, Smith has reverted to his 2016 form, and Kareem Hunt looks like he has hit the rookie wall.
