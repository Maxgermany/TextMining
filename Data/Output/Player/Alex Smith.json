   "comment":"Alex Smith in the third quarter, everyone on the forum, including myself, thought it was over. We were all wrong, but can you blame us? Smith has been an epic failure his whole career, but he was amazing in the second half, leading the 49ers to 3 touchdown drives and coming several yards short on the final possession of a potential game-tying field goal. In just 1 half of play, Smith was 15-of-22 for 206 yards, 3 touchdowns and a desperation pick at the end of the game. It's hard to believe he can keep this up, and in the future, he'll need to avoid fumbling a lot (he has tiny hands), but if Smith can continue playing like this, the 49ers will be a Super Bowl contender.

The Eagles took over and went 94 yards for a touchdown, giving them a sizable lead that they would never relinquish.    Though he tossed 2 interceptions, Donovan McNabb otherwise played pretty well, going 21-of-36 for 306 yards and a touchdown. He hit 3 plays of 39 yards or more. Two of McNabb's big gainers (39, 59) went to DeSean Jackson, who finished with 6 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown. The other was to Brent Celek (43), who notched 4 catches for 73 yards.    Leonard Weaver led the team with 17 carries for 52 yards. LeSean McCoy rushed the ball just 9 times, but gained 48 yards and a score.    Frank Gore, meanwhile, led all backs in rushing with 107 yards on just 16 attempts. It's a shame the 49ers fell behind early; otherwise, Gore would have had more opportunities.    Strangely, neither Vernon Davis (3-43) nor Michael Crabtree (4-26) led the 49ers in receiving. Josh Morgan did that, snagging 7 balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Davis received a verbal lashing from Mike Singletary for not making an attempt to break up Alex Smith's first interception.    I thought this could be a potential stink bomb game from Andy Reid. The Eagles won, but Big Red still made a huge error. On 4th-and-inches in the first quarter, Reid decided to go for it on his own 29! Philadelphia wasn't able to convert, giving the 49ers a short field. Fortunately for them, Walker had that aforementioned fumble.    Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender. The time kept ticking down, but Weaver was killing the Eagles because he wasn't paying attention. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith (20-37, 177 yards, TD) launched 3 interceptions in Eagles territory. Delanie Walker, meanwhile, fumbled in the red zone when the score was just 7-3. The Eagles took over and went 94 yards for a touchdown, giving them a sizable lead that they would never relinquish.    Though he tossed 2 interceptions, Donovan McNabb otherwise played pretty well, going 21-of-36 for 306 yards and a touchdown. He hit 3 plays of 39 yards or more. Two of McNabb's big gainers (39, 59) went to DeSean Jackson, who finished with 6 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown. The other was to Brent Celek (43), who notched 4 catches for 73 yards.    Leonard Weaver led the team with 17 carries for 52 yards. LeSean McCoy rushed the ball just 9 times, but gained 48 yards and a score.    Frank Gore, meanwhile, led all backs in rushing with 107 yards on just 16 attempts. It's a shame the 49ers fell behind early; otherwise, Gore would have had more opportunities.    Strangely, neither Vernon Davis (3-43) nor Michael Crabtree (4-26) led the 49ers in receiving. Josh Morgan did that, snagging 7 balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Davis received a verbal lashing from Mike Singletary for not making an attempt to break up Alex Smith's first interception.    I thought this could be a potential stink bomb game from Andy Reid. The Eagles won, but Big Red still made a huge error. On 4th-and-inches in the first quarter, Reid decided to go for it on his own 29! Philadelphia wasn't able to convert, giving the 49ers a short field. Fortunately for them, Walker had that aforementioned fumble.    Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender. The time kept ticking down, but Weaver was killing the Eagles because he wasn't paying attention. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith. Smith was 21-of-32 for 188 yards and a touchdown, but tossed 2 very ugly interceptions. The first was an unwarranted desperation heave under pressure. The second, which occurred in the final quarter, was the result of his staring down his receiver. I really liked what I saw out of Smith in that final drive against the Saints on Monday night 2 weeks ago, but his performance at Atlanta was really abysmal. The 49ers will need a new quarterback next offseason. Why they didn't just trade for "

   "comment":"Alex Smith was finally benched. No, really, he was. Mike Singletary told David Carr to warm up as Smith struggled and was nearly booed out of the stadium. Despite the crowd chanting, We want Carr! Smith talked Singletary out of benching him. From that point on, Smith went 12-of-16 for 123 yards, leading the 49ers on 2 touchdown drives. Smith went into Beast Mode and simply was unstoppable. However, he played just like this against the Saints on Monday Night Football, so there's no reason to think that this will carry over to next week's game against Oakland. Smith does seem to perform better in the no-huddle, 2.minute drill style of offense, so San Francisco should think about playing this way going forward.    In total, Smith went 25-of-39 for 309 yards, 3 touchdowns, 2 interceptions and a horrifying fumble returned for an Eagles score.    On the bright side, "

The crowd, as you might expect, kept booing him until the 49ers finally established the lead in the 4.h quarter.    The Raiders did a good job bottling up Frank Gore until he sprinted for a 64-yard gain late in the contest. "

Carr really struggled, going 5-of-13 for 67 yards and a horrible interception that led to Carolina's game-winning field goal.    San Francisco went up 7-0 quickly, and it appeared as though Carolina wouldn't have much of a chance. However, the 49ers just stopped scoring, and Alex Smith (9-19, 129 yards, TD) wasn't very good after that first drive.

   "comment":"Alex Smith, it was no surprise to 49er fans who have seen his follies all too often. Amazingly, the ball bounced right back up to Smith, who threw deep, almost connecting for a touchdown and getting a pass interference call on the Cowboys to boot. Breaks like that helped San Francisco scrap its way to a 14-0 lead. A pass interference penalty (25 yards) set them up at the 1-yard line for a short Frank Gore touchdown run, and in the second scoring drive, a bunch of short plays did the trick after starting at the Dallas 48. Finally, Dallas caught a huge break when Ahmad Brooks lined up offsides on a failed third down as time was running out in the half. Given a second chance to convert, some guy named Tramine Brock out of Belhaven College (think the 49ers need to draft a cornerback?) fell down in coverage, and 53 yards later, Miles Austin cut the lead to 14-7 at the break.    Speaking of Austin, that final drive marked his first catch of the game after the Cowboys failed to find him on 5 targets in the first half. Then he caught all 9 passes thrown his way for 143 yards and a touchdown hat trick. Unfortunately, Austin pulled his hamstring and could be out a few weeks. The passing game took on increased importance because Felix Jones hurt his shoulder early. He had just 9 carries for 25 yards, and caught a pass for 5 yards. DeMarco Murray (6-21) and Tashard Choice (5-5) were not effective in relief.    While on the subject of injuries, Tony Romo was hit by Carlos Rogers toward the end of the second quarter and did not come out ready to play in the second half. It was Jon Kitna time and you know what that means - touchdowns, yards and interceptions. Kitna completed his first 3 passes before Donte Whitner intercepted him when Jason Witten did not go where he expected him to on a deep route. Witten saw a hefty 15 targets, catching 7 passes for 102 yards. Both quarterbacks looked at him, so if Romo's ribs keep him out, fantasy owners should not be worried about putting the tight end in the lineup. That interception was offset by a pick from Alan Ball who was starting at cornerback as part of a makeshift Dallas secondary. Five plays later, Kitna found Austin to tie the game at 14.    Where was Ted Ginn? Glad I am pretending you asked. Ginn was another heavily targeted player, leading the 49ers with 7. but he caught just 4 passes for 38 yards. He also was not a factor in the return game after housing a punt and kickoff to ice last week's win over Seattle. However, rookie Kendall Hunter did have a big kickoff return for 43 yards following the tying score. Unfortunately it was wasted when DeMarcus Ware started that drive with 1 of his 2 sacks. Kitna's next interception was a pass thrown behind Kevin Ogletree. Alex Smith immediately hit Delanie Walker who was matched up with Anthony Spencer and predictably ran right past him for a 29-yard score to make it 21-14."

   "comment":"Alex Smith was just 12-of-19 for 143 yards. The 49ers' demolition was all about great running and just watching Mark Sanchez attempt futile passes all afternoon. It's really laughable how bad Sanchez is. He takes stupid sacks, makes careless mistakes and can't fire accurate accurate passes consistently. Sanchez went 13-of-29 for 103 yards an interception and a lost fumble on a third down in San Francisco territory. Sanchez nearly tossed a couple of other picks, as the crowd booed him mercilessly throughout the entire contest. I tweeted () the following during the third quarter following 1 of Sanchez's turnovers: Hey Jets, it's Tebow time. It really is. It has to be. Even if you're not a Tebow believer, you have to at least agree that it's time for New York to give up on Sanchez, and Tebow is the only alternative. Tebow was on the field on several occasions. He completed his only pass attempt for 9 yards, on a 3rd-and-1. However, his tight end fumbled the football after a fierce hit and the 49ers recovered it.    That wasn't the only instance in which an injured Jet coughed up the football while writhing in pain. Santonio Holmes hauled in a rare Sanchez completion but suffered a non-contact injury to his foot (though at the time, it seemed like he hurt his knee). As Holmes went down, he flipped the ball away carelessly like a selfish POS, seemingly giving up because he perhaps knew that his season was over. Carlos Rogers scooped up the ball and ran it in for 6. Holmes, meanwhile, was carted off into the locker room. He finished with 4 catches for 29 yards.    The Jets, of course, couldn't run the football either because Shonn Greene is terrible. He gained just 34 yards on 11 carries.    As for the 49ers, I mentioned earlier that they pounded the ball very well. Their front line pushed New York's defense around, as the Jet players couldn't tackle whatsoever. San Francisco ran a number of plays out of the Wildcat with Colin Kaepernick, who rushed for 50 yards and a touchdown on 5 attempts. Frank Gore (21-62, TD) and Kendall Hunter (8-56, TD) also couldn't be stopped.    With the runners gashing the Jets easily, Alex Smith didn't have to do much. He finished with essentially the same line as posted above (12-21, 143 yards), and none of his receivers had more than 3 receptions. Both "

   "comment":"Alex Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure. Smith then had a chance to be more comfortable, so he settled for more checkdowns, which is what he usually does anyway. As a consequence, "

   "comment":"Alex Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure. Smith then had a chance to be more comfortable, so he settled for more checkdowns, which is what he usually does anyway. As a consequence, "

   "comment":"Alex Smith paired with receivers who can't catch the ball and an offensive line that has trouble blocking at times, so it wouldn't have been a surprise if they had posted minimal production in a playoff lose in January. But a 7.point output against the Colts? That's pretty eye-opening. Smith was terrible against a defense that hasn't been able to stop anyone recently. His final numbers don't look too bad (16-of-29, 153 yards, 2 interceptions), but by the time the Colts made this a 23-7 score with 2:47 remaining in the third quarter, he was 10-of-18 for 79 yards and a pick. He generated some garbage yardage in the final frame, but ultimately tossed his second interception on an underthrown touch pass. Smith enjoyed so much success last week because the Raiders inexplicably had no idea that the Chiefs would be running screen plays. The Colts were more prepared for that, limiting Charles to 38 receiving yards on his 5 receptions. Charles did rush for 106 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries though, but he obviously couldn't do much more because his team trailed throughout.    The Colts, meanwhile, played so much better offensively than they have in recent weeks. That's obvious just by looking at the result, but their offensive line performed extremely well. If Indianapolis' front can continue to play like this, the team will be a tough out in the playoffs because "

   "comment":"Alex Smith pass that popped into the air and fell right into the arms of Anthony Fasano, who was on the ground. Fasano crawled into the end zone and put the Chiefs up by 14. Kansas City never relinquished its lead and held a double-digit advantage for most of the afternoon. Kansas City's defense took over in the second half, preventing the Jets from scoring a single point. Part of that was the quarterback getting hurt, but QBDK wasn't going to lead the Jets to victory anyway. While he made some nice plays - particularly 1 instance in which he eluded a sack and found Chris Johnson for a big gain - he was just too overwhelmed with pressure. Combine that with some red-zone ineptitude, and it's no wonder that New York didn't score at all following the break. QBDK wasn't awful though, as he went 21-of-28 for 196 yards and a touchdown to Eric Decker (9-63). He got hurt on a 4.h-down attempt in the red zone on a play in which his team was flagged for offensive pass interference. He was able to enter the game later in the 4.h quarter, but it was too late by then. Still, it was a reminder of how brittle QBDK is, and why teams simply can't rely on him to be a starter. Simms, by the way, did nothing in QBDK's absence, going 3-of-8 for 39 yards.    Percy Harvin was the primary reason why the Jets were able to move the chains and enter the red zone on some instances. Harvin caught a whopping 11 balls for 129 yards, and he also had a good kickoff return at the end of the first half to set up the team in field goal range. It's obviously very encouraging that Harvin was able to be such a huge part of this offense despite being in New York for only 2 weeks.    Chris Johnson complained about his usage this past week, and the Jets' coaching staff obviously listened. Johnson had more carries than Chris Ivory (11-8), and Johnson outgained Ivory, 69-22. CJ0K also caught 2 passes for 32 receiving yards. He actually looked decent for a change, but his troublesome antics during the week is exactly why bringing him into the team was a huge mistake. He's not nearly the player he once was, so his poor locker room attitude isn't worth it. The Jets, now 1-8, have to regret bringing him in, but it's not like they had the talent to win anyway.    As for the victors, Alex Smith was very economical, going 21-of-31 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He didn't make any mistakes, but then again, he didn't really need to force anything into New York's anemic secondary, who left receivers open all afternoon. I already mentioned that Smith somehow found Fasano for a fluke touchdown in the first half. Smith's other score was thrown to "

   "comment":"Alex Smith touchdown run because Leodis McKelvin muffed a punt. The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion. The crowd let the officials have it for what they thought was an awful call - there were several shady penalties, including an early ticky-tack roughness on Smith that gave the Chiefs a field goal - but it ultimately allowed Kansas City to prevail. Kyle Orton, meanwhile, was also responsible for leaving some points off the board. He was very inaccurate in crucial moments, missing multiple touchdowns to open players. He had Chandler and Robert Woods available for scores at various points of the game, but he just completely whiffed on his throws. Orton finished 29-of-48 for 259 yards and a touchdown to Chris Hogan. He had some issues with the Kansas City pass rush, and it was evident at times that he was concerned with his protection. Orton was brought down only once, but that's not even close to being indicative of the amount of pressure he was under.    Both Sammy Watkins and Fred Jackson were game-time decisions, but both played. Neither did much, however. Watkins saw 10 targets come his way, but snared only 4 of them for just 27 yards. He didn't look completely healthy and probably should have rested. Jackson, meanwhile, didn't get much of a workload, carrying the ball just 3 time for 10 yards. He was a bigger contributor in the passing game, hauling in 4 balls for 39 receiving yards.    Brown and Anthony Dixon shouldered most of the carries. Dixon (9-62) outgained Brown (7-35), but the latter led the team in receiving. He caught 6 balls for 65 receiving yards, but had that costly fumble. Coughing the ball up was his problem in Philadelphia, so the turnover was far from a surprise. It's discouraging to see that he hasn't been able to remedy his primary issue.    As for the victors, Alex Smith also had problems with the opposing pass rush. He was sacked a whopping 6 times, as "

The Chiefs are actually lucky that Murray suffered a concussion and had to leave the game in the second quarter because they had no answer for the explosive back, who tallied 112 yards and a pair of scores on just 4 carries. The Chiefs had more success getting the Raiders off the field once the 2 aging running backs, Darren McFadden (12-29) and Maurice Jones-Drew (3 carries, -1 yards), started touching the football. Kansas City consequently came back from a 17-3 deficit, as Alex Smith caught fire, completing 10 passes in a row. However, some bad coaching - "

   "comment":"Alex Smith didn't have a chance in this game. His dreadful offensive line took 6 sacks. I have no idea what Eric Fisher was trying to do on some of the plays, as he looked more like a 7.h-round prospect than a No. 1 overall pick. Six different Chiefs registered at least half a sack, and it's a miracle that Smith made it out of this game without an injury. 3. Bad luck/coaching for Kansas City: This was 1 of those days where nothing went right for the Chiefs. They accepted a penalty on a Denver punt and then watched the Broncos convert a fake. Smith had an interception tipped by Terrance Knighton that floated perfectly into DeMarcus Ware's arms. The Chiefs dropped 3 interceptions from Manning. The Broncos were able to recover a muffed punt when a clueless Kansas City player had the ball bounce off his leg after a poor kick, and coincidentally, the senile Walt Coleman missed that the recovering player didn't make an attempt to come inbounds after being pushed out, which should have been flagged. And, to put the cherry on top, Donnie Avery lost a fumble in Denver territory with about 4 minutes remaining. It also must be noted that Jamaal Charles had just 14 touches in this game. Reid had 10 days to prepare for this key divisional battle, and that's what he came up with? Granted, Charles gained just 35 yards on his 10 carries, but he's Kansas City's best player, by far. He needs the ball in his hands as much as possible. Fortunately for Charles' fantasy owners, he saved them with 4 catches for 24 receiving yards and a touchdown.    Alex Smith went 15-of-23 for 153 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned tipped interception. He had 1 very poor pass when he threw behind "

More on that later, but in the meantime, I'd attempt to sell-high and trade him to someone else.    I mentioned that Brady was the media's top story. To me, it was the horrible coaching job by Mike Tomlin and his staff. It was so frustrating watching this team, and I'm not just talking about Butler's ineptitude on the defensive side of the ball. A poor effort by the stop unit was expected. The offense, however, was supposed to click better than this. Every time the Steelers had momentum going, they screwed up somehow. It started on the opening drive when they were ripping off 10 yards per play, and yet Todd Haley inexplicably tried a trick play that lost yardage. A holding penalty derailed the next drive. Then, a procedural penalty. After that, there were drops by "

   "comment":"Alex Smith continues to dink and dunk. Even against Chicago's poor defense, Smith seldom looked beyond the sticks. It was pathetic, and Andy Reid needs to think about making the switch to Chase Daniel. Smith went 16-of-30 for 181 yards and a touchdown, and he pretty much has no hope of rebounding without Charles. Smith was at his worst at the end of the first half. He took 20 seconds to get to the line of scrimmage while in scoring territory, and then he took a sack to get knocked out of field-goal range. I don't know which was worse; his horrible clock management, or his lack of awareness in terms of recognizing where he was on the field. Sadly, this wasn't the first time a Smith sack nullified a field-goal try, and it seems as though Reid will never figure out how to score prior to the end of each half. He should have hired a 16-year-old <i>Madden</i> player long ago.    Thanks to Smith's limitations, only 1 player had more than 35 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith at this point of his career, and that is most definitely not a compliment, despite all of the fake positive things Trent Dilfer has to say about Smith. Manning was lucky to get away with another pick that was dropped by T.J. Carrie. If you can get something decent for him in fantasy, don't hesitate to pull the trigger.    The Raiders, meanwhile, would've had the win if they didn't shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly. It started early when a false start, a Carr sack and a blocked field goal ruined a scoring opportunity. Sebastian Janikowski later missed a 40-yard field goal, and then a Derek Carr pick-six iced the victory for Denver. Carr had 2 receivers in the area, but neither inexplicably looked back for the ball. Oakland and Denver had about the same amount of net yardage (the visitor accumulated 9 more), but the mistakes the host made allowed the Broncos to improve to 5-0.    Carr went 26-of-39 for 249 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick-six to go along with a lost fumble. He moved the chains well throughout most of the afternoon, and he launched a deep bomb late that drew a pass interference flag, but he dinked and dunked more than he should have. Perhaps the worst instance of that occurred on a 4.h-and-19 with about 4 minutes remaining. Doing his best impersonation of Alex Smith, Carr inexplicably tossed a checkdown that went nowhere. It's almost as if the Raiders didn't know it was 4.h down. And no, Dilfer, that's not a good play.    With Carr limited, it's no surprise that none of his receivers accumulated more than 54 yards. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith went 4.and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision. Bridgewater looked good overall, but he'll need to clean up these sloppy errors when he starts playing better opponents.    It was odd to see Adrian Peterson struggle so much. The Chiefs had a terrific performance from Jaye Howard again, who helped clog the trenches. Peterson, as a result, was limited to 60 yards on 26 carries, and much of that came on a 23-yard burst. Peterson just didn't have any room to run. For instance, on 1 play, he was forced into foolishly reversing field, which resulted in a 6-yard loss.    Bridgewater targeted 2 receivers 9 times each. One was Mike Wallace, who continued to be very inefficient, hauling in just 2 passes for 23 yards. He dropped a pass in the early going. Fifth-round rookie Stefon Diggs, on the other hand, was so much better, logging 7 receptions for 129 yards. Diggs is definitely worth adding in fantasy.    Kyle Rudolph caught Bridgewater's sole touchdown. However, he did nothing otherwise, catching 2 passes for only 9 yards.    As for the Chiefs, they were just very inconsistent on offense. Jamaal Charles was clearly missed, while West definitely did not serve as an effective replacement. Adding injury to insult, Jeremy Maclin left with a concussion, making Kansas City's scoring unit even more ineffective. West split touches with Knile Davis early on. He had the majority of the workload in the second half, but managed only 33 yards on 9 carries with just 1 catch for 6 receiving yards. West looked slow and sluggish, and he was stopped on a 4.h-down run in the red zone when Sharrif Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    "

   "comment":"Alex Smith, on the other hand, was moving the ball with 160 yards at halftime, but no touchdowns and 3 Cairo Santos field goals. This has been a familiar refrain for this Kansas City offense.    After half, Kansas City found the end zone as Charcandrick West saw 3 goal-line attempts, but was able to get in for his first touchdown of his career and the first rushing touchdown the Steelers had allowed this season. West had a bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but overall played a nice game, rushing for 110 yards on 22 carries for 5 yards per attempt. This comes against a Steelers' defense that had been giving up just 3.5 yards per carry on the season.    West's touchdown was then matched when Jones hit Bryant again, but this time for a 19-yard touchdown, bringing the Steelers within 6 points just before the third quarter ended. Bryant now has 3 touchdown receptions in his first 2 games back and amazingly, Bryant caught all of those touchdown passes from Landry Jones. When Ben Roethlisberger returns, this offense could be special.    The Steelers then made another push, aided by Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley."

   "comment":"Alex Smith, throwing short of the line to gain on third-down situations. Always a craven, Gabbert is simply too scared to go downfield. He also took a sack on a 4.h-and-1 try on the Cleveland 30. He also had an extremely dumb play where he took a big loss for what was ruled a sack by running out of bounds instead of throwing the ball away. Because of Gabbert's ultra-conservative nature, the 49ers simply couldn't get anything going. They were limited to just 48 net yards and 2 first downs in the opening half. Those figures are more indicative of how they performed, given that they picked up garbage yardage late when this game was out of hand.    To be somewhat fair to Gabbert, he had nothing to work with in the wake of Vance McDonald's injury. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith as a runner. He appeared very poised, and I was highly impressed. Unfortunately for the Bengals, Denver figured out McCarron pretty quickly. McCarron was 10-of-18 for only 81 yards and a lost fumble after the break. His passes were off the mark, as he missed Green for a deep touchdown. The fumble ended the game, with McCarron mishandling the shotgun snap. McCarron actually fumbled on the previous play as well, but the NFL officials botched the replay review. Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here. The inconsistency is troubling, but Denver has 1 of the top defenses in the NFL.    Green happened to be Cincinnati's leading receiver, catching 5 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown, though all of this production came in the first half. Tyler Kroft (4-46), starting for the injured Tyler Eifert, was next. Kroft made an impressive play to break a tackle and move the team into field goal range at the end of the 4.h quarter.    Jeremy Hill looked good at times, gaining 63 yards on 19 carries. He outgained Giovani Bernard (8-14), who also caught 4 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Vontaze Burfict killed his team in overtime. He allowed the Broncos to advance the ball into Cincinnati territory after he was guilty of a late hit out of bounds on Virgil Green. It was a truly stupid play. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Alex Smith as a runner. He appeared very poised, and I was highly impressed. Unfortunately for the Bengals, Denver figured out McCarron pretty quickly. McCarron was 10-of-18 for only 81 yards and a lost fumble after the break. His passes were off the mark, as he missed Green for a deep touchdown. The fumble ended the game, with McCarron mishandling the shotgun snap. McCarron actually fumbled on the previous play as well, but the NFL officials botched the replay review. Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here. The inconsistency is troubling, but Denver has 1 of the top defenses in the NFL.    Green happened to be Cincinnati's leading receiver, catching 5 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown, though all of this production came in the first half. Tyler Kroft (4-46), starting for the injured Tyler Eifert, was next. Kroft made an impressive play to break a tackle and move the team into field goal range at the end of the 4.h quarter.    Jeremy Hill looked good at times, gaining 63 yards on 19 carries. He outgained Giovani Bernard (8-14), who also caught 4 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Vontaze Burfict killed his team in overtime. He allowed the Broncos to advance the ball into Cincinnati territory after he was guilty of a late hit out of bounds on Virgil Green. It was a truly stupid play. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Alex Smith had a terrific comeback performance last week, but struggled mightily in this contest. He went 20-of-37 for 186 yards. Believe it or not, that was helped by garbage time! Smith was just 8-of-16 for 53 yards in the first half, and his only throw of longer than 17 yards was a 34-yarder to Spencer Ware that was just a short toss in which the Texans forgot to cover him out of the backfield. This was a typical Alex Smith-type performance against a strong defense. Smith just doesn't have the physical skill set to beat superior opponents. Of course, it didn't help that he was missing his 2 starting guards. "

   "comment":"Alex Smith. Fifteen minutes of game action later, the Chiefs put themselves in position to win, thanks to a controversial move by Gary Kubiak, and the kick hit the upright - except that it deflected inside the other upright to give Kansas City the victory. It was hard for me to determine where to begin otherwise, given how insane this game was. But I kept going back to 2 words: Justin Houston. The Chiefs came into this divisional battle extremely banged up, but 1 player they had back from injury happened to be Houston. He was on the field last week, but didn't quite look like himself. Well, he's definitely back, as he racked up 3 sacks and a forced fumble. That doesn't tell the whole story though, as he completely dominated the line of scrimmage, especially in the first half. He may have cost Ty Sambrailo his job, as the Colorado State product was benched in favor of Donald Stephenson, who was yanked last week. One of Houston's sacks featured a strip in the end zone, resulting in a safety. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyreek Hill scored a touchdown on the return. Thus, Houston was effectively responsible for 9 early Kansas City points.    Speaking of Hill, he also had a huge performance. In addition to his return touchdown on the free kick, he caught 9 of the 10 targets thrown his way for 52 yards. He also reached the end zone on offense, which was the touchdown that sent the game to overtime. It appeared as though Hill was tackled short of the goal line, and that's how the officials ruled it at first, but following replay review, it was stated that Hill didn't have full possession when he was touched, and by the time he obtained the ball, he had crossed the goal line.    Alex Smith finished 26-of-44 for 220 yards and a touchdown. He was dreadful in the opening half, as he was 5-of-12 for only 26 yards prior to intermission. It wasn't all Smith's fault, as he saw tons of pressure from Ambassador "

   "comment":"Alex Smith threw a bubble screen to Travis Kelce. The Broncos looked like they had never seen 1 before, and Kelce took advantage of terrific blocking to scamper 80 yards into the end zone. Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault. In fact, Smith's first poor throw of the night came on his 10th attempt when he made an errant throw to "

   "comment":"Alex Smith put together 1 of the best performances of his season on Sunday afternoon. The veteran quarterback was his usual, accurate self, but he added a lot to the game by virtue of his mobility. Smith scrambled for 21 yards on 6 carries during the matchup with the Chargers. He also added a touchdown with his legs. On the score, he ran a read-option play that he was able to execute perfectly. He read the opponent and got outside leverage before getting to the pylon. On the other scrambles, Smith showed tremendous speed and was able to make quick decisions. That really helped to get his passing game going. In that department, Smith went 21-of-28 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He was able to demonstrate excellent accuracy and delivered a lot of on-target passes to his receivers. If Smith can play like this in the postseason, he will give the Chiefs a chance to win their divisional round matchup.    Smith's strategy of spreading the ball around worked very well for the Chiefs on Sunday. Four different receivers saw at least 5 targets, and the leader of the group was "

   "comment":"Alex Smith has reverted to his 2016 form, and Kareem Hunt looks like he has hit the rookie wall. The 6-4 Chiefs have to turn things around quickly to have any hopes of competing with the Steelers and Patriots in January. With the meaningless win, the 2-8 Giants could end up hurting their draft positioning, but as of right now, they remain in the third slot behind the Browns and 49ers.    With both offenses struggling, there were a few trick plays tried in this game. Giants converted a fake punt in the first half to pick up a first down near midfield. New York went to another gadget play near the end zone with Shane Vereen throwing a pass on a halfback option, but the ball was picked off by Kansas City safety Daniel Sorensen. The Chiefs gave it right back when they tried a shovel pass to Travis Kelce, which was deflected up in the air and then caught by Giants defensive tackle Snacks Harrison for an interception. That put New York at the Kansas City's 26. A pass interference on Marcus Peters in the end zone moved it to the 1-yard line and New York scored with Orleans Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a 4.h-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, "
