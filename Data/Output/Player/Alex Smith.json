Frank Gore, meanwhile, led all backs in rushing with 107 yards on just 16 attempts. It's a shame the 49ers fell behind early; otherwise, Gore would have had more opportunities.    Strangely, neither Vernon Davis (3-43) nor Michael Crabtree (4-26) led the 49ers in receiving. Josh Morgan did that, snagging 7 balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Davis received a verbal lashing from Mike Singletary for not making an attempt to break up Alex Smith's first interception.    I thought this could be a potential stink bomb game from Andy Reid. The Eagles won, but Big Red still made a huge error. On 4th-and-inches in the first quarter, Reid decided to go for it on his own 29! Philadelphia wasn't able to convert, giving the 49ers a short field. Fortunately for them, Walker had that aforementioned fumble.    Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender. The time kept ticking down, but Weaver was killing the Eagles because he wasn't paying attention. "

Smith went into Beast Mode and simply was unstoppable. However, he played just like this against the Saints on Monday Night Football, so there's no reason to think that this will carry over to next week's game against Oakland. Smith does seem to perform better in the no-huddle, 2.minute drill style of offense, so San Francisco should think about playing this way going forward.

He'll have an MRI on Monday, but told the media he will travel to London with the team to take on Denver.    "

   "comment":"Smith came out on San Francisco's first possession and immediately completed a pass to Bruce Miller for 11 yards. Then he got sacked and threw 2 incompletions. You can pretty much copy that a few times, and you get the gist of what the 49ers did on much of the afternoon, mixing in some unsuccessful runs by Frank Gore who finished with 42 yards on 17 carries. This is not lazy analysis - I am serious. Both defenses played well in this game obviously, with the final total yards going to Cincinnati just barely at 228-226. Cincinnati's 5 sacks were crucial in getting their defense off the field. Only once did the 49ers get a first down on a drive following a sack, and it was the result of a penalty. Meanwhile San Francisco's defense was getting it done on third down, stopping 9 out of 10 conversion attempts. If not for a Frank Gore fumble early in the 4.h quarter, the Bengals would not have scored after the opening drive. Vernon Davis was the offensive force for the 49ers. His 39-yard reception in the second quarter led to the tying field goal. Yes, it was 3-3 at halftime. Then with the game on the line, he had receptions for 8, 8 and 20 yards during a 72-yard march for the game's only touchdown. Kendall Hunter finished it off with a 7-yard run and he had a mild coming out party here. Gore was ineffective and the smaller rookie Hunter ran big. Immediately after the score, Carlos Rogers intercepted Dalton and even though the drive immediately stalled, David Akers drilled a field goal from 53-yards out to put them up 13-6. Those 2 drives took the game from 8:57 remaining to 2:11 by the time Cincinnati got the football back trying to drive for the tying touchdown. Dalton started connecting with tight end Jermaine Gresham and had the Bengals on the move until a dreadful interception to Reggie Smith. Head coach Jim Harbaugh made a questionable coaching decision last week not taking points off the board in a loss to Dallas, but this time managed the final 1:45 well. The 49ers took time off the clock and then punter "

   "comment":"Smith came out on San Francisco's first possession and immediately completed a pass to Bruce Miller for 11 yards. Then he got sacked and threw 2 incompletions. You can pretty much copy that a few times, and you get the gist of what the 49ers did on much of the afternoon, mixing in some unsuccessful runs by Frank Gore who finished with 42 yards on 17 carries. This is not lazy analysis - I am serious. Both defenses played well in this game obviously, with the final total yards going to Cincinnati just barely at 228-226. Cincinnati's 5 sacks were crucial in getting their defense off the field. Only once did the 49ers get a first down on a drive following a sack, and it was the result of a penalty. Meanwhile San Francisco's defense was getting it done on third down, stopping 9 out of 10 conversion attempts. If not for a Frank Gore fumble early in the 4.h quarter, the Bengals would not have scored after the opening drive. Vernon Davis was the offensive force for the 49ers. His 39-yard reception in the second quarter led to the tying field goal. Yes, it was 3-3 at halftime. Then with the game on the line, he had receptions for 8, 8 and 20 yards during a 72-yard march for the game's only touchdown. Kendall Hunter finished it off with a 7-yard run and he had a mild coming out party here. Gore was ineffective and the smaller rookie Hunter ran big. Immediately after the score, Carlos Rogers intercepted Dalton and even though the drive immediately stalled, David Akers drilled a field goal from 53-yards out to put them up 13-6. Those 2 drives took the game from 8:57 remaining to 2:11 by the time Cincinnati got the football back trying to drive for the tying touchdown. Dalton started connecting with tight end Jermaine Gresham and had the Bengals on the move until a dreadful interception to Reggie Smith. Head coach Jim Harbaugh made a questionable coaching decision last week not taking points off the board in a loss to Dallas, but this time managed the final 1:45 well. The 49ers took time off the clock and then punter "

   "comment":"Smith. He was a force. The rest of the unit had issues in the second half when the 49ers kept driving the length of the field for touchdowns. Kendall Hunter had a sweet reception for 45 yards to key their first touchdown march. The game was still in their control when Nnamdi Asomugha, signed to be a shutdown corner, let Michael Crabtree beat him for a gain of 32 yards to start a drive that ended in a touchdown to trim the lead to 23-17, which gave the visitors hope. At this point the offense kept moving down the field only to watch their rookie kicker act like a rookie. Alex Henery missed field goals on consecutive drives sandwiched around forcing a San Francisco punt. Suddenly, the 49ers had the ball with the outcome in doubt and 6:28 left. They got big plays from Hunter and the physically limited Frank Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper. The icing on the cake was Akers striking the extra point to make it 24-23. Still, the Dream Team had a full 3 minutes to answer the bell. Short passes put them just inside San Francisco territory. A pass to Maclin had them at the 32 and pretty much in field goal range, assuming Henery was up to it. One problem - Justin Smith forced a fumble, and a pack of 49ers was there to cover it and end the threat. Again, it wasn't over until Philly's defense let Gore run for 4, 8, 4, 5 and 5 yards on consecutive plays when it knew what was coming. How do you let an injured running back average over 5 yards per carry on a drive like that with the game on the line? There is plenty of blame to go around, but clearly this team of stars lacks heart and finishing skills.    On the other side, San Francisco got decent play from Alex Smit,h whose only turnover was a lost fumble. They have something brewing in the backfield with Gore and Hunter (11 touches for 100 yards). The passing game was littered with big plays from Crabtree, Morgan and tight end "

   "comment":"Smith moved the ball well and threw a perfect strike to Delanie Walker for a 26-yard touchdown. Walker was in the middle of 3 Tampa Bay players and went up to make a nice catch for the first score of the game. The Buccaneers responded with a 33-yard wide receiver screen to Arrelious Benn that set up a field goal. After that drive, and for the rest of the game, Tampa Bay's offense struggled.    The 49ers successfully drove the ball into Buccaneers' territory on the next drive, but Frank Gore fumbled the ball away, sacrificing a scoring opportunity. Josh Freeman gave it right back. He dropped back and had plenty of time to throw, but made a bad read on a throw to Kellen Winslow. The pass was picked off by Carlos Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.    Early in the third quarter, Smith and Gore kept moving the ball against the Buccaneers. Smith threw a nice pass to "

   "comment":"Smith sacked McCoy to end Cleveland's next drive, but the next time they got it, things became interesting all of a sudden. Cribbs caught a ball down the sideline and shed a tackle racing for a 46-yard touchdown. Leading by just 1 score, it was time for San Francisco's offense to regain their first-half form. This could mean only 1 thing - a pass to defensive tackle Sopoaga on third down from Cleveland's 32. It went for 18 yards and more importantly, allowed them to chew more time off the clock. The drive took 4:05 and concluded with a short Akers field goal to seal it at 20-10. Cleveland managed some garbage time yards and that was that. There really was not much to this game. Alex Smith (15-for-24 177 yards 1 TD) did his usual thing, taking just 1 sack with no turnovers. McCoy (22-for-34 241 yards 1 TD 1 INT) was on his back 4 times and had the key fumble on the opening drive. The 49ers rushed for 174 yards on the afternoon and were never legitimately in danger of losing the game even when the Browns pulled close late. Their conservative style might not work in a playoff setting against a high-powered offense, but in the regular season, it is serving them quite well.   "

The 49ers converted twice on third down, but were forced to tie the game on a field goal when Aaron Ross wrapped up tight end Vernon Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

   "comment":"Smith and a 12-yard pass to Michael Crabtree, but the 49ers worked to field goal range. One of their many MVPs this season, kicker David Akers, couldn't make good from 52 yards out though. Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back "

   "comment":"Smith, he was 12-of-26 for 196 yards and 2 scores. He made a couple of great throws to Vernon Davis, but 2 things stick out to me. First, he had an open Kyle Williams downfield for a long touchdown in the second quarter, but overthrew him by about 5 yards. Second, Smith couldn't convert a third down to save his life. He was 1-of-13 in those situations, with the only positive result coming right at the very end of regulation when the Giants allowed him to complete a pass well short of the end zone. I don't want you to think that Smith is a lost cause or anything. He made great strides this year, and it wouldn't be fair to dismiss him because of this loss, especially after his late-game heroics versus New Orleans. He deserves a chance with more than 1 weapon to throw to. Vernon Davis was a monster again (3-112, 2 TDs), but no other Niner receiver or tight end did anything. "

   "comment":"Smith was just 12-of-19 for 143 yards. The 49ers' demolition was all about great running and just watching Mark Sanchez attempt futile passes all afternoon. It's really laughable how bad Sanchez is. He takes stupid sacks, makes careless mistakes and can't fire accurate accurate passes consistently. Sanchez went 13-of-29 for 103 yards an interception and a lost fumble on a third down in San Francisco territory. Sanchez nearly tossed a couple of other picks, as the crowd booed him mercilessly throughout the entire contest. I tweeted () the following during the third quarter following 1 of Sanchez's turnovers: Hey Jets, it's Tebow time. It really is. It has to be. Even if you're not a Tebow believer, you have to at least agree that it's time for New York to give up on Sanchez, and Tebow is the only alternative. Tebow was on the field on several occasions. He completed his only pass attempt for 9 yards, on a 3rd-and-1. However, his tight end fumbled the football after a fierce hit and the 49ers recovered it.    That wasn't the only instance in which an injured Jet coughed up the football while writhing in pain. Santonio Holmes hauled in a rare Sanchez completion but suffered a non-contact injury to his foot (though at the time, it seemed like he hurt his knee). As Holmes went down, he flipped the ball away carelessly like a selfish POS, seemingly giving up because he perhaps knew that his season was over. Carlos Rogers scooped up the ball and ran it in for 6. Holmes, meanwhile, was carted off into the locker room. He finished with 4 catches for 29 yards.    The Jets, of course, couldn't run the football either because Shonn Greene is terrible. He gained just 34 yards on 11 carries.    As for the 49ers, I mentioned earlier that they pounded the ball very well. Their front line pushed New York's defense around, as the Jet players couldn't tackle whatsoever. San Francisco ran a number of plays out of the Wildcat with Colin Kaepernick, who rushed for 50 yards and a touchdown on 5 attempts. Frank Gore (21-62, TD) and Kendall Hunter (8-56, TD) also couldn't be stopped.    With the runners gashing the Jets easily, Alex Smith didn't have to do much. He finished with essentially the same line as posted above (12-21, 143 yards), and none of his receivers had more than 3 receptions. Both "

   "comment":"Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by "

   "comment":"Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure. Smith then had a chance to be more comfortable, so he settled for more checkdowns, which is what he usually does anyway. As a consequence, "

   "comment":"Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure. Smith then had a chance to be more comfortable, so he settled for more checkdowns, which is what he usually does anyway. As a consequence, "

Smith's scores went to Charles and Bowe (4-69). The Chiefs failed on their first trip to the red zone, as it appeared that they missed Anthony Fasano, who is a big end-zone target. However, Washington's stop unit was so inept that it couldn't keep the Chiefs from scoring. - Special teams: Remember the Griffin strip-six that was overturned by the officials?

   "comment":"Smith pass that popped into the air and fell right into the arms of Anthony Fasano, who was on the ground. Fasano crawled into the end zone and put the Chiefs up by 14. Kansas City never relinquished its lead and held a double-digit advantage for most of the afternoon. Kansas City's defense took over in the second half, preventing the Jets from scoring a single point. Part of that was the quarterback getting hurt, but QBDK wasn't going to lead the Jets to victory anyway. While he made some nice plays - particularly 1 instance in which he eluded a sack and found Chris Johnson for a big gain - he was just too overwhelmed with pressure. Combine that with some red-zone ineptitude, and it's no wonder that New York didn't score at all following the break. QBDK wasn't awful though, as he went 21-of-28 for 196 yards and a touchdown to Eric Decker (9-63). He got hurt on a 4.h-down attempt in the red zone on a play in which his team was flagged for offensive pass interference. He was able to enter the game later in the 4.h quarter, but it was too late by then. Still, it was a reminder of how brittle QBDK is, and why teams simply can't rely on him to be a starter. Simms, by the way, did nothing in QBDK's absence, going 3-of-8 for 39 yards.    Percy Harvin was the primary reason why the Jets were able to move the chains and enter the red zone on some instances. Harvin caught a whopping 11 balls for 129 yards, and he also had a good kickoff return at the end of the first half to set up the team in field goal range. It's obviously very encouraging that Harvin was able to be such a huge part of this offense despite being in New York for only 2 weeks.    Chris Johnson complained about his usage this past week, and the Jets' coaching staff obviously listened. Johnson had more carries than Chris Ivory (11-8), and Johnson outgained Ivory, 69-22. CJ0K also caught 2 passes for 32 receiving yards. He actually looked decent for a change, but his troublesome antics during the week is exactly why bringing him into the team was a huge mistake. He's not nearly the player he once was, so his poor locker room attitude isn't worth it. The Jets, now 1-8, have to regret bringing him in, but it's not like they had the talent to win anyway.    As for the victors, Alex Smith was very economical, going 21-of-31 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He didn't make any mistakes, but then again, he didn't really need to force anything into New York's anemic secondary, who left receivers open all afternoon. I already mentioned that Smith somehow found Fasano for a fluke touchdown in the first half. Smith's other score was thrown to "

The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion. The crowd let the officials have it for what they thought was an awful call - there were several shady penalties, including an early ticky-tack roughness on Smith that gave the Chiefs a field goal - but it ultimately allowed Kansas City to prevail.

   "comment":"Smith on a good day, and I have to believe that a competent defense will be able to contain New England's offense. More on that later, but in the meantime, I'd attempt to sell-high and trade him to someone else.    I mentioned that Brady was the media's top story. To me, it was the horrible coaching job by Mike Tomlin and his staff. It was so frustrating watching this team, and I'm not just talking about Butler's ineptitude on the defensive side of the ball. A poor effort by the stop unit was expected. The offense, however, was supposed to click better than this. Every time the Steelers had momentum going, they screwed up somehow. It started on the opening drive when they were ripping off 10 yards per play, and yet Todd Haley inexplicably tried a trick play that lost yardage. A holding penalty derailed the next drive. Then, a procedural penalty. After that, there were drops by "

   "comment":"Smith threw 2 picks, 1 of which was his fault. The first interception was a telegraphed pass, but the other was tipped into the air. The second was a killer because it occurred in the red zone, nullifying a scoring opportunity. The real killer, however, was Charles' late-game fumble. Following Manning's third touchdown, the Chiefs were content just to run the clock out and go to overtime. However, Charles fumbled, and Bradley Roby scooped up the ball and scored. And just like that, Denver prevailed in a game it definitely did not deserve to win. It's a shame for Charles, as the 2 cough-ups ruined what was otherwise a brilliant evening; he gained 125 yards and a score on 21 carries.    Why didn't the Broncos deserve to win? Outside of Manning's ineptitude, the team made so many horrible mistakes. They had 3 penalties on Kansas City's first drive alone. They converted a 4.h-and-1 on a later possession, but there was a strange timeout that negated it. Late hits, missed tackles and unsportsmanlike penalties were prevalent throughout the evening. The Broncos were the sloppier team, and yet Kansas City had 4 more turnovers!    While Manning's struggles were predictable, the surprising aspect of this game was how poorly Denver's running game functioned. Both C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman struggled to find rushing room. Anderson mustered just 27 yards on 12 carries, while Hillman tallied 34 yards on 9 attempts. Hillman's YPC figure looks nice, but most of his yardage came on a 16-yard burst. Anderson still remains a weekly play for now, but Denver's blocking is awfully sketchy. Maybe Kansas City's run defense is that good, but I'm beginning to have doubts.    Both of Manning's primary receivers hauled in 8 passes, with Sanders securing 2 of the touchdowns. Sanders (8-87) is worth selling high in fantasy right now, given Manning's struggles. The same can be said for Thomas (8-116).    Manning's third score went to Virgil Green. Owen Daniels (3-19) disappointed once again. He's worth dropping at this point.    I mentioned that Smith tossed 2 interceptions earlier. He was 16-of-25 for 191 yards otherwise. He struggled immensely on third downs, going 0-of-7 in such situations. This game proved why the Chiefs do have any sort of chance at the Super Bowl with him at quarterback. He's so limited, and you can't even say that he takes care of the football anymore. The Chiefs would benefit from moving on after this year.    It's now a season and 2 games with Smith throwing a touchdown pass to a receiver. "

It was pathetic, and Andy Reid needs to think about making the switch to Chase Daniel. Smith went 16-of-30 for 181 yards and a touchdown, and he pretty much has no hope of rebounding without Charles. Smith was at his worst at the end of the first half. He took 20 seconds to get to the line of scrimmage while in scoring territory, and then he took a sack to get knocked out of field-goal range. I don't know which was worse; his horrible clock management, or his lack of awareness in terms of recognizing where he was on the field. Sadly, this wasn't the first time a Smith sack nullified a field-goal try, and it seems as though Reid will never figure out how to score prior to the end of each half. He should have hired a 16-year-old <i>Madden</i> player long ago.    Thanks to Smith's limitations, only 1 player had more than 35 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Smith went 4.and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision. Bridgewater looked good overall, but he'll need to clean up these sloppy errors when he starts playing better opponents.    It was odd to see Adrian Peterson struggle so much. The Chiefs had a terrific performance from Jaye Howard again, who helped clog the trenches. Peterson, as a result, was limited to 60 yards on 26 carries, and much of that came on a 23-yard burst. Peterson just didn't have any room to run. For instance, on 1 play, he was forced into foolishly reversing field, which resulted in a 6-yard loss.    Bridgewater targeted 2 receivers 9 times each. One was Mike Wallace, who continued to be very inefficient, hauling in just 2 passes for 23 yards. He dropped a pass in the early going. Fifth-round rookie Stefon Diggs, on the other hand, was so much better, logging 7 receptions for 129 yards. Diggs is definitely worth adding in fantasy.    Kyle Rudolph caught Bridgewater's sole touchdown. However, he did nothing otherwise, catching 2 passes for only 9 yards.    As for the Chiefs, they were just very inconsistent on offense. Jamaal Charles was clearly missed, while West definitely did not serve as an effective replacement. Adding injury to insult, Jeremy Maclin left with a concussion, making Kansas City's scoring unit even more ineffective. West split touches with Knile Davis early on. He had the majority of the workload in the second half, but managed only 33 yards on 9 carries with just 1 catch for 6 receiving yards. West looked slow and sluggish, and he was stopped on a 4.h-down run in the red zone when Sharrif Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    "

   "comment":"Smith, on the other hand, was moving the ball with 160 yards at halftime, but no touchdowns and 3 Cairo Santos field goals. This has been a familiar refrain for this Kansas City offense.    After half, Kansas City found the end zone as Charcandrick West saw 3 goal-line attempts, but was able to get in for his first touchdown of his career and the first rushing touchdown the Steelers had allowed this season. West had a bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but overall played a nice game, rushing for 110 yards on 22 carries for 5 yards per attempt. This comes against a Steelers' defense that had been giving up just 3.5 yards per carry on the season.    West's touchdown was then matched when Jones hit Bryant again, but this time for a 19-yard touchdown, bringing the Steelers within 6 points just before the third quarter ended. Bryant now has 3 touchdown receptions in his first 2 games back and amazingly, Bryant caught all of those touchdown passes from Landry Jones. When Ben Roethlisberger returns, this offense could be special.    The Steelers then made another push, aided by Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley."

   "comment":"Smith, throwing short of the line to gain on third-down situations. Always a craven, Gabbert is simply too scared to go downfield. He also took a sack on a 4.h-and-1 try on the Cleveland 30. He also had an extremely dumb play where he took a big loss for what was ruled a sack by running out of bounds instead of throwing the ball away. Because of Gabbert's ultra-conservative nature, the 49ers simply couldn't get anything going. They were limited to just 48 net yards and 2 first downs in the opening half. Those figures are more indicative of how they performed, given that they picked up garbage yardage late when this game was out of hand.    To be somewhat fair to Gabbert, he had nothing to work with in the wake of Vance McDonald's injury. "

   "comment":"Smith as a runner. He appeared very poised, and I was highly impressed. Unfortunately for the Bengals, Denver figured out McCarron pretty quickly. McCarron was 10-of-18 for only 81 yards and a lost fumble after the break. His passes were off the mark, as he missed Green for a deep touchdown. The fumble ended the game, with McCarron mishandling the shotgun snap. McCarron actually fumbled on the previous play as well, but the NFL officials botched the replay review. Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here. The inconsistency is troubling, but Denver has 1 of the top defenses in the NFL.    Green happened to be Cincinnati's leading receiver, catching 5 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown, though all of this production came in the first half. Tyler Kroft (4-46), starting for the injured Tyler Eifert, was next. Kroft made an impressive play to break a tackle and move the team into field goal range at the end of the 4.h quarter.    Jeremy Hill looked good at times, gaining 63 yards on 19 carries. He outgained Giovani Bernard (8-14), who also caught 4 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Vontaze Burfict killed his team in overtime. He allowed the Broncos to advance the ball into Cincinnati territory after he was guilty of a late hit out of bounds on Virgil Green. It was a truly stupid play. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Smith as a runner. He appeared very poised, and I was highly impressed. Unfortunately for the Bengals, Denver figured out McCarron pretty quickly. McCarron was 10-of-18 for only 81 yards and a lost fumble after the break. His passes were off the mark, as he missed Green for a deep touchdown. The fumble ended the game, with McCarron mishandling the shotgun snap. McCarron actually fumbled on the previous play as well, but the NFL officials botched the replay review. Overall, McCarron went 22-of-35 for 200 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles for 21 rushing yards. There's some promise here.

   "comment":"Smith gone, the cornerback play has regressed, and Justin Houston's absence hasn't helped matters.    Two of Roethlisberger's touchdowns went to Antonio Brown, who caught 4 balls for 64 yards. He was once again whistled for taunting in the end zone after doing an inappropriate dance following a touchdown, though it wasn't as egregious as his twerking earlier in the year. Roethlisberger's other scores went to Darrius Heyward-Bey (1-31), Markus Wheaton (1-30) and Jesse James (2-15). Sammie Coates had a solid showing for once, snatching 6 balls for 79 yards. He also led the team with 8 targets. Coates has immense upside, so perhaps he's finally beginning to live up to expectations.    Le'Veon Bell made his 2016 debut in this debut following his 3.game suspension. Bell didn't disappoint, generating 144 yards on only 18 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 34 receiving yards. The only downside was that DeAngelo Williams (4-7) vultured a touchdown late in the evening.    Before moving on to the Chiefs, it's worth mentioning that the Steelers sustained ankle injuries to Marcus Gilbert and Jarvis Jones. A Gilbert loss would be substantial against teams with better pass rushes.    Speaking of Jones, he caught Alex Smith's single interception when it slipped out of his hands and was tipped by Cameron Heyward."

It didn't help the Saints that Terron Armstead sustained an injury on the second drive, but New Orleans couldn't block the Chiefs' defensive front. The sack count might not seem low - Drew Brees was brought down only once - but the Saints' blockers were responsible for numerous holding penalties, which disrupted drives in the opening half. As a result, Brees was constantly stuck in third-and-long situations, and he threw a pick-six on the second drive, which was deflected. Stats can be deceiving, and that's the case here, as Brees went 37-of-48 for 367 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick-six. Brees definitely did not play poorly at all, but he wasn't as great as those stats indicate. He was very jittery in the pocket, as it was apparent that the Chiefs' pressure rattled him. The crowd noise was bothersome as well, as Brees took a delay-of-game penalty and had to waste a precious second-half timeout. He also missed some receivers, including Michael Thomas for a big gain on a third down at the end of the opening half, and he should've been picked off another time, but Ron Parker dropped the ball.    The Chiefs will only get better defensively, as it's a great sign that they're 4-2 right now with Justin Houston not even seeing any game action yet. It'll be up to the offense to produce, and it's too bad for them that they don't get to beat up on the Saints' sorry defense every week. Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. Most of his throws were of the short variety, as you might expect, though he did connect on a long touchdown to Tyreek <strike>Lanister</strike> Hill for a 38-yard strike. He also made an impressive completion to "

An Indianapolis defender hit him as he was sliding, but the defender's arms inadvertently hit Smith's helmet, causing it to hit the turf. Smith, who was knocked out for a couple of drives earlier in the contest, had to leave the game for good. It's actually shocking that Smith hasn't sustained more head injuries in his career, given his stature and willingness to scramble so much.

   "comment":"Smith this offseason, but still had a great corner in Peters. He was set to cover Evans, but wasn't around to do so. As a result, Evans had a big performance, catching 6 of 13 targets for 105 yards. He didn't reach the end zone, but came very close; Steven Nelson knocked a potential touchdown out of Evans' hands at the last second in the opening half.    Despite Evans having a big performance, Winston was able to spread the ball around very well, as he had a strong afternoon following a weird fumble on the opening drive in the red zone, where the ball inexplicably slipped out of his hands. Winston was almost picked off in the end zone as well, but improved as the afternoon progressed. Including Evans, 5 Buccaneers reeled in at least 3 receptions. Cecil Shorts (5-62) and Russell Shepard (3-54) were next on the receiving list, followed by Adam Humphries (4-47) and Doug Martin (3-42).    Speaking of Martin, he had a tough time finding any running room, gaining 63 yards on 24 carries, and this includes a gain of 12, meaning his other 23 attempts went for only 51 yards. Martin at least helped his team as a receiver, but he dropped a pass on what appeared to be a very promising screen.    Moving on to the Chiefs, Alex Smith had a solid afternoon except for 1 glaring error. That occurred in the second half, as he entered the red zone. Smith threw a pass into the end zone, but he telegraphed it, and the Buccaneers were able to snatch the interception and return it to midfield. This was a crushing blow for the Chiefs, who may have won the game had they just settled for a field goal on that drive. Smith finished 24-of-31 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and that interception. He also found the end zone on a second occasion on the ground, though he scrambled just twice for 10 yards.    Smith's 1 aerial score didn't go to the usual suspects, as "

   "comment":"Smith. Fifteen minutes of game action later, the Chiefs put themselves in position to win, thanks to a controversial move by Gary Kubiak, and the kick hit the upright - except that it deflected inside the other upright to give Kansas City the victory. It was hard for me to determine where to begin otherwise, given how insane this game was. But I kept going back to 2 words: Justin Houston. The Chiefs came into this divisional battle extremely banged up, but 1 player they had back from injury happened to be Houston. He was on the field last week, but didn't quite look like himself. Well, he's definitely back, as he racked up 3 sacks and a forced fumble. That doesn't tell the whole story though, as he completely dominated the line of scrimmage, especially in the first half. He may have cost Ty Sambrailo his job, as the Colorado State product was benched in favor of Donald Stephenson, who was yanked last week. One of Houston's sacks featured a strip in the end zone, resulting in a safety. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyreek Hill scored a touchdown on the return. Thus, Houston was effectively responsible for 9 early Kansas City points.    Speaking of Hill, he also had a huge performance. In addition to his return touchdown on the free kick, he caught 9 of the 10 targets thrown his way for 52 yards. He also reached the end zone on offense, which was the touchdown that sent the game to overtime. It appeared as though Hill was tackled short of the goal line, and that's how the officials ruled it at first, but following replay review, it was stated that Hill didn't have full possession when he was touched, and by the time he obtained the ball, he had crossed the goal line.    Alex Smith finished 26-of-44 for 220 yards and a touchdown. He was dreadful in the opening half, as he was 5-of-12 for only 26 yards prior to intermission. It wasn't all Smith's fault, as he saw tons of pressure from Ambassador "

He did manage to score a touchdown on the ground, but that was 1 of his few positive plays.    Speaking of Maclin, he finished with a team-high 6 catches for 82 yards, doubling up the next player on the stat sheet, "

   "comment":"Smith threw a bubble screen to Travis Kelce. The Broncos looked like they had never seen 1 before, and Kelce took advantage of terrific blocking to scamper 80 yards into the end zone. Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault. In fact, Smith's first poor throw of the night came on his 10th attempt when he made an errant throw to "

   "comment":"Smith put together 1 of the best performances of his season on Sunday afternoon. The veteran quarterback was his usual, accurate self, but he added a lot to the game by virtue of his mobility. Smith scrambled for 21 yards on 6 carries during the matchup with the Chargers. He also added a touchdown with his legs. On the score, he ran a read-option play that he was able to execute perfectly. He read the opponent and got outside leverage before getting to the pylon. On the other scrambles, Smith showed tremendous speed and was able to make quick decisions. That really helped to get his passing game going. In that department, Smith went 21-of-28 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He was able to demonstrate excellent accuracy and delivered a lot of on-target passes to his receivers. If Smith can play like this in the postseason, he will give the Chiefs a chance to win their divisional round matchup.    Smith's strategy of spreading the ball around worked very well for the Chiefs on Sunday. Four different receivers saw at least 5 targets, and the leader of the group was "

The 6-4 Chiefs have to turn things around quickly to have any hopes of competing with the Steelers and Patriots in January. With the meaningless win, the 2-8 Giants could end up hurting their draft positioning, but as of right now, they remain in the third slot behind the Browns and 49ers.    With both offenses struggling, there were a few trick plays tried in this game. Giants converted a fake punt in the first half to pick up a first down near midfield. New York went to another gadget play near the end zone with Shane Vereen throwing a pass on a halfback option, but the ball was picked off by Kansas City safety Daniel Sorensen. The Chiefs gave it right back when they tried a shovel pass to Travis Kelce, which was deflected up in the air and then caught by Giants defensive tackle Snacks Harrison for an interception. That put New York at the Kansas City's 26. A pass interference on Marcus Peters in the end zone moved it to the 1-yard line and New York scored with Orleans Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a 4.h-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, "
