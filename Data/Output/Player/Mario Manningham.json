Hakeem Nicks had 4 grabs for 49 yards and a touchdown. As noted earlier, Manningham also scored, but had just 2 catches for 33 yards.

The Bills answered immediately with running back Fred Jackson breaking off an 80-yard touchdown run. He got excellent blocks from center Eric Wood and guard Kent Urbik to open up a lane. Jackson veered and slashed across the field to prevent being caught from behind for a career-long touchdown run. Buffalo took the lead with a 60-yard touchdown strike from quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. It was a short pass to him in zone coverage, and the second-year wide receiver cut by a couple of defensive backs, breaking into the open field. He then raced into the end zone for a 14-7 lead. After Manning led the Giants to a field goal, Fitzpatrick was following suit. The Giants' defensive line came alive with Mathias Kiwanuka and Jason Pierre-Paul both recording sacks to knock the Bills out of field goal range. Not long after, Manning and wideout Hakeem Nicks beat cornerback Drayton Florence for a 60-yard gain to the Bills 5-yard line. Bradshaw dove over the top of the line, in for another short touchdown run. In the third quarter, the Giants broke a 17-17 tie with another short touchdown run by Bradshaw. It was set up by some passes from Manning to Ballard. Initially, Manning had a touchdown pass to Manningham, but it was reversed and put on the 1-yard line, where Bradshaw finished it off.

His stats don't completely indicate just how well he was playing. He completed 8-of-11 passes for 71 yards with 5 carries for 31 yards and a score. Manning was also very good, throwing the ball accurately and making good decisions. The biggest issue for the Giants' offense was inconsistent play from the offensive line. To start the third quarter, Bush ran for 41 yards on 2 carries to get Miami a field goal. That was all the scoring of the third quarter as the teams gave their punters some work. Early in the final period, Manning led a field goal drive with 2 good passes to Ballard. On the next possession, the Giants took the lead when Manning hit wide out Manningham.

Early in the final period, Manning led a field goal drive with 2 good passes to Ballard. On the next possession, the Giants took the lead when Manning hit wide out Victor Cruz on a slant in the intermediate part of the field. He slashed his way through the secondary and dashed into the end zone for a 25-yard score. That put New York up 20-17. The Giants' defense took over and started putting a lot of heat on Moore. New York's defensive line was overwhelming the Dolphins' front. Osi Umenyiora beat Jake Long for a sack. Mathias Kiwanuaka got by Vernon Carey for a sack on the next play. That ended up putting Moore in a 4th-and-23 just after the 2-minute warning. He threw downfield and was intercepted by Corey Webster. Jason Pierre-Paul, Linval Joseph and Justin Tuck also got into the sack column in the game. Moore finished 13-of-22 for 138 yards and 1 interception. Earlier in the week, Bush admitted that he and his team have been terrible this year. Well, Bush tried to do something about it as he ran for 103 yards on 15 carries. Wide receiver Brandon Marshall had 55 yards on 4 catches. Manning had a fabulous performance. He was 31-of-45 for 349 yards and 2 touchdowns. Bradshaw ran for 50 yards on 13 carries and had 5 receptions for 38 yards. The Giants wide outs all had solid games. Cruz led the unit with 7 receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown. Hakeem Nicks caught 6 for 67 yards and Manningham notched 6 receptions for 63 yards and a touchdown. Ballard caught 4 passes for 55 yards. One thing that was clear from the game was both teams could use help on the offensive line. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Mario Manningham totaling 30 yards. Eli Manning was sharp early, completing his first 10 passes. After a somewhat controversial non-fumble, Victor Cruz was short of a first down and the Giants went up 3-0. San Francisco answered with a nice drive. Alex Smith spread the ball around, hitting Delanie Walker, Braylon Edwards and Ted Ginn Jr. for a total of 46 yards. The 49ers converted twice on third down, but were forced to tie the game on a field goal when Aaron Ross wrapped up tight end Vernon Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Manningham totaling 30 yards.
