Earlier in the year against the Vikings, Mangina was also unsuccessful running the Wildcat in the red zone.   "

   "comment":"Cribbs running wide open down the middle of the field. It was an easy pass that Cribbs would have turned into an 80-yard touchdown, but McCoy's pass was horribly overthrown, and the Browns had to punt. McCoy came back and got the Browns on the board in the second quarter. He rolled out of the pocket and tossed a jump ball into the end zone for Cribbs. The wide receiver made a leaping catch in front of cornerback "
