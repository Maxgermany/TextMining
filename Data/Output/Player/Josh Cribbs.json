   "comment":"Josh Cribbs played out of the Wildcat in the red zone, yet tossed an interception to Polamalu. This was yet another mistake by Eric Mangini in his horrific 10.re as the Browns head coach. Earlier in the year against the Vikings, Mangina was also unsuccessful running the Wildcat in the red zone.   "
