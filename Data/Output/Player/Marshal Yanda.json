  "comment":"Marshal Yanda. The All-Pro guard suffered an ankle injury and was ruled out very quickly. It was later revealed that Yanda has a fractured ankle, and he's out for the season. This is a devastating injury that will end any chance the Ravens had of making a deep playoff push. Yanda is 1 of the top linemen in the NFL, and he's irreplaceable. If there's a silver lining, it's that ",
