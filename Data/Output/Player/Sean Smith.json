Smith was up to his old tricks early on, throwing a typical checkdown that wasn't even far enough on a third-and-4 try.

   "comment":"Smith gone, the cornerback play has regressed, and Justin Houston's absence hasn't helped matters.    Two of Roethlisberger's touchdowns went to Antonio Brown, who caught 4 balls for 64 yards. He was once again whistled for taunting in the end zone after doing an inappropriate dance following a touchdown, though it wasn't as egregious as his twerking earlier in the year. Roethlisberger's other scores went to Darrius Heyward-Bey (1-31), Markus Wheaton (1-30) and Jesse James (2-15). Sammie Coates had a solid showing for once, snatching 6 balls for 79 yards. He also led the team with 8 targets. Coates has immense upside, so perhaps he's finally beginning to live up to expectations.    Le'Veon Bell made his 2016 debut in this debut following his 3.game suspension. Bell didn't disappoint, generating 144 yards on only 18 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 34 receiving yards. The only downside was that DeAngelo Williams (4-7) vultured a touchdown late in the evening.    Before moving on to the Chiefs, it's worth mentioning that the Steelers sustained ankle injuries to Marcus Gilbert and Jarvis Jones. A Gilbert loss would be substantial against teams with better pass rushes.    Speaking of Jones, he caught Alex Smith's single interception when it slipped out of his hands and was tipped by Cameron Heyward."

   "comment":"Smith's departure. However, it appears as though the stop unit is rounding into 2015 form. One week after limiting the Raiders' offense to just 10 points, the Chiefs stomped all over Drew Brees, basically allowing nothing to him until very late in the game when they were up multiple scores. It didn't help the Saints that Terron Armstead sustained an injury on the second drive, but New Orleans couldn't block the Chiefs' defensive front. The sack count might not seem low - Drew Brees was brought down only once - but the Saints' blockers were responsible for numerous holding penalties, which disrupted drives in the opening half. As a result, Brees was constantly stuck in third-and-long situations, and he threw a pick-six on the second drive, which was deflected. Stats can be deceiving, and that's the case here, as Brees went 37-of-48 for 367 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick-six. Brees definitely did not play poorly at all, but he wasn't as great as those stats indicate. He was very jittery in the pocket, as it was apparent that the Chiefs' pressure rattled him. The crowd noise was bothersome as well, as Brees took a delay-of-game penalty and had to waste a precious second-half timeout. He also missed some receivers, including Michael Thomas for a big gain on a third down at the end of the opening half, and he should've been picked off another time, but Ron Parker dropped the ball.    The Chiefs will only get better defensively, as it's a great sign that they're 4-2 right now with Justin Houston not even seeing any game action yet. It'll be up to the offense to produce, and it's too bad for them that they don't get to beat up on the Saints' sorry defense every week. Alex Smith misfired on just 7 occasions, going 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. Most of his throws were of the short variety, as you might expect, though he did connect on a long touchdown to Tyreek Lanister Hill for a 38-yard strike. He also made an impressive completion to "

   "comment":"Smith. Fifteen minutes of game action later, the Chiefs put themselves in position to win, thanks to a controversial move by Gary Kubiak, and the kick hit the upright - except that it deflected inside the other upright to give Kansas City the victory. It was hard for me to determine where to begin otherwise, given how insane this game was. But I kept going back to 2 words: Justin Houston. The Chiefs came into this divisional battle extremely banged up, but 1 player they had back from injury happened to be Houston. He was on the field last week, but didn't quite look like himself. Well, he's definitely back, as he racked up 3 sacks and a forced fumble. That doesn't tell the whole story though, as he completely dominated the line of scrimmage, especially in the first half. He may have cost Ty Sambrailo his job, as the Colorado State product was benched in favor of Donald Stephenson, who was yanked last week. One of Houston's sacks featured a strip in the end zone, resulting in a safety. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyreek Hill scored a touchdown on the return. Thus, Houston was effectively responsible for 9 early Kansas City points.    Speaking of Hill, he also had a huge performance. In addition to his return touchdown on the free kick, he caught 9 of the 10 targets thrown his way for 52 yards. He also reached the end zone on offense, which was the touchdown that sent the game to overtime. It appeared as though Hill was tackled short of the goal line, and that's how the officials ruled it at first, but following replay review, it was stated that Hill didn't have full possession when he was touched, and by the time he obtained the ball, he had crossed the goal line.    Alex Smith finished 26-of-44 for 220 yards and a touchdown. He was dreadful in the opening half, as he was 5-of-12 for only 26 yards prior to intermission. It wasn't all Smith's fault, as he saw tons of pressure from Ambassador "
