   "comment":"Kelley was stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 on what proved to be a long-developing play. Kirk Cousins threw short of the goal line on a third down. Josh Norman dropped what appeared to be a pick-six. A field goal was missed prior to halftime, albeit from long range. The Redskins paid the price by allowing Cincinnati to hang around. The Bengals caught fire in the second half, and the difference proved to be Tyler Eifert. The talented tight end caught only 2 passes for 22 yards prior to intermission, but he came alive after the break, as Andy Dalton made it a point to throw to him on what seemed like every down. Eifert, who finally was 100 percent, provided the big boost that the Bengals' offense has desperately needed. Eifert caught 6 balls for 76 yards and a touchdown in the second half alone. With Eifert and A.J. Green dominating the Redskins' defense, it appeared as though the Bengals would pull away. They entered the red zone, up 3. but Dalton forced a poor throw while under pressure, and the ball sailed right to linebacker Will Compton. The Redskins were able to drive the field for a touchdown to take the lead, and the contest eventually went into overtime, the first extra session that British people have ever seen in person. Much like the last NFL overtime affair that everyone else witnessed on national TV, this contest came down to a short field goal, which was whiffed, as Dustin Hopkins was wide left from 34 yards. As a result, we've had a tie in consecutive weeks for the first time in nearly 2 decades.    It's pretty horrible to have to fly to London and just come away with a tie, but if there's a silver lining for the Bengals, it's that Eifert finally became a big part of the offense. Eifert caught 9 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. He's definitely back, and he'll help Cincinnati's offense immensely in the second half of the season.    Eifert's presence will undoubtedly be a boost for Dalton, who had a solid morning if some mistakes are ignored. Dalton finished 27-of-42 for 284 yards and a touchdown, but he was also guilty of a horrible interception that allowed the Redskins to crawl back into it. Dalton was lucky to get away with a couple of other picks, as Norman dropped a pair of passes. Dalton also lost a fumble on a third-down sneak late in overtime near midfield, negating a potential game-winning field goal for Cincinnati.    Only 3 Bengals caught more than 1 pass. In addition to Eifert, they were A.J. Green (9-121) and Tyler Boyd (5-38). Green was a monster, producing big numbers despite Josh Norman covering him on almost every play. Green's best instance was when he fought through several tacklers to move the chains on third-and-10. This led a touchdown that gave Cincinnati its first lead of the morning.    Cincinnati had some success running the ball, as both Jeremy Hill (20-76) and Giovani Bernard (11-52) scored touchdowns. Hill left the game twice with what seemed like minor injuries, while Bernard had a lost fumble that was negated by a defensive hold.    As for the Redskins, Cousins posted some huge numbers, going 38-of-56 for 458 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Cousins had a mostly positive performance, but he was guilty of some mistakes. As mentioned, he threw short of the goal line on third down. He was also picked off on a deep shot to DeSean Jackson. However, he moved the chains well for most of the game, and he deserves credit for having his team in position to win with a short kick, but Hopkins blew it.    Cousins focused on targeting Jordan Reed early and often. Reed racked up 9 catches for 99 yards and a touchdown, trailing only Jamison Crowder (9-107), who also found the end zone. Crowder and Reed share the middle of the field, so it's surprising to see both of them post huge numbers. Elsewhere, Vernon Davis (5-93) and Pierre Garcon (6-67) both had solid performances. Jackson (3-48) left the game with a concussion.    The Redskins were missing Matt Jones, allowing Kelley to start. Kelley had a solid showing, gaining 87 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. "

He misfired just twice after intermission.    As mentioned, Garcon (6-116) and Crowder (3-102) caught deep touchdowns, as the 2 led the Redskins in receiving yardage. Jackson (4-51) also scored. Jordan Reed, meanwhile, snatched 5 of his 6 targets for 79 yards. He dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Kelley, meanwhile, continued to impress after supplanting Matt Jones as the starting running back. Kelley scored a whopping 3 touchdowns, generating 139 yards on 24 carries. A big chunk of his yardage came at the very end following a Green Bay fumble that effectively ended the game, but Kelley was once again an extremely strong runner, moving the pile on most occasions to pick up 3 or 4 yards when he had no running room. Kelley's sole mistake was a dropped pass in the opening half.    As for Rodgers, he started very slowly. In fact, the Packers didn't pick up a first down on their opening 3 drives in a game for the first time since 2010. The heavy winds really bothered Rodgers, unlike Cousins, which would explain why he generated most of his production in the second and 4.h quarters when he was playing with the wind. Rodgers finished 26-of-41 for 351 yards and 3 touchdowns. The numbers look great, and while Rodgers didn't play poorly or anything, he still wasn't quite himself. He didn't see some things the Rodgers of old would've noticed. He also was errant on some passes that pre-2015 Rodgers would've completed in his sleep. There were 2 occasions in which Rodgers was guilty of a delay-of-game penalty, though he got to use a timeout to negate 1. His head just doesn't seem to be completely in the game.    Rodgers' score went to "

   "comment":"Kelley had some tough runs in this contest, but didn't produce much yardage, as the Redskins had to abandon the run because they trailed throughout. Kelley's 14 carries went for 37 yards, but he punished the Dallas front with his tough plunges.    One thing I forgot to mention was that the sun was once again a factor, as the glare helped distract the Washington receivers in the first quarter. For all the money Jerry Jones put into the stadium, there sure are some major design flaws.   "
