   "comment":"Justin Smith forced a fumble, and a pack of 49ers was there to cover it and end the threat. Again, it wasn't over until Philly's defense let Gore run for 4, 8, 4, 5 and 5 yards on consecutive plays when it knew what was coming. How do you let an injured running back average over 5 yards per carry on a drive like that with the game on the line? There is plenty of blame to go around, but clearly this team of stars lacks heart and finishing skills.    On the other side, San Francisco got decent play from Alex Smit,h whose only turnover was a lost fumble. They have something brewing in the backfield with Gore and Hunter (11 touches for 100 yards). The passing game was littered with big plays from Crabtree, Morgan and tight end "
