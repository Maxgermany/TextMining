How do you let an injured running back average over 5 yards per carry on a drive like that with the game on the line? There is plenty of blame to go around, but clearly this team of stars lacks heart and finishing skills.    On the other side, San Francisco got decent play from Alex Smit,h whose only turnover was a lost fumble. They have something brewing in the backfield with Gore and Hunter (11 touches for 100 yards). The passing game was littered with big plays from Crabtree, Morgan and tight end Smith. He was a force. The rest of the unit had issues in the second half when the 49ers kept driving the length of the field for touchdowns. Kendall Hunter had a sweet reception for 45 yards to key their first touchdown march. The game was still in their control when Nnamdi Asomugha, signed to be a shutdown corner, let Michael Crabtree beat him for a gain of 32 yards to start a drive that ended in a touchdown to trim the lead to 23-17, which gave the visitors hope. At this point the offense kept moving down the field only to watch their rookie kicker act like a rookie. Alex Henery missed field goals on consecutive drives sandwiched around forcing a San Francisco punt. Suddenly, the 49ers had the ball with the outcome in doubt and 6:28 left. They got big plays from Hunter and the physically limited Frank Gore, who capped the drive off with a 12-yard touchdown scamper. The icing on the cake was Akers striking the extra point to make it 24-23. Still, the Dream Team had a full 3 minutes to answer the bell. Short passes put them just inside San Francisco territory. A pass to Maclin had them at the 32 and pretty much in field goal range, assuming Henery was up to it. One problem - Justin Smith forced a fumble, and a pack of 49ers was there to cover it and end the threat.

Walker was in the middle of 3 Tampa Bay players and went up to make a nice catch for the first score of the game. The Buccaneers responded with a 33-yard wide receiver screen to Arrelious Benn that set up a field goal. After that drive, and for the rest of the game, Tampa Bay's offense struggled.    The 49ers successfully drove the ball into Buccaneers' territory on the next drive, but Frank Gore fumbled the ball away, sacrificing a scoring opportunity. Josh Freeman gave it right back. He dropped back and had plenty of time to throw, but made a bad read on a throw to Kellen Winslow. The pass was picked off by Carlos Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.

Alex Smith scrambled for 8 yards on first down and Gore (19-107) had his longest run of the game chugging down field for a gain of 27. Two runs by Smith was crunched by rookie Ryan Kerrigan for a sack. After a quick exchange of punts, Washington mounted a bit of offense, digging its way out from their own 3-yard line to reach the 37 thanks in part to a pair of 5-yard penalties. However, John Beck (30-for-47 254 yards 1 TD, 1 INT) was picked off by Dashon Goldson. One play later, the scoreless first quarter was over. The 49ers went to Gore 3 times in a row to start the drive totaling 21 yards, then went away from him and failed to muster 3 yards on 2 plays to force a long field goal. David Akers, 1 of the most valuable players for them this season, was good from 52 yards out to make it 3-0.

   "comment":"Justin Smith knocked down the final pass of the game. Manning had his typical, big-number game (26-for-40 311 yards 2 TDs, 2 INTs) but the mistakes were costly, especially the second pick. Granted, he had only a little help from the running game, as Brandon Jacobs and D.J. Ware combined for 89 yards on 27 carries. Still, even with a big edge in time of possessions (34:37 to 25:23) and no Gore to deal with, New York found a way to let this win slip away.   Smith spread the ball around, hitting Delanie Walker, Braylon Edwards and Ted Ginn Jr. for a total of 46 yards. The 49ers converted twice on third down, but were forced to tie the game on a field goal when Aaron Ross wrapped up tight end Vernon Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by "

   "comment":"Justin Smith all played well for San Francisco.    The Dolphins have a solid defense and are well-coached, but until they get some play-makers at wide receiver for Tannehill to work with, the team is going to keep coming up short against good opponents.   Smith, took care of business in crunch time. With Atlanta losing to Carolina, the 49ers still have a shot at landing the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The first half of the game was a defensive battle, and the 49ers clawed to a 6-3 lead. The Dolphins' defense played excellently led by Cameron Wake, who had 3 sacks and a forced fumble. In the third quarter, Miami gifted a touchdown to the 49ers. Marcus Thigpen muffed a punt inside the 10-yard line that San Francisco recovered. Gore (16-63 rushing, 2-22 receiving) banged the ball into the end zone a few plays later.  Kaepernick then dropped in a perfectly thrown bomb in the end zone to Randy Moss, but the veteran dropped it. Gore took the drive over with some powerful runs and a 19-yard reception. He moved the ball down the field to set up a short Anthony Dixon (2-9) touchdown plunge. Kaepernick put the game on ice with a 50-yard touchdown off a of a read option with 2:10 left in regulation. Jared Odrick blew contain to open up the side of the field. Kaepernick finished 18-of-23 for 185 yards with 6 carries for 53 yards and a score. Michael Crabtree (9-93) played well, while Moss (2-30) continued to prove he's a washed-up waste of a roster spot.    Ryan Tannehill played well once again, but he doesn't have the talent around him to help put Miami over the top. The offensive line allowed way too much pressure and the receivers were pitiful. He had a third-quarter deep ball that was slightly overthrown, but still should've been caught by Marvin Miller for a huge gain. The drive still ended well as Tannehill hooked up with Anthony Fasano for a touchdown on 4.h-and-goal. Fasano (2-9) made a tremendous reception as he laid out for a diving 1.handed catch along the sideline. Tannehill's final drives were shut down. He finished 17-of-33 for 150 yards with a score and zero interceptions. Tannehill played better than his stats indicate against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL. Davone Bess (5-50), Reggie Bush (14-65 rushing, 5-38 receiving) and Brian Hartline (2-34) were kept out of the end zone.    Aldon Smith continued his tremendous season with 2 sacks. Navarro Bowman, "

   "comment":"Justin Smith had a sack; Ahmad Brooks, NaVorro Bowman and Patrick Willis all were solid.Smith's DUI and drug possession arrest was for the 49ers in this game. There's no way the Colts should've beaten them by 20. </i>    Players and coaches have told me that there are times when their teams can get a boost of momentum when their front office and ownership go all in to make it clear they will do whatever it takes to win immediately. The Colts seemed to have that lift this week as they took care of business against the 49ers, while San Francisco seemed to still be reeling from last week's loss to the Seahawks. Aside from a good drive in the second quarter, the 49ers' offense looked like it was sleepwalking against a Colts' defense that hardly looked elite in Weeks 1 and 2. Offensively, Indianapolis got some use out of newly acquired running back Trent Richardson. He plunged into the end zone from a yard out early in the first quarter. While Richardson (13-35) contributed, Ahmad Bradshaw (19-95) did the heavy lifting for the Colts' offense. He ripped off a 27-yard to set up a short touchdown run on a bootleg by Andrew Luck. That score put Indianapolis up 20-7 with 7 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter and basically finished off the 49ers. Luck took care of the football and did his job as a game-manager. He completed 18-of-27 passes for 164 yards, plus ran for 24 yards and a score. Reggie Wayne (5-63) and Darrius Heyward-Bey (5-59) led the Colts' receivers. Indianapolis offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton had a solid game plan and stayed patient with the run game.    The Colts' defense really played phenomenal football. Linebacker Jerrell Freeman was awesome, as he led the team with 8 tackles and chipped in a sack and forced fumble. Cory Redding chipped in with half a sack and a deflected pass to set up a Cassius Vaughn interception. Robert Mathis played well with 1.5 sacks, too.    49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was off all day. Indianapolis' defense stopped the read option and never let Kaepernick get in sync. He completed only 13-of-27 passes for 150 yards with an interception and lost fumble. Kaepernick ran for just 20 yards on 7 carries. The Colts' secondary stepped up to have blanket coverage with enough pass rush to keep Kaepernick pressured. Anquan Boldin (5-67) was the only receiver to catch more than 2 passes for San Francisco. The 49ers ran the ball well early, but the Colts adjusted to shut that down. Frank Gore (11-82) led the way with over 40 yards on San Francisco's lone touchdown drive. That possession was capped with by a 13-yard touchdown run by Kendall Hunter (4-14). Gore also caught 2 passes for 21 yards.    The 49ers' defense played well until its members were exhausted in the 4.h quarter. Justin Smith had a sack; Ahmad Brooks, NaVorro Bowman and Patrick Willis all were solid."

   "comment":"Justin Smith dropped Griffin for no gain on a third-down run to force a punt. That refrain repeated itself with a good run by Morris, but the drive ended courtesy of a Ray McDonald sack. Meriweather forced a fumble from Carlos Hyde that let the Redskins took over at their own 40, but they did nothing with the possession. Washington finally got a nice drive going thanks to passes to Andre Roberts and Pierre Garcon (3-34). Morris (21-125) charged hard with 11 yards to the 1.yard line. He then finished the drive with a plunge into the end zone. Just before the half, the 49ers moved the ball with a tremendous 25-yard catch by Michael Crabtree (5-58) to set up a 41-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Kaepernick threw a ball up for grabs in the third quarter that was picked off by Greg Ducre. The Redskins didn't get anything out of that possession, but on the next drive, they moved the ball with an 11-yard run by Morris and a 31-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (2-39). Aaron Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. Ryan Clark added a 15-yard penalty on the play with his helmet-to-helmet hit. That moved ball inside the Redskins' 20-yard line. A pass to Boldin (9-137) moved it to the 4-yard line before Hyde (7-16) darted into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. The Redskins got 2 more possessions, but the 49ers' defense slammed the door as Lynch came up with a clutch sack on the first possession and Justin Smith beat Morgan Moses for a strip-sack that was recovered by Ahmad Brooks to end the game.Smith dropped Griffin for no gain on a third-down run to force a punt.
