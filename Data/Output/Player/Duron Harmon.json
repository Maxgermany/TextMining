Flacco, who began the game 8-of-8 for 100 yards and a touchdown, finished 28-of-45 for 292 yards, 4 touchdowns and the 2 interceptions. Part of the reason he was so successful was because the Patriots couldn't get any pressure on him. His offensive line was fantastic despite the fact that "

The Patriots will host the winner of the Chiefs-Steelers matchup. They figure to be favored by at least a touchdown over both, despite their underwhelming performance in this contest.    I mentioned that the Texans' offense had a comedy of errors throughout the game. It started innocently when "
