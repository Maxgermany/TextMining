   "comment":"Duron Harmon snatched the pick to effectively clinch the victory. Flacco, who began the game 8-of-8 for 100 yards and a touchdown, finished 28-of-45 for 292 yards, 4 touchdowns and the 2 interceptions. Part of the reason he was so successful was because the Patriots couldn't get any pressure on him. His offensive line was fantastic despite the fact that Eugene Monroe did not play in this game.    Flacco, like Brady, spread the ball around extensively, as the Ravens also had 6 players who caught 4 passes. The 2 Smiths led the way with 3 grabs each. Torrey had 62 yards, while Steve, who had the misfortune of going up against Darrelle Revis, logged 44 yards and a touchdown. The latter Smith made some tough catches and also drew a couple of penalties on Revis. The officials actually missed an infraction in the red zone during the 4.h quarter, so the Ravens should've had a better chance at scoring a touchdown instead of a field goal, which ultimately decided the game.    The other Ravens who produced were: Harmon snatched the pick to effectively clinch the victory.
