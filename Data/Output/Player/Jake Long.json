   "comment":"Jake Long. The latter could be done for the year with a torn ACL. It's amazing how unfortunate the Rams have been. They've had injury issues to their linemen for years. They've missed Sam Bradford over the past couple of seasons. Chris Long has been out this year. And now this. Perhaps it'll be a blessing in disguise, as it'll help the Rams land either Marcus Mariota or James Winston in the 2015 NFL Draft (go here for my ).    Davis couldn't do anything without 4 key players, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 92 yards in the second half. He finished 15-of-25 for 160 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that he heaved into double coverage early on.    With Quick out, "

   "comment":"Jake Long, who was benched for a while after that. Long was swapped back in, but then was benched again, as Mike Zimmer and Norv Turner seemingly couldn't decide which crappy left tackle to have Bradford get killed. The Eagles ultimately got their act together offensively, sparked by a kickoff return touchdown. The Vikings never did, save for the very end in garbage time, ultimately prompting their first loss of the season.    Wentz finished 16-of-28 for 138 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Wentz began the game very poorly, but was sharp toward the end. He was actually 7-of-8 for 85 yards and a score following the break, so credit Philadelphia's coaching staff for making the proper adjustments. This was especially remarkable considering that left tackle "
