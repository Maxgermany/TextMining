Cam Newton let the ball hit the ground just 2 times, going 15-of-17 for 204 yards and a touchdown. Mixed in was his usual, arrogant showboating, as well as 10 scrambles that went for 26 rushing yards. There was a scary moment concerning Newton in the second half. Robert Quinn injured Newton on a read-option play. Newton went to the sideline, but missed only 1 play.    Newton's sole aerial score went to Steve Smith (5-69). Greg Olsen was the only other Panther to catch more than 3 balls (4-47), but didn't look healthy at all. He was wincing in pain following some of his receptions.    While the Rams couldn't do anything about stopping the pass, particularly in the second half, they did a good job of limiting DeAngelo Williams to 40 yards on 15 carries. Mike Tolbert (13-36) vultured another touchdown.    A common theme of this game was the chippiness between these 2 squads. There were several scrums and unsportsmanlike penalties. In fact, 1 Ram (Chris Long) was ejected for throwing a punch. "

   "comment":"Long and Robert Quinn recorded sacks to finish off Tampa Bay.    Both quarterbacks completed 16 passes for 158 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Glennon was 16-of-26, while Clemens was 16-of-20.    The Rams' defense was suffocating. Qunn beat Penn for 2 of his 3 sacks. At 18 sacks this year, Quinn broke Kevin Carter's franchise record. T.J. McDonald (6 tackles, 1 sack), Ogletree (8 tackles, .5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles), Laurinaitis (6 tackles, 1.5 sacks) and Long all played well for St. Louis.    "

   "comment":"Long. The latter could be done for the year with a torn ACL. It's amazing how unfortunate the Rams have been. They've had injury issues to their linemen for years. They've missed Sam Bradford over the past couple of seasons. Chris Long has been out this year. And now this. Perhaps it'll be a blessing in disguise, as it'll help the Rams land either Marcus Mariota or James Winston in the 2015 NFL Draft (go here for my 2015 NFL Mock Draft).    Davis couldn't do anything without 4 key players, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 92 yards in the second half. He finished 15-of-25 for 160 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that he heaved into double coverage early on.    With Quick out, "

   "comment":"Long, who was benched for a while after that. Long was swapped back in, but then was benched again, as Mike Zimmer and Norv Turner seemingly couldn't decide which crappy left tackle to have Bradford get killed. The Eagles ultimately got their act together offensively, sparked by a kickoff return touchdown. The Vikings never did, save for the very end in garbage time, ultimately prompting their first loss of the season.    Wentz finished 16-of-28 for 138 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Wentz began the game very poorly, but was sharp toward the end. He was actually 7-of-8 for 85 yards and a score following the break, so credit Philadelphia's coaching staff for making the proper adjustments. This was especially remarkable considering that left tackle "
