   "comment":"Avery Williamson. Both teams had drives stall. With less than 2 minutes remaining, Mariota made a great throw to Harry Douglas (2-20) for 25 yards. He then hit Tajae Sharpe (3-48) for gains of 23 and 19 yards to get inside Oakland's 5.yard line. A personal foul penalty on Taylor Lewan pushed the ball back. Mariota then connected with Andre Johnson for a touchdown, but Johnson was called for pushing off the corner. On 4.h down, Mariota threw incomplete for the end zone to Douglas, and the Raiders were fortunate they weren't called for pass interference.    Derek Carr completed 21-of-35 passes for 249 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Amari Cooper had 4 receptions for 62 yards, while Michael Crabtree had 8 catches for 102 yards.    Mariota completed 17-of-33 passes for 214 yards with zero touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Tight end Delanie Walker was out with a hamstring injury, and replacement Jace Amaro led the Titans in receiving with 3 catches for 59 yards.    DeMarco Murray ran for 114 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also had 5 receptions for 41 yards. Derrick Henry (10-45) ran well, too.    Oakland's secondary played much better this week, but Tennessee's wide receivers really struggled. The Titans front 7 got good games from Avery Williamson (9 tackles, 1 interception), Brian Orakpo and Jurrell Casey."
