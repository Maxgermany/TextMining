The Bengals had limited Indianapolis to just 13 points in the opening half, but missing Maualuga and Kirkpatrick proved to be too much, as Luck moved the chains effortlessly following the break. Indianapolis generated 482 net yards of offense, moving the chains 22 times, and they would've won by much more if it wasn't for some miscues in the red zone.    Luck finished 31-of-44 for 376 yards and a touchdown. Despite the early scoring drive, Luck had issues connecting with "

He does some nifty things, but he's just way too limited, both mentally and physically, and that's not even taking his glaring off-the-field issues into account. The Browns need to obtain a franchise quarterback soon, and that's exactly what I have them doing in my 2016 NFL Draft.    Manziel was so ineffective for half the game that he slowed down "
