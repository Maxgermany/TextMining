   "comment":"Denard Robinson was running well. The reason why they were ultimately blown out on the scoreboard was Blake Bortles. Saying Bortles was awful is an understatement. He didn't even look like a functional NFL quarterback. He threw wobbly passes throughout the afternoon and looked hesitant on most of his plays. He also threw short of the first-down marker on third down and missed several open receivers. Bortles (18-of-34, 221 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 picks), made his most egregious errors occurred when he lost a fumble and tossed 2 interceptions, both of which were pick-sixes. The first occurred when he unnecessarily forced it in Miami territory. The second occurred because he stared down Cecil Shorts. By the time the Dolphins ran the second interception into the end zone, they went up 17-3 despite doing absolutely nothing on offense. It seemed like the Jaguars became dispirited and stopped trying very hard on defense. Who could blame them?    As mentioned, Denard Robinson ran well - at least during the first half. He gained 108 yards on 18 carries, but struggled following intermission, managing just 18 yards on 7 attempts.    Both Jacksonville Robinsons had big games. "

A few plays later, Romo rolled out and threw a dart to Witten for a touchdown. Romo opened up the lead by hitting Dez Bryant on a short crossing route. Bryant then turned downfield and ran through a few arm tackles before powering his way into the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. Jacksonville responded to set up a scoring opportunity on apass to Shorts. He broke a few tackles and bolted down the sideline for a 53-yard gain, but on the next play, Denard Robinson fumbled the ball away to Dallas after getting stripped by George Selvie."

If Ivory misses any amount of time, Yeldon would likely take over the lead-back role and could be a low-end RB2.    Defensively, the Jaguars got a great effort out of their pass-rushers.
