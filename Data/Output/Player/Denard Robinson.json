The first occurred when he unnecessarily forced it in Miami territory. The second occurred because he stared down Cecil Shorts. By the time the Dolphins ran the second interception into the end zone, they went up 17-3 despite doing absolutely nothing on offense.

The Texans answered with a field goal drive to take a 10-7 lead. Right before the half, Bortles drove the ball to Houston's 10-yard line, but he threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal to maintain the 3.point lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, the Jaguars stopped a 4.h-and-1 carry by Foster for a loss of a few yards, which set up Jacksonville at midfield.

   "comment":"Denard Robinson carried the load. Yeldon, who was dealing with an ankle injury, totaled 17 yards on 6 carries. He looked only OK and was clearly hampered by his ankle. Robinson got 13 carries and turned them into 39 yards. He simply does not have the strength to be an every-down back, and he should only be used in a change-of-pace scenario. If Ivory misses any amount of time, Yeldon would likely take over the lead-back role and could be a low-end RB2.    Defensively, the Jaguars got a great effort out of their pass-rushers. Highly touted free agent signee Robinson. Bortles' accuracy was only decent, but he did make some nice throws. On the touchdown throw to Marqise Lee, Bortles threw a bullet that Lee nabbed to get the big score. One thing that Bortles actually did well was running the ball. He posted a career-high 81 rushing yards on 8 carries. He was able to scramble out of the pocket as the Bills had issues containing him. If Bortles can continue to make those kinds of plays, then defenses will respect his running a bit more. That would open things up for the passing game.    Bortles spent most of the afternoon targeting a trio of third-year receivers. Marqise Lee (4-37, 1 TD), Allen Robinson (2-24) and Allen Hurns (1-12, TD) all saw a great deal of attention from their quarterback."
