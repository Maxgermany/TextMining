   "comment":"Robinson was running well. The reason why they were ultimately blown out on the scoreboard was Blake Bortles. Saying Bortles was awful is an understatement. He didn't even look like a functional NFL quarterback. He threw wobbly passes throughout the afternoon and looked hesitant on most of his plays. He also threw short of the first-down marker on third down and missed several open receivers. Bortles (18-of-34, 221 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 picks), made his most egregious errors occurred when he lost a fumble and tossed 2 interceptions, both of which were pick-sixes. The first occurred when he unnecessarily forced it in Miami territory. The second occurred because he stared down Cecil Shorts. By the time the Dolphins ran the second interception into the end zone, they went up 17-3 despite doing absolutely nothing on offense. It seemed like the Jaguars became dispirited and stopped trying very hard on defense. Who could blame them?    As mentioned, Denard Robinson ran well - at least during the first half. He gained 108 yards on 18 carries, but struggled following intermission, managing just 18 yards on 7 attempts.    Both Jacksonville Robinsons had big games. "

   "comment":"Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to A.J. Green, a clutch reception by Cedric Peerman, a chunk run by Hill, and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanu. Cincinnati's next score was set up by Rex Burkhead, getting a piece of a punt to shorten the field. Dalton dropped in a rainbow to Sanu, who made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 32-yard gain to the 10-yard line. On the next play, Sanu recovered a fumble by A.J. Green to maintain the scoring opportunity that ended with a field goal by Andy Dalton. The Jaguars went 3.and-out, thanks to a sack by Carlos Dunlap and Jaguars punter Bryan Anger had his second consecutive punt blocked, which Taylor Mays turned into a safety. Cincinnati could have broken the game open as Bortles had another interception dropped; this time by linebacker Emmanuel Lamur before the half. In the third quarter, Dalton went right back to Sanu for a 36-yard reception to the 11-yard line. Sanu (4-95) ran a great route and beat safety Josh Evans for the ball. Hill finished the drive with a short touchdown run. The Jaguars answered with Bortles throwing a 40-yard touchdown to Allen Hurns. Hurns had a step on Leon Hall, but the ball was underthrown, and Hurns had to adjust to make the reception in front of Hall. Dalton helped the Jaguars out with a poorly thrown ball that was picked off by Sherrod Martin. The Bengals' defense came up with a stop despite, once again, dropping an interception. That near-turnover was around Jacksonville's 20-yard line. Pacman Jones then returned a punt 31 yards to set up a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Green (3-44). Jacksonville fought back with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Hurns (7-112). He made a great adjustment to outfight Terrance Newman for the ball in the front of the end zone. In response, Dalton had a ball slip out of his hands, and linebacker J.T. Thomas III intercepted the ball after it ping-ponged off a helmet. A couple of plays later, Robinson (17-94) ran the ball into the end zone to close the lead to 3. Just seconds later though, Hill ripped off a 60-yard touchdown run. Hurns then bailed out Bortles with a great catch over Hall to move the ball into Cincinnati territory, but Bortles' poor decisions came back to bite the Jaguars, as he threw a pass into a crowd of defenders in the end zone for an interception by "

One thing that Bortles actually did well was running the ball. He posted a career-high 81 rushing yards on 8 carries. He was able to scramble out of the pocket as the Bills had issues containing him. If Bortles can continue to make those kinds of plays, then defenses will respect his running a bit more. That would open things up for the passing game.    Bortles spent most of the afternoon targeting a trio of third-year receivers.
