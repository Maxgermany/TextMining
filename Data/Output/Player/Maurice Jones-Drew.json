   "comment":"Jones-Drew as much as possible. Well, Jones-Drew didn't receive a single carry early on when the team had 1st-and-goal. The Jaguars predictably stalled. Right before the Bills went up 15-10, Jacksonville called 22 pass plays to just 10 runs! The Jaguars as a whole were disoriented. They surrendered multiple first downs on long-yardage situations, including a 3rd-and-15; they had careless penalties, including 1 instance where they had 12 men on the field when Buffalo was in the red zone; and they fumbled it 3 times on top of an interception. If I didn't know any better, I would have said that Jacksonville fired its head coach this week; not Buffalo.    Jones-Drew actually finished with 25 carries because Del Rio finally realized that he had to run the ball when Buffalo went up 15-10. Drew-Jones gained just 66 yards and a touchdown. Not sure why Jacksonville couldn't get him going; it's as if this team was asleep the entire afternoon.    "

   "comment":"Jones-Drew received just FIVE carries in the first half compared to 18 David Garrard attempts. I'll capitalize: HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE? GET THE BALL TO YOUR BEST PLAYER, YOU IDIOTS! The Jaguars trailed 17-3 at the break, so amazingly, 10 of Jones-Drew's 15 carries came in the second half. Way to run the ball only when you're down. Jones-Drew finished with 75 yards on those 15 attempts. Oh, and you'll be surprised by this 1 - the Jaguars had 5 penalties in the first half. The 49ers had just 1 all game. And note that this frustration comes despite the fact that I won 5 units on San Francisco. It just bothers me that an NFL coaching staff can be this inept week in and week out. It's like Del Rio and Koetter are betting against themselves. It's inexcusable. Rant over.    David Garrard was apparently solid by going 25-of-36 for 307 yards. However, Garrard took 6 sacks and lost 2 fumbles. He leads the NFL in fumbles with 11 (8 lost).    Aside from Jones-Drew's 5 catches, "

Apparently, Del Rio and Koetter don't read this Web site. Jones Drew had just 18 carries (63 yards) and 3 catches (35 more yards). The bottom line: Del Rio and Koetter have to go. Oh, and for the 20 Jags fans out there: Get ready to order your Tim Tebow jerseys.    The second thing you can take away from this game is that Tom Brady is completely healthy again.

   "comment":"Jones-Drew found the end zone, the crowd furiously booed, and it didn't get any better afterward when Cleveland went 3.and-out on the ensuing drive. However, the Browns got on track after that and were able to move the chains pretty consistently in the second half, mostly on the ground. Chris Ogbonnaya rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries despite the fact that the Jaguars were 8. against the rush (3.9 YPC) heading into this contest. A barrage of injuries to Terrence Knighton, Matt Roth and Clint Session really helped.    Colt McCoy played pretty well too. He went 17-of-24 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and a poor interception in the red zone where he didn't see safety Dawan Landry. Still, it was a quality performance considering how good Jacksonville has been against the pass this season. Granted, cornerback Rashean Mathis was out, but the Browns will take it.    Only a pair Cleveland players had more than 2 receptions: Greg Little (5-59) and Joshua Cribbs (3-20). The latter scored McCoy's sole touchdown.    As for the younger quarterback, Blaine Gabbert was 22-of-41 for 210 yards. That's a pretty nondescript stat line, but Gabbert was pretty bad. Sure, he hit a few nice throws and led a nice final drive, but most of his passes seemed to sail in random places, as he constantly missed open receivers. He could have heaved a couple of interceptions, including 1 where Joe Haden dropped what should have been an easy pick.    You have to wonder why Gabbert had 41 attempts to just 21 Jones-Drew carries when the Browns established their first and only lead in the 4.h quarter. And it's not like Jones-Drew was bottled up; he had 87 yards and the aforementioned score. Jones-Drew also caught 4 balls for 31 receiving yards. The leader in both categories for Jacksonville was "

If I didn't know any better, I wouldn't have thought for a second that he was coming off major knee surgery.

   "comment":"Jones-Drew to an ankle (on the second play of the game) and Blaine Gabbert to a shoulder. It's a shame for Gabbert, who was having a relatively decent performance. He finished 8-of-12 for 110 yards and a touchdown to a wide-open Cecil Salute Your Shorts that looked like a punt. Yes, most of Gabbert's passes were checkdowns and he nearly tossed 2 picks on 1 drive, including 1 into triple coverage, but this, sadly, was 1 of his better outings. Chad Henne stepped in and the drop-off was immediately noticeable. Henne, who went 9-of-20 for 71 yards, displayed zero pocket awareness and terrible accuracy. He didn't even look like he was sober. It seemed like he just walked out of a Michigan frat party and a Jacksonville coach ran up to him and said, Chad, we know you're over the legal limit, but Blaine is hurt and we really need you to play! Mularkey's horrible coaching first was apparent when he went for it on a 4th-and-1 at midfield in the second quarter with a 17-3 lead. The Raiders had nothing going on offense, yet Mularkey had Henne run a bootleg, which resulted in a loss of downs. Oakland scored an ensuing quick field goal - 3 points that would have been extremely useful for Jacksonville late in the game. In the second half, Mularkey continuously had Henne pass the ball despite never trailing. It's a borderline miracle that he was never picked off. The Raiders eventually tied it. They tried their best to lose this game themselves, wasting timeouts and turning the ball over (thrice). Carson Palmer, who went 26-of-46 for 298 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and a weird interception (a 10-yard shovel pass that bounced off a helmet), nearly tossed a second pick in the end zone, but the ball was dropped. On the very next play, Aaron Ross was whistled for pass interference, ultimately leading to a Palmer sneak for a score. After the Jaguars punted the ball at the end of regulation, the Raiders tried to run out the clock. Mularkey called a timeout even though he didn't have enough stoppages to force an Oakland punt, so Palmer decided to attempt a long pass. He actually completed it to Rod Streater for 23 yards, setting up what would've been a record-setting 64-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. He was short by a few yards, but later nailed the game-winner in overtime following a Shorts lost fumble.    As mentioned, Jones-Drew hurt his ankle. He was on crutches in the second half, meaning "

   "comment":"Jones-Drew lost a fumble on the opening drive, which helped set up a Donald Brown touchdown. The Jaguars then allowed Trent Richardson to score on a 4.h-and-2 near the goal line. Making matters worse, Chad Henne was picked off because of a miscommunication deep in Indianapolis territory. Antoine Beatha had a big return to set up a field goal, making this a 3.score affair at halftime. Indianapolis never looked back. This was a nice win, but the Colts sustained a number of injuries: Vontae Davis (groin), Aubrayo Franklin (knee) and Bjoern Werner (ankle) were all knocked out.    Here are some key stats/notes: - Andrew Luck went 26-of-37 (including a perfect 6-of-6 in the second half) for 282 yards and a touchdown. He should've had a second score, but Griff Whalen dropped the ball in the end zone. On the flip side, Luck was fortunate to get away with an interception in the red zone. - Whalen ultimately found the end zone, as he was 1 of 2 Colts who logged more than a couple of receptions (4-32). The other was T.Y. Hilton, who had a huge game with 11 catches for 155 yards. - Both Indianapolis backs scored, as mentioned, though Brown (12-31) and Richardson (8-25) were both limited in terms of yardage. - Henne racked up garbage yardage, finishing 30-of-51 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. It must be noted that Henne had just 107 yards by halftime. - Jones-Drew, who fumbled, had just 39 rushing yards on 13 carries, but did catch 5 balls for 51 receiving yards. This may have been his final game in a Jaguars' jersey. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
