I'll capitalize: HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE? GET THE BALL TO YOUR BEST PLAYER, YOU IDIOTS! The Jaguars trailed 17-3 at the break, so amazingly, 10 of Jones-Drew's 15 carries came in the second half. Way to run the ball only when you're down. Jones-Drew finished with 75 yards on those 15 attempts. Oh, and you'll be surprised by this 1 - the Jaguars had 5 penalties in the first half. The 49ers had just 1 all game. And note that this frustration comes despite the fact that I won 5 units on San Francisco. It just bothers me that an NFL coaching staff can be this inept week in and week out. It's like Del Rio and Koetter are betting against themselves. It's inexcusable. Rant over.    David Garrard was apparently solid by going 25-of-36 for 307 yards. However, Garrard took 6 sacks and lost 2 fumbles. He leads the NFL in fumbles with 11 (8 lost).

Jones-Drew found the end zone, the crowd furiously booed, and it didn't get any better afterward when Cleveland went 3.and-out on the ensuing drive. However, the Browns got on track after that and were able to move the chains pretty consistently in the second half, mostly on the ground. Chris Ogbonnaya rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries despite the fact that the Jaguars were 8. against the rush (3.9 YPC) heading into this contest. A barrage of injuries to Terrence Knighton, Matt Roth and Clint Session really helped.    Colt McCoy played pretty well too. He went 17-of-24 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and a poor interception in the red zone where he didn't see safety Dawan Landry. Still, it was a quality performance considering how good Jacksonville has been against the pass this season. Granted, cornerback Rashean Mathis was out, but the Browns will take it.    Only a pair Cleveland players had more than 2 receptions: Greg Little (5-59) and Joshua Cribbs (3-20). The latter scored McCoy's sole touchdown.    As for the younger quarterback, Blaine Gabbert was 22-of-41 for 210 yards. That's a pretty nondescript stat line, but Gabbert was pretty bad. Sure, he hit a few nice throws and led a nice final drive, but most of his passes seemed to sail in random places, as he constantly missed open receivers. He could have heaved a couple of interceptions, including 1 where Joe Haden dropped what should have been an easy pick.    You have to wonder why Gabbert had 41 attempts to just 21 Jones-Drew carries when the Browns established their first and only lead in the 4.h quarter. And it's not like Jones-Drew was bottled up; he had 87 yards and the aforementioned score. Jones-Drew also caught 4 balls for 31 receiving yards. The leader in both categories for Jacksonville was "

It's a shame for Gabbert, who was having a relatively decent performance. He finished 8-of-12 for 110 yards and a touchdown to a wide-open Cecil Salute Your Shorts that looked like a punt. Yes, most of Gabbert's passes were checkdowns and he nearly tossed 2 picks on 1 drive, including 1 into triple coverage, but this, sadly, was 1 of his better outings. Chad Henne stepped in and the drop-off was immediately noticeable. Henne, who went 9-of-20 for 71 yards, displayed zero pocket awareness and terrible accuracy. He didn't even look like he was sober. It seemed like he just walked out of a Michigan frat party and a Jacksonville coach ran up to him and said, Chad, we know you're over the legal limit, but Blaine is hurt and we really need you to play! Mularkey's horrible coaching first was apparent when he went for it on a 4th-and-1 at midfield in the second quarter with a 17-3 lead. The Raiders had nothing going on offense, yet Mularkey had Henne run a bootleg, which resulted in a loss of downs. Oakland scored an ensuing quick field goal - 3 points that would have been extremely useful for Jacksonville late in the game. In the second half, Mularkey continuously had Henne pass the ball despite never trailing. It's a borderline miracle that he was never picked off. The Raiders eventually tied it. They tried their best to lose this game themselves, wasting timeouts and turning the ball over (thrice). Carson Palmer, who went 26-of-46 for 298 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and a weird interception (a 10-yard shovel pass that bounced off a helmet), nearly tossed a second pick in the end zone, but the ball was dropped. On the very next play, Aaron Ross was whistled for pass interference, ultimately leading to a Palmer sneak for a score. After the Jaguars punted the ball at the end of regulation, the Raiders tried to run out the clock. Mularkey called a timeout even though he didn't have enough stoppages to force an Oakland punt, so Palmer decided to attempt a long pass. He actually completed it to Rod Streater for 23 yards, setting up what would've been a record-setting 64-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. He was short by a few yards, but later nailed the game-winner in overtime following a Shorts lost fumble.    As mentioned, Jones-Drew hurt his ankle. He was on crutches in the second half, meaning "

   "comment":"Maurice Jones-Drew to score a 1-yard touchdown. The Cardinals, however, played smarter football after that, and eventually established a lead in the third quarter. The Jaguars didn't even score a single point after the Jones-Drew touchdown, allowing Arizona to win by double digits and cover the spread.    Carson Palmer entered this contest with 2 or more turnovers in 7 of his 9 games this year. He actually didn't commit a single give-away versus the Jaguars - officially, that is. Palmer tossed an ugly interception, but had it overturned because of a timeout ruling. He was also whistled for a terrible intentional grounding. However, he still managed to go 30-of-42 for 419 yards and 2 touchdowns, thanks to very little pressure by a terrible Jacksonville pass rush.    The bulk of Palmer's yardage came via Michael Floyd receptions. Floyd caught 6 passes for 193 yards and a touchdown - a 91-yarder that he caught on an intermediate pass and then took the distance, breaking 4 Jacksonville tackles in the process. Two other Arizona players tied Floyd with the reception lead: Rob Housler (6-70) and Larry Fitzgerald (6-61), who caught Palmer's other touchdown.    The Cardinals won this game, so they won't be criticized too much for their recurring mistake, but I still can't understand why Rashard Mendenhall continues to get way more touches than Andre Ellington. Mendenhall had 16 touches compared to Ellington's 10. The former turned his 13 carries into just 14 yards and a touchdown. Ellington didn't fare much better (8-3), but he's capable of going the distance on any play, so he needs to have the ball in his hands as much as possible.    Some quick Jacksonville stats: - Chad Henne went 27-of-42 for 255 yards, the touchdown to Noble and 2 very ugly interceptions. - Maurice Jones-Drew (14-23) scored, as mentioned, but couldn't find any running room otherwise. - Jones-Drew to score a 1-yard touchdown. The Cardinals, however, played smarter football after that, and eventually established a lead in the third quarter. The Jaguars didn't even score a single point after the Jones-Drew touchdown, allowing Arizona to win by double digits and cover the spread.    "
