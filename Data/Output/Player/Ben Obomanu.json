   "comment":"Ben Obomanu on third down. - Whitehurst was strip-sacked at the beginning of the second quarter, setting up the Browns for their first field goal. What also helped was that the Seahawks were offside on a 4th-and-3, giving Cleveland a free first down.    Given all that, it's a miracle that the Browns only pushed. They outgained Seattle, 298-137, and the Seahawks had just 9 first downs. So, what happened? Matvei, who runs the section, described it perfectly: <i> That Seattle push was 1 for the ages. They have to both block a field goal and then commit a moronic headbutt that allowed the Browns to kneel rather than knick another field goal. That took 5 years off my life. </i>    Some noteworthy stats: - "
