   "comment":"Obomanu on third down. - Whitehurst was strip-sacked at the beginning of the second quarter, setting up the Browns for their first field goal. What also helped was that the Seahawks were offside on a 4th-and-3, giving Cleveland a free first down.    Given all that, it's a miracle that the Browns only pushed. They outgained Seattle, 298-137, and the Seahawks had just 9 first downs. So, what happened? Matvei, who runs the Las Vegas Hilton Supercontest Sharps Picks section, described it perfectly: That Seattle push was 1 for the ages. They have to both block a field goal and then commit a moronic headbutt that allowed the Browns to kneel rather than knick another field goal. That took 5 years off my life.    Some noteworthy stats: - "

   "comment":"Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3, Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced fourth down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back Justin Forsett. Speaking of Forsett, did anyone else notice how many players on Seattle's offense have a Bay Area connection? Lynch and Forsett both were running backs for UC-Berkeley where backup tight end Cameron Moorah and reserve lineman Mike Gibson also went. Fullback Michael Robinson played for the 49ers, while starting left tackle Pat McQuistan, left guard Robert Gallery and tight end Zach Miller were drafted by the Raiders. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Doug Baldwin went to Stanford. Kind of ridiculous isn't it? In the third quarter, it looked like San Francisco was going to ice this game. The first possession went 74 yards on 8 plays, highlighted by a 27-yard pass to Michael Crabtree (5-85) on the first play of the half and a 17-yard pickup to Vernon Davis (4-54). Gore cashed in the touchdown from 4 yards out to tie the game at 10. The defense forced a quick punt and Kyle Williams had a big punt return for 36 yards to change field position and set the 49ers up in Seahawks' territory. Gore and Hunter runs did most of the work on the drive while Smith missed on his only pass attempt and scrambled for an 11-yard gain. An illegal block by Braylon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the fourth quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Aldon Smith registered a sack to force a 3rd-and-15. Jackson almost bailed Seattle out, hitting Obomanu a yard short of the marker. Carroll resisted the urge to go for it against a stout defense and wisely chose to play field position. It looked like a bad decision when the punt went out of the end zone and Smith hit Davis for 17 yards on the first play of the drive. Just like that, all the Seahawks had gained from the kick was 8 yards of field position. However, the defense stood tall from there, forcing a punt that was blocked by "
