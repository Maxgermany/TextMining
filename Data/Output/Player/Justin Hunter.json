He had a brilliant performance last week at St. Louis, but came back to muster 30 yards on 12 carries along with his 2 fumbles (1 was credited to Locker). He helped his PPR owners a bit with 5 catches for 43 receiving yards, but his inability to run on a crappy Jacksonville defense was highly discouraging.    I'm not going to spend too much time on the Jaguars, because who cares? "

Foster did the heavy lifting, totaling 151 rushing yards on 20 carries with 2 scores while catching 4 passes for 22 receiving yards and another score. Without Foster, the Texans would struggle to move the ball. The offensive line really struggled in pass protection, although some sacks were Fitzpatrick's fault.    Mettenberger completed 27-of-41 passes for 299 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He looked better in the 4.h quarter and should improve over the bye week without having to go against Watt in his next game. "

   "comment":"Justin Hunter and Bishop Sankey. Mariota had Kendall Wright open for a deep touchdown, but threw it short, and that allowed the defense to come back for a breakup. That was the only score in the first half. In the third quarter, Denarius Moore was stripped on a punt return by Jalston Fowler, and the Titans recovered around the Bills' 40-yard line. Mariota went to work with clutch passes to Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to Chris Hogan, who beat Coty Sensabaugh to get inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal, Taylor went back to Hogan on a sprint out for a touchdown and a 14-13 lead. The Bills' defense came up with 2 stops to clinch the victory. On the second 1. Mariota was pressured by Marcell Dareus into throwing a deep ball up for grabs that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore to end the game for Buffalo.    Taylor completed 10-of-17 passes for 109 yards with a touchdown. He ran for 76 yards and 8 carries and a score. He'll continue to be a solid starting option in fantasy because of his rushing ability.    The Bills' offense was without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins. Their top running back was Dan Herron (9-28), while Chris Hogan (3-52) led them through the air.    Marcus Mariota was 21-of-32 for 187 yards with an interception. He ran for 47 yards on 5 carries. He didn't play poorly, and the Bills' defense did a good job of bending but not breaking.    The Titans' ground game was shutdown by Buffalo as Dexter McCluster (8-20) and Bishop Sankey (7-20 rushing, 3-23 receiving) were unable to get in any groove.    Antonio Andrews led the Titans through the air (3-45). Mariota spread the ball around to Kendall Wright (3-29), Justin Hunter (3-38), Delanie Walker (4-36) and Harry Douglas (2-17), but all were limited by the Bills. Walker and Wright suffered injuries late in the game that are worth monitoring.    Titans defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Justin Hunter (2-25) were the other favorites of Taylor on the day. The offensive unit performed pretty well considering that it was missing its top 2 receivers, Sammy Watkins and Robert Woods, during the game.    The reason that the Bills lost was that they were unable to hold up on defense late. The unit just seemed to tire out and could not stop the Dolphins any longer. In fact, before the Bills' final drive, the Dolphins had outgained the Bills 178-6 in the 4.h quarter alone. Still, the defensive stars for the Bills performed well. "

   "comment":"Justin Hunter for a huge 64-yard gain. For the most part, however, Jones put too much air under his passes and too often stared down his receivers. Still, he offers more upside than Manuel at this point. The Bills will likely part ways with Manuel in the offseason, and I would be surprised to see him on a 53-man roster come next fall.    With the issues between the quarterbacks, it is no surprise that the receivers had a poor day for the Bills. "
