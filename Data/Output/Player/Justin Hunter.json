   "comment":"Hunter to take the lead for good. Locker remarkably went 94 yards in just 1:50 despite not having any timeouts.    Locker's favorite target has always been Nate Washington, and that was once again the case this week. Washington hauled in a whopping 8 balls for 131 yards. Kendall Wright was also solid (6-71). As for Kenny Britt? He dropped a pass early on and was booed by the crowd. He then suffered an injury on another incompletion.    Chris Johnson was effective, but didn't get very many carries because the Titans trailed for most of this contest. He rushed for 90 yards on just 19 carries.    As for the Chargers, this was a game of blown opportunities for them. For instance, Eddie Royal (2-34) scored a touchdown, but it was wiped out by offensive pass interference (Keenan Allen picked a defender). Philip Rivers was then whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty, which gave San Diego a second-and-goal at the 25-yard line. The Chargers made some other mistakes throughout the afternoon, including a hold as the team was trying to run out the clock late in the fourth quarter. However, no error was worse than a dropped interception on Tennessee's final drive. The ball bounced off Delanie Walker and into the arms of a San Diego defender, who let a potential pick fall out of his hands. Locker found Hunter a few plays later for the decisive touchdown. I'm also not sure why the Titans didn't have any safety help on the Hunter score, though it should be noted that Hunter pushed off. The officials could've called offensive pass interference, but kept all yellow flags in their pockets.    It's remarkable San Diego lost this contest considering that Philip Rivers misfired on just 4 attempts. He went 20-of-24 for 184 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had a second score nullified by offensive pass interference. Rivers couldn't really look downfield in the second half because 2 of his starting linemen - "

He had a brilliant performance last week at St. Louis, but came back to muster 30 yards on 12 carries along with his 2 fumbles (1 was credited to Locker). He helped his PPR owners a bit with 5 catches for 43 receiving yards, but his inability to run on a crappy Jacksonville defense was highly discouraging.    I'm not going to spend too much time on the Jaguars, because who cares? "

That was the only score in the first half. In the third quarter, Denarius Moore was stripped on a punt return by Jalston Fowler, and the Titans recovered around the Bills' 40-yard line. Mariota went to work with clutch passes to Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through fourth quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to "
