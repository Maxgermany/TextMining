   "comment":"Roscoe Parrish led the squad with 4 receptions and 31 yards.    Parrish made a great play in this game. On third down, he caught a pass 5 yards away from the first-down marker. I don't know how many defenders he juked, but it seriously looked like he avoided 15 guys to barely pick up the first down.    <b> Officiating: </b> It's been widely publicized that the officiating has been abysmal this year. Well, that continued in this game. The refs didn't recognize a Buffalo challenge flag that was thrown on an obvious drop by Wes Welker. Reversing the call would have put the Patriots in a third-and-six on Buffalo's 38. Instead, Welker's 21-yard catch held up, eventually leading to a touchdown. Later, a recovered onsides kick by the Bills in the final 2 minutes of the game was unjustly given to New England, despite the fact that the Patriots clearly touched the ball first. The refs, who were calling the game as if they had money on the Patriots, gave the ball to New England and refused to look at the replay.   "
