   "comment":"Treadwell was even less of a positive factor. He failed to haul in his only target, as he dropped it. The ball popped into the air and was picked off by Slay. However, Slay was called for pass interference on what was a very shaky penalty. This occurred on the first drive, and Treadwell wasn't heard from again. He's been a huge disappointment thus far.    The Vikings once again struggled to run the ball. McKinnon tallied 31 yards on 9 carries, most of which came on a 10-yard burst. He also caught 4 balls for 45 yards, which includes the 41-yard reception I mentioned earlier. "
