The pick effectively ended the game, as San Diego's defense couldn't get Denver's offense off the field.    Two of Rivers' scores went to Gates (5-54), while the other was thrown to "

   "comment":"Antonio Gates (5-34) dropped a pass, though Rivers paid him back by missing him for a potential first down.    The Chargers didn't try hard enough to establish the run. Ryan Matthews carried the ball only 11 times, tallying 44 yards in the process.    Mike McCoy made a very curious decision late in the game. Down 23-14, McCoy opted to punt on a 4.h-and-4 at midfield with about 5 minutes remaining. There just wasn't enough time on the clock. It may have been a good move down just 1 score - they forced New England to punt, after all - but the Chargers gave themselves no chance by relinquishing possession like that.   "

   "comment":"Antonio Gates drew a pass-interference flag. Rivers struggled mightily. He failed to get into a rhythm going because it appeared as though he was worried too much about the pass rush. The numbers don't look terrible - 24-of-41, 232 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks - but the Chargers averaged just 4.7 yards per play because of his mediocre quarterbacking. Rivers also nearly lost a fumble; it was initially called that way, but the officials ruled that his arm was going forward after watching a replay.    Rivers' 1 score went to Gates, who was able to secure an impressive, 1.handed catch in the second quarter. He led the team in receiving with 6 catches for 54 yards and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Antonio Gates (4-67) and Malcom Floyd (3-29).    Ryan Mathews was also missing. Branden Oliver and Donald Brown shared carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 71-39. Oliver also scored. Brown, meanwhile, was stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 try in the final quarter.    As for the Chiefs, they nearly broke their streak of games without a touchdown to a receiver. Dwayne Bowe caught a pass and appeared to cross the goal line, but fumbled. It was ruled that Bowe didn't score, but luckily for the Chiefs, Travis Kelce was right there to recover the ball for the touchdown.    Chase Daniel proved to be a true facsimile of Alex Smith, as he threw short, quick passes to his targets. Daniel was guilty of holding the ball too often on a couple of occasions and took some sacks as a consequence, but he was still able to complete more than half of his passes, finishing 16-of-27 for 157 yards and what should've been a touchdown to Bowe. He began the game 9-of-9 for 72 yards, but couldn't maintain his success, though some of that was because of a couple of drops, including 1 by Albert Wilson in the red zone.    Kelce turned out to be Daniel's leading receiver, hauling in 7 balls for 84 yards. Bowe was next with just 3 grabs for 30 yards. Wilson was a major disappointment, failing to log a single reception.    Another week, another game in which Jamaal Charles didn't touch the ball enough. Charles had just 13 carries, which he turned into 54 yards. He caught only 2 passes. I don't understand why Andy Reid wasn't utilizing Charles very much prior to this contest, but there was at least an explanation this week, as Charles hobbled off the field in the first half.    Daniel deserves some credit for this win, but Kansas City's defense was most responsible. Several defenders were awesome, including Houston. Husain Abdullah was also terrific; he broke up a potential touchdown pass thrown toward Antonio Gates in the final quarter and then stuffed Brown on a 4.h down. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Antonio Gates for a gain of 27 yards. A run by Melvin Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.

He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.    Neither team received a good game from its defense, but Chargers rookie linebacker "

As for Allen, this performance was a bit disappointing, given that the Raiders' corners had underperformed this season. Rivers spent most of the day targeting his tight ends and Melvin Gordon in checkdowns, so it really wasn't Allen's fault. Allen is a high-end WR2 most weeks, so he should bounce back.
