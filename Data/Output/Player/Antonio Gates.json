Would Shawne Merriman also have a solid performance despite playing with a shredded knee? As you can tell by Carolina's offensive output, not at all. Merriman rotated in and out of the lineup, and manged only 1 tackle. The Chargers couldn't contain the Panthers, much like they struggled to stop the Charlie Frye-led Seahawks in the preseason. Hey, I have the Broncos winning the division, so even though San Diego lost, the team performed better than I expected them to, given that Rivers and Gates looked sharp.    As for Carolina's skill players, "

   "comment":"Gates for a 6-yard score. Late in the second quarter, Royal made up for it with a big punt return across midfield. Tebow moved the ball down the field with a 2 good passes. He finished the drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker. In the third quarter, the teams traded field goals. Ryan Mathews broke off a 39-yard run on a pitch around the edge. San Diego couldn't finish the drive as Nick Novak missed a field goal. Denver had a promising drive of its own go for nothing. Tebow ran for a first down on a critical third down but a holding call canceled it out. He then threw a good deep pass to Decker just in front of the end zone, but Chargers defensive back Paul Oliver got away with a pass interference that caused an incompletion. On their next drive, Tebow hooked up with Decker for a 39-yard gain. It was a good pass and he made a superb catch. A few plays later, Tebow moved the ball inside the Chargers 20 with a 23-yard pass to Donate Rosario. The San Diego defense shored up and forced Denver into a game-tying field goal. The Broncos' defense came up with a clutch stop of the Chargers. A sack by Elvis Dumervil was the key play to kill the drive for San Diego. In overtime, Denver got the ball and got close to midfield before Tebow was stopped on a third-and-short run. The Chargers moved the ball into Broncos' territory and lined up for a 53-yard attempt. Denver blocked a field goal, but their head coach John Fox had called a time out, and the San Diego offensive line heard the whistle, so the Broncos busted through and blocked the kick easily. It didn't matter as Nick Novak missed the field goal on the actual play. Denver got great field position at their 43-yard line and finished the game in short order. Tebow ran for 16 yards on 2 carries and Willis McGahee ran up the middle for 24 yards. Broncos kicker Matt Prater made a 37-yard field goal to eke out another win for Denver. All game, San Diego's pass rush was pathetic. Tebow had all day to throw the ball on many pass plays. The Chargers' offensive line also struggled with the Broncos edge rushers. Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 3 sacks on the afternoon. Rivers was only 19-of-36 for 188 yards and 1 touchdown. Mathews ran for 137 yards on 22 carries. Gates had 6 catches for 50 yards and a score. Denver's play-calling is at best a work in progress. They don't mix in enough play-action passing. San Diego was selling out to stop the run and at the same time they couldn't get any pass rush. Tebow threw some good deep balls, and he is better at throwing deep than at precision passing in the short to intermediate part of the field. Tebow finished the game 9-of-18 for 143 yards and 1 touchdown. He also ran for 67 yards on 22 carries. McGahee had a good game with 117 yards on 23 carries.   "

   "comment":"Gates was called back by a penalty, but Rivers kept advancing the ball. He finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. San Diego then caught the Lions' special teams napping with an onside kick that was recovered by Eric Weddle. Rivers hit Floyd for a gain of 30 to the Detroit 3-yard line after he beat Chris Houston running downfield. Houston bounced back to break up a pass in the end zone on third-and-goal so the Chargers had to settle for a field goal. The Lions answered by moving the ball down the field and Smith running into the end zone from 6 yards out. Detroit was up 31-10 entering the fourth quarter. San Diego followed up with another promising drive, moving the ball down the field. However, Houston had another good pass breakup in the end zone. The Lions' stand forced a fourth-and-goal from the 3 that fell incomplete. Houston would kill another drive by intercepting a jump ball at the goal line. He returned it 43 yards and the pick sealed the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished the afternoon 29-of-36 for 373 yards and 3 touchdowns. Pettigrew (9-80), Johnson (4-102) and Nate Burleson (6-83) all had good games. For San Diego, Rivers completed 28-of-53 passes for 299 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Floyd (6-95) led the Chargers in receiving with Gates (4-40) contributing. He became the franchise's all-time receptions leader in this loss, passing Charlie Joiner.    It was a huge win for the Lions as they clinched their first playoff appearance since 1999. Congratulations to the long-suffering Lions fans who finally get to see their team play in the postseason after a long drought.   "

   "comment":"Gates later in the first half for 33-yard gain against Mark Barron. The veteran duo took advantage of the rookie again for a 13-yard touchdown. Gates had Barron beaten for another touchdown, but Rivers had a poorly underthrown pass to let Barron recover for the pass breakup. The Chargers took the lead just before halftime with Rivers throwing a fastball for a short touchdown pass to Malcolm Floyd.    The Bucs' defense held Rivers to only 3 second-half points. He had the opportunity for more scores, but shaky pass protection and improved play from the Tampa Bay secondary kept him from capitalizing. Rivers completed 29-of-37 passes for 337 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.    Alexander led the Chargers in receiving with 134 yards on 5 catches. Floyd (6-63), Gates (4-57), "

Manning took advantage by ripping the ball through San Diego's secondary, including a 28-yard, over-the-shoulder catch by Demaryius Thomas. The Broncos finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown. Thomas continued to dominate early in the second half as he took a screen pass 34 yards for his third touchdown of the game. San Diego's Tourek Williams came through with a huge play as he beat left tackle Chris Clark on a speed rush to get a blindside strip-sack that was recovered by Donald Butler at the Broncos 11-yard line. Rivers turned that into 7 points with a short pass to Danny Woodhead (6-27 rushing, 4-17 receiving). The Chargers' comeback attempt continued as Rivers dropped in a 24-yard pass to Gates and a pass of 30 yards to Eddie Royal (2-36) on a third-and-13."

   "comment":"Gates (4-67) and Malcom Floyd (3-29).    Ryan Mathews was also missing. Branden Oliver and Donald Brown shared carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 71-39. Oliver also scored. Brown, meanwhile, was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 try in the final quarter.    As for the Chiefs, they nearly broke their streak of games without a touchdown to a receiver. Dwayne Bowe caught a pass and appeared to cross the goal line, but fumbled. It was ruled that Bowe didn't score, but luckily for the Chiefs, Travis Kelce was right there to recover the ball for the touchdown.    Chase Daniel proved to be a true facsimile of Alex Smith, as he threw short, quick passes to his targets. Daniel was guilty of holding the ball too often on a couple of occasions and took some sacks as a consequence, but he was still able to complete more than half of his passes, finishing 16-of-27 for 157 yards and what should've been a touchdown to Bowe. He began the game 9-of-9 for 72 yards, but couldn't maintain his success, though some of that was because of a couple of drops, including 1 by Albert Wilson in the red zone.    Kelce turned out to be Daniel's leading receiver, hauling in 7 balls for 84 yards. Bowe was next with just 3 grabs for 30 yards. Wilson was a major disappointment, failing to log a single reception.    Another week, another game in which Jamaal Charles didn't touch the ball enough. Charles had just 13 carries, which he turned into 54 yards. He caught only 2 passes. I don't understand why Andy Reid wasn't utilizing Charles very much prior to this contest, but there was at least an explanation this week, as Charles hobbled off the field in the first half.    Daniel deserves some credit for this win, but Kansas City's defense was most responsible. Several defenders were awesome, including Houston. Husain Abdullah was also terrific; he broke up a potential touchdown pass thrown toward Antonio Gates in the final quarter and then stuffed Brown on a fourth down.   "

Rivers had no time as a result, as Dee Ford had a breakout game in relief of the injured Justin Houston. Ford collected 3 sacks and had many more hurries, as he basically lived in San Diego's backfield. Rivers went 24-of-43 for 263 yards and an interception, which wasn't his fault; the ball bounced off the hobbled Floyd. Rivers could've been picked several more times when he made some desperation heaves downfield on the final drive. However, in a gutsy effort, he managed to move his team to the 1-yard line, thanks to a third-and-14 to Floyd, a fourth-and-3 to Javontee Herndon, a fourth-and-10 to Gates and another fourth-and-10 to Vincent Brown, the latter of which occurred with 5 seconds remaining.

   "comment":"Gates - exit early to a standing ovation from a crowd that was comprised of a 50-50 mix of Chargers and Dolphins fans. It was a nice moment. If you're looking at this glass-half-empty, the Chargers' insistance on focusing on the past may have cost them greatly in the future. By winning, they lost out on the opportunity to draft Laremy Tunsil, the top left tackle in this upcoming class. Considering San Diego's glaring holes on the front, the team desperately needed Tunsil, but now it appears as though the Titans will secure him, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    Philip Rivers had an easy time delivering the ball to his open wideouts. He misfired just 10 times, going 26-of-36 for 311 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Rivers had a few poor throws. He was nearly picked in the end zone and underthrew an open Floyd for a score. One of Rivers' interceptions was heaved into triple coverage. Reshad Jones secured the ball and ran back to where Rivers threw it from. Jones then fumbled, and Rivers inexplicably recovered the ball.    Antonio Gates led the team in receiving with 6 catches for 88 yards. "

   "comment":"Gates fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Perry Riley with Reggie Nelson recovering for Oakland. The Raiders responded with Carr using Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree to move the ball down the field. Oakland was stopped on the goal line to settle for a short field goal. Promptly, Rivers tossed an underthrown pass that was picked off by Sean Smith and returned into San Diego territory, but Sebastian Janikowski missed the field goal. The Chargers got moving and Rivers hit Tyrell Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1-yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On fourth-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2-point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Chargers punter Drew Kaser had a 16-yard shanked punt that set up the Raiders at the San Diego 32-yard line, and the Raiders turned that into a short touchdown run from fullback Jamize Olawale. The Chargers responded by moving the ball down the field, and Rivers hit Gates on a short touchdown pass to close the Raiders' lead to a field goal. San Diego got in position to tie the game with a field goal, but Kaser fumbled the snap to botch the field goal attempt and ensure another Chargers loss.    "

   "comment":"Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a fourth-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. "

Rivers spent most of the day targeting his tight ends and Melvin Gordon in checkdowns, so it really wasn't Allen's fault. Allen is a high-end WR2 most weeks, so he should bounce back.
