   "comment":"Warmack. Penalties on Titans offensive lineman Rob Turner also took big gains away from Johnson. Locker completed 17-of-30 passes for 148 yards with 2 touchdowns.    The Texans have some cause for concern about their running game. Foster looks like he lacks a burst, and the offensive line wasn't opening up holes consistently enough. Although Foster played his best late in the game, Tate should receive more carries going forward.    The Titans got sacks from "

   "comment":"Warmack suffered an ugly injury as players fell into the back of his leg. He limped off the field, and hopefully the injury isn't serious.    Fitzpatrick had the best game of his career, completing 24-of-33 for 358 yards with 6 touchdowns. Hopkins also had the best performance of his young career with 9 receptions for 238 yards with 2 scores.    Watt continued to show that he is the MVP of the league with 2 sacks, 1 forced fumble, 1 fumble recovery, 3 tackles and a touchdown catch. The last defensive player to win the MVP was Lawrence Taylor in 1986, and Watt deserves the award for single-handedly putting the Texans in playoff contention.   "

   "comment":"Warmack to a knee injury that required him to be carted off. Mariota took a beating throughout, taking a whopping 7 sacks. It got so bad that he struggled to go to the sidelines during a timeout at some point during the second half. Mariota had an interesting sequence in the 4.h quarter that epitomized his afternoon. He threw his first incomplete pass if the second half at the 7:54 mark of the 4.h quarter. It was nearly an interception, and his next throw, which was released as he was hit, was actually picked, though it was negated by a hands-to-the-face penalty. After the reprieve, Mariota threw a pass behind "
