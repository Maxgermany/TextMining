   "comment":"Plaxico Burress and Dustin Keller.Burress and Dustin Keller. That would be a theme as well as he finished with 369 yards. However, the drive stalled. When the Jets quickly got it back, LaDainian Tomlinson made a dynamic run after catch good for 74 yards to set up a Sanchez bootleg run to tie it up at 7. Sanchez was asked to roll out of the pocket quite a bit, and while it worked early, the Raiders adjusted and shut it down. It was really an uneven game for him even with the big passing numbers. Rookie Jeremy Kerley returned a punt 53 yards only to watch Sanchez give it away on an interception to Tyvon Branch. The second quarter was a scoring frenzy. To be honest, I had trouble keeping up after watching the defensive struggle earlier in the day. Tomlinson caught a touchdown pass to put the Jets on top 14-7. Raider fans used to seeing Tomlinson in a Chargers uniform saw another vintage performance from him as he piled up 154 yards on 11 touches. McFadden answered with a few tough runs for 17, 15 and 6 yards to get Oakland just close enough for Sebastian Janikowski to try a 56-yard field goal. He missed, but it would set him up for later on. The field position allowed the Jets to drive and eventually kick a short field go to go up by 10, but it would be 2 full quarters before their offense scored again. In the meantime, the Raiders started working on offense. McFadden turned in a brilliant 70-yard touchdown run. On the next drive, Campbell completed short pass after short pass to march the team into position for Janikowski to make a field goal from 54 yards out and tie the game at halftime. New York head coach Rex Ryan could be seen shaking his head as his team walked off the field. This was not a vintage Jets performance, and although Tomlinson and Shonn Greene did combine for 97 yards on the ground, the running game did not come close to dominating like they have grown accustomed to doing in the past. Alternating punts chewed up the first half of the third quarter, as both offenses failed twice. Then came the turning point of the game. New York had a 3rd-and-2 from the Oakland 37-yard line. Two incompletions later, the 43-yard drive resulted in no points. The answer from Oakland was dramatic. On the play's third drive, McFadden had a pass option and instead ran left for 27 yards. Rookie phenomenon Denarius Moore then took a reverse 23 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. The Black Hole was rocking, and all of the frustration from a game with 4 penalties built up for Cromartie. He booted the return, and 2 plays later, a Michael Bush touchdown made it 31-17 to open the 4.h quarter. There was no quit in the Jets. A drive basically bookended by completions to Burress spanned 93 yards and resulted in a touchdown to make it 31-24, but it took almost 3 minutes and left just 5:33 on the clock. Oakland took advantage of a penalty on "

   "comment":"Plaxico Burress was also hit way late out of bounds on 1 play, but there was actually a call against Burress for a face mask for a simple stiff-arm to the face. Most prominently, 1 of Sanchez's strip-sixes was definitely a forward pass. Rex Ryan was so irate by the call that he used a timeout just to yell at Mike Carey. There was a ton of sharp money Sunday morning on the Ravens. If those botched calls had an impact on the result, I'd suggest that Carey, who also made sure Green Bay covered last week, was perhaps influenced by outside sources. But no, that couldn't possibly happen, could it?   "

   "comment":"Plaxico Burress 3 years ago. I thought it was funny. It's not like Burress shot anyone else. If you shoot yourself in the leg, you deserve to be made fun of. Nice job, Stevie - except for all of your terrible drops at the very end, that is.)    The cliche must-win probably fit for both teams here. The difference between 6-5 and 5-6 is pretty big in the competitive AFC wild card chase. It was tight to start, with the teams quickly exchanging punts. After another punt from the Jets, the visiting Bills went on an epic march spanning 13 plays and covering 90 yards for the opening touchdown of the game. C.J. Spiller, thrust into a featured role now that star Fred Jackson is on injured reserve, immediately became a factor. He had the ball in his hands 7 times on the drive and was bottled up other than a 13-yard reception. His biggest impact was when Brodney Pool grabbed his face mask for a 15-yard penalty early in the possession. Ryan Fitzpatrick hit David Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Burress 3 years ago. I thought it was funny. It's not like Burress shot anyone else.
