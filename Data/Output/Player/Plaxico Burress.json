   "comment":"Plaxico Burress was also hit way late out of bounds on 1 play, but there was actually a call against Burress for a face mask for a simple stiff-arm to the face. Most prominently, 1 of Sanchez's strip-sixes was definitely a forward pass. Rex Ryan was so irate by the call that he used a timeout just to yell at Mike Carey. There was a ton of sharp money Sunday morning on the Ravens. If those botched calls had an impact on the result, I'd suggest that Carey, who also made sure Green Bay covered last week, was perhaps influenced by outside sources. But no, that couldn't possibly happen, could it?   "

   "comment":"Plaxico Burress 3 years ago. I thought it was funny. It's not like Burress shot anyone else. If you shoot yourself in the leg, you deserve to be made fun of. Nice job, Stevie - except for all of your terrible drops at the very end, that is.)    The cliche must-win probably fit for both teams here. The difference between 6-5 and 5-6 is pretty big in the competitive AFC wild card chase. It was tight to start, with the teams quickly exchanging punts. After another punt from the Jets, the visiting Bills went on an epic march spanning 13 plays and covering 90 yards for the opening touchdown of the game. C.J. Spiller, thrust into a featured role now that star Fred Jackson is on injured reserve, immediately became a factor. He had the ball in his hands 7 times on the drive and was bottled up other than a 13-yard reception. His biggest impact was when Brodney Pool grabbed his face mask for a 15-yard penalty early in the possession. Ryan Fitzpatrick hit David Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker "
