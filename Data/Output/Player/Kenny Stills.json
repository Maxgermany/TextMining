Miami, however, didn't score a single point after that. The primary issue for Miami was the state of the offensive line. The team was missing its starting left tackle and top 2 centers, and it showed.

   "comment":"Kenny Stills, but he had been terrific in the second half, completing all 8 of his passes for 114 yards. The afternoon ended when Calais Campbell drilled Tannehill below the knee. Matt Moore stepped in, and the Dolphins went 3.and-out and hit a poor punt to give Arizona a short field. The Cardinals were able to come back as a result to tie the game, but Moore was clutch on the final drive. Moore completed 3 of his 5 attempts for 47 yards, setting up the decisive field goal.    Tannehill and Moore's heroics were crucial, as the Dolphins couldn't run the ball against Arizona's stalwart front. Ajayi managed just 48 yards on 20 carries, and 13 of his yards came on 1 burst. As mentioned earlier, Ajayi should've caught a touchdown, but Tannehill overshot him. Ajayi was also robbed of another score, as a scamper of his into the end zone was nullified by a hold.    Thanks to the conditions, only 2 Dolphins accumulated more than 15 receiving yards. DeVante Parker (2-14) was not 1 of them, as he had to deal with Patrick Peterson. Thanks to Tyvon Branch's injury, Jarvis Landry led the way with 4 catches for 103 yards, though he lost a fumble on a punt return. Kenny Stills logged 6 receptions for 97 yards and scored once.    With Tannehill out of the game, the victory was there for the Cardinals, and they managed to come back from down 21-9, but "

Only 2 other Dolphins caught multiple passes.    Ryan, meanwhile, had just a middling performance against a weak back 7. He finished 24-of-35 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick at the end of the game. The issue I had with Atlanta's game plan was that the team ran the ball so often on first down, putting Ryan in constant long-yardage situations. Ryan converted those in the opening half, but didn't have nearly as much success after the break. Prior to the final drive, Atlanta mustered only 45 yards in the second half!    "

   "comment":"Kenny Stills was 1 of the heroes during Miami's late-game comeback. He caught both touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, snatching 6 balls for 85 yards overall. On top of that, Stills made an acrobatic catch in the first half. Perhaps Stills will remain a big part of the offense when DeVante Parker returns, though his targets (9) will likely decrease. "

Jarvis Landry (6-95) also had a score, and he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Meanwhile, Parker (4-26) never really did anything positive. The Dolphins have been disgruntled with Parker's work ethic, so this type of performance is not surprising in the slightest.    Miami's running game had a nice pick-up with Williams' aforementioned 69-yard gain, but Williams didn't do anything else; he finished with 78 yards on 10 carries. "
