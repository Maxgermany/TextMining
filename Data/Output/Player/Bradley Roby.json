   "comment":"Bradley Roby broke up a pass intended for Reggie Wayne.Roby broke up a pass intended for Reggie Wayne. Denver escaped with a victory. It was shocking to see Luck fail on a 4.h-quarter comeback attempt, but there were 2 other major take-aways from this game: 1. Peyton Manning looked done in the second half. I never thought I'd be typing that after his brilliant first half - 16-of-22, 199 yards, 3 touchdowns - but he struggled to complete routine passes after the break. Manning was just 6-of-14 for 70 yards in the second half. He did endure a couple of drops, but he had receivers open and couldn't hit them. This includes a pair of major overthrows to his targets when he was trying to run out the clock near the end of regulation. I have no explanation for what happened. Manning was battling a defense mostly devoid of talent. He was so sharp prior to intermission, so I don't know why he looked like Josh McCown near the end of the game. 2. Denver's defense might just be able to carry this team. The Broncos did allow some scores late, but that was bound to happen against an exceptional quarterback like Luck. Besides, there were a couple of fluky instances, including 1 play in which the entire defense assumed Dwayne Allen went out of bounds when he tip-toed the sideline for a 41-yard, 4.h-quarter touchdown. DeMarcus Ware led the Broncos' pass rush with 1.5 sacks. The pressure he applied allowed Rahim Moore to come away with a pair of interceptions. Nate Irving (5 tackles, 1 sack) played well, but got hurt at 1 point. Roby, as mentioned, made the game-ending break-up on Wayne.    Wayne ended up leading the team with 9 receptions for 98 yards, but it was Allen (4-64) and "

   "comment":"Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to Khalif Barnes. He fumbled the ball to Denver at the Oakland 18-yard line. Manning quickly produced another touchdown with a slant to Julius Thomas (6-63). Another touchdown pass to Thomas put the game away. Carr soon threw an interception to T.J. Ward to set up the Broncos inside the Raiders' 15. Denver ran up the score with Manning throwing another touchdown to Sanders. In garbage time, Carr threw a touchdown pass to tight end Mychal Rivera (6-64), who quietly has emerged this season as a quality receiving tight end.    Manning finished completing 31-of-44 for 340 yards with 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Anderson had a huge game for Denver, as he ran the ball 13 times for 90 yards with 4 receptions for 73 yards. Demaryius Thomas (11-108) moved the chains, while Wes Welker (4-24) didn't do much.    Carr completed 30-of-47 passes for 192 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His offensive line was overwhelmed, and his receivers weren't getting separation. Oakland couldn't get the ground game going with Darren McFadden (7-14 rushing, 4-22 receiving).    Defensively, the Broncos got good games from Brandon Marshall (13 tackles), T.J. Ward (7 tackles, 1 INT) and Bradley Roby (4 tackles, 1 INT). <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Roby.
