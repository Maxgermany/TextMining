The team as a whole looked really unmotivated when Russell stepped in. The score at 1 point was 17-13, but once Russell started taking sacks and doing stupid things, the Raiders looked like they gave up.    Gradkowski was a more effective 10-of-18 for 153 yards. His knee appeared to get twisted on a tackle, but he was standing up and laughing on the sidelines, so it didn't appear to be serious. Unfortunately, it was later revealed that he has a partially torn MCL and will be shut down for the year.    "

   "comment":"Gradkowski led his team down to Arizona's 14-yard line. Sebastian Janikowski was faced with a 32-yard field goal to clinch Oakland's second victory of the season. Janikowski, to the chagrin to the undead, was wide left. The lesson, as always: Don't spend first-round picks on kickers!    Gradkowski completed only 50 percent of his passes (17-of-34), but threw for 255 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The Polish Point-Shaver showed a great rapport with "

   "comment":"Gradkowski to Jacoby Ford score.    Chad Henne started for the Dolphins. Though he didn't have Brandon Marshall, he went 17-of-30 for 307 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was terrible, but Henne was otherwise terrific. Henne was curiously replaced by Tyler Thigpen on a couple of plays in the second half and watched Thigpen run for an 8-yard gain. This really confused Gus Johnson and his broadcasting partner, who spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what was going on.    With Henne back and Marshall out, Davone Bess naturally led the Dolphins with 6 grabs for 111 yards. Meanwhile, Ricky Williams (20-95, TD) and Ronnie Brown (24-85) completely gashed Oakland on the ground.    Bruce Gradkowski, meanwhile, didn't play so well. He went 17-of-32 for 252 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. It appears as though the magic he had at the end of last year has fizzled out. Of course, Gradkowski didn't have much of a chance because of an anemic ground attack. "
