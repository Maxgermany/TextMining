The Polish Point-Shaver fired a dart toward Louis Muphy past the first-down marker, but the ball fell out of Murphy's hands and into the arms of a Texan defender. Gradkowski had a very solid performance, going 24-of-39 for 278 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions (the aforementioned pick obviously not his fault). He left the game in the third quarter with an injury, but came back shortly afterward.    It's evident that Gradkowski loves throwing to "

   "comment":"Bruce Gradkowski to Jacoby Ford score.    Chad Henne started for the Dolphins. Though he didn't have Brandon Marshall, he went 17-of-30 for 307 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was terrible, but Henne was otherwise terrific. Henne was curiously replaced by Tyler Thigpen on a couple of plays in the second half and watched Thigpen run for an 8-yard gain. This really confused Gus Johnson and his broadcasting partner, who spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what was going on.    With Henne back and Marshall out, Davone Bess naturally led the Dolphins with 6 grabs for 111 yards. Meanwhile, Ricky Williams (20-95, TD) and Ronnie Brown (24-85) completely gashed Oakland on the ground.    Bruce Gradkowski, meanwhile, didn't play so well. He went 17-of-32 for 252 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. It appears as though the magic he had at the end of last year has fizzled out. Of course, Gradkowski didn't have much of a chance because of an anemic ground attack. "
