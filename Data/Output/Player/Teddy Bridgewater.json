Jared Allen abused the inept Matt Kalil; it's astonishing how the former Pro Bowl left tackle has transformed into 1 of the worst offensive linemen in the NFL. It was so bad that at 1 point, Bridgewater drifted back 25 yards in the pocket on 1 play to avoid pressure. Bridgewater went 18-of-28 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was just a desperation heave into the end zone. However, the score occurred after the aforementioned fake punt, as Chicago's defense wasn't prepared.

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater battled against a hot team while going head-to-head with the top quarterback in the NFL.    It isn't a surprise that Green Bay got the scoring started with how well the team has been playing the past few weeks. On a third-and-10, Bridgewater battled against a hot team while going head-to-head with the top quarterback in the NFL.    It isn't a surprise that Green Bay got the scoring started with how well the team has been playing the past few weeks. On a third-and-10, Aaron Rodgers threw a perfect pass to Randalll Cobb (5-48) to beat good coverage from Captain Munneryln for a gain of 29. After a pass to Andrew Quarless (2-50) moved the ball inside the 10, Eddie Lacy dove over the top at the goal line for a touchdown. Minnesota answered with a nice drive that featured a critical holding call drawn by Cordarraelle Patterson (2-18) and a 4.h-and-short conversion by Jerick McKinnon (15-54). Bridgewater found an open Charles Johnson (3-52) for a 22-yard score after he ran by Tramon Willims to get open."

Bridgewater, who was woefully inaccurate at San Francisco, misfired on just 4 occasions, going 14-of-18 for 153 yards and a touchdown. Bridgewater's big gain was a 49-yarder to Peterson that he flipped to his running back as he was being taken down by a defender. Bridgewater's sole score went to "

He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns.

Bridgewater was stripped, allowing the Broncos to take over with barely any time left on the clock. The pressure disrupted lots of drives and forced Bridgewater to sail lots of passes out of bounds. However, he was able to put together some quality drives as well to give Minnesota a chance. Bridgewater went 27-of-41 for 269 yards and a touchdown. He also picked up 23 rushing yards on 3 scrambles, 1 of which was a converted sneak on 4.h-and-1 just shy of midfield on the opening drive. He made some poor throws in the first half, but was very accurate after intermission, connecting on 13 out of his 15 attempts. Unfortunately, his offensive line did him in and ruined a potential victory.    Bridgewater targeted 2 players 10 times each: "

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Bridgewater and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit.

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater out of the game. I said it when Williams was reinstated - it was a huge mistake to allow that maniac to continue coaching because his dirty tactics would lead to some valuable quarterbacks sustaining injuries. If Roger Goodell wasn't so incompetent and corrupt, he'd remove Williams immediately, but that's not going to happen.    In the first quarter of this game, the Rams scored a touchdown to cut the Vikings lead to 10-6. St. Louis decided to go for 2 and failed. Passing on the extra point turned out to be catastrophic for St. Louis as they lost in overtime. At the end of the year, if the Rams come up short for a wild card while Minnesota gets into the postseason, that play could end up being a pivotal moment in the season. Aside from the wild card, Minnesota is hot on the heels of Green Bay, but seeing Teddy Bridgewater knocked out of the game with a concussion could greatly impair the Vikings' efforts to pass the Packers in the NFC North.    The Vikings got on the board first with a field-goal drive as Bridgewater was taking what the Rams were giving him with short passes moving the ball down the field. That continued on the next drive, as Bridgewater moved it inside the 10-yard line before Bridgewater out of the game. I said it when Williams was reinstated - it was a huge mistake to allow that maniac to continue coaching because his dirty tactics would lead to some valuable quarterbacks sustaining injuries. If Roger Goodell wasn't so incompetent and corrupt, he'd remove Williams immediately, but that's not going to happen.    In the first quarter of this game, the Rams scored a touchdown to cut the Vikings lead to 10-6. St. Louis decided to go for 2 and failed. Passing on the extra point turned out to be catastrophic for St. Louis as they lost in overtime. At the end of the year, if the Rams come up short for a wild card while Minnesota gets into the postseason, that play could end up being a pivotal moment in the season. Aside from the wild card, Minnesota is hot on the heels of Green Bay, but seeing Teddy Bridgewater knocked out of the game with a concussion could greatly impair the Vikings' efforts to pass the Packers in the NFC North.    The Vikings got on the board first with a field-goal drive as Bridgewater was taking what the Rams were giving him with short passes moving the ball down the field. That continued on the next drive, as Bridgewater moved it inside the 10-yard line before "
