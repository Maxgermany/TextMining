He went 19-of-30 for 317 passing yards as well as 27 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Bridgewater made some great plays, including 1 where he juked to avoid a sack and rushed upfield to move the chains. He had the fans in a frenzy, who chanted, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! throughout the afternoon. The FOX sideline reporter said that Bridgewater gave her 2 thumbs up when he was being wheeled off, so hopefully that's a good sign. It would be a shame if Bridgewater missed significant time after this excellent display, albeit against a crappy defense. However, 1 of the few reasons Bridgewater fell in the 2014 NFL Draft was because some teams were worried about his durability. This might be something Minnesota fans will just have to get used to, unfortunately. Bridgewater opened the game with mostly short throws to "

   "comment":"Bridgewater. The Vikings' rookie signal-caller was constantly under siege. He was sacked only twice, but that's not indicative of how much heat he saw throughout the afternoon. Jared Allen abused the inept Matt Kalil; it's astonishing how the former Pro Bowl left tackle has transformed into 1 of the worst offensive linemen in the NFL. It was so bad that at 1 point, Bridgewater drifted back 25 yards in the pocket on 1 play to avoid pressure. Bridgewater went 18-of-28 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was just a desperation heave into the end zone. However, the score occurred after the aforementioned fake punt, as Chicago's defense wasn't prepared.    With Bridgewater struggling with time in the pocket, he couldn't connect with his primary receivers. "

It isn't a surprise that Green Bay got the scoring started with how well the team has been playing the past few weeks. On a third-and-10, Aaron Rodgers threw a perfect pass to Randalll Cobb (5-48) to beat good coverage from Captain Munneryln for a gain of 29. After a pass to Andrew Quarless (2-50) moved the ball inside the 10, Eddie Lacy dove over the top at the goal line for a touchdown. Minnesota answered with a nice drive that featured a critical holding call drawn by Cordarraelle Patterson (2-18) and a 4.h-and-short conversion by Jerick McKinnon (15-54). Bridgewater found an open Charles Johnson (3-52) for a 22-yard score after he ran by Tramon Willims to get open."

He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant.

Bridgewater was stripped, allowing the Broncos to take over with barely any time left on the clock. The pressure disrupted lots of drives and forced Bridgewater to sail lots of passes out of bounds. However, he was able to put together some quality drives as well to give Minnesota a chance. Bridgewater went 27-of-41 for 269 yards and a touchdown. He also picked up 23 rushing yards on 3 scrambles, 1 of which was a converted sneak on 4.h-and-1 just shy of midfield on the opening drive. He made some poor throws in the first half, but was very accurate after intermission, connecting on 13 out of his 15 attempts.

   "comment":"Bridgewater forced a pass in the end zone under pressure during the opening drive that was picked off. Right after that, the Chiefs had a safety in the end zone because of a holding penalty. It was somehow not ruled a safety even though all of the linemen were in the end zone. Minnesota dominated the play in the opening half, winning the yardage battle 193-51, with Kansas City recording just 3 first downs. The Chiefs managed to move the chains a bit better in the second half, but it wasn't enough. Minnesota was able to clamp down when it mattered most. The team forced a Charcandrick West fumble on Kansas City's penultimate drive, and Alex Smith went 4.and-out on the final possession.    Bridgewater moved the chains well overall; he had about 150 passing yards at the end of the first quarter, putting him on pace for 600. He didn't quite get there, and he actually became the first quarterback to fail to reach 250 yards against Kansas City's anemic defense. He was just 1 yard shy, going 17-of-31 for 249 yards and a touchdown. However, Bridgewater made a couple of key mistakes. I mentioned his first pick, which he forced despite being under heavy pressure. He tossed a second interception after halftime, which was another bad decision. Bridgewater looked good overall, but he'll need to clean up these sloppy errors when he starts playing better opponents.    It was odd to see "

   "comment":"Bridgewater and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3."

   "comment":"Bridgewater out of the game. I said it when Williams was reinstated - it was a huge mistake to allow that maniac to continue coaching because his dirty tactics would lead to some valuable quarterbacks sustaining injuries. If Roger Goodell wasn't so incompetent and corrupt, he'd remove Williams immediately, but that's not going to happen.    In the first quarter of this game, the Rams scored a touchdown to cut the Vikings lead to 10-6. St. Louis decided to go for 2 and failed. Passing on the extra point turned out to be catastrophic for St. Louis as they lost in overtime. At the end of the year, if the Rams come up short for a wild card while Minnesota gets into the postseason, that play could end up being a pivotal moment in the season. Aside from the wild card, Minnesota is hot on the heels of Green Bay, but seeing Teddy Bridgewater knocked out of the game with a concussion could greatly impair the Vikings' efforts to pass the Packers in the NFC North.    The Vikings got on the board first with a field-goal drive as Bridgewater was taking what the Rams were giving him with short passes moving the ball down the field. That continued on the next drive, as Bridgewater moved it inside the 10-yard line before "

   "comment":"Bridgewater was going to make a statement to silence his detractors. The narrative for Bridgewater thus far has been that he hasn't been able to step up against superior opponents. He fell flat on his face against the Packers and Seahawks, both of which occurred at home. The Cardinals were favored by 10 points in this contest, so many thought that Bridgewater would struggle again, but he stepped up and played well - until costing his team with a horrible mistake at the very end. Bridgewater opened the game completing 10 of his first 11 passes. He was on fire, constantly beating Arizona's ineffective blitz. The Cardinals didn't make any sort of adjustments despite this. They kept sending tons of pass-rushers, only to have Bridgewater find the open receiver almost every single time. It was truly remarkable that Bridgewater performed so well against a perceived strong defense, and it was equally astonishing that Arizona didn't change its strategy at all. Bridgewater finished 25-of-36 for 335 yards and a touchdown. He managed to come back from being down 20-10, and then he moved his team into field-goal range at the very end of regulation to perhaps tie the contest and send it into overime. With a third-and-10 on the Arizona 31-yard line, however, Bridgewater held on to the ball for an eternity, allowing "

   "comment":"Bridgewater put together an incredible performance. He was sharp all afternoon, slicing and dicing a Chicago secondary that had overperformed all year. He converted a key first down early on a third-and-10 play with a 12-yard pass to Kyle Rudoph, and then he found Stefon Diggs in the back of the end zone to cap off the drive, as the rookie wideout torched the normally beleaguered Tracy Porter. Bridgewater continued to lead successful drives throughout this contest, converting 8-of-12 third downs. He misfired just 3 times, going 17-of-20 for 231 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). There was a scary moment in which he was banged low on a dirty hit, but he turned out to be fine.

   "comment":"Bridgewater and Kyle Rudolph put together a terrific drive to move the team into short field-goal range. All Blair Walsh had to do was drill a 27-yarder after he connected on 3 longer field goals earlier in the contest. He whiffed, wide left, and it wasn't even close. And just like that, Minnesota's valiant effort in the third-coldest playoff game in NFL history ended in bitter disappointment. It's easy to blame Walsh, and he definitely deserves most of the responsibility for this defeat. However, Adrian Peterson needs to shoulder some of the blame as well. Peterson lost a crucial fumble in the 4.h quarter in his own territory that set up the Seahawks with what turned out to be the game-winning field goal. Peterson, of course, has a history of fumbling, so it wasn't exactly a surprise to see him cough up the ball. He did so at the worst moment possible, as the Vikings, up 9-7, converted a first down and appeared to be gaining momentum. The Seahawks had barely done anything offensively on the afternoon, save for 1 drive, so giving them a gift like that was devastating. Peterson, by the way, couldn't find any room against Seattle's stalwart front, mustering just 45 yards on 23 carries. He was taken off the field following the fumble, but only because Jerick McKinnon is better in the passing game. Mike Zimmer trusted Peterson enough to move his team closer into field-goal position at the very end, but it was all for naught.    Going into the game, I liked the Vikings to keep this contest close, but I wasn't crazy about it to wager more than 3 units on it because Teddy Bridgewater had never been primarily responsible for winning a big game. Bridgewater certainly played well, completing 17-of-24 passes for 146 yards in an environment in which it was incredibly difficult to air it out. Bridgewater played very well. In fact, he could've enjoyed a much better stat line had McKinnon not dropped a deep pass in the first half. If there's a silver lining for Minnesota, it's that Bridgewater took some major steps, especially on the final drive, which bodes well for the future.    Thanks to the sub-zero conditions and Seattle's terrific secondary, Minnesota's leading receiver had just 26 receiving yards. That was "
