   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater limped toward the sideline and was carted off to the locker room. It's a shame because Bridgewater had a brilliant performance in his first NFL start. He went 19-of-30 for 317 passing yards as well as 27 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Bridgewater made some great plays, including 1 where he juked to avoid a sack and rushed upfield to move the chains. He had the fans in a frenzy, who chanted, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! throughout the afternoon. The FOX sideline reporter said that Bridgewater gave her 2 thumbs up when he was being wheeled off, so hopefully that's a good sign. It would be a shame if Bridgewater missed significant time after this excellent display, albeit against a crappy defense. However, 1 of the few reasons Bridgewater fell in the 2014 NFL Draft was because some teams were worried about his durability. This might be something Minnesota fans will just have to get used to, unfortunately. Bridgewater opened the game with mostly short throws to "

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater on the other hand, didn't look sharp early, as the Vikings went to the air instead of pounding the ball on the ground with Peterson. But as soon as the running game got going, Bridgewater had a much easier time with a better pocket to work from. He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant. He was hurried and sacked all game, while his offensive line limped off the field seemingly every other play. "

Bridgewater was stripped, allowing the Broncos to take over with barely any time left on the clock. The pressure disrupted lots of drives and forced Bridgewater to sail lots of passes out of bounds. However, he was able to put together some quality drives as well to give Minnesota a chance. Bridgewater went 27-of-41 for 269 yards and a touchdown. He also picked up 23 rushing yards on 3 scrambles, 1 of which was a converted sneak on 4.h-and-1 just shy of midfield on the opening drive. He made some poor throws in the first half, but was very accurate after intermission, connecting on 13 out of his 15 attempts. Unfortunately, his offensive line did him in and ruined a potential victory.    Bridgewater targeted 2 players 10 times each: "

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs continued their hot play to lead a comeback road win in Detroit. Minnesota's front 7 dominated the Lions' offensive line, and Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. "

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater out of the game. I said it when Williams was reinstated - it was a huge mistake to allow that maniac to continue coaching because his dirty tactics would lead to some valuable quarterbacks sustaining injuries. If Roger Goodell wasn't so incompetent and corrupt, he'd remove Williams immediately, but that's not going to happen.    In the first quarter of this game, the Rams scored a touchdown to cut the Vikings lead to 10-6. St. Louis decided to go for 2 and failed. Passing on the extra point turned out to be catastrophic for St. Louis as they lost in overtime. At the end of the year, if the Rams come up short for a wild card while Minnesota gets into the postseason, that play could end up being a pivotal moment in the season. Aside from the wild card, Minnesota is hot on the heels of Green Bay, but seeing Teddy Bridgewater knocked out of the game with a concussion could greatly impair the Vikings' efforts to pass the Packers in the NFC North.    The Vikings got on the board first with a field-goal drive as Bridgewater was taking what the Rams were giving him with short passes moving the ball down the field. That continued on the next drive, as Bridgewater moved it inside the 10-yard line before "

   "comment":"Teddy Bridgewater was going to make a statement to silence his detractors. The narrative for Bridgewater thus far has been that he hasn't been able to step up against superior opponents. He fell flat on his face against the Packers and Seahawks, both of which occurred at home. The Cardinals were favored by 10 points in this contest, so many thought that Bridgewater would struggle again, but he stepped up and played well - until costing his team with a horrible mistake at the very end. Bridgewater opened the game completing 10 of his first 11 passes. He was on fire, constantly beating Arizona's ineffective blitz. The Cardinals didn't make any sort of adjustments despite this. They kept sending tons of pass-rushers, only to have Bridgewater find the open receiver almost every single time. It was truly remarkable that Bridgewater performed so well against a perceived strong defense, and it was equally astonishing that Arizona didn't change its strategy at all. Bridgewater finished 25-of-36 for 335 yards and a touchdown. He managed to come back from being down 20-10, and then he moved his team into field-goal range at the very end of regulation to perhaps tie the contest and send it into overime. With a third-and-10 on the Arizona 31-yard line, however, Bridgewater held on to the ball for an eternity, allowing "
