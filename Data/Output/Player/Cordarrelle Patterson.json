   "comment":"Cordarrelle Patterson dropped touchdown. Faced with a 4.h-and-14 on the Green Bay 17-yard line, Minnesota kicked the tying field goal. I don't get it. There were 4 minutes remaining in overtime, so the likelihood of the Vikings generating another long drive were slim. Thus, they were essentially pretty much guaranteeing that there would be a tie. What's the point of a tie for Minnesota? Green Bay doesn't exactly mind it because the team is now just half a game behind Chicago and Detroit instead of being 1 back with a loss. But what does a tie do for the Vikings? They should have just gone for the touchdown. It would've been a win-win situation. Had they converted, it would've energized the team to perhaps spark a late run that could carry over into 2014. A loss would improve draft positioning. A tie does neither.    The Packers were able to come back with Matt Flynn. I don't understand how Flynn can play so terribly elsewhere, yet thrive in Green Bay. Flynn wasn't great or anything - he went 21-of-36 for 218 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles and 24 rushing yards - but he was much more effective than "

   "comment":"Cordarrelle Patterson for a potential big play. Bradford finished 31-of-40 for 273 yards and a touchdown, as he threw quicker passes under new coordinator Pat Shurmur. However, this is just proof that stats can be very misleading. Bradford wasn't horrible, but he has clearly regressed since his hot start, and he needs to clean up the mistakes.    Despite the small amount of incompletions, Bradford endured some drops. "

Patterson had a long touchdown run on a reverse, and it seems like the Raiders are figuring out how to involve him in the offense. They also ran a razzle-dazzle lateral to Patterson on a pass play. He ended up with 60 scrimmage yards and could earn a bigger role if he continues to perform well.    <b>Final note:</b> "
