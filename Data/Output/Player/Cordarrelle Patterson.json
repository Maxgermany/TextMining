   "comment":"Patterson 109-yard kickoff return touchdown. The Packers converted 4 third downs, ultimately capping off their opening possession with a Rodgers touchdown to Jordy Nelson. Green Bay would end up scoring on its next 8 possessions, including a Micah Hyde punt return. Rodgers misfired on just 5 passes, finishing 24-of-29 for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which went to Nelson (7-123). He also had 6 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. It's amazing that he's so productive while throwing to guys named Jarret Boykin, Myles White and Andrew Quarless. Three other Packers had more than 2 receptions: Boykin (5-89), White (5-35) and Lacy (4-18). Speaking of Lacy, the powerful runner gained 94 yards on 29 carries. He's such a tough runner, as he broke numerous tackles and carried Minnesota defenders around. James Starks chipped in with 57 yards on 7 attempts, including a score of his own.    As for the Vikings, there will be more speculation that the concussed Josh Freeman will have to take over for Christian Ponder next week. Ponder wasn't terrible, but he's just not very good. His numbers - 14-of-21, 145 yards with 5 scrambles for 38 rushing yards and a score - aren't indicative of how he played. His rushing touchdown came in garbage time, and he missed several receivers, including an open Greg Jennings downfield. Ponder also had a potential pick-six that was dropped. Jennings, meanwhile, had a dreadful outing, catching only 1 ball for 9 yards. Ponder misfired to him on 1 instance because of a miscommunication. Jennings drew a bogus pass interference in the second quarter, but drew boos from the crowd following another incompletion. The only question: Who was jeering him? Was it the Minnesota fans who have been disappointed with him, or was it the Green Bay backers (there were many of them in the Metrodome), who were heckling their former receiver for foolishly choosing a bit more money over his career? Jennings whispered something into Rodgers' ear for about 2 minutes after the game concluded. Rodgers didn't reveal what he said, but I'll have all the answers in my NFL Power Rankings page Tuesday morning, thanks to my super-awesome spy skills.    Adrian Peterson managed only 60 yards and a touchdown, but ran violently. He simply didn't get many opportunities (13 carries) because the Packers controlled the clock and didn't give the Vikings a chance to possess the ball. Peterson also had 3 catches for 23 receiving yards.    Kyle Rudolph caught 4 passes for 51 yards, including a great leaping grab. Patterson, who had the aforementioned kickoff return for a touchdown, caught 2 balls for 26 yards.   "

   "comment":"Patterson dropped touchdown. Faced with a 4.h-and-14 on the Green Bay 17-yard line, Minnesota kicked the tying field goal. I don't get it. There were 4 minutes remaining in overtime, so the likelihood of the Vikings generating another long drive were slim. Thus, they were essentially pretty much guaranteeing that there would be a tie. What's the point of a tie for Minnesota? Green Bay doesn't exactly mind it because the team is now just half a game behind Chicago and Detroit instead of being 1 back with a loss. But what does a tie do for the Vikings? They should have just gone for the touchdown. It would've been a win-win situation. Had they converted, it would've energized the team to perhaps spark a late run that could carry over into 2014. A loss would improve draft positioning. A tie does neither.    The Packers were able to come back with Matt Flynn. I don't understand how Flynn can play so terribly elsewhere, yet thrive in Green Bay. Flynn wasn't great or anything - he went 21-of-36 for 218 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 scrambles and 24 rushing yards - but he was much more effective than Scott Tolzien, who was 7-of-17 for 98 yards and a rushing touchdown (that featured a crazy spin move) before getting benched in the second half. Tolzien was victimized by a James Jones dropped touchdown in the first quarter - though it should be noted that Xavier Rhodes made a good break-up - but that was the only thing Tolzien could possibly point to if he wants to blame something else for his struggles. He was very ineffective in this contest against an awful Minnesota defense.    Flynn may have been on the field, but Eddie Lacy was the 1 who sparked Green Bay's offense in the 4.h quarter. The noodle-armed Flynn opted to check the ball down to Lacy much more frequently than Tolzien, and the results were tremendous. Lacy caught 6 balls for 48 receiving yards to go along with his 110 rushing yards and touchdown. Those numbers don't tell the whole story though, as Lacy ran extremely violently. In fact, 1 of the FOX announcers exclaimed, He's throwing Vikings defenders all over the place!    Four Packers had more than 3 catches. I already mentioned Lacy. The others were James Jones (7-80), Jarrett Boykin (5-60, TD) and Jordy Nelson (4-58).    Lacy wasn't the only back who had some fierce runs. Adrian Peterson powered his way for 146 yards and a touchdown on 32 carries, though he lost a fumble at midfield in the first half. Toby Gerhart also looked great, tallying 91 yards on just 8 attempts. He was instrumental in Minnesota's game-tying drive in overtime.    Christian Ponder had an average outing. He let the ball hit the ground just 9 times, going 21-of-30 for 233 yards and a touchdown. He was lucky to get away with an interception, as Davon House dropped a pass thrown right to him. On the flip side, Ponder should've had a second score (the aforementioned Patterson drop) and he also saw another receiver (Jarius Wright) let the ball fall through his hands."

   "comment":"Patterson score in which he broke free following a reception caught behind the line of scrimmage. Once again, the Ravens should have been able to bring him down, but the defense disappointed. Just when all hope was lost, Joe Flacco hit a big pass to Marlon Brown for 35 yards. Following an interception that was wiped out by a defensive hold, he went back to Brown for a 9-yard score that was reviewed and upheld. It was Flacco's third and final touchdown of the afternoon, and it won the game for good. It was the fastest span of 5 combined touchdowns in the previous 50 years (2:01) breaking the old record (5:40) by a wide margin.    Flacco went 28-of-50 for 245 yards, the 3 scores and 3 interceptions along with a 22-yard run in which he somehow broke out of 4 potential sacks. Two of the picks were his fault. On the first, he had all day to throw, yet still hurled it up for grabs in Minnesota territory, negating at least 3 points. The second was also a poor force, but the third was the result of a Jones bobble. Jones, fortunately, redeemed himself with that kickoff return.    Flacco's touchdowns went to Brown (7-92), Pitta (6-48) and Ed Dickson. Flacco and Pitta had trouble connecting early on - the first 3 attempts were incomplete, and Pitta had just 1 reception in the opening half - but the tight end, making his 2013 debut, came alive after intermission. Torrey Smith, by the way, logged just 1 reception, though he did catch a 2.point conversion. Smith had trouble dealing with emerging rookie corner Xavier Rhodes, who missed some action late in the contest.    Ray Rice had the third-most catches for the Ravens on the afternoon with 5 grabs for a season-high 42 receiving yards. This complemented his decent rushing stats (17-67).    As for the Vikings, Cassel finished 17-of-39 for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, he had trouble sustaining drives in the first 3 quarters, but he played well in the final period. Having said that, 79 of his yards were all Patterson. Speaking of the rookie wideout, he continued to impressive with 5 grabs for 141 yards and the score. "

Foles was later picked off on an overthrow, which was followed by an unsuccessful 4.h-and-short try deep in his own territory. He also held on to the ball too long, helping the Vikings accumulate 4 sacks.    Foles still managed to post some awesome numbers, though a huge chunk of his stats came in garbage time. He finished 30-of-48 for 428 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick. He also had 41 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. His best play when this game was still in doubt was a 17-yard completion to DeSean Jackson that Foles somehow converted as he was getting drilled.    Jackson nearly had half of Foles' yardage, snagging 10 balls for a whopping 195 yards and a score. However, like Foles, most of what Jackson did came after intermission when this game was essentially over. At 1 point, Jackson had to be restrained on the sideline because he was yelling at 1 of the assistant coaches. Zach Ertz (6-57) and Jason Avant (3-40) had Foles' other touchdowns. Ertz's score was an awesome 1.hander.    LeSean McCoy didn't have a chance to run the ball because his team trailed by a wide margin early on. He gained 38 yards on just 8 carries, though he did have 5 catches for 68 receiving yards.    As for the winning team, Cassel finished with outstanding numbers, going 26-of-35 for 382 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception that wasn't his fault because the ball was deflected. Cassel endured some drops, so his stats could've even looked better. Again, Cassel was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. Or, perhaps, Philadelphia's defense was just bad.    Cassel's touchdowns went to Greg Jennings (11-163) and Patterson (5-35). It's amazing how well Cassel and Jennings have gelled, especially when considering that the other 2 Minnesota quarterbacks haven't been able to connect with the former Packer wideout whatsoever.    Starting in place of Peterson and Gerhart, the shockingly slow "

Bridgewater, who finished 15-of-26 for 157 yards, with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, managed to complete just 4 passes after halftime, however. Pass protection was a huge issue, as Matt Kalil was once again anemic. It looked like he just stopped blocking Buffalo linemen in some instances. He surrendered multiple sacks, which disrupted a couple of promising drives. He also negated a Bridgewater 15-yard completion to Chase Ford with an illegal-hands-to-the-face infraction, and he followed that up by surrendering a sack to Jerry Hughes. It's amazing how terrible Kalil has gotten. He needs to be benched.    Bridgewater's sole score, as mentioned, went to Patterson, who managed to catch just 2 passes for 9 yards. Jennings was the team's leading receiver with 6 grabs for 77 yards.    "

   "comment":"Patterson negated that conversion by lining up incorrectly. The play immediately following the penalty was Bradford's pick, snatched by Darius Slay. Stafford was also on fire in the early going, starting 8-of-8 for 69 yards. His initial incompletion was a Golden Tate drop. Stafford's receivers betrayed him throughout the afternoon. Andre Roberts dropped a deep touchdown after a Minnesota corner fell down. Marvin Jones also had a considerable gain wiped out when the ball slipped through his hands. Stafford finished 23-of-40 for 232 yards and a touchdown (as well as 30 rushing yards), but as you can see, his numbers should've been a lot better. The Vikings were able to stymie Stafford in the third quarter with some great pressure, but the Detroit signal-caller eventually came through in the clutch, as he's been wont to do this year.    Stafford's sole aerial score went to Boldin, who caught 7 passes for 69 yards. He trailed only Tate in that category, as Tate snatched 5 balls for 77 yards. Jones saw the most targets (11), but had a disappointing result - 4 catches, 54 yards - thanks to Xavier Rhodes' terrific coverage.    Theo Riddick gained 45 yards on 9 carries. A big chunk came on a 12-yard burst early on, so Riddick didn't do much otherwise. Still, it was an improvement over last week, when the Lions couldn't even gain 20 yards on the ground.    As for the Vikings, Bradford's stat line might look pretty good because of his completion percentage. He went 31-of-37 for 224 yards and the aforementioned interception. I'm sure some NFL talking heads who slurp quarterbacks will compliment Bradford for that completion percentage, but it's just further proof that stats can be very misleading. Bradford misfired just 6 times because he dinked and dunked most of the time. There were so many occasions when he settled for short passes on third-and-medium or third-and-long, which would explain why the Vikings were just 2-of-10 on third down. Minnesota's offense was just agonizing to watch. The team had just 1 completion of longer than 21 yards, and that was a 41-yard short toss to Jerick McKinnon that the spry running back was able to turn into a big gain because of a blown coverage. Take away that fluky connection, and Bradford would've thrown for just 183 yards on 30 completions, which is just sad. I don't completely blame Bradford for being a checkdown machine because he can't exactly trust his offensive line, plus Stefon Diggs was out. However, there times when Bradford had plenty of time in the pocket, and he still settled for 3-yard completions on a third-and-8.    With Diggs out, Bradford spent the majority of the time targeting Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen, both of whom drew double-digit targets. Rudolph hauled in 9 of 10 passes thrown his way for 64 yards, with the sole failed connection being a drop. Thielen, meanwhile, snared 8 of his 11 targets for 53 yards. He was also guilty of a drop. Patterson, who made the greatest mistake of all, reeled in 5 passes, but for only 15 yards. He also picked up 22 rushing yards on a double reverse. Rookie "
