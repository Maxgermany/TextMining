Then an incompletion to Young and a far-too-late completion to Johnson on the final play brought this 1 to a merciful end. The aftermath was far more exciting. Harbaugh was overly exuberant as he strutted over to shake Schwartz's hand. He gave him an obnoxiously hard handshake and patted, some might say shoved, him on the back. Schwartz took exception and kind of ran after him as almost everyone reading this has probably seen. There were way too many people on the field for anything to happen, but it was an interesting moment. Schwartz knows all about big celebrations with his punching motion deal he does, so I am not sure why he was so offended by Harbaugh's excitement. This was a big road win by the 49ers, who controlled this game with their defense. Rookie Mikel LeShoure might have given Detroit more of a running threat, but once Calvin Johnson was prevented from taking over the game, the Lions struggled to move the ball. It didn't even matter that Smith was 17-for-32 passing for just 125 yards. The 49ers also lost the turnover battle 2-0 and committed 15 penalties for 120 yards. Getting the ball twice on turnovers and picking up better than a football field in penalty yardage should be enough to win a game at home. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Got all that? The backfield tumult resulted in a very uneven rushing attack. If you look at the combination of Morris and Williams, they had a total 94 yards, but almost half of that (49 yards) came on each player's long run of the day. The meat of their carries produced an average of 2.81 yards. Atlanta's running game was similarly stagnant, but they went to it more to help balance the offense. "
