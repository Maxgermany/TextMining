   "comment":"Bentley committed a terrible pass interference on Andre Roberts in the 4.h quarter - his second of the game - setting up an Arizona touchdown. The Lions had 5 penalties in the second half.    Bush, who had the aforementioned fumble - though it was officially credited to Matthew Stafford - suffered what looked to be a serious injury in the first half. He grabbed the back of his knee, but eventually reentered the game. Bush rushed for just 25 yards on 9 carries, though he made up for it with 3 catches for 44 receiving yards. Joique Bell actually outgained him (8-31; 5-41).    As for Stafford, he went 24-of-36 for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns. He came out on fire, but the Cardinals made the proper adjustments and shut him down after intermission. He was just 8-of-16 for 68 yards in the final couple of quarters.    Both of Stafford's scores went to Calvin Johnson, which had to make his fantasy owners happy after they barely missed out on a couple of touchdowns last week. Megatron logged 6 catches for 116 yards despite Patrick Peterson's coverage.    Speaking of Peterson, he was used on offense on a few snaps in this contest. Peterson caught a 17-yard pass along the sideline and even tossed a 17-yard dart on a trick play to Kerry Taylor.    Carson Palmer had a pretty decent outing considering that Larry Fitzgerald wasn't 100 percent. Fitzgerald, who caught just 2 passes for 33 yards, wasn't even on the field during the final drive. Palmer went 22-of-39 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly interception that was made off his back foot and taken back 66 yards by DeAndre Levy for a pick-six. Not included in Palmer's numbers were 2 long pass interferences on Bentley and an incompletion that should have been ruled a catch. It was obvious that "
