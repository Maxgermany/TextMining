  "comment":"Takeo Spikes were both ejected because of a scuffle in which no punches were thrown. Spikes, who still has inexplicably not made the playoffs in his otherwise illustrious career, may have played his last game.    Unlike the Eagles, the Chargers played hard for their dead man walking. The team opened with a kickoff return for a score. "
