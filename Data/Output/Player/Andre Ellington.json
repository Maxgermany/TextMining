Late in the fourth quarter, Arizona tacked on another field goal to ice the win.    Palmer completed 22-of-31 for 253 yards with 2 scores and an interception. Larry Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for 21 yards.    The workhorse for the Arizona offense was Ellington as he ran for 88 yards on 24 carries with 6 receptions for 72 yards. He is really playing at a high level and allowing Palmer to serve as a game-manager.    Carr completed 16-of-28 passes for 173 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. He had some good plays called back on penalties and was better than the numbers indicate.    "

   "comment":"Ellington's numbers were minimal. He couldn't get anything on the ground against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 23 yards on 18 carries. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, he found the end zone once and snagged 5 catches for 19 receiving yards.    Some quick St. Louis stats: - Davis wasn't having a bad game prior to the Cardinals' avalanche. He was 8-of-10 for 110 yards and a touchdown in the opening half, but that's not indicative of his play, as he struggled with pressure. In his defense, no 1 was getting open. Davis finished 17-of-30 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and the pair of interceptions to Peterson. He nearly had a third pick at the very end - it was getting ridiculous at that point - but defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Ellington drop and a poor interception by Drew Stanton. As a result, the Seahawks prevailed, giving themselves a legitimate chance to win the NFC West, since they play the Cardinals again in Week 16.    Wilson went 17-of-22 for 211 yards and a touchdown to go along with 73 rushing yards on 10 scrambles. He took 7 sacks in total, including 3 from Calais Campbell. It's quite evident that Seattle missed stud center Max Unger.    Unger was also missed in the ground game. The Seahawks struggled to run without him at Kansas City, and that continued in that contest, as Marshawn Lynch mustered just 39 yards on 15 carries. Granted, it's tough to pound the rock against the Cardinals, but Lynch would've had much better numbers had Unger been snapping the ball.    Wilson's sole aerial score went to someone named Cooper Helfet. Neither Jermaine Kearse (1-19) nor Doug Baldwin (2-6) did much. Seattle's leading receiver was Ricardo Lockette (48 yards) caught only 1 pass.    As for the Cardinals, Stanton struggled mightily, going 14-of-26 for 149 yards and the aforementioned pick. There were some drops, including 1 by Jaron Brown in the end zone, but Stanton's passes were all over the place, and he was overwhelmed by Seattle's pass rush. Stanton missed Larry Fitzgerald, who couldn't recover from the knee injury he sustained last week. He had just 2 reliable targets as a consequence, and 1 of them - Michael Floyd - didn't haul in a single reception. Rookie John Brown led the team with 61 receiving yards on 3 grabs, 1 of which was an impressive, 32-yard catch made as he tapped his feet along the sideline.    Ellington couldn't run the ball once again (10-24), but he was a factor in the passing game, catching 5 balls for 39 receiving yards. He made a great snag on a ball thrown behind him for a gain of 15.   "

   "comment":"Ellington suffered a hip injury in the second quarter, but it's not like Arizona had much success moving the chains with him despite battling 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. They didn't even reach the red zone until the 2-minute warning in the fourth quarter!    Stanton finished 24-of-39 for 294 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 poor interceptions. Don't pay attention to the completions and yardage, as most of them came in garbage time. To illustrate his struggles, Stanton went 8-of-16 for only 128 yards and a pick in the opening half. Stanton could've been intercepted on several other occasions, including once where he carelessly flung the ball into triple coverage during the second half.    Larry Fitzgerald was out, but Michael Floyd didn't take advantage of his opportunities. He saw 10 targets, but reeled in only 5 of them for 53 yards. John Brown (2-40) also struggled, while Jaron Brown (7-75) led the team in receiving.

He lost a fumble and then heaved a careless interception into the end zone, staring down his receiver. Much later, whatever life the Cardinals had following a touchdown was sucked out when Palmer was responsible for a dumb interception into double coverage.

Late in the first half, Hoyer threw a pass up for grabs like a punt, and Antoine Bethea picked it off to set up the Cardinals at the 49ers' 30-yard line. Arizona tied it at 6-6 entering halftime. Early in the third quarter, the 49ers put up another field goal drive. Arizona drove into San Francisco territory before DeForest Buckner had a clutch sack to force the Cardinals into settling for a field goal. The 49ers answered again with a Robbie Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the fourth quarter.
