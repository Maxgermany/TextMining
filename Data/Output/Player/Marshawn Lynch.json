Nice job with all of those draft picks you accumulated by trading Jared Allen! It's too bad the NFL isn't like college football in terms of being able to schedule your non-divisional foes; otherwise, I'd recommend every non-AFC West team to pencil in Kansas City in the middle of the season. They're the ultimate cure for any offensive woes!    While Buffalo's offense was unstoppable - the Bills punted only twice - Kansas City helped the opposition score as well. Tyler Thigpen, who had been playing brilliantly until Sunday, threw 2 picks and fumbled once. Still, Thigpen was able to lead the Chiefs to 24 points (the final 7 came from Quinn Gray). Thigpen was 17-of-31 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Thigpen located Tony Gonzalez a whopping 10 times for 113 yards and a score. Dwayne Bowe managed 3 grabs for 58 yards and a touchdown. Mark Bradley chipped in with 52 yards and a score.    Larry Johnson rushed for 81 yards on just 7 carries. Sounds insane, but 63 of those yards came on 1 attempt.    As indicated earlier, Edwards' struggles were cured against Kansas City's pathetic defense. Edwards finished 24-of-32 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Lee Evans and Josh Reed caught 5 passes each. Evans had 110 yards, while Reed had 50 yards and a touchdown.    Marshawn Lynch, who also managed 5 receptions, gained 114 total yards and found the end zone once.    The 54 points Kansas City allowed represents the largest point total ever scored against this once-proud franchise. That's what happens when you commit 5 turnovers and fail to obtain 1 yourself. That's also what happens when your defense is still stuck on 6 total sacks on the year!   "

Mark Bradley chipped in with 52 yards and a score.    Larry Johnson rushed for 81 yards on just 7 carries. Sounds insane, but 63 of those yards came on 1 attempt.    As indicated earlier, Edwards' struggles were cured against Kansas City's pathetic defense. Edwards finished 24-of-32 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Lee Evans and Josh Reed caught 5 passes each. Evans had 110 yards, while Reed had 50 yards and a touchdown.    Marshawn Lynch, who also managed 5 receptions, gained 114 total yards and found the end zone once.    The 54 points Kansas City allowed represents the largest point total ever scored against this once-proud franchise. That's what happens when you commit 5 turnovers and fail to obtain 1 yourself. That's also what happens when your defense is still stuck on 6 total sacks on the year!   "

Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback "

FOX brought in Mike Pereira, who explained what happened. The officiating crew apparently forgot to charge Seattle with a timeout on a Doug Baldwin injury. The lead ref then announced that the Seahawks did, in fact, have a third timeout to use because the clock was stopped during the Baldwin injury. Pereira came back and then angrily said, That's not true. Just because the clock was stopped, doesn't mean there's no charged timeout. Some of the replacement officials did well this weekend, but these guys, as well as the 1. in the Green Bay-San Francisco game, were particularly atrocious.    The Cardinals moved the ball pretty well in the first half. Their offensive line held up shockingly well after being unable to block whatsoever in the preseason. However, the Seahawks seemed to figure things out after intermission. The Cardinals didn't achieve a single first down until John Skelton was knocked out with an injury in the 4.h quarter. Skelton started hot, going 11-of-17 for 124 yards in the first half, but was just 3-of-11 for only 25 yards and a pick after the break. However, Kolb stepped in and looked much sharper, going 6-of-8 for 66 yards and the decisive touchdown on his only drive. Kolb's score was pretty humorous because Ken Whisenhunt was running down the sideline, trying desperately to call a timeout. He has to be pretty happy that it wasn't granted. At any rate, Skelton suffered a high ankle sprain, but it doesn't matter at this point. Kolb will be starting next week.    Kolb hit Larry Fitzgerald twice on his only possession. Fitzgerald had just 2 catches before that, so he finished with 4 grabs for 63 yards. Andre Roberts (5-54) caught the touchdown.    The Cardinals couldn't run the ball at all. Chris Wells and Ryan Williams had just 14 and 9 rushing yards, respectively. Williams lost a fumble.    Russell Wilson went 18-of-34 for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception carelessly thrown into triple coverage in his debut. He ran a pretty conservative game plan, probably because Seattle's offensive line couldn't block the Cardinals. Wilson was sacked thrice, but he was constantly running for his life.    Wilson's score went to Sidney Rice, who caught 4 balls for 36 yards. Braylon Edwards paced the team with 5 receptions for 43 yards.    Marshawn Lynch started despite dealing with back spasms and still ran well, gaining 85 yards on 21 carries. He had some really tough runs, so it's a shame that his effort went to waste. Lynch carry.

But Ryan stepped up when it counted most - as he's done for most of this season. Ryan finished 24-of-35 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He had some shaky moments, particularly in the middle of the 4.h quarter when he failed to advance the chains, but his final completions of 22 and 19 yards to Harry Douglas and Tony Gonzalez, respectively, were absolutely huge for this franchise.    Speaking of Gonzalez, it was cool to see him crying after the game was over. Gonzalez, who tied Julio Jones with a team-high 6 receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown, just won his first playoff contest in his Hall-of-Fame career. Roddy White (5-76) and Jason Snelling caught Ryan's other scores.    As for the Seahawks, they probably would have prevailed had Pete Carroll not been guilty of some egregious errors in the first half. He opted to go for it on a 4th-and-1 inside Atlanta's 15, which I didn't have a big problem with until he called for a Michael Robinson carry that was easily stuffed. Marshawn Lynch wasn't even on the field for some strange reason. Later on, the Seahawks left points off the board when Wilson took a sack with about a dozen seconds remaining prior to intermission. I don't know why Carroll didn't have his field-goal unit prepared, but Wilson tried to run a play on 4.h down when time expired. Wilson's sack was his only blunder in what was an awesome afternoon for him. The dynamic rookie went 24-of-36 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception (on the final Hail Mary) while leading the team with 60 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. He was unbelievable after halftime, going 14-of-19 for 241 yards following the break. The Falcons simply had no answer for him, as he led his team to the end zone on all but 1 of his final 5 drives if the Hail Mary at the end is excluded.    It's remarkable that Wilson played so well when he didn't have Lynch assisting him. The stud back had an unusually poor outing, gaining just 46 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also fumbled in the first quarter to set up an Atlanta touchdown.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch struggled to run in the prior meeting, but he redeemed himself. He gained 97 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries. Conversely, Zach Stacy, who trampled Seattle in the first meeting, was stuffed at the line of scrimmage, mustering just 15 yards on 15 carries. It gets worse when you factor in that Stacy ripped off a 7.yard gain; this means he managed just 8 yards on his other 14 totes.    Clemens finished with a nice completion percentage (21-of-30), but as mentioned, managed just 157 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the 2 picks.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch touchdown. - Shayne Graham whiffed on 2 field goals, though 1 could be blamed on the holder, who set up the ball with the laces facing the wrong way. - Marques Colston dropped a 20-yard pass in the 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter. - Some of Drew Brees' passes fluttered. Others were knocked down by the wind. He didn't throw an interception, but only because the Seahawks dropped 2 possible picks, the second of which was very Auburn-like, as the ball bounced off 2 Seattle defenders and into the arms of Robert Meachem for a long gain. Brees was better after halftime, but he was awful in the opening half, going just 5-of-12 for only 34 yards.    Brees finished 24-of-43 for 309 yards and a touchdown to Colston, who had a big game with 11 catches for 144 yards. I mentioned the near-picks, but perhaps Brees' best play in meaningful action was when he resembled Russell Wilson, inexplicably squirting out of 2 potential sacks to find Colston for a 15-yard completion.    Jimmy Graham had an eventful pre-game when he ripped off Bruce Irvin's cap and then got into a shouting match with Richard Sherman. However, Graham didn't log a single reception until an 8.yard catch on a failed final drive. Earl Thomas did a great job of keeping Graham in check.    The Saints ran the ball well with both Khiry Robinson (13-57, TD) and Ingram (10-49). Robinson is someone to watch out for in fantasy next year; as the FOX broadcasters let us know repeatedly, Bill Parcells called Sean Payton during the week and told him that Robinson reminds him of Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin.    Speaking of Payton, he had some poor coaching gaffes in the second half. He burned a pair of timeouts, which was absolutely crucial, as the Saints simply ran out of time on their final drive. He then had Graham try an 48-yard field goal into the wind instead of having Brees attempt to move the chains. Sure, it was a 4.h-and-15, but Graham had zero chance in that spot. Even a punt would've been a better choice. Payton then wasted his final timeout when challenging what seemed like a sure reception on Seattle's final offensive possession. It was a big gain, but Payton simply couldn't throw the red flag there unless he was absolutely sure that Doug Baldwin dropped the pass. Payton also may have been responsible for Colston's desperation bone-headed forward lateral on the last play from scrimmage. Colston should have just stepped out of bounds following a reception to give Brees a Hail Mary try, but perhaps he was told to attempt a backward pass.    As for the winners, the big story for the Seahawks heading into this contest was Percy Harvin's return to the field. Harvin had a 9.yard rush on a sweep and made a 16-yard leaping catch, but his first game back turned out to be a flop because he was knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter on a fierce hit by Malcolm Jenkins. The Saints made it a point to hit him hard; safety Rafael Bush drew a flag for a shoulder shot to the helmet, yet the coaches high-fived him on the sideline. Roger Goodell can't be happy about that. Harvin finished with just 3 grabs for 21 yards.    Marshawn Lynch couldn't muster anything in the early going, as the Saints did a great job of bottling him up. However, he broke free for some big gains as the game developed, finishing with a franchise playoff-record 140 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 carries. Lynch appeared like he wore down at the end of the season, but he was in full Beast Mode in this contest. That obviously bodes well going forward.    Russell Wilson had some issues with his accuracy; he completed only half of his passes (9-of-18 for 103 yards), as some of his attempts were behind his intended targets. However, there are 2 things to keep in mind. First, the Saints have an outstanding aerial defense, as stud cornerback Keenan Lewis broke up several passes. Second, Wilson made a clutch, third-down conversion to Baldwin (2-30) on the team's final possession, setting up Lynch's second touchdown. Baldwin, by the way, led the Seahawks in receiving yardage. Harvin, meanwhile, was the only Seahawk with more than 2 receptions. Wilson almost definitely would've enjoyed a better performance had Harvin remained on the field. Fortunately for Seattle, he'll have an extra day to get cleared. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Lynch touchdown. - Shayne Graham whiffed on 2 field goals, though 1 could be blamed on the holder, who set up the ball with the laces facing the wrong way. - Marques Colston dropped a 20-yard pass in the 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter. - Some of Drew Brees' passes fluttered.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch a sure handoff on a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, allowing San Francisco to pounce on the fumble. Wilson finished 16-of-25 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He didn't do anything on the ground, rushing for zero yards on his 5 scrambles.    Wilson was credited with the lost fumble to Lynch, but it was the running back who was distraught on the sideline right after the play. Perhaps Lynch was to blame, and if that was the case, it was his only mistake of the afternoon. Lynch struggled to find running lanes in the opening quarter, but each of his carries seemed to wear San Francisco down more and more. Suddenly, his 2-yard gains turned into 8-yard rushes. He then broke free for a 40-yard scamper, which was Seattle's first touchdown of the afternoon. He ultimately rushed for 109 yards and the score on 22 carries.    While Lynch was strong in the second half - 66 of his yards came after intermission - Frank Gore couldn't get anything going throughout. Gore mustered just 14 yards on 11 carries. He had a 9-yard scamper, so take that away and he had a pathetic line of 10-5.    As mentioned, Wilson's lone touchdown went to Kearse (2-44). Baldwin led all Seahawks in receiving yardage, catching 6 balls for 106 yards. Golden Tate (4-31) and Zach Miller (3-25) were the only other Seattle players with more than 2 receptions.    Kaepernick's aerial score, once again, was thrown to Boldin (5-53), who had 2 drops in this contest. Vernon Davis managed just 2 catches for 16 yards, while Crabtree (4-52) never had a chance for the game-winning touchdown because Sherman tipped the pass away. Sherman was then flagged for taunting Crabtree, giving the throat-slash gesture. And if that wasn't completely over the top, he shrieked at Erin Andrews in the post-game interview, exclaiming that he was the best cornerback in the NFL and that Crabtree was just a mediocre at best receiver.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch. A 36-yard pass interference penalty on D.J. Hayden set up the Seahawks at the Raiders' 6-yard line. Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker Bruce Irvin tipped a pass up in the air. He came down with the ball and sprinted down the field for a 35-yard touchdown. Carr gave the ball right back as Richard Sherman picked off a back-shoulder throw intended for Andre Holmes (2-28). That spotted Seattle a field goal. Just before the half, the Seahawks drove down the field again. They were aided by a taunting penalty on Hayden, and Lynch scored from 5 yards out. The Seahawks had a 24-3 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Hayden dropped an interception that should have been a pick-six as he jumped a route. On the very next play though, Denico Autry blocked a punt and the ball rolled about 25 yards into the end zone before Brice Butler recovered it for a touchdown. The Raiders got going with a punt return by T.J. Carrie to the Seahawks' 30-yard line. A 23-yard pass to McFadden moved the ball inside the 10. On 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, Mychal Rivera (8-38) made a tremendous leaping catch for a touchdown. And just like that, Oakland was surprisingly down by just 7. The Seahawks responded with a 39-yard pass play to Lynch, who rumbled down the field, but the drive stalled, and Seattle had to settle for a field goal. Doug Baldwin then returned a punt 38 yards. Wilson scampered for 19 to convert a third down to set up another field goal. The Raiders got a drive going thanks to a face mask on Michael Bennett and a pass to Maurice Jones-Drew inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal just after the 2-minute warning, Carr connected with Rivera (8-38) for another touchdown off a play-action bootleg. It was close, but Seattle recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.    Wilson finished completing 17-of-35 passes for 179 yards. Marshawn Lynch had a huge day as Seattle's leading rusher with 21 carries for 67 yards and was the leading receiver with 5 receptions for 76 yards. The Seahawks' receivers gave them very little, as Doug Baldwin (5-38), Lynch. A 36-yard pass interference penalty on D.J. Hayden set up the Seahawks at the Raiders' 6-yard line. Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch caught a 4.h-and-1 pass to move inside the Chicago 20. Two fade pass attempts at Chicago cornerback Alan Ball came up short as Ball slapped the passes away from Graham and Rishard Matthews. A field goal closed the first half to give Seattle a 6-0 lead at the half. To open the second half, rookie speedster Tyler Lockett took the kickoff back 105 yards for a touchdown. A 21-yard run by Thomas Rawls got the Seahawks moving, and a 22-yard pass to Doug Baldwin got them to the Chicago 30. Wilson hit Graham on a crossing route, and he broke a tackle from Brock Vereen to charge into the end zone for Seattle. With a 20-0 lead, the game was essentially over. The Seahawks' offense found their groove with Rawls running for 18 yards, Kearse hauling in an 18-yarder, and Wilson running for 13 yards. That led to another Seattle field goal. A 4.h-and-short pass to Graham moved the chains, and that set up a final 48-yard field goal for Steven Hauschka.    Russell Wilson completed 20-of-30 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 28 yards on 6 carries. He remains an every-week starter because of his scrambling ability.    Marshawn Lynch played injured and had only 14 yards on 5 carries. Rawls totaled 104 yards on 16 carries. Rawls will be someone to monitor if Lynch misses time in the future. His absence in this game seemed like a precaution.    Jimmy Graham had his best game as a Seahawk with 7 receptions for 83 yards and a score. Hope you were able to buy him low. If so, time to sell him high!    Bears quarterback "

Following that was a possession that saw Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper drop passes, with the instances sandwiching a holding penalty that negated a first down. Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a "
