Nice job with all of those draft picks you accumulated by trading Jared Allen! It's too bad the NFL isn't like college football in terms of being able to schedule your non-divisional foes; otherwise, I'd recommend every non-AFC West team to pencil in Kansas City in the middle of the season. They're the ultimate cure for any offensive woes!    While Buffalo's offense was unstoppable - the Bills punted only twice - Kansas City helped the opposition score as well. Tyler Thigpen, who had been playing brilliantly until Sunday, threw 2 picks and fumbled once. Still, Thigpen was able to lead the Chiefs to 24 points (the final 7 came from Quinn Gray). Thigpen was 17-of-31 for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Thigpen located Tony Gonzalez a whopping 10 times for 113 yards and a score. Dwayne Bowe managed 3 grabs for 58 yards and a touchdown. Mark Bradley chipped in with 52 yards and a score.    Larry Johnson rushed for 81 yards on just 7 carries. Sounds insane, but 63 of those yards came on 1 attempt.    As indicated earlier, Edwards' struggles were cured against Kansas City's pathetic defense. Edwards finished 24-of-32 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Lee Evans and Josh Reed caught 5 passes each. Evans had 110 yards, while Reed had 50 yards and a touchdown.    Marshawn Lynch, who also managed 5 receptions, gained 114 total yards and found the end zone once.    The 54 points Kansas City allowed represents the largest point total ever scored against this once-proud franchise. That's what happens when you commit 5 turnovers and fail to obtain 1 yourself. That's also what happens when your defense is still stuck on 6 total sacks on the year!   "

All of Lynch's carries came in the first half. I predicted that Dick Jauron would make a dumb choice by going to the inferior Lynch over Jackson, and I was correct. But I'm not going to take any credit; it was an easy call because Jauron can't make simple and obvious decisions, and doesn't know how to be a head coach in the NFL.    With no protection and a large deficit to come back from, "

The reason it was so close is because out of 7 trips to the red zone, Seattle came up with just 1 touchdown. The Seahawks also committed 10 penalties. It could have been a lot worse for Arizona.    One thing we learned in this contest is that Williams is a stud. Finally living up to expectations, Williams hauled in 11 passes for 87 yards and a touchdown.    Another thing is that Seattle's pass protection still stinks. "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch carry. This enraged the Cardinal players, who looked like they wanted to punch the refs. A 10-minute delay ensued. The crowd booed mercilessly. FOX brought in Mike Pereira, who explained what happened. The officiating crew apparently forgot to charge Seattle with a timeout on a Doug Baldwin injury. The lead ref then announced that the Seahawks did, in fact, have a third timeout to use because the clock was stopped during the Baldwin injury. Pereira came back and then angrily said, That's not true. Just because the clock was stopped, doesn't mean there's no charged timeout. Some of the replacement officials did well this weekend, but these guys, as well as the 1. in the Green Bay-San Francisco game, were particularly atrocious.    The Cardinals moved the ball pretty well in the first half. Their offensive line held up shockingly well after being unable to block whatsoever in the preseason. However, the Seahawks seemed to figure things out after intermission. The Cardinals didn't achieve a single first down until John Skelton was knocked out with an injury in the 4.h quarter. Skelton started hot, going 11-of-17 for 124 yards in the first half, but was just 3-of-11 for only 25 yards and a pick after the break. However, Kolb stepped in and looked much sharper, going 6-of-8 for 66 yards and the decisive touchdown on his only drive. Kolb's score was pretty humorous because Ken Whisenhunt was running down the sideline, trying desperately to call a timeout. He has to be pretty happy that it wasn't granted. At any rate, Skelton suffered a high ankle sprain, but it doesn't matter at this point. Kolb will be starting next week.    Kolb hit Larry Fitzgerald twice on his only possession. Fitzgerald had just 2 catches before that, so he finished with 4 grabs for 63 yards. Andre Roberts (5-54) caught the touchdown.    The Cardinals couldn't run the ball at all. Chris Wells and Ryan Williams had just 14 and 9 rushing yards, respectively. Williams lost a fumble.    Russell Wilson went 18-of-34 for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception carelessly thrown into triple coverage in his debut. He ran a pretty conservative game plan, probably because Seattle's offensive line couldn't block the Cardinals. Wilson was sacked thrice, but he was constantly running for his life.    Wilson's score went to Sidney Rice, who caught 4 balls for 36 yards. Braylon Edwards paced the team with 5 receptions for 43 yards.    Marshawn Lynch started despite dealing with back spasms and still ran well, gaining 85 yards on 21 carries. He had some really tough runs, so it's a shame that his effort went to waste. "

Russell Wilson was very economical, going 19-of-25 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. I mentioned his awful pick-six.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch broke the plane of the goal line, which gave Seattle a 28-27 lead, it was assumed that Atlanta would once again would be 1.and-done in the playoffs. But Ryan stepped up when it counted most - as he's done for most of this season. Ryan finished 24-of-35 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He had some shaky moments, particularly in the middle of the 4.h quarter when he failed to advance the chains, but his final completions of 22 and 19 yards to Harry Douglas and Tony Gonzalez, respectively, were absolutely huge for this franchise.    Speaking of Gonzalez, it was cool to see him crying after the game was over. Gonzalez, who tied Julio Jones with a team-high 6 receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown, just won his first playoff contest in his Hall-of-Fame career. Roddy White (5-76) and Jason Snelling caught Ryan's other scores.    As for the Seahawks, they probably would have prevailed had Pete Carroll not been guilty of some egregious errors in the first half. He opted to go for it on a 4th-and-1 inside Atlanta's 15, which I didn't have a big problem with until he called for a Michael Robinson carry that was easily stuffed. Marshawn Lynch wasn't even on the field for some strange reason. Later on, the Seahawks left points off the board when Wilson took a sack with about a dozen seconds remaining prior to intermission. I don't know why Carroll didn't have his field-goal unit prepared, but Wilson tried to run a play on 4.h down when time expired. Wilson's sack was his only blunder in what was an awesome afternoon for him. The dynamic rookie went 24-of-36 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception (on the final Hail Mary) while leading the team with 60 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. He was unbelievable after halftime, going 14-of-19 for 241 yards following the break. The Falcons simply had no answer for him, as he led his team to the end zone on all but 1 of his final 5 drives if the Hail Mary at the end is excluded.    It's remarkable that Wilson played so well when he didn't have Lynch assisting him. The stud back had an unusually poor outing, gaining just 46 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also fumbled in the first quarter to set up an Atlanta touchdown.    Some of the skill players who stepped up were "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch disappointed his fantasy owners in their championship. He rushed for 71 yards on 18 carries. He just missed out on a couple of touchdowns, but was tackled just shy of the end zone.    I wrote earlier that the officials screwed the Seahawks with 2 horrible calls, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the zebras tried to do the same thing to the Cardinals. Arizona blocked an extra point that would've given Seattle the lead in the 4.h quarter, but it was ruled that the player who blocked the kick lined up over the center, which was the incorrect ruling.

It gets worse when you factor in that Stacy ripped off a 7.yard gain; this means he managed just 8 yards on his other 14 totes.    Clemens finished with a nice completion percentage (21-of-30), but as mentioned, managed just 157 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the 2 picks.

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch touchdown. - Shayne Graham whiffed on 2 field goals, though 1 could be blamed on the holder, who set up the ball with the laces facing the wrong way. - Marques Colston dropped a 20-yard pass in the 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter. - Some of Drew Brees' passes fluttered. Others were knocked down by the wind. He didn't throw an interception, but only because the Seahawks dropped 2 possible picks, the second of which was very Auburn-like, as the ball bounced off 2 Seattle defenders and into the arms of Robert Meachem for a long gain. Brees was better after halftime, but he was awful in the opening half, going just 5-of-12 for only 34 yards.    Brees finished 24-of-43 for 309 yards and a touchdown to Colston, who had a big game with 11 catches for 144 yards. I mentioned the near-picks, but perhaps Brees' best play in meaningful action was when he resembled Russell Wilson, inexplicably squirting out of 2 potential sacks to find Colston for a 15-yard completion.    Jimmy Graham had an eventful pre-game when he ripped off Bruce Irvin's cap and then got into a shouting match with Richard Sherman. However, Graham didn't log a single reception until an 8.yard catch on a failed final drive. Earl Thomas did a great job of keeping Graham in check.    The Saints ran the ball well with both Khiry Robinson (13-57, TD) and Ingram (10-49). Robinson is someone to watch out for in fantasy next year; as the FOX broadcasters let us know repeatedly, Bill Parcells called Sean Payton during the week and told him that Robinson reminds him of Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin.    Speaking of Payton, he had some poor coaching gaffes in the second half. He burned a pair of timeouts, which was absolutely crucial, as the Saints simply ran out of time on their final drive. He then had Graham try an 48-yard field goal into the wind instead of having Brees attempt to move the chains. Sure, it was a 4.h-and-15, but Graham had zero chance in that spot. Even a punt would've been a better choice. Payton then wasted his final timeout when challenging what seemed like a sure reception on Seattle's final offensive possession. It was a big gain, but Payton simply couldn't throw the red flag there unless he was absolutely sure that Doug Baldwin dropped the pass. Payton also may have been responsible for Colston's desperation bone-headed forward lateral on the last play from scrimmage. Colston should have just stepped out of bounds following a reception to give Brees a Hail Mary try, but perhaps he was told to attempt a backward pass.    As for the winners, the big story for the Seahawks heading into this contest was Percy Harvin's return to the field. Harvin had a 9.yard rush on a sweep and made a 16-yard leaping catch, but his first game back turned out to be a flop because he was knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter on a fierce hit by Malcolm Jenkins. The Saints made it a point to hit him hard; safety Rafael Bush drew a flag for a shoulder shot to the helmet, yet the coaches high-fived him on the sideline. Roger Goodell can't be happy about that. Harvin finished with just 3 grabs for 21 yards.    Marshawn Lynch couldn't muster anything in the early going, as the Saints did a great job of bottling him up. However, he broke free for some big gains as the game developed, finishing with a franchise playoff-record 140 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 carries. Lynch appeared like he wore down at the end of the season, but he was in full Beast Mode in this contest. That obviously bodes well going forward.    Russell Wilson had some issues with his accuracy; he completed only half of his passes (9-of-18 for 103 yards), as some of his attempts were behind his intended targets. However, there are 2 things to keep in mind. First, the Saints have an outstanding aerial defense, as stud cornerback Keenan Lewis broke up several passes. Second, Wilson made a clutch, third-down conversion to Baldwin (2-30) on the team's final possession, setting up Lynch's second touchdown. Baldwin, by the way, led the Seahawks in receiving yardage. Harvin, meanwhile, was the only Seahawk with more than 2 receptions. Wilson almost definitely would've enjoyed a better performance had Harvin remained on the field. Fortunately for Seattle, he'll have an extra day to get cleared. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch a sure handoff on a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, allowing San Francisco to pounce on the fumble. Wilson finished 16-of-25 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He didn't do anything on the ground, rushing for zero yards on his 5 scrambles.    Wilson was credited with the lost fumble to Lynch, but it was the running back who was distraught on the sideline right after the play. Perhaps Lynch was to blame, and if that was the case, it was his only mistake of the afternoon. Lynch struggled to find running lanes in the opening quarter, but each of his carries seemed to wear San Francisco down more and more. Suddenly, his 2-yard gains turned into 8-yard rushes. He then broke free for a 40-yard scamper, which was Seattle's first touchdown of the afternoon. He ultimately rushed for 109 yards and the score on 22 carries.    While Lynch was strong in the second half - 66 of his yards came after intermission - Frank Gore couldn't get anything going throughout. Gore mustered just 14 yards on 11 carries. He had a 9-yard scamper, so take that away and he had a pathetic line of 10-5.    As mentioned, Wilson's lone touchdown went to Kearse (2-44). Baldwin led all Seahawks in receiving yardage, catching 6 balls for 106 yards. Golden Tate (4-31) and Zach Miller (3-25) were the only other Seattle players with more than 2 receptions.    Kaepernick's aerial score, once again, was thrown to Boldin (5-53), who had 2 drops in this contest. Vernon Davis managed just 2 catches for 16 yards, while Crabtree (4-52) never had a chance for the game-winning touchdown because Sherman tipped the pass away. Sherman was then flagged for taunting Crabtree, giving the throat-slash gesture. And if that wasn't completely over the top, he shrieked at Erin Andrews in the post-game interview, exclaiming that he was the best cornerback in the NFL and that Crabtree was just a mediocre at best receiver. This prompted the following ridiculous feedback on Twitter :   "

Lockette (2-38) and fullback Derrick Coleman (1-15) were the 2 Seattle players who caught Wilson's touchdowns. Zach Miller led everyone but Harvin with 3 grabs for 42 yards. His highlight was an excellent diving catch that made everyone realize he was still in the league.    Marshawn Lynch looked awesome against the Packers. It was if he had didn't have any offseason issues at all. He nimbly eluded tacklers all evening, rushing for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. Forum member Body Burner, who was over watching the game, asked me if I regretted listing Lynch as a . I don't. I never doubted Lynch's talent; my issue with him is that the workload he's shouldered over the past few years will cause him to miss some time this year.    Some Seattle defenders worth mentioning: "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch, but the running back let the ball pop out of his hands, and it ended up falling to cornerback Josh Norman for an interception. Wilson then missed a score of his own; he had Cooper Helfet wide open for a score, but the attempt inexplicably fell way short. Luke Willson followed that up with a drop near the goal line on the same possession. After that, Wilson had issues holding on to the ball. He dropped a read-option exchange. He was lucky to retain possession, but only temporarily, because he gave away a turnover when there was a botched snap.    Wilson still came away with the victory though, and that's all that will matter during the playoff push. Wilson went 20-of-32 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick that wasn't his fault. Wilson missed several open targets, but picked up some decent chunks on the ground, gaining 35 rushing yards on 6 scrambles.    Wilson's sole score ended up going to Willson, which won the game. Doug Baldwin was the only Seahawk with more than 32 receiving yards. He caught 6 of his 8 targets for 61 yards.    Chris Mortensen reported that this will be Marshawn Lynch's final season with the Seahawks, but that Lynch would not be traded. Had Lynch been on the block, he would've lost some value based on this performance. He was responsible for Wilson's interception, negating at least 3 points. He also rushed for 62 yards on 14 carries, but didn't do much on the ground until a late, 25-yard burst. He was at the 3.yard-average mark for most of the afternoon.    As for the Panthers, Cam Newton had a miserable second half. He did a good job of moving the chains prior to intermission, but he had a complete meltdown after the break, going 4-of-12 for 81 yards and an interception to finish the game. The pick was terrible, as it was an ugly shovel pass. His only long completion following halftime was an amazing 51-yard reception by "

Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker Bruce Irvin tipped a pass up in the air. He came down with the ball and sprinted down the field for a 35-yard touchdown. Carr gave the ball right back as Richard Sherman picked off a back-shoulder throw intended for Andre Holmes (2-28). That spotted Seattle a field goal. Just before the half, the Seahawks drove down the field again. They were aided by a taunting penalty on Hayden, and Lynch scored from 5 yards out. The Seahawks had a 24-3 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Hayden dropped an interception that should have been a pick-six as he jumped a route. On the very next play though, Denico Autry blocked a punt and the ball rolled about 25 yards into the end zone before Brice Butler recovered it for a touchdown. The Raiders got going with a punt return by T.J. Carrie to the Seahawks' 30-yard line. A 23-yard pass to McFadden moved the ball inside the 10. On 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, Mychal Rivera (8-38) made a tremendous leaping catch for a touchdown. And just like that, Oakland was surprisingly down by just 7. The Seahawks responded with a 39-yard pass play to Lynch, who rumbled down the field, but the drive stalled, and Seattle had to settle for a field goal. Doug Baldwin then returned a punt 38 yards. Wilson scampered for 19 to convert a third down to set up another field goal. The Raiders got a drive going thanks to a face mask on Michael Bennett and a pass to Maurice Jones-Drew inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal just after the 2-minute warning, Carr connected with Rivera (8-38) for another touchdown off a play-action bootleg. It was close, but Seattle recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.    Wilson finished completing 17-of-35 passes for 179 yards. Marshawn Lynch had a huge day as Seattle's leading rusher with 21 carries for 67 yards and was the leading receiver with 5 receptions for 76 yards. The Seahawks' receivers gave them very little, as Doug Baldwin (5-38), "

Speaking of Lynch, he had a tough time finding running room against a ferocious Philadelphia ground defense. Lynch gained 86 yards on 23 carries, but those numbers were inflated by a 21-yard burst that he managed late in the game against the exhausted Eagles. Lynch helped his fantasy owners as a receiver, catching 5 balls for 27 extra yards and a touchdown.    Despite holding the ball the entire game, only 1 Seattle player had more than 37 receiving yards. That was Doug Baldwin (5-97), who secured Wilson's other touchdown.

This occurred on 1 of the final plays of the contest, as the center, who had been out of the lineup since Week 11, rolled his ankle again. It's unclear how serious this tweak was, but the Seahawks will definitely need their star center back in the lineup against an actual playoff-caliber opponent next week.    Unger's presence was expected to open things up for Marshawn Lynch, but Beast Mode couldn't get on track for the most part. Lynch was limited to 59 yards on 14 carries, and most of that came on a 25-yard burst in the second half, which could've been a longer gain had Lynch not barely stepped out of bounds.    The Panthers, meanwhile, didn't look like they were going to be very competitive in the first quarter. "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch caught a 4.h-and-1 pass to move inside the Chicago 20. Two fade pass attempts at Chicago cornerback Alan Ball came up short as Ball slapped the passes away from Graham and Rishard Matthews. A field goal closed the first half to give Seattle a 6-0 lead at the half. To open the second half, rookie speedster Tyler Lockett took the kickoff back 105 yards for a touchdown. A 21-yard run by Thomas Rawls got the Seahawks moving, and a 22-yard pass to Doug Baldwin got them to the Chicago 30. Wilson hit Graham on a crossing route, and he broke a tackle from Brock Vereen to charge into the end zone for Seattle. With a 20-0 lead, the game was essentially over. The Seahawks' offense found their groove with Rawls running for 18 yards, Kearse hauling in an 18-yarder, and Wilson running for 13 yards. That led to another Seattle field goal. A 4.h-and-short pass to Graham moved the chains, and that set up a final 48-yard field goal for Steven Hauschka.    Russell Wilson completed 20-of-30 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 28 yards on 6 carries. He remains an every-week starter because of his scrambling ability.    Marshawn Lynch played injured and had only 14 yards on 5 carries. Rawls totaled 104 yards on 16 carries. Rawls will be someone to monitor if Lynch misses time in the future. His absence in this game seemed like a precaution.    Jimmy Graham had his best game as a Seahawk with 7 receptions for 83 yards and a score. Hope you were able to buy him low. If so, time to sell him high!    Bears quarterback "

   "comment":"Marshawn Lynch touchdown.    Speaking of Lynch, he had trouble finding room to run in the early stages of the game - just 8 yards on 5 carries in the opening half - but he eventually found some holes versus a Miami defense that was tired following intermission because the unit was on the field for a long time. The Raiders converted 8-of-15 third downs and maintained possession for a big chunk of time entering the 4.h quarter. This allowed Lynch to gain 57 yards on 14 carries, scoring twice in the process.    As for the Dolphins, their offense moved the chains well and looked good overall when they weren't being penalized. It seemed like every other drive featured a holding penalty, however, especially when a big play was involved. Some of the calls were legitimate, as they were a byproduct of a poor offensive line trying to block, but some of the infractions were ticky-tack and should've been let go by an overzealous officiating crew led by the corrupt Terry McAuley. Despite all the infractions, "
