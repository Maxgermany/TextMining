   "comment":"Adam Humphries had 5 catches for 55 yards, but he's not someone you want on your fantasy team.    Winston showed more maturity than the rest of the Bucs. He had a solid day, completing 19-of-36 passes for 249 yards. Winston's numbers would have been much better if the Bucs didn't drop so many passes. Winston had his 4.h-straight game without an interception and also scored on the rushing touchdown.    Tampa Bay finished with 136 rushing yards, but that total is misleading because 59 of those yards came on a run by "
