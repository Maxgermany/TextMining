He had a solid day, completing 19-of-36 passes for 249 yards. Winston's numbers would have been much better if the Bucs didn't drop so many passes. Winston had his 4.h-straight game without an interception and also scored on the rushing touchdown.

He also hurt his team by knocking the ball out of Winston's hands.    Much won't be made of this because the kick was inconsequential, but Robert Aguayo whiffed from 45, sailing the ball wide right.   "

   "comment":"Humphries, which set up a field goal. However, Winston then was guilty of 2 turnovers; 1 was an interception tipped off Humphries' hands, while the second was a strip-sack in Carolina territory, as he held on to the ball too long. Winston was also very fortunate to get away with a pick at the end of the game when he foolishly threw the ball up for grabs into the end zone while getting hit. It was a tie game, and the Buccaneers were in kicking range, so it's not like Winston had to force anything. The ball fell incomplete, however, and Winston managed to throw a touchdown shortly after. The score turned out to the the game-winner, as the Panthers failed on a 2.point try on the next drive with only a few seconds remaining in regulation. Winston ended up 20-of-35 for 202 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and his fumble. He didn't look very good, perhaps because he was missing his security blanket, Cameron Brate. Humphries took over in that role, snatching 10 balls for 94 yards, but as mentioned, he was responsible for Winston's interception.    Aside from Humphries, only 2 Buccaneers caught multiple passes: "
