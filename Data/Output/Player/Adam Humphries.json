   "comment":"Adam Humphries, which set up a field goal. However, Winston then was guilty of 2 turnovers; 1 was an interception tipped off Humphries' hands, while the second was a strip-sack in Carolina territory, as he held on to the ball too long. Winston was also very fortunate to get away with a pick at the end of the game when he foolishly threw the ball up for grabs into the end zone while getting hit. It was a tie game, and the Buccaneers were in kicking range, so it's not like Winston had to force anything. The ball fell incomplete, however, and Winston managed to throw a touchdown shortly after. The score turned out to the the game-winner, as the Panthers failed on a 2.point try on the next drive with only a few seconds remaining in regulation. Winston ended up 20-of-35 for 202 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and his fumble. He didn't look very good, perhaps because he was missing his security blanket, Cameron Brate. Humphries took over in that role, snatching 10 balls for 94 yards, but as mentioned, he was responsible for Winston's interception.    Aside from Humphries, only 2 Buccaneers caught multiple passes: Humphries, which set up a field goal.
