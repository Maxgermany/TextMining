   "comment":"Seth Roberts for the game-winning touchdown.    This was very much a coming-out party for Derek Carr, who set his career high in yardage with 351 yards passing and his second-best completion rate with 65 percent, which is darn good when you chuck it 42 times. His 3 touchdown passes were his second-most, and all of this comes after an absolutely pitiful game against the Bengals last week.    Neither defense can really be applauded for much. The Raiders' defensive line looked great in preseason, but hasn't had a sack in 2 games now, and the Ravens without Terrell Suggs couldn't get to Carr, which led to both quarterbacks picking apart the opposing secondary.

  "comment":"Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered. The Raiders had bullied their way into the red zone with the run game and then, pfft. That fumble was a back-breaker, and there really was no way the Raiders were going to be able to keep up with the Patriots offense down 14-0.    Lynch ended up carrying the ball 11 times for 67 yards, which probably makes sense, as the Raiders were down big and would need the passing game to come from behind, but in retrospect, keeping their offense on the field might have been valuable to the defense that was getting picked apart. But I'm grasping at straws here, because they just didn't have the personnel to stop Brady.    Brady was unstoppable in the first half, completing 20-of-24 passes for 201 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Raiders came into this game allowing the best completion percentage to opposing quarterbacks, and this performance will only help push them into the upper echelons of pass defense futility. Going into halftime Brady and company went 48 yards in 33 seconds to set up a mammoth 62-yard field goal for Steven Gostkowski, who nailed it in the high elevation. It likely would have been good from 70 yards. Of course, Brady wasn't done, as he took the ball on the first drive after halftime and hit Brandin Cooks for a 64-yard touchdown in stride. If you weren't sure if the last nail had been driven into the coffin, well, that was it.    The Raiders didn't muster much after that until the 4.h quarter. Trailing 30-0, they went on a meandering 5 minutes and 20 seconds drive that ended in a 9-yard touchdown to ",
