He also led Roberts inside the New Orleans 5-yard line. Carr, meanwhile, had some poor throws. One was off his back foot on a third down despite having a clean pocket. He also led Clive Walford out of bounds in the red zone and then floated a high pass out of play on a 4.h down that seemingly ended the game, but he was bailed out by a horrible pass interference call; the pass should've been deemed uncatchable. Again, I don't want to sound overly negative because the Raiders made a great comeback and ultimately prevailed, but they were fortunate because of both the officiating and the opposition. If they want to make a playoff run - and they certainly have the talent to do so - they need to clean up their mistakes because they'll be penalized versus tougher foes. Something that would also help would be getting their right tackle situation shored up. It was fine heading into the game, but Menelik Watson and his backup both got hurt. To compensate for this, the Raiders moved Donald Penn to right tackle, sliding guard Kelechi Osemele to the blind side. Meanwhile, on defense, cornerback Sean Smith wishes he sustained an injury, so that he could at least have an excuse for being torched so brutally. Smith was ultimately benched.    Roberts scored Carr's lone touchdown, which happened to put Crabtree in position to secure the 2.pointer. Crabtree caught 7 passes for 87 yards. His 2 blemishes were a dropped pass and a horrible call on an unsportsmanlike penalty for celebrating too much after giving the Raiders the decisive score. Crabtree did throw the ball up into the air, but the officials need to calm the hell down. Players can't be mindless automatons, so they're going to celebrate after a game-winning play. As for "

   "comment":"Seth Roberts and Cam Newton rushed in from 3 yards out on the next drive to tie it 7-7. That was the score to end the first quarter, i.e. the calm before the storm. The second quarter was all Oakland. A 4-yard Latavius Murray touchdown run, a Sebastian Janikowski field goal, and then, to cap it off with less than a minute before half, Khalil Mack picked off a Cam Newton screen pass and waltzed into the end zone for a 6-yard interception return for a touchdown. That put the Raiders up 24-7 at half. A 17-point lead is always nice to have at halftime, but those numbers seemed even more daunting when you realize that Newton had completed just 3 passes on 12 attempts in the first half. The Raiders got the ball to start the second half, and quickly, disaster struck as Derek Carr dislocated his right pinkie while fumbling a snap. That mangled pinkie was the spark the Panthers needed, because they then went on to score 3 touchdowns in the third quarter, 2 short Jonathan Stewart runs and a 88-yard score from Newton to Ted Ginn Jr. The Panthers had turned a 17-point deficit into a 1-point lead by the end of the third quarter, and they weren't done yet. After Carr left the game, Matt McGloin came in for the next possession. He wasn't able to move the ball, and by the time the Raiders got the ball back, the Panthers had scored 2 touchdowns and were only down by 4 points. If Carolina hadn't have scored so quickly, we might not have seen Carr back in this game, but as his lead had disappeared, he came back in with a glove on his throwing hand and promptly threw an interception, which led to Stewart's second rushing touchdown of the day. Now in the 4.h quarter, Newton struck again with a 44-yard touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin to give the Panthers a 32-24 lead. At this point, the Raiders had given up 4 unanswered touchdowns, lost a 17-point lead, and their star quarterback was hurting. Things did not look good for the home team. Carr had the glove on and couldn't take snaps from center, but he lined up in the shotgun and started the work to bring his team back. He methodically led his offense down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clive Walford. Then, Carr hit Seth Roberts for the 2.point conversion to tie the game midway through the 4.h quarter. The Panthers then stalled at midfield, and coach Ron Rivera opted to punt on 4.h-and-1 with 5 minutes left in the game. This was a decision that Riverboat Ron probably wants back. Carr then promptly moved his team down the field again, hitting Roberts and Cam Newton rushed in from 3 yards out on the next drive to tie it 7-7.

   "comment":"Seth Roberts was guilty of dropping a touchdown on the first drive, and there was a holding penalty involved, but Carr was almost picked off on another throw. Marquette King fumbled a hold on 1 of Sebastian Janikowski's attempts, but in the end, it didn't really matter. Carr finished with absolutely dreadful numbers. He was 17-of-41 for only 117 yards. He was victimized by numerous drops, but he looked like a shell of his former self because of his injury, and once again, if things don't get better in that regard, the Raiders could lose their next 4 games. They're known for their dynamic offense, so it's going to be difficult for them to have any success averaging just 3.3 yards per play like they did in this divisional affair.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, have moved into first place of the AFC West in the wake of this victory, thanks to their season-sweep tie-breaker over the Raiders. However, they can't be feeling too good right now because of Derrick Johnson's injury. Johnson went down on no contact toward the end of the second quarter and had to be helped off the field. It was ruled that he he ruptured his problematic Achilles and will be out for the year and possibly a portion of 2017. It's a huge blow, as Johnson is the heart and soul of Kansas City's defense.    Alex Smith was terrific in the first half, as he looked like the quarterback in the running for the MVP. Smith was 11-of-16 for 202 yards and a touchdown in the opening half alone. He converted on an early third-and-10, as Chris Conley beat David Amerson. He then hit Travis Kelce for a gain of 28 yards from deep in his own territory, and followed that up with a nifty play in which he danced around the pocket and connected to Conley for a 31-yarder, as Conley beat Amerson again. Smith came back down to Earth after halftime, as he was just 6-of-10 for 62 yards, a telegraphed interception and a lost fumble (Khalil Mack strip-sack) following intermission. A regression to the mean was bound to happen for Smith, though in fairness, Andy Reid didn't seem interested in passing whatsoever, opting to just feed Spencer Ware instead. Overall, Smith finished 17-of-26 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and the lost fumble.    The Raiders came into this game struggling against tight ends, so it's no wonder that Kelce went off. Kelce caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 1.handed grab thrown behind him for a gain of 34. Meanwhile, Tyreek Hill (6-66) scored twice; once on offense when he beat Amerson (notice a theme here?), and once via a punt return. Jeremy Maclin (1-16) was barely heard from upon his return. He was targeted on Smith's interception.    Ware had a disappointing evening. He was limited to just 56 yards on 20 carries, and he was vultured in the second quarter by Charcandrick West, who found the end zone on 1 of his only 2 attempts.    Moving back to the Raiders, there might be another hand injury that they have to worry about. That's what Michael Crabtree hurt during 1 of his drops in the 4.h quarter. Crabtree caught 4 passes for 21 yards, and the only positive thing he did was draw a pass-interference flag. Sadly, Crabtree trailed the Raider leader in receiving yardage by only 8 yards, as Cooper snatched 5 of his 10 targets for just 29 yards. Cooper should've had more, but as mentioned, Carr couldn't hit an open Cooper for a long touchdown.    Seth Roberts needs to be brought up again. He dropped 3 passes, including 1 in the end zone. Though he converted a 4.h-and-4, Roberts is 1 of the worst receivers in the NFL.    As for the running game, Cris Collinsworth kept harping about how much more effective Oakland's rushing attack would've been had Kelechi Osemele not been a late scratch. Osemele is 1 of the top guards in the NFL, and his unexpected absence certainly had a big impact. Even with him gone, "

   "comment":"Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered. The Raiders had bullied their way into the red zone with the run game and then, pfft. That fumble was a back-breaker, and there really was no way the Raiders were going to be able to keep up with the Patriots offense down 14-0.    Lynch ended up carrying the ball 11 times for 67 yards, which probably makes sense, as the Raiders were down big and would need the passing game to come from behind, but in retrospect, keeping their offense on the field might have been valuable to the defense that was getting picked apart. But I'm grasping at straws here, because they just didn't have the personnel to stop Brady.    Brady was unstoppable in the first half, completing 20-of-24 passes for 201 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Raiders came into this game allowing the best completion percentage to opposing quarterbacks, and this performance will only help push them into the upper echelons of pass defense futility. Going into halftime Brady and company went 48 yards in 33 seconds to set up a mammoth 62-yard field goal for Steven Gostkowski, who nailed it in the high elevation. It likely would have been good from 70 yards. Of course, Brady wasn't done, as he took the ball on the first drive after halftime and hit Brandin Cooks for a 64-yard touchdown in stride. If you weren't sure if the last nail had been driven into the coffin, well, that was it.    The Raiders didn't muster much after that until the 4.h quarter.
