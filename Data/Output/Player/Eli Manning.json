   "comment":"Eli Manning may have his Super Bowl, but Philip Rivers is the winner when it really doesn't count as much. Rivers is now 1-0 versus Manning in the Battle of the 2004 Quarterback Class. Next meeting: 2013. Can't wait. Rivers, who went 24-of-36 for 209 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks, really impressed me on the final drive of the game. Armed with 1 timeout and 2:05 on the regulation clock, Rivers took the Chargers 80 yards in 1:46 for the winning score. Rivers never panicked, and he never had to use his timeout. He just remained calm and in control. His decisive 18-yard touchdown to Vincent Jackson was a thing of beauty. Rivers finished the game 24-of-36 for 209 yards, 3 scores and 2 picks. Jackson, meanwhile, caught 5 balls for 58 yards and 2 touchdowns.    LaDainian Tomlinson once again disappointed his fantasy owners, rushing for just 22 yards on 12 carries. Tomlinson had absolutely no room to run, so even the LT of old couldn't have done much more.    You can't blame Eli Manning's heel for this loss. Eli was 25-of-33 for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns. He looked like the Eli of old, converting some difficult third-down situations.    The real problem for the Giants was careless errors that they made. They were whistled for 9 penalties for 104 yards. One of the penalties, a holding call on "

Untouched, Cruz dropped the ball and ran back to the huddle, thinking that the play was over. However, the Cardinals pounced on what appeared to be a fumble recovery. The officials ruled that Cruz gave himself up. Ken Whisenhunt tried to challenge it, but wasn't allowed to. On the next play, Manning hit Hakeem Nicks for the decisive 29-yard score. Most of the talking heads on TV were pissed off about this and disagreed with the call, but I didn't - until I heard what Cruz said afterward. I thought it was pretty legitimate at first. If you look at Cruz, he glanced to his left and right, decided that he wasn't going anywhere, and dived down on his own. I figured he knew he wasn't touched, and thus gave himself up. Afterward, however, Cruz said that he thought he was touched. If that's the case, then Arizona definitely got hosed.    What's lost amid the controversy was Eli Manning's 4.h-quarter performance. He finished 27-of-40 for 321 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final 4 minutes. The top-five quarterback hit Nicks 10 times for 162 yards and Cruz on 6 occasions for 98 yards.

   "comment":"Eli Manning heaved an inaccurate bomb to the end zone. It was a careless play call and attempt, and the resulting short field sparked Miami's first touchdown. New York would go on to commit 5 penalties in the first half alone, while several defensive players loafed around.)    The Dolphins were shorthanded without cornerback Vontae Davis and running back Daniel Thomas, but they started the game strong and played New York tough. Miami had a good drive early in the first quarter as quarterback Matt Moore was moving the ball well. He had a big 16-yard run on 3rd-and-9 to extend the drive. Moore tossed a few passes to Reggie Bush, and a 16-yard connection to Charles Clay. A pass interference penalty on Aaron Ross in the end zone moved the ball to the 1-yard line. Miami capped the drive with Steve Slaton plunging in the end zone. The Giants came back with a drive that yielded a field goal for New York. Running back Ahmad Bradshaw had a nice 18-yard run. Then, quarterback Eli Manning had a 21-yard pass to tight end Jake Ballard.Manning heaved an inaccurate bomb to the end zone. It was a careless play call and attempt, and the resulting short field sparked Miami's first touchdown. New York would go on to commit 5 penalties in the first half alone, while several defensive players loafed around.)    The Dolphins were shorthanded without cornerback Vontae Davis and running back Daniel Thomas, but they started the game strong and played New York tough.

   "comment":"Eli Manning was just 2-of-7 for 24 yards after the opening period, and it just seemed evident that the Jets would run away with the victory. The Jets, however, would do stupid things on their own to keep the Giants in the game. Manning hit Victor Cruz for a 99-yard touchdown in the second quarter on what should have been a 10-yard gain or so. Two defenders whiffed on tackles. On the others side of the ball, Dustin Keller was clearly focused on some hot female in the stands because he had a ball hit him in the helmet and then dropped another pass. Nick Folk, meanwhile, whiffed on a 44-yard field goal that was way wide right as the first half concluded.    Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer also deserves a ton of blame. He didn't run the ball at all against a weak ground defense, with Shonn Greene getting just 14 carries for 58 yards. Instead, Mark Sanchez attempted a career-high 59 passes, finishing 30-of-59 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, however. Sanchez could have easily been picked off 5 times. He took a safety and had 2 lost fumbles overturned by replay. I don't know what Schottenheimer was thinking, but he easily solidified his status as 1 of the worst offensive coordinators in the NFL. He got Sanchez sacked 5 times, twice by Jason Pierre-Paul.    While Sanchez was pretty inept, he didn't really get any help from his receivers. I already mentioned Keller's drops. Santonio Holmes had 1 as well on a 3rd-and-9 that would have converted a first down at the end of the third quarter. Burress was whistled for offensive pass interference on a touchdown. Keller at least finished with quality numbers (8-77). Holmes disappointed his fantasy owners (4-50), as did Burress (3-34).    Cruz was definitely the top producer on both sides of the ball. In fact, he was the only Giant with more than 1 reception. He logged 3 grabs for 164 yards and a touchdown. Hakeem Nicks (1-20) did nothing.    It's hard to believe that Eli Manning was able to win by 15 points despite only 9 completions. He went 9-of-27 for 225 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception; his yardage obviously inflated by that 99-yard Cruz strike.    "

   "comment":"Eli Manning did a terrific job with the hard count. What's most disconcerting, whether I'm Jerry Jones or a regular Dallas fan, is that the team lacked energy and showed no urgency in the first half. There were multiple fumble recovery opportunities, but the players were just really slow in jumping on the loose balls. It's almost like most of the Cowboys thought that this was the third preseason game instead of a win-or-die divisional battle for the final playoff spot.    I don't want to take anything away from the Giants though, who played really well in the first, second and 4.h quarters.

The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible. His final numbers look decent - 22-of-35, 291 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks - but most of the yardage, save for a 62-yard touchdown bomb to Josh Gordon, came in garbage time. On 1 instance, Weeden was whistled for an illegal forward pass because he tossed the ball into the end zone after the ball was batted back to him. Immediately afterward, Weeden heaved an interception into the end zone. Weeden was mostly awful, which has to be especially discouraging for Cleveland fans because the Giants were missing half of their back 7.    Both of Weeden's scores went to Gordon, who caught just those 2 balls for 82 yards. Meanwhile, Jordan Norwood hauled in 9 passes for 81 yards.    While Richardson ran very well, that's nothing compared to what Ahmad Bradshaw was able to accomplish. He fumbled on his first carry because his own lineman hit him and then committed a chop block, but he rebounded and was able to finish with a whopping 200 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. Meanwhile, Andre Brown suffered a concussion.    Manning, meanwhile, went 25-of-37 for 259 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception despite not having Hakeem Nicks and losing Martellus Bennett to an injury for a stretch."

I said save for a couple of plays because both Griffin and Manning had some poor turnovers. Manning, who went 26-of-40 for 337 yards and a touchdown, tossed 2 poor interceptions. The first was an overthrow in Washington territory, which took a potential score off the board. The second led to a Redskin field goal. As for Griffin, he tossed an interception and fumbled twice. At 1 point in the second half, the Redskins committed turnovers on 3 consecutive possessions. They were back-breakers, as they all occurred in New York territory. Washington left points off the board in those instances. It also did so in the first quarter when a Griffin-to-"

Manning, who was sacked only once. Meanwhile, the Packers' linemen couldn't block the Giants whatsoever. Rodgers was constantly under pressure, getting sacked 5 times. Mathias Kiwanuka recorded 2 sacks, while Osi Umenyiora, who registered a sack and a forced fumble, showed signs of life for the first time all season. Having a healthy Antrel Rolle was also a major boost. Rodgers ended up 14-of-25 for 219 yards, an early touchdown to Jordy Nelson (2-71) who beat Corey Webster for a 61-yard score, an interception and a lost fumble. Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.    Only 3 Packer non-running backs made receptions: Nelson, Jermichael Finley (3-51) and Randall Cobb (4-39). Finley dropped a pass, but he showed great awareness by running from out of the screen and catching a ball that was tipped in the air.    Going back to Manning, he displayed no remnants of a tired arm that plagued him prior to the bye. Save for an ugly overthrow in the end zone on the opening drive, Manning was pretty much flawless, going 16-of-30 for 249 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Manning's scores went to "

The unit was also guilty of a holding penalty that negated a nice-looking David Wilson touchdown run when the game was still close. Right after the Wilson score was taken off the board, Manning took a sack, which set up a long field goal that was missed. The result of this poor blocking was disastrous outside of that blown scoring opportunity. The Giants mustered just 2 first downs and 18 total net yards by halftime. The team's fans on the forum all agreed that this was the worst offensive performance they've ever seen.    As you may guess, Eli Manning struggled immensely because he had no time to throw. By the time the Panthers went up 31-0, Manning was just 6-of-11 for 37 yards and an ugly interception that he fired into double coverage. Manning finished 12-of-23 for 119 yards and the pick.

   "comment":"Eli Manning was taken down awkwardly at the end of the first half. He hobbled into the locker room to receive X-rays on his leg, and he was ruled out for the rest of the game. It turned out to be an ankle sprain. That didn't seem as bad as William Beatty's injury. Beatty was carted off with his right leg immobilized, and he was ultimately diagnosed with a fractured leg. Rehab will be tough for him this offseason, and this further emphasizes the need the Giants have for a tackle. I may give them 1 in my next <b> </b>.    The other big storyline in this contest was Kirk Cousin's dwindling trade stock. Cousins had a great performance against the Falcons 2 weeks ago, but has gotten worse each week. Cousins went 19-of-49 for 169 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. It could've been even worse for Cousins, as the Giants dropped a couple of possible picks. His receivers hurt him with some drops, but Cousins was completely inept, and the Redskins will be lucky to get anything more than a 4.h-round pick for him.    Some other stats/notes: - Manning went 10-of-24 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was nearly pick-sixed on the opening drive. He later hurt his hand and completed just 3 of 10 passes after that before leaving with his ankle sprain. - "

   "comment":"Eli Manning touchdown. Credit must be give to his offensive line, as Romo had all afternoon to throw for the most part. Bryant, meanwhile, reeled in 9 of the 12 targets thrown his way. As mentioned, he made so many circus catches throughout the contest despite being covered well. He nearly scored a touchdown, getting tackled at the 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter.    Two of Romo's touchdowns went to Gavin Escobar (3-65), while the other was thrown to Terrance Williams (1-18), who curiously saw just 3 targets go his way.    Murray, meanwhile, continued to dominate, as he broke Jim Brown's record for most consecutive 100-yard rushing performances (7) to begin the season. There was a scare, however, as Murray rolled his ankle in the first half and limped off the field. He didn't miss much action, however, and he ultimately gained 128 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries despite the Giants selling out against the run.    The Giants, on the other hand, failed to run the ball against the league's worst rush defense. Andre Williams' poor ability had something to do with that. Looking like a typical Big Ten plodder - though he's not from the Big Ten - Williams managed 51 yards on 18 carries, with 22 of his yards coming on 1 play. Peyton Hillis also saw some action (6-29), even getting a carry on the third down of the opening drive for some reason. It goes without saying that the Giants desperately need Rashad Jennings to return to action.    The Giants didn't lose this game because of their inability to run, however. They simply made too many mistakes. It began early when Will Beatty false started on a 4.h-and-inches attempt. Justin Pugh also had some crucial infractions. Rueben Randle's hold wiped out a long gain. Larry Donnell was most responsible though, as he lost 2 fumbles in his own territory. The first led to a Dallas touchdown, while the second ended the game. New York's errors ruined a quality performance by Eli Manning, who went 21-of-33 for 248 yards and 3 touchdowns. He did not appear to miss Victor Cruz at all. Two of his scores went to Odell Beckham (4-34), while the other was passed to Manning touchdown. Credit must be give to his offensive line, as Romo had all afternoon to throw for the most part.

Beckham tipped the pass into the air, and the ball sailed right to Earl Thomas. The Seahawks scored on the ensuing drive. On their next possession, they got extremely lucky when both Lynch and Russell Wilson fumbled. The Giants seemed to have a great chance to recover loose footballs, but Seattle inexplicably recovered in both instances. The deflated Giants allowed Lynch to run into the end zone once again. The Seahawks followed that up with another score in garbage time, making it appear as though this game wasn't the close affair that it surely was for 3.and-half quarters.    Despite this game being tight, the Giants still looked completely pathetic trying to stop Seattle's ground attack. The Seahawks rushed for a franchise-record 350 yards, led by Lynch, who tallied 140 yards and a quartet of touchdowns on 21 carries. Lynch was extremely tough and moved the pile on most of his attempts. He'll be missed when he moves on next year, but Seattle fans got a taste of the future, as Christine Michael gained 71 yards on just 4 carries.    Like Lynch, Russell Wilson eclipsed the century barrier on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks designed plenty of runs for Wilson, and the Giants didn't have an answer. They were perplexed every single time. Wilson, however, didn't succeed in the passing game. He went 10-of-17 for 172 yards and 2 interceptions, and he also was pressured quite frequently. One of his picks was forced into tight coverage, while the second was underthrown. He missed an open Jermaine Kearse for a touchdown as well. It was discouraging to see Wilson struggle, given that some of his missing offensive linemen returned for this game.    Kearse was Wilson's leading receiver, catching 3 of his 4 targets for 70 yards. Doug Baldwin had the most balls thrown to him (6), but his 4-31 line was very underwhelming.    The Giants blew this 1 late, but they can at least be encouraged by Beckham's performance. The No. 12 overall pick continued to show flashes of greatness, snagging 7 of his 9 targets for 108 yards.

Beckham finished with 10 catches (on 11 targets) for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he should've even had a much better performance. Beckham sprinted past the coverage and was wide open downfield late in the third quarter on what would've been an 87-yard touchdown, but Manning inexplicably didn't see him. Beckham left the game briefly with an injury, but he turned out to be fine.    Manning, despite that blemish, had a strong rebound performance off his 5.interception outing.

Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half. Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown."

Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain.

   "comment":"Eli Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain. Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain.

   "comment":"Eli Manning went 18-of-34 for 297 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Manning didn't have much time - he lost Manning's interception gave the Jets new life. A field goal, followed by a touchdown, and then an overtime scoring drive helped them steal a game that appeared to be lost.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was excellent for the second week in a row, as it appears as though he's completely over his thumb injury. Fitzpatrick went 36-of-50 for 390 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 5 times for 22 rushing yards. Granted, the Giants have a horrible secondary, but Fitzpatrick was impressive nonetheless.    Three Jets accumulated more than 90 receiving yards. Two were the usual suspects. Brandon Marshall reeled in 12 of his 13 targets for 131 yards and a touchdown, which sent the game into overtime. Eric Decker (8-101) did most of his work in the second half. The third Jet was Bilal Powell, who was thrown to 13 times. Powell accumulated 8 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Powell didn't do much on the ground, which was expected. Chris Ivory gained 47 yards on 10 carries. He was given just 3 attempts after intermission because the Jets were behind so much and had to go into catch-up mode. It's a shame, as Ivory looked great, aside from his fumble. There was 1 carry where he broke 3 tackles and made a nasty spin move to pick up a 20-yard gain. The Giants were guilty of horrid tackling early on.    The Giants, meanwhile, screwed up as well. They seemed to be gifted a victory, but they threw it all away, beginning with Manning's interception. After that, Odell Beckham couldn't locate a deep pass and then was flagged for kicking the ball out of frustration. This was capped off by a 48-yard missed field goal in overtime to give the Jets the win.    "

Had the Giants been sharp and played to their potential, they could've prevailed by at least 2 touchdowns.    Save for the lost fumble, Eli Manning didn't deserve blame for this. He didn't throw a touchdown, but came close to doing so on multiple occasions. His passing numbers were still impressive, as he went 32-of-41 for 368 yards. Of course, this was to be expected, given that the Saints' already-dreadful defense was missing its top cornerback, Delvin Breaux. Making matters even worse, the team's other starting corner, "

   "comment":"Eli Manning threw way behind his receivers, the crowd began booing, and the fans actually gave the Giants a sarcastic standing ovation following their initial first down early in the second quarter. The Giants then had more success moving the ball, but Beckham sustained an injury. He left the game, came back in after 1 play, and then limped into the locker room. He was diagnosed with a hip pointer, but managed to return. With some renewed optimism, things quickly changed when Manning threw an interception as a result of Sterling Shepard falling down. The Ravens took the lead, but that didn't last very long. Manning, who was horrid in early going, lofted a bomb to Beckham, who managed to secure it for a 75-yard touchdown, torching Will Davis, who was on the field because starting cornerback Jimmy Smith left the game with an injury. The Ravens managed to take the lead, but Manning once again hit Beckham for a long score, this time a 66-yarder on a 4.h-and-1 as a result of a 2 Baltimore defensive backs crashing into each other. Beckham followed that up by ripping off his helmet, running to the kicking net and proposing to it. After the net apparently said yes, he hugged the net, which collapsed as a result, so Beckham did more harm than good to his new fiancee. The Giants had a 4.point advantage with less than 2 minutes remaining, but the Ravens drove down the field and nearly reached the red zone, thanks to a very bogus roughing-the-passer penalty. Joe Flacco had an open receiver at the 5-yard line, but overthrew him. Flacco then had to try a Hail Mary, and that fell incomplete as time expired.    As you can tell, this game was insane, with so many twists and turns. Either team could have won it; the Ravens failed to convert a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Plus, these teams weren't far apart in terms of net yardage (435-391, Giants), and Baltimore won the time-of-possession battle by more than 10 minutes.    Speaking of twists and turns, that could appropriately describe Eli Manning's performance. Manning began very poorly; as mentioned, he was throwing way behind countless receivers. However, his deep connections to Beckham bolstered his stat line, and he finished 32-of-46 for 403 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first score was the 300th of his career. By the way, neither of Manning's interceptions were his fault; I mentioned Shepard fell down during 1 of them. The other occurred when Manning tried to make something happen at the end of the first half, so the turnover didn't hurt at all.    Beckham had just 2 catches for 11 yards at halftime, and as mentioned, he was dealing with a hip pointer. However, he came alive following intermission, and he finished with 8 catches for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns, as Baltimore's beleaguered secondary blew coverage after coverage.    Manning threw way behind his receivers, the crowd began booing, and the fans actually gave the Giants a sarcastic standing ovation following their initial first down early in the second quarter. The Giants then had more success moving the ball, but Beckham sustained an injury. He left the game, came back in after 1 play, and then limped into the locker room.

   "comment":"Eli Manning found a wide-open Roger Lewis, thanks to a blown coverage by Jaylen Watkins, who was later flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty. Wentz settled down afterward, though he struggled in the red zone and had some issues with his accuracy. However, Doug Pederson picked up the slack in terms of crushing his own team with mistakes. Pederson went for it twice on 4.h-and-short in the opening half. I didn't think the decisions were bad, but the play calls were abysmal. The first had Wentz rolling left, which the Giants read easily, smothering him for a loss. The second was 1 of the slowest-developing runs the NFL has ever seen, and Darren Sproles was predictably stuffed. That wasn't all for Pederson, as he constantly called ineffective read plays for Wentz, which didn't do anything. Pederson also had a horrible challenge on 1 play in the third quarter, burning a timeout. It was 1 of 2 timeouts Pederson wasted in the second half, costing the Eagles 1 more possession. Despite all of this, as well as a blocked field goal, the Eagles still had a chance to win at the very end. They had 2 possessions deep in Giants territory, but high passes, drops and quarterback pressures ultimately allowed the Giants to win.    Wentz finished 27-of-47 for 364 yards and the 2 picks. Wentz managed to play well in between the 20s after the 2 early turnovers, but he constantly sailed passes over his receivers' heads in the red zone. He also made some dumb mental mistakes. For instance, he took a 5-yard sack by running out of bounds and not throwing the ball away. He also threw short of the third-down marker on third down on a couple of occasions. He was lucky to have just 2 interceptions, as he was nearly picked off a couple more times. He also underthrew Jordan Matthews and someone named Bryce Treggs for 2 potential touchdowns.    If there's a silver lining for the Eagles, it's that Wentz finally developed a connection with Zach Ertz. The talented tight end had done nothing all year, but he caught all 8 of his targets for 97 yards, eating the Giants' linebacking corps alive. Ertz missed some action with a minor injury, but he wasn't out long. Matthews (6-88) was next on the receiving chart. Nelson Agholor, meanwhile, dropped some passes and fumbled the ball, but was fortunate enough to recover it.    Sproles once again carried the load for the Eagles. He gained 57 yards on 13 carries, but was stuffed on that aforementioned 4.h-and-1 play. He also nearly scored on a punt return, but barely stepped out of bounds. Ryan Mathews found the end zone, but was given just 5 carries, which he turned into 15 yards. Kenjon Barner also had a touchdown on his only attempt.    Following the 2 early touchdown following Wentz's interceptions, the Giants barely did anything on offense. It didn't help that stud guard Justin Pugh sustained an injury in the first quarter. Still, the Giants had just 2 positive drives that didn't come off Philadelphia turnovers on the afternoon. Eli Manning finished 22-of-36 for 257 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He was nearly picked a third time by McLeod, but the ball barely hit the ground. Manning struggled following halftime, going 7-of-14 for 82 yards and 2 picks. Neither interception was really his fault, however, as the first 1 occurred when Manning found a wide-open Roger Lewis, thanks to a blown coverage by Jaylen Watkins, who was later flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty.

That is a truly horrible stat line against 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Most quarterbacks have torched the Browns this year, so it has to be very discouraging for the Giants that Manning couldn't do much. He should've been able to make several downfield throws, but was just inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't all Manning's fault, as his offensive line had issues keeping the Browns out of the backfield. Cleveland sacked Manning once, but that's not indicative of the pressure Manning saw. Rookie Emmnauel Ogbah put some good heat on the Giant signal-caller.

The other interception occurred because his receiver fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie also snatched that 1.    The only 2 successful targets for Cousins happened to be Garcon (4-96) and Jordan Reed (5-40, TD). Garcon made a great play to elude numerous tacklers on a third-and-17 in the red zone to set up the touchdown. DeSean Jackson didn't do much, catching 2 balls for 34 yards. The scuttlebutt is that Jackson will sign with the Eagles this offseason.    Robert Kelley didn't have any sort of success, mustering only 33 yards on 12 carries.

At 1-4, the Chargers can't be realistic that they can get back into the playoff race in perhaps the toughest division in the NFL, but the first win under head coach Anthony Lynn should help his status along with general manager Tom Telesco.    The Giants scored first as the Chargers' offense was backed up in their own end zone. The center snapped the ball before Rivers was ready, and Rivers wisely pushed the loose ball out of the back of the end zone to give up a safety rather than a touchdown.

   "comment":"Eli Manning dropped back to throw a pass, but never got it off. The Seahawks got a lot of pressure on him and he fumbled. Seattle recovered and made a terrific play next. On the ensuing possession, Pete Carroll dialed up a bit of trickery. Russell Wilson handed the ball to halfback J.D. McKissic, who lateralled it back to Wilson. The Seahawks quarterback then launched the ball downfield to Paul Richardson, who went up and caught the ball. Landon Collins also got his hands on it as well, and shades of the Fail Mary game surfaced as the officials reviewed the call. Ultimately, Richardson's 38-yard touchdown stood, and that was the difference-maker for this contest. Still, this was not a great performance for the Seahawks. They once again struggled in the first half, and their blocking wasn't good for yet another week. Wilson was under pressure from the Giants' edge rushers for most of the day and constantly had to move outside the pocket. He was called for intentional grounding a couple times and a less-mobile quarterback would have been sacked far more than once. Against a stronger team, the Seahawks may not have emerged victorious in this contest.    Wilson's final numbers look very good; he went 27-of-39 for 334 yards and 3 touchdowns. But he did have some issues of his own. He had some overthrows on passes, and notably missed Doug Baldwin for what would have been a wide-open touchdown. That said, the positives far outweighed the negatives. Wilson made some beautiful touch passes and was able to have great ball placement on almost all of his accurate throws. On 1 of his touchdowns, he found Baldwin over the middle of the field and lofted a perfect touch pass to him for the 22-yard score. The ball lofted over the linebackers and was 1 of his best throws on the day. In fact, all his touch passes were near perfect today, and that was his biggest strength. Wilson will continue to perform well, but the Seahawks need to get him help so he doesn't have to carry the team.    Wilson's top receivers on the day were Doug Baldwin (9-92, 1 TD) and Jimmy Graham (3-51, 1 TD). Baldwin led the team with a whopping 12 targets. He demonstrated great chemistry with Wilson and was able to find space all across the field and use his elusiveness to gain extra yards. Baldwin has a lot of upside in fantasy, and can be a WR1 some weeks. Meanwhile, Graham's performance was a mixed bag, but he also had a couple of drops. On 1 play, he dropped a touchdown that hit him in the chest. The defender was close to him, but it was a makeable grab. The more egregious 1 came when Wilson hit him in the chest on a deep ball. Graham let it hit the ground, but he could have had a touchdown. Graham is still a TE1, but he needs to improve his hands to help the team.    The run offense was once again an issue for the Seahawks. They used multiple running backs, but it's clear that they are missing Chris Carson. Eddie Lacy saw 11 carries, but only notched 34 yards. Thomas Rawls also saw 11 carries and did about the same, garnering 36 yards. Perhaps the most impressive of the group was J.D. McKissic, who had 5 touches for 33 scrimmage yards. He has explosive play-making ability, so he may have a chance to earn a bigger role with the team. ,li&gt; For the Giants, they deserve praise for keeping pace with the Seahawks early on. But it's clear that their offense is not going to be able to keep the team competitive this year. Eli Manning had a poor performance against the Seahawks. The veteran quarterback has regressed, and he's looking like 1 of the worse signal-callers in the NFL. At halftime, Manning only had 17 passing yards despite the Giants having the lead. Manning's arm strength is no longer there, and his downfield accuracy has suffered as a result. Of course, Manning has been operating without his top-three passing options in the past couple weeks, but the Giants still had no chance against the Seahawks. Manning was dinking and dunking against a defense known for solid tackling and pursuit abilities. That was not a recipe for success. Overall, Manning went 19-of-39 for 134 yards and 1 touchdown. He also fumbled. Manning's numbers are indicative of his declining ability. Manning isn't capable of leading the Giants to the playoffs, so they need to think about replacing him this offseason.

   "comment":"Eli Manning and the defense made numerous mistakes in what turned out to be a blowout victory for the Rams. It began right away when the Rams turned 2 Giants turnovers into a pair of touchdowns. Aaron Donald strip-sacked Manning, which led to Goff throwing a short touchdown to Tyler Higbee. Wayne Gallman then coughed the ball up, and Los Angeles took over. It appeared as though nothing was going to materialize, as the team was stuck in a third-and-33, but Goff lobbed a short toss to Robert Woods in the slot, and Woods ran the distance for 52 yards, thanks to Landon Collins taking a horrible angle on the play. If that wasn't bad enough for the Giants, the Rams scored once again on a long play, with Goff hitting Watkins with a 67-yard bomb. Watkins was wide open because Eli Apple blew the coverage. And just like that, the Rams carried a 27-10 lead into halftime, and New York couldn't muster anything in the second half because of the team's severe limitations.    Goff finished 14-of-22 for 311 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was excellent once again, taking advantage of a New York defense missing numerous key players. In addition to Jenkins, Olivier Vernon and top linebacker B.J. Goodson were both out, and Goff had a terrific performance as a consequence.    Given that Woods and Watkins both had big gains of 50-plus yards, it's not a surprise that they led the team in receiving. Woods caught 4 balls for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Watkins' 67-yard score was his only reception. Cooper Kupp (3-54) had a solid outing.    Todd Gurley didn't have much room on the ground for most of the afternoon, but he was able to break free for a 36-yard burst in the opening half. Gurley had an underwhelming rushing line - 16 carries, 59 yards - but he scored twice and also caught 2 passes for 45 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Giants were guilty of more turnovers than the 1. I referenced earlier. Eli Manning nearly had a couple of other turnovers late in the second quarter. He was picked off, and then fumbled the ball when Donald hit him again, but was very fortunate that the ball bounced back to him. Manning had an opportunity to take advantage of the lucky bounce, but overthrew Manning and the defense made numerous mistakes in what turned out to be a blowout victory for the Rams. It began right away when the Rams turned 2 Giants turnovers into a pair of touchdowns. Aaron Donald strip-sacked Manning, which led to Goff throwing a short touchdown to Tyler Higbee."
