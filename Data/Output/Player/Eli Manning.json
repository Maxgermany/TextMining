The important thing here is that Manning left the game in the 4.h quarter with a heel injury. It was characterized as a bruise, so he should be OK. I'm basing this on my vast medical expertise.    "

This, as well as Denver's confusing blitz schemes caused Manning to take 3 sacks. Manning had been sacked only 17 times entering this contest.

   "comment":"Manning's fumble in Eagles territory in the 4.h quarter), but Philadelphia screwed up just as much - if not more. The Eagles outgained New York by 184 yards. They had red zone struggles, an easy dropped touchdown by Jason Avant and fumbles of their own (2 lost). QB Dog Killer, meanwhile, barely missed DeSean Jackson on several occasions. Philadelphia could have easily scored way more than 27 points.    QB Dog Killer went 24-of-38 for 258 yards. He also rushed 11 times for 34 yards and a score, as the Giants did an incredible job bottling him up and limiting his scrambling yardage.    Jackson caught 5 balls for 50 yards, but as mentioned, his night should have been much better. Jeremy Maclin (9-120) did the most damage out of the receiving corps.    With the Giants entirely focused on QB Dog Killer, LeSean McCoy tore it up. He tallied 111 rushing yards and a touchdown on just 14 carries. He also snagged 5 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Eli Manning committed 4 turnovers (3 interceptions and a fumble) and finished 20-of-33 for 147 yards and 2 touchdowns otherwise. One of the picks was made in desperation mode, but the other 3 give-aways, namely the fumble, proved to be way too costly. For thoughts on Broncos-Chargers, check out my updated   "

   "comment":"Manning was awful in the preseason, as he had issues with his accuracy in every outing. That continued at Washington. Though he went 18-of-32 for 268 yards, a rushing touchdown and a pick, he made numerous poor throws and missed open receivers. That said, he doesn't deserve blame for the interception, which happened to be returned for 6. Kareem McKenzie whiffed on a block, allowing rookie Ryan Kerrigan to take the pick back for 6. On the other side of the coin, Rex Grossman really looked good in the exhibition contests, beating out John Beck by a mile. Grossman was really sharp against the Giants, going 21-of-34 for 305 yards and a pair of scores. He made only 1 mistake, which was a fumble that he committed while getting sacked. He also overthrew Jabar Gaffney for a potential touchdown, though Gaffney repaid the favor by dropping a long completion. Maybe Grossman was on to something when he said that the Redskins were going to win the NFC East.    If you need a tight end in your fantasy league, pick up Fred Davis. He was every bit as good as his numbers indicate; he hauled in 5 passes for 105 yards.    Santana Moss had 6 receptions for 76 yards. Tim Hightower, meanwhile, generated 72 rushing yards and a touchdown on 25 attempts to go along with 3 catches for 25 receiving yards.    The only positive stat-producer on the Giants was Hakeem Nicks, who notched 7 receptions for 122 yards. Mario Manningham's 4 grabs for 49 yards were the result of Manning's inaccuracy.   "

   "comment":"Manning heaved an inaccurate bomb to the end zone. It was a careless play call and attempt, and the resulting short field sparked Miami's first touchdown. New York would go on to commit 5 penalties in the first half alone, while several defensive players loafed around.)    The Dolphins were shorthanded without cornerback Vontae Davis and running back Daniel Thomas, but they started the game strong and played New York tough. Miami had a good drive early in the first quarter as quarterback Matt Moore was moving the ball well. He had a big 16-yard run on 3rd-and-9 to extend the drive. Moore tossed a few passes to Reggie Bush, and a 16-yard connection to Charles Clay. A pass interference penalty on Aaron Ross in the end zone moved the ball to the 1-yard line. Miami capped the drive with Steve Slaton plunging in the end zone. The Giants came back with a drive that yielded a field goal for New York. Running back Ahmad Bradshaw had a nice 18-yard run. Then, quarterback Eli Manning had a 21-yard pass to tight end Jake Ballard."

   "comment":"Manning even made an important throw to a receiver wearing a No. 85 jersey. I guess he is a top-five quarterback. And by the way, if the Patriots still had proud defensive veterans like Willie McGinest, Tedy Bruschi, Ty Law, Mike Vrabel, Richard Seymour, etc. they wouldn't have allowed that final touchdown. This defense blows.)    In the first half, the Patriots and Giants got a lot of use out of their punters and neither team was able to get any points. New England started to move the ball midway through the half, but on the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady was intercepted. His ball was deflected by Michael Boley, and Mathias Kiwanuka snatched the deflection. New York's offensive line had a lot of issues in the first half. They had multiple holding penalties and were letting consistent pressure get to Eli Manning. He took some big hits and moved well to avoid taking sacks. Late in the second quarter, the Patriots started moving the ball with Brady making a series of short passes. After making a beautiful catch for a 21-yard gain against cornerback "

   "comment":"Manning returned the favor by throwing a pick to linebacker Jamar Chaney. Philadelphia took the lead with a field goal in the second quarter, but Young threw another pick. The pass was deflected by cornerback Aaron Ross, and safety Kenny Philips tracked down the ball to set up the Giants just past midfield. A short time later, the Eagles took over at their own 2-yard line. Young aired out a deep ball that Jackson ran under for a gain of about 50 yards. After the play, he acted like an idiot, flipping the ball at a New York coach and then taunting the Giants' sideline. That drew a penalty which negated his big catch and put the ball back on the Philadelphia 2-yard line. Just before halftime, Jackson had a massive punt return, and why in God's name did New York kick it to him? The Giants finally forced Jackson to step out of bounds at the 14-yard line. The next play saw Young connect with Steve Smith on a crossing route for a touchdown. New York got a field goal before time ran out and Philadelphia took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. The third quarter saw more of the same - the Eagles' defensive line was whipping the Giants' line. Manning was under constant duress and the run blocking was terrible. New York had its 8. punt halfway through the 4.h quarter. Philadelphia started a promising drive, but Young threw a ball up for grabs in the back of the end zone and Ross came down with the interception. After trading more punts, the Giants finally got something going early in the 4.h quarter. Manning threw a deep ball for "

   "comment":"Manning threw the game-sealing touchdown on the very next play to give his team a 30-13 lead.    Another Packer gaffe was a Jennings' lost fumble on the second drive. It was initially ruled a fumble, but then the officials discussed it and said he was down by contact. Tom Coughlin challenged the play because it was pretty apparent that Jennings did in fact fumble. FOX announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were even speculating on where the ball would be spotted. However, official Bill Leavy ruled that Jennings was down and offered no explanation. The Packers maintained possession and would go on to score a touchdown on the drive. If you're not familiar with Leavy, he's the inept/crooked ref who botched/fixed the Steelers-Seahawks Super Bowl. I don't know how the hell he's still permitted to officiate playoff games. He needs to be fired because allowing him to work another game would be completely irresponsible. He's either bought or just completely awful at his job.    The Packers also screwed themselves defensively. They barely got any pressure on Manning, while their tackling efforts were atrocious. I don't have enough fingers to count how many tackles they missed. It really hurt them when "

   "comment":"Manning hit Victor Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7.point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible. His final numbers look decent - 22-of-35, 291 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks - but most of the yardage, save for a 62-yard touchdown bomb to Josh Gordon, came in garbage time. On 1 instance, Weeden was whistled for an illegal forward pass because he tossed the ball into the end zone after the ball was batted back to him. Immediately afterward, Weeden heaved an interception into the end zone. Weeden was mostly awful, which has to be especially discouraging for Cleveland fans because the Giants were missing half of their back 7.    Both of Weeden's scores went to Gordon, who caught just those 2 balls for 82 yards. Meanwhile, Jordan Norwood hauled in 9 passes for 81 yards.    While Richardson ran very well, that's nothing compared to what Ahmad Bradshaw was able to accomplish. He fumbled on his first carry because his own lineman hit him and then committed a chop block, but he rebounded and was able to finish with a whopping 200 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. Meanwhile, Andre Brown suffered a concussion.    Manning, meanwhile, went 25-of-37 for 259 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception despite not having Hakeem Nicks and losing Martellus Bennett to an injury for a stretch."

The first was an overthrow in Washington territory, which took a potential score off the board. The second led to a Redskin field goal. As for Griffin, he tossed an interception and fumbled twice. At 1 point in the second half, the Redskins committed turnovers on 3 consecutive possessions. They were back-breakers, as they all occurred in New York territory.

   "comment":"Manning had a long pass to Rueben Randle (2-68) for 56 yards on the first drive of the game to set up a field goal. After that, the Cowboys started making mistakes. Brown undercut a pass in the deep middle of the field on a post route to intercept Romo. He had a nice return to inside the Dallas 30-yard line. Bryant ran a bad route and didn't come back to the ball. Romo threw a pass off the mark to Miles Austin a few minutes later, and cornerback Corey Webster snatched it. That led to a 1-yard touchdown plunge from Andre Brown (3-21). Bryant then fumbled the ball away at the end of the first quarter while being tackled on a punt return. That set up the Giants at the Cowboys 15-yard line, but Dallas held New York to a field goal, limiting the visitors to a 16-0 lead. The Giants blew the game wide open when Jason Pierre-Paul (1 sack) made a leaping interception on an attempted dump off in the flat. He returned the interception 27 yards for a touchdown.    The Cowboys finally started showing signs of life with a drive that ended with a Felix Jones touchdown. Romo found Bryant wide open in busted coverage for a gain of 55 yards to set up a field goal. Dallas cut the lead to 23-17 in the third quarter after Romo moved the ball down the field with Bryant (5-110) and Austin (9-133). Romo ran in a bootleg on 4.h-and-goal for a 1.yard touchdown. The Cowboys then took the lead with Romo throwing a short touchdown pass to tight end John Phillips (3-14).    Manning finally got going in the 4.h quarter and moved the ball through the air to retake the lead with a field goal. Dallas was driving down the field, but Felix Jones (3-19) fumbled the ball away after running into his own linemen. Brown picked up the free ball for New York to produce another field goal that was a critical score. The Cowboys drove the ball through the air later in the 4.h, primarily with "

   "comment":"Manning has a tired arm. He may also be fatigued mentally because he made numerous terrible decisions in this contest. He made consecutive poor mistakes in the second half, firing dumb interceptions, both of which led to Cincinnati touchdowns. He was also strip-sacked. Manning finished 29-of-46 for just 215 yards otherwise.    The offensive performance can't be blamed entirely on Manning though. New York's pass protection was terrible; the offensive line surrendered 4 sacks. "

   "comment":"Manning, who was sacked only once. Meanwhile, the Packers' linemen couldn't block the Giants whatsoever. Rodgers was constantly under pressure, getting sacked 5 times. Mathias Kiwanuka recorded 2 sacks, while Osi Umenyiora, who registered a sack and a forced fumble, showed signs of life for the first time all season. Having a healthy Antrel Rolle was also a major boost. Rodgers ended up 14-of-25 for 219 yards, an early touchdown to Jordy Nelson (2-71) who beat Corey Webster for a 61-yard score, an interception and a lost fumble. Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.    Only 3 Packer non-running backs made receptions: Nelson, Jermichael Finley (3-51) and Randall Cobb (4-39). Finley dropped a pass, but he showed great awareness by running from out of the screen and catching a ball that was tipped in the air.    Going back to Manning, he displayed no remnants of a tired arm that plagued him prior to the bye. Save for an ugly overthrow in the end zone on the opening drive, Manning was pretty much flawless, going 16-of-30 for 249 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Manning's scores went to "

Manning overthrew his target near the end of the first quarter for a second pick. 4. Wilson was stripped for a fumble returned for a touchdown. He wasn't on the field after that. He finished with 19 yards on 7 carries, absolutely killing his fantasy owners. 5. A weird bounce on a punt bounced off an unaware Giant. 6."

   "comment":"Manning was sacked thrice in the first 6 minutes and 6 times overall in the first half. The unit was also guilty of a holding penalty that negated a nice-looking David Wilson touchdown run when the game was still close. Right after the Wilson score was taken off the board, Manning took a sack, which set up a long field goal that was missed. The result of this poor blocking was disastrous outside of that blown scoring opportunity. The Giants mustered just 2 first downs and 18 total net yards by halftime. The team's fans on the forum all agreed that this was the worst offensive performance they've ever seen.    As you may guess, Eli Manning struggled immensely because he had no time to throw. By the time the Panthers went up 31-0, Manning was just 6-of-11 for 37 yards and an ugly interception that he fired into double coverage. Manning finished 12-of-23 for 119 yards and the pick.

Dallas answered with DeMarco Murray (14-86 rushing, 3-40 receiving) as he ripped off a few chunk runs including a 30-yarder. A screen to Lance Dunbar set up Romo to throw a rope to Jason Witten (4-37) for a 20-yard touchdown. A ridiculous penalty on Brandon Carr took away a fumble that Dallas recovered, and the Giants took advantage of the break. Brandon Jacobs (9-75) took the ball to the 5-yard line on a 36-yard run, but the Giants had to settle for a field goal. The Cowboys fumbled the ball away during the third quarter, but a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on Mathias Kiwanuka negated the fumble. A few plays later, Romo threw a short touchdown pass to Witten. The Giants quickly answered with a 27-yard touchdown to Brandon Myers (3-39). He made a leaping catch along the sideline and was on the ground. but neither Bruce Carter or Heath tagged him down. Myers got up and ran 10 yards into the end zone. Manning moved the ball down the field as the 4.h quarter wound down. A 22-yard pass to Cruz (2-27) set up the Giants inside the 10. Manning hit "

The first wasn't really his fault because Victor Cruz had the ball bounce out of his hands and into a Seattle defender's. The second was foolish, as Manning tried to challenge Richard Sherman for some reason."

   "comment":"Manning was taken down awkwardly at the end of the first half. He hobbled into the locker room to receive X-rays on his leg, and he was ruled out for the rest of the game. It turned out to be an ankle sprain. That didn't seem as bad as William Beatty's injury. Beatty was carted off with his right leg immobilized, and he was ultimately diagnosed with a fractured leg. Rehab will be tough for him this offseason, and this further emphasizes the need the Giants have for a tackle. I may give them 1 in my next    The other big storyline in this contest was Kirk Cousin's dwindling trade stock. Cousins had a great performance against the Falcons 2 weeks ago, but has gotten worse each week. Cousins went 19-of-49 for 169 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. It could've been even worse for Cousins, as the Giants dropped a couple of possible picks. His receivers hurt him with some drops, but Cousins was completely inept, and the Redskins will be lucky to get anything more than a 4.h-round pick for him.    Some other stats/notes: - Manning went 10-of-24 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was nearly pick-sixed on the opening drive. He later hurt his hand and completed just 3 of 10 passes after that before leaving with his ankle sprain. - "

   "comment":"Manning struggled during the exhibition and preseason opener, but he has improved since and was razor sharp in this matchup. Out of 23 first-half passes, he had only 1 incompletion that wasn't dropped compared to 3 touchdowns. He converted first down after first down, moving the sticks on 7-of-9 on third downs prior to intermission. The Redskins, missing DeAngelo Hall, had no answer for New York's aerial attack, and couldn't get any sort of pass rush going. This was puzzling, as Brian Orakpo, Ryan Kerrigan and Jason Hatcher were battling an offensive line with some glaring holes. Manning finished 28-of-39 for 300 yards, 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception. His pick wasn't his fault at all, as "

   "comment":"Manning touchdown. Credit must be give to his offensive line, as Romo had all afternoon to throw for the most part. Bryant, meanwhile, reeled in 9 of the 12 targets thrown his way. As mentioned, he made so many circus catches throughout the contest despite being covered well. He nearly scored a touchdown, getting tackled at the 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter.    Two of Romo's touchdowns went to Gavin Escobar (3-65), while the other was thrown to Terrance Williams (1-18), who curiously saw just 3 targets go his way.    Murray, meanwhile, continued to dominate, as he broke Jim Brown's record for most consecutive 100-yard rushing performances (7) to begin the season. There was a scare, however, as Murray rolled his ankle in the first half and limped off the field. He didn't miss much action, however, and he ultimately gained 128 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries despite the Giants selling out against the run.    The Giants, on the other hand, failed to run the ball against the league's worst rush defense. Andre Williams' poor ability had something to do with that. Looking like a typical Big Ten plodder - though he's not from the Big Ten - Williams managed 51 yards on 18 carries, with 22 of his yards coming on 1 play. Peyton Hillis also saw some action (6-29), even getting a carry on the third down of the opening drive for some reason. It goes without saying that the Giants desperately need Rashad Jennings to return to action.    The Giants didn't lose this game because of their inability to run, however. They simply made too many mistakes. It began early when Will Beatty false started on a 4.h-and-inches attempt. Justin Pugh also had some crucial infractions. Rueben Randle's hold wiped out a long gain. Larry Donnell was most responsible though, as he lost 2 fumbles in his own territory. The first led to a Dallas touchdown, while the second ended the game. New York's errors ruined a quality performance by Eli Manning, who went 21-of-33 for 248 yards and 3 touchdowns. He did not appear to miss Victor Cruz at all. Two of his scores went to Odell Beckham (4-34), while the other was passed to "

   "comment":"Manning heaved a careless pass into the end zone toward Odell Beckham, who was covered by Richard Sherman. Beckham tipped the pass into the air, and the ball sailed right to Earl Thomas. The Seahawks scored on the ensuing drive. On their next possession, they got extremely lucky when both Lynch and Russell Wilson fumbled. The Giants seemed to have a great chance to recover loose footballs, but Seattle inexplicably recovered in both instances. The deflated Giants allowed Lynch to run into the end zone once again. The Seahawks followed that up with another score in garbage time, making it appear as though this game wasn't the close affair that it surely was for 3.and-half quarters.    Despite this game being tight, the Giants still looked completely pathetic trying to stop Seattle's ground attack. The Seahawks rushed for a franchise-record 350 yards, led by Lynch, who tallied 140 yards and a quartet of touchdowns on 21 carries. Lynch was extremely tough and moved the pile on most of his attempts. He'll be missed when he moves on next year, but Seattle fans got a taste of the future, as Christine Michael gained 71 yards on just 4 carries.    Like Lynch, Russell Wilson eclipsed the century barrier on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks designed plenty of runs for Wilson, and the Giants didn't have an answer. They were perplexed every single time. Wilson, however, didn't succeed in the passing game. He went 10-of-17 for 172 yards and 2 interceptions, and he also was pressured quite frequently. One of his picks was forced into tight coverage, while the second was underthrown. He missed an open Jermaine Kearse for a touchdown as well. It was discouraging to see Wilson struggle, given that some of his missing offensive linemen returned for this game.    Kearse was Wilson's leading receiver, catching 3 of his 4 targets for 70 yards. Doug Baldwin had the most balls thrown to him (6), but his 4-31 line was very underwhelming.    The Giants blew this 1 late, but they can at least be encouraged by Beckham's performance. The No. 12 overall pick continued to show flashes of greatness, snagging 7 of his 9 targets for 108 yards. He made several great catches at Seattle, including 2 on a single drive.    Eli Manning went 28-of-43 for 279 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He had a solid afternoon until that game-turning pick. Curiously, Tom Coughlin didn't attempt a pass with Manning at the end of the first half. The Giants had the ball in the red zone with 10 seconds remaining, but he called a run for "

   "comment":"Manning heaved a careless pass into the end zone toward Odell Beckham, who was covered by Richard Sherman. Beckham tipped the pass into the air, and the ball sailed right to Earl Thomas. The Seahawks scored on the ensuing drive. On their next possession, they got extremely lucky when both Lynch and Russell Wilson fumbled. The Giants seemed to have a great chance to recover loose footballs, but Seattle inexplicably recovered in both instances. The deflated Giants allowed Lynch to run into the end zone once again. The Seahawks followed that up with another score in garbage time, making it appear as though this game wasn't the close affair that it surely was for 3.and-half quarters.    Despite this game being tight, the Giants still looked completely pathetic trying to stop Seattle's ground attack. The Seahawks rushed for a franchise-record 350 yards, led by Lynch, who tallied 140 yards and a quartet of touchdowns on 21 carries. Lynch was extremely tough and moved the pile on most of his attempts. He'll be missed when he moves on next year, but Seattle fans got a taste of the future, as Christine Michael gained 71 yards on just 4 carries.    Like Lynch, Russell Wilson eclipsed the century barrier on the ground, scrambling 14 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks designed plenty of runs for Wilson, and the Giants didn't have an answer. They were perplexed every single time. Wilson, however, didn't succeed in the passing game. He went 10-of-17 for 172 yards and 2 interceptions, and he also was pressured quite frequently. One of his picks was forced into tight coverage, while the second was underthrown. He missed an open Jermaine Kearse for a touchdown as well. It was discouraging to see Wilson struggle, given that some of his missing offensive linemen returned for this game.    Kearse was Wilson's leading receiver, catching 3 of his 4 targets for 70 yards. Doug Baldwin had the most balls thrown to him (6), but his 4-31 line was very underwhelming.    The Giants blew this 1 late, but they can at least be encouraged by Beckham's performance. The No. 12 overall pick continued to show flashes of greatness, snagging 7 of his 9 targets for 108 yards. He made several great catches at Seattle, including 2 on a single drive.    Eli Manning went 28-of-43 for 279 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He had a solid afternoon until that game-turning pick. Curiously, Tom Coughlin didn't attempt a pass with Manning at the end of the first half. The Giants had the ball in the red zone with 10 seconds remaining, but he called a run for "

   "comment":"Manning interceptions. Because Eli had an epically brutal performance, cementing himself as the worst quarterback of the 3 Manning brothers, let's delve into all of his picks: Manning's first interception was telegraphed. His second was 1 of the worst throws in NFL history. It was unclear whom Manning was targeting because he lofted a weak-armed duck to a 49er player with no teammate in the vicinity. His third was a terrible overthrow. His 4.h occurred because he was hit as he released the ball. The fifth should've never happened; after stupidly throwing 3 fades in the red zone - horrible play-calling because fades seldom work - the Giants should've tried a field goal. They were down 6 with 4:30 remaining on the clock, so going for 3 made a lot of sense. Tom Coughlin foolishly went for it, and Manning proceeded to throw his fifth pick on a deflection.    Manning finished 22-of-45 for 280 yards, 1 touchdown and the 5 picks. He had some nice throws during the afternoon, but his interceptions were back-breakers. The Giants played evenly with the 49ers, but the turnovers were the difference.    The silver lining for the Giants was that Odell Beckham looked great once again. He caught 6 balls for 93 yards, including a fantastic sideline grab. "

Beckham caught 2 touchdowns, 1 of which was what Cris Collinsworth referred to as the greatest catch he's ever seen. If you haven't watched it yet, your TV must not work because every network has replayed the reception about 5 billion times, give or take a hundred grand. Beckham, who was being dragged down by a helpless Brandon Carr, somehow snatched the ball behind his head with 3 fingers, as he extended 1 arm to retrieve the pass and used his other arm to help him fall inbounds and into the end zone. Something like that shouldn't be humanly possible, and there's real potential that Beckham is some sort of football cyborg. Beckham finished with 10 catches (on 11 targets) for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he should've even had a much better performance. Beckham sprinted past the coverage and was wide open downfield late in the third quarter on what would've been an 87-yard touchdown, but Manning inexplicably didn't see him. Beckham left the game briefly with an injury, but he turned out to be fine.    Manning, despite that blemish, had a strong rebound performance off his 5.interception outing.

Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown."

   "comment":"Manning engineered a brilliant, last-second touchdown drive despite the fact that the top 3 receivers on his roster were injured. Odell Beckham had been enjoying a terrific evening - 7 catches, 121 yards, 1 touchdown - but left with a hamstring injury. Rueben Randle (5-42) was ruled out with the same malady. It was unknown if Beckham could return, and he wasn't on the field during the first half of the final drive. Beckham reentered the field midway through and actually said a prayer that he could stay healthy. He didn't catch a ball, but drew a crucial pass interference flag that set up Larry Donnell (6-35) with a game-winning touchdown. Donnell caught the pass over 2 San Francisco players, including NaVorro Bowman, and somehow hung on to the ball despite it being above his head as he was falling down out of the back of the end zone.    Eli Manning finished 41-of-54 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, which was a poor underthrow into the end zone at the end of the first half. Manning was terrific considering all of the injuries. He was throwing passes to guys named "

   "comment":"Manning's interception gave the Jets new life. A field goal, followed by a touchdown, and then an overtime scoring drive helped them steal a game that appeared to be lost.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was excellent for the second week in a row, as it appears as though he's completely over his thumb injury. Fitzpatrick went 36-of-50 for 390 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 5 times for 22 rushing yards. Granted, the Giants have a horrible secondary, but Fitzpatrick was impressive nonetheless.    Three Jets accumulated more than 90 receiving yards. Two were the usual suspects. Brandon Marshall reeled in 12 of his 13 targets for 131 yards and a touchdown, which sent the game into overtime. Eric Decker (8-101) did most of his work in the second half. The third Jet was Bilal Powell, who was thrown to 13 times. Powell accumulated 8 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Powell didn't do much on the ground, which was expected. Chris Ivory gained 47 yards on 10 carries. He was given just 3 attempts after intermission because the Jets were behind so much and had to go into catch-up mode. It's a shame, as Ivory looked great, aside from his fumble. There was 1 carry where he broke 3 tackles and made a nasty spin move to pick up a 20-yard gain. The Giants were guilty of horrid tackling early on.    The Giants, meanwhile, screwed up as well. They seemed to be gifted a victory, but they threw it all away, beginning with Manning's interception. After that, Odell Beckham couldn't locate a deep pass and then was flagged for kicking the ball out of frustration. This was capped off by a 48-yard missed field goal in overtime to give the Jets the win.    "

The Giants then had more success moving the ball, but Beckham sustained an injury. He left the game, came back in after 1 play, and then limped into the locker room. He was diagnosed with a hip pointer, but managed to return. With some renewed optimism, things quickly changed when Manning threw an interception as a result of Sterling Shepard falling down."

   "comment":"Manning found a wide-open Roger Lewis, thanks to a blown coverage by Jaylen Watkins, who was later flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty. Wentz settled down afterward, though he struggled in the red zone and had some issues with his accuracy. However, Doug Pederson picked up the slack in terms of crushing his own team with mistakes. Pederson went for it twice on 4.h-and-short in the opening half. I didn't think the decisions were bad, but the play calls were abysmal. The first had Wentz rolling left, which the Giants read easily, smothering him for a loss. The second was 1 of the slowest-developing runs the NFL has ever seen, and Darren Sproles was predictably stuffed. That wasn't all for Pederson, as he constantly called ineffective read plays for Wentz, which didn't do anything. Pederson also had a horrible challenge on 1 play in the third quarter, burning a timeout. It was 1 of 2 timeouts Pederson wasted in the second half, costing the Eagles 1 more possession. Despite all of this, as well as a blocked field goal, the Eagles still had a chance to win at the very end. They had 2 possessions deep in Giants territory, but high passes, drops and quarterback pressures ultimately allowed the Giants to win.    Wentz finished 27-of-47 for 364 yards and the 2 picks. Wentz managed to play well in between the 20s after the 2 early turnovers, but he constantly sailed passes over his receivers' heads in the red zone. He also made some dumb mental mistakes. For instance, he took a 5-yard sack by running out of bounds and not throwing the ball away. He also threw short of the third-down marker on third down on a couple of occasions. He was lucky to have just 2 interceptions, as he was nearly picked off a couple more times. He also underthrew Jordan Matthews and someone named Bryce Treggs for 2 potential touchdowns.    If there's a silver lining for the Eagles, it's that Wentz finally developed a connection with Zach Ertz. The talented tight end had done nothing all year, but he caught all 8 of his targets for 97 yards, eating the Giants' linebacking corps alive. Ertz missed some action with a minor injury, but he wasn't out long. Matthews (6-88) was next on the receiving chart. Nelson Agholor, meanwhile, dropped some passes and fumbled the ball, but was fortunate enough to recover it.    Sproles once again carried the load for the Eagles. He gained 57 yards on 13 carries, but was stuffed on that aforementioned 4.h-and-1 play. He also nearly scored on a punt return, but barely stepped out of bounds. Ryan Mathews found the end zone, but was given just 5 carries, which he turned into 15 yards. Kenjon Barner also had a touchdown on his only attempt.    Following the 2 early touchdown following Wentz's interceptions, the Giants barely did anything on offense. It didn't help that stud guard Justin Pugh sustained an injury in the first quarter. Still, the Giants had just 2 positive drives that didn't come off Philadelphia turnovers on the afternoon. Eli Manning finished 22-of-36 for 257 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He was nearly picked a third time by McLeod, but the ball barely hit the ground. Manning struggled following halftime, going 7-of-14 for 82 yards and 2 picks. Neither interception was really his fault, however, as the first 1 occurred when "

   "comment":"Manning overthrew him on the first drive, as Beckham torched Joe Haden.    Manning accumulated 3 touchdowns, but struggled once again. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-27 for only 194 yards. That is a truly horrible stat line against 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Most quarterbacks have torched the Browns this year, so it has to be very discouraging for the Giants that Manning couldn't do much. He should've been able to make several downfield throws, but was just inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't all Manning's fault, as his offensive line had issues keeping the Browns out of the backfield. Cleveland sacked Manning once, but that's not indicative of the pressure Manning saw. Rookie Emmnauel Ogbah put some good heat on the Giant signal-caller.    Excluding Beckham, only 1 Giant had more than 18 receiving yards. That was "

So what happened? Well, the return of stud guard Justin Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive.

   "comment":"Manning pass, the Redskins needed another score to either win or force overtime. They moved into New York territory, but Cousins was pressured once again. He moved to his left, which forced a weak throw to Pierre Garcon. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie snatched the interception to seal the victory for the Giants. Cousins finished 22-of-35 for 287 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Cousins is getting a ton of flak on Twitter, with a hilarious Jordan meme where Michael Jordan's face replaced Cousins during the iconic You like that? moment. However, while Cousins is partly to blame for the pick, the Redskins' offensive line is mostly at fault. The pressure they allowed prompted the losing pick. The other interception occurred because his receiver fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie also snatched that 1.    The only 2 successful targets for Cousins happened to be Garcon (4-96) and Jordan Reed (5-40, TD). Garcon made a great play to elude numerous tacklers on a third-and-17 in the red zone to set up the touchdown. DeSean Jackson didn't do much, catching 2 balls for 34 yards. The scuttlebutt is that Jackson will sign with the Eagles this offseason.    Robert Kelley didn't have any sort of success, mustering only 33 yards on 12 carries. He was stuffed by Kelvin Sheppard on a third-and-1 in the opening quarter.    As for the Giants, their offense once again did just enough to prevail. Eli Manning went an underwhelming 17-of-27 for 180 yards, but his 44-yard connection with Tavarres King set up the decisive field goal."

   "comment":"Manning was constantly under siege, and many of his throws were inaccurate as a result. Beckham obviously would've helped, but the pressure was too much for the aging quarterback to handle. Manning finished 29-of-38 for 221 yards and an interception, but most of his yardage came in garbage time once the Cowboys took their foot off the gas. Manning had just 33 yards by halftime, and the Giants as a whole didn't achieve a first down until the 11:49 mark of the second quarter. Manning's pick wasn't really his fault, as his team was way down already and he just tried to make something happen.    "

   "comment":"Manning dropped back to throw a pass, but never got it off. The Seahawks got a lot of pressure on him and he fumbled. Seattle recovered and made a terrific play next. On the ensuing possession, Pete Carroll dialed up a bit of trickery. Russell Wilson handed the ball to halfback J.D. McKissic, who lateralled it back to Wilson. The Seahawks quarterback then launched the ball downfield to Paul Richardson, who went up and caught the ball. Landon Collins also got his hands on it as well, and shades of the Fail Mary game surfaced as the officials reviewed the call. Ultimately, Richardson's 38-yard touchdown stood, and that was the difference-maker for this contest. Still, this was not a great performance for the Seahawks. They once again struggled in the first half, and their blocking wasn't good for yet another week. Wilson was under pressure from the Giants' edge rushers for most of the day and constantly had to move outside the pocket. He was called for intentional grounding a couple times and a less-mobile quarterback would have been sacked far more than once. Against a stronger team, the Seahawks may not have emerged victorious in this contest.    Wilson's final numbers look very good; he went 27-of-39 for 334 yards and 3 touchdowns. But he did have some issues of his own. He had some overthrows on passes, and notably missed Doug Baldwin for what would have been a wide-open touchdown. That said, the positives far outweighed the negatives. Wilson made some beautiful touch passes and was able to have great ball placement on almost all of his accurate throws. On 1 of his touchdowns, he found Baldwin over the middle of the field and lofted a perfect touch pass to him for the 22-yard score. The ball lofted over the linebackers and was 1 of his best throws on the day. In fact, all his touch passes were near perfect today, and that was his biggest strength. Wilson will continue to perform well, but the Seahawks need to get him help so he doesn't have to carry the team.    Wilson's top receivers on the day were Doug Baldwin (9-92, 1 TD) and Jimmy Graham (3-51, 1 TD). Baldwin led the team with a whopping 12 targets. He demonstrated great chemistry with Wilson and was able to find space all across the field and use his elusiveness to gain extra yards. Baldwin has a lot of upside in fantasy, and can be a WR1 some weeks. Meanwhile, Graham's performance was a mixed bag, but he also had a couple of drops. On 1 play, he dropped a touchdown that hit him in the chest. The defender was close to him, but it was a makeable grab. The more egregious 1 came when Wilson hit him in the chest on a deep ball. Graham let it hit the ground, but he could have had a touchdown. Graham is still a TE1, but he needs to improve his hands to help the team.    The run offense was once again an issue for the Seahawks. They used multiple running backs, but it's clear that they are missing Chris Carson. Eddie Lacy saw 11 carries, but only notched 34 yards. Thomas Rawls also saw 11 carries and did about the same, garnering 36 yards. Perhaps the most impressive of the group was J.D. McKissic, who had 5 touches for 33 scrimmage yards. He has explosive play-making ability, so he may have a chance to earn a bigger role with the team. ,li&gt; For the Giants, they deserve praise for keeping pace with the Seahawks early on. But it's clear that their offense is not going to be able to keep the team competitive this year. Eli Manning had a poor performance against the Seahawks. The veteran quarterback has regressed, and he's looking like 1 of the worse signal-callers in the NFL. At halftime, Manning only had 17 passing yards despite the Giants having the lead. Manning's arm strength is no longer there, and his downfield accuracy has suffered as a result. Of course, Manning has been operating without his top-three passing options in the past couple weeks, but the Giants still had no chance against the Seahawks. Manning was dinking and dunking against a defense known for solid tackling and pursuit abilities. That was not a recipe for success. Overall, Manning went 19-of-39 for 134 yards and 1 touchdown. He also fumbled. Manning's numbers are indicative of his declining ability. Manning isn't capable of leading the Giants to the playoffs, so they need to think about replacing him this offseason.    The top target for Manning on Sunday was far and away "

   "comment":"Manning every game, but when it's 31-13 in the 4.h quarter, should Webb be given a look? The Giants have a big decision to make in 5-and-a-half months, so they probably figure out what they have in Webb!    The 49ers got their first win of the season, and it was only a matter of time because they had played a lot of tough football against a number of teams this season. The lone negative for the 49ers is they are no longer in pole position to land the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. The winless Browns now are on track to get that selection. The Giants, meanwhile, lost a winnable game, and this further illustrates that New York is in free fall. The No. 1 pick is probably coming down to the Giants or the Browns, which is an utter shocker considering New York was in the playoffs last year after 11 wins.    In the first quarter, the teams exchanged field goals before New York added on 3 more for a 6-3 lead. After driving into San Francisco territory, Manning tried to flip a pass forward while getting sacked by Ronald Blair, but it was ruled a fumble that San Francisco recovered."
