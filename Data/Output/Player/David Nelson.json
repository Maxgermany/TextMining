   "comment":"Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Dave Rayner flubbed the kickoff, hitting Emanuel Cook who was up on the front line. It looked almost like he was trying to knock the ball off an unsuspecting player and get a surprise onside kick, but up 14-7 with the half close to ending, it would make no sense. The Jets went to Greene who picked up 7 yards on a reception and another 15 was added on a personal foul by rookie Marcell Dareus. All of a sudden, they were at the Bills' 14-yard line as the 2.minute warning sounded. After 2 failed plays, Sanchez found Burress wide open for the tying touchdown pass. Buffalo's answer was 2 incompletions and another Maybin sack. New York tried to steal a field goal attempt, but couldn't get past the midfield stripe until the final play of the half. The Bills went right back to picking on Revis to start the second half with an 8-yard pass to Stevie Johnson (8-75 yards, TD), who had his fingerprints all over this result. Ex-Jets receiver Brad Smith picked up 17 yards on a reception and another 3 on an end around as part of a promising drive, but Spiller's inability to find open space ultimately doomed the march, and an awful punt went through the end zone for a touchback. Breathing room really helped New York, which went to the running game with Greene (13-78) and Joe McKnight (4-21), who probably should have been given a few more rushing attempts in this 1. The third player to touch the ball on this drive was Dustin Keller, who caught his second touchdown to put the Jets ahead 21-14. Things were looking good for the home team when the defense held, but Antonio Cromartie muffed the punt and Buffalo smartly went right after him throwing to Smith for a 36-yard touchdown to tie the game right back up. He tipped the ball to himself while Cromartie, who has to be wondering what to get all of his kids for Christmas, lost his balance. Sanchez (17-for-35 180 yards, 4 TDs, 1 INT) threw 3 incompletions to kill the Jets' next drive, distributing his targets (Burress, Patrick Turner, Holmes). At least they backed the Bills' up, including a 10-yard holding penalty on the punt. Buffalo had a nice march taking the game into the 4.h quarter, overcoming a 15-yard personal foul on lineman Erik Pears along the way and twice converting third downs. New York stiffened up on defense and Rayner tried to make amends for his kickoff flub by giving his team the 24-21 lead on a booming 53-yard field goal. After a quick exchange of punts, I pointed out on Twitter that the time was now for Sanchez and the Jets, even with 5:44 remaining. They responded. After drawing boos earlier in the game, the New York signal caller shook off his day-long inaccuracy by completing passes to convert a pair of third downs. Sanchez was 6-for-8 on what wound up being the winning drive for 65 yards and his final touchdown pass to, who else, Holmes covering 16 yards with 1:09 left on the clock. Keep in mind Sanchez entered the drive 11-for-27. The Bills came out in shotgun formation for their last ditch effort to pull out a victory and drove right down to the Jets' 27-yard line with quick passes to Nelson and Scott Chandler, plus some scrambling from Fitzpatrick, who smartly ran out of bounds on both scampers."

   "comment":"Nelson for a 24-yarder on a third-and-10. He went on to misfire on just 4 of his 12 passes following intermission. He was especially lethal out of the pocket, scrambling for 44 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Smith finished 17-of-27 for 190 yards. He had the early aforementioned misfires and later overthrew Nelson for a touchdown. He was also lucky to get away with an interception thrown late across his body. However, Smith had a solid performance overall, and it's definitely something to build on heading into the 2014 campaign.    Both of New York's scores came on the ground. I already mentioned Smith's touchdown. Rookie defensive tackle "
