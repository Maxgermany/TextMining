  "comment":"David Nelson for a 24-yarder on a third-and-10. He went on to misfire on just 4 of his 12 passes following intermission. He was especially lethal out of the pocket, scrambling for 44 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Smith finished 17-of-27 for 190 yards. He had the early aforementioned misfires and later overthrew Nelson for a touchdown. He was also lucky to get away with an interception thrown late across his body. However, Smith had a solid performance overall, and it's definitely something to build on heading into the 2014 campaign.    Both of New York's scores came on the ground. I already mentioned Smith's touchdown. Rookie defensive tackle ",
