I called for Phil Simms' firing a couple of weeks ago, and I'm once again going to repeat that he's 1 of the worst NFL announcers. He's so horrible that I feel like I'm betting against him every Thursday. Simms, at 1 point, told Jim Nantz he can't afford massages. He was obviously not being serious, as his CBS salary is in the 7.figure range, but it just didn't sound quite right. The comment that sparked this bullet point, however, was when Simms stated that the 49ers, down 17 with 3:15 remaining, should punt on a 4.h-and-4. Sure, a comeback wasn't likely at all, but the 49ers could've kept moving the chains and given their quarterback some confidence for next week. There was literally no downside to going for it, yet Simms agreed with the Tomsula brain trust in terms of kicking it away. Simms, who also said that the Seahawks were the defending Super Bowl champions at 1 point, needs to be fired. He's bland, he offers no ideas, and he's infuriating to listen to. And if I have to hear him say, You know, Jim, 1 more time, I might just have a seizure. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
