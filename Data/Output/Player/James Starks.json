   "comment":"Starks drop. It still looked promising though when Green Bay reached the red zone, but Rodgers was intercepted when rolling out of the pocket. Rodgers then threw another interception on a high pass to Jordy Nelson that was tipped and picked. Rodgers missed several throws after that. He had Nelson open for a touchdown, but misfired. He failed to connect with Nelson (10-161) on a couple of other occasions, including a crucial third-and-8 when he fired behind his favorite receiver. However, Rodgers came through in the clutch, finding Randall Cobb for a 48-yard score on the very next play. There was some good and some bad from Rodgers, who finished 25-of-39 for 318 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. This was to be expected though, and he should only be better next week when he takes on the 49ers.    There was also a major plot line regarding Chicago's quarterbacking situation. There was major debate whether Jay Cutler or Josh McCown should start. Cutler, 1-7 against the Packers heading into this contest, actually performed well despite the loss. He went 15-of-24 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that came at the very end on a Hail Mary. Cutler has choked versus Green Bay in the past, but this loss certainly wasn't his fault. His usually reliable weapons had a hand in this defeat. Alshon Jeffery (3-80) lost a fumble in the first half, while Brandon Marshall (6-74, TD) was guilty of a drop on the final drive.    Chicago's defense was ultimately to blame for this loss because it blew a coverage on Cobb's decisive touchdown. It also didn't pay attention on a weird play in which Rodgers fumbled and then Jarrett Boykin ran into the end zone after picking up the football and standing around for what seemed like 10 seconds.    The Bears also struggled to stop the run. Thanks to an ankle injury that continued to hamper him, Eddie Lacy was held in check with 66 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Starks, however, tallied 88 yards on just 11 attempts.    "

Lacy was on the field for a bit, but following some ineffective runs (5 carries, 4 yards), the fat running back was benched in favor of some practice-squad player named John Crockett, who gained 22 yards on 5 carries. Both Crockett and Starks looked much better than Lacy, who needs to lose about 20 pounds.    Richard Rodgers snared all 8 targets of his for 146 yards and the game-winning touchdown. I've heard people lamenting not playing him in fantasy, but his stat line prior to the Hail Mary was 7-85, which is solid, but not great. The play should have never even happened; the Lions could have just tackled Aaron Rodgers without getting him on the face mask - well, they actually did - and Rodgers would've never been in position to win the game with the touchdown.

   "comment":"Starks' hands. However, Rodgers was off the mark on a number of throws and had 2 interceptions that were dropped, 1 of which was by a safety that appeared as though it could go the other way for 6. Rodgers really doesn't have anyone to blame at this point, especially when considering the Giants' already-thin secondary lost Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Eli Apple to groin injuries. Both of Rodgers' primary receivers appear to be healthy, while his offensive line kept him clean the entire night. He wasn't sacked a single time, and there were instances in which he stood in the pocket for 6 or more seconds without anyone even coming close to him. It's mind-boggling that the Giants' high-priced defensive line couldn't generate an sort of heat on Rodgers.    Randall Cobb had a huge performance. Banged up prior to the bye, he used his week off to heal up, and it showed in this contest. He caught 9 of his 11 targets for 108 yards. There was a huge play in which he broke 2 tackles to reach for the first down, ultimately leading to a Green Bay score. Cobb later caught a third-down pass while falling down, which sealed the victory for the Packers. His 1 blemish was a drop.    Rodgers' 2 touchdowns went to Jordy Nelson (4-38) and Davante Adams (5-85). Nelson could've drawn a couple of pass-interference flags downfield, especially 1 on the opening drive, but the officials allowed the teams to play.    Eddie Lacy ran well, gaining 81 yards on just 11 carries. Unfortunately for Lacy, he sustained an ankle injury in the third quarter and never returned. James Starks (12-33) nearly lost the game with a fumble on the final drive, but the Packers were able to recover. Starks also dropped a potential touchdown.    Moving on to the Giants, "

   "comment":"Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2-point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the fourth quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the fourth quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "
