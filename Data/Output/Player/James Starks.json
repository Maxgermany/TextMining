   "comment":"James Starks (8-24) looked better, but he can't be fully trusted because of his fumbling issues.    As for the winning side, it seemed like the Vikings won in spite of Bridgewater. The second-year signal-caller went 10-of-19 for 99 yards and an interception, which was 1 of the most impressive picks I've ever seen. Bridgewater attempted to throw the ball away under pressure. He heaved the ball with his left hand, which "

   "comment":"James Starks (7 carries, 3 yards) is worth mentioning because he was stuffed on a 4.h-and-2 try in the third quarter. That's right - despite having the best quarterback in the NFL and a better running back at his disposal, Mike McCarthy had Starks run the ball on 1 of the most important plays of the game. I don't get it, especially when a field goal on the play would've eventually forced the game into overtime. McCarthy helped lose this game for the Packers with that decision, though there were certainly other factors.   "

   "comment":"James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "
