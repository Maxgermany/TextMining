Those may not be overly impressive numbers at first glance, but they are when you consider that the 49ers ranked third against the run going into this weekend. Pick up Starks immediately.    With Starks running well, everything was clicking for the Packers. "

That's right - despite having the best quarterback in the NFL and a better running back at his disposal, Mike McCarthy had Starks run the ball on 1 of the most important plays of the game. I don't get it, especially when a field goal on the play would've eventually forced the game into overtime. McCarthy helped lose this game for the Packers with that decision, though there were certainly other factors.   "

   "comment":"James Starks' hands. However, Rodgers was off the mark on a number of throws and had 2 interceptions that were dropped, 1 of which was by a safety that appeared as though it could go the other way for 6. Rodgers really doesn't have anyone to blame at this point, especially when considering the Giants' already-thin secondary lost Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Eli Apple to groin injuries. Both of Rodgers' primary receivers appear to be healthy, while his offensive line kept him clean the entire night. He wasn't sacked a single time, and there were instances in which he stood in the pocket for 6 or more seconds without anyone even coming close to him. It's mind-boggling that the Giants' high-priced defensive line couldn't generate an sort of heat on Rodgers.    Randall Cobb had a huge performance. Banged up prior to the bye, he used his week off to heal up, and it showed in this contest. He caught 9 of his 11 targets for 108 yards. There was a huge play in which he broke 2 tackles to reach for the first down, ultimately leading to a Green Bay score. Cobb later caught a third-down pass while falling down, which sealed the victory for the Packers. His 1 blemish was a drop.    Rodgers' 2 touchdowns went to Jordy Nelson (4-38) and Davante Adams (5-85). Nelson could've drawn a couple of pass-interference flags downfield, especially 1 on the opening drive, but the officials allowed the teams to play.    Eddie Lacy ran well, gaining 81 yards on just 11 carries. Unfortunately for Lacy, he sustained an ankle injury in the third quarter and never returned. James Starks (12-33) nearly lost the game with a fumble on the final drive, but the Packers were able to recover. Starks also dropped a potential touchdown.    Moving on to the Giants, "

   "comment":"James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "
