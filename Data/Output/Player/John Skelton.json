Arizona won this abomination of a game, and Ram fans have to feel really discouraged. With Sam Bradford back and Steven Jackson running well, St. Louis should have blown out this miserable Cardinal squad that was playing without its backup quarterback. Instead, they lost, and Bradford didn't look much better than Adam Joshua Feeley did the past 2 weeks; the second-year signal-caller had several overthrows in this contest. Bradford finished 23-of-36 for 255 yards and an interception. He showed an OK rapport with Brandon Lloyd, who hauled in 5 grabs for 80 yards. Lloyd drew a key pass interference at the end of regulation to set up what should have been a Josh Brown game-winning field goal. However, Calais Campbell blocked the kick, which would eventually allow Patrick Peterson to return yet another punt for a touchdown for what would be the decisive score.    Jackson, as mentioned, performed pretty well. He had 130 yards on 29 carries. Chris Wells, meanwhile, had just 20 yards on 10 attempts. The Rams were ranked 31st against the rush going into the contest, but the Rams were selling out against the run because they didn't respect Skelton.

   "comment":"Skelton tried to find Larry Fitzgerald and instead got the ball to Donte Whitner. The 49ers made short work of the short field, needing just 4 plays capped off by an 18-yard pass to Davis for a 23-0 lead and the rout was on. Dashon Goldson ended the Cardinals' next drive with an interception, ending the misery that was Skelton's day. He finished 6-of-19 for 99 yards with 3 picks and a 10.5 QB rating. I'm not convinced Red Skelton would have been worse. After San Francisco stalled and punted, Navorro Bowman came up with the fumble by Peterson who definitely played like a rookie. However, Smith was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Skelton, wouldn't telegraph his passes. Skelton had this issue in a loss at San Francisco back in Week 11. Arizona performed well otherwise in that contest. So, what happened? Kolb suffered a head injury on the opening drive. I thought Skelton would cost his team the game again, and that seemed to be the case when the Cardinals were able to muster just 2 first downs in the opening half. Well, apparently not. Skelton was solid in relief. He made a couple of bad decisions on a pair of interceptions, but was good otherwise, going 19-of-28 for 282 yards, 3 touchdowns and the picks. He also showed great mobility, picking up 25 yards on 6 scrambles. Skelton's second interception was actually challenged by Whisenhunt even though it was painfully obvious that the play wasn't going to be overturned. Whisenhunt should probably be stripped of his red flags because he tried to have yet another clear call reviewed earlier. It was actually a good challenge, but only by accident. The red flag disrupted a San Francisco fake punt that caught Arizona unawares, but the 49ers weren't docked a challenge because the replay equipment malfunctioned for some strange reason.    "

Skelton started hot, going 11-of-17 for 124 yards in the first half, but was just 3-of-11 for only 25 yards and a pick after the break. However, Kolb stepped in and looked much sharper, going 6-of-8 for 66 yards and the decisive touchdown on his only drive. Kolb's score was pretty humorous because Ken Whisenhunt was running down the sideline, trying desperately to call a timeout. He has to be pretty happy that it wasn't granted. At any rate, Skelton suffered a high ankle sprain, but it doesn't matter at this point. Kolb will be starting next week.    Kolb hit "
