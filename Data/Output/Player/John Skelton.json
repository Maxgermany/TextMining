How does that even happen?    Arizona won this abomination of a game, and Ram fans have to feel really discouraged. With Sam Bradford back and Steven Jackson running well, St. Louis should have blown out this miserable Cardinal squad that was playing without its backup quarterback. Instead, they lost, and Bradford didn't look much better than Adam Joshua Feeley did the past 2 weeks; the second-year signal-caller had several overthrows in this contest. Bradford finished 23-of-36 for 255 yards and an interception. He showed an OK rapport with Brandon Lloyd, who hauled in 5 grabs for 80 yards. Lloyd drew a key pass interference at the end of regulation to set up what should have been a Josh Brown game-winning field goal. However, Calais Campbell blocked the kick, which would eventually allow Patrick Peterson to return yet another punt for a touchdown for what would be the decisive score.    Jackson, as mentioned, performed pretty well. He had 130 yards on 29 carries. Chris Wells, meanwhile, had just 20 yards on 10 attempts. The Rams were ranked 31st against the rush going into the contest, but the Rams were selling out against the run because they didn't respect Skelton. And rightfully so - Skelton went 20-of-35 for 222 yards and a touchdown to "

Skelton's second interception was actually challenged by Whisenhunt even though it was painfully obvious that the play wasn't going to be overturned. Whisenhunt should probably be stripped of his red flags because he tried to have yet another clear call reviewed earlier. It was actually a good challenge, but only by accident. The red flag disrupted a San Francisco fake punt that caught Arizona unawares, but the 49ers weren't docked a challenge because the replay equipment malfunctioned for some strange reason.
