   "comment":"Parmele, who rushed for 80 yards on 24 carries. Jennings, meanwhile, had just 3 carries for minus-1 yard. The quarterback position is much more interesting. Henne outplayed Gabbert last week, but I argued that Gabbert should get the final 9 starts so the front office could see if it should in fact move on from him. But this changes things. Henne was terrific, so he should get a chance to prove what he can do in this offense.    Henne's 4 touchdowns went to Blackmon (as mentioned), "

   "comment":"Parmele was expected to start after handling the majority of the workload last week, but that didn't appear to be the case on the box score. Rashad Jennings handled most of the carries , gaining 43 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts. Parmele received just 8 tries (45 yards) because he hurt his leg early in the first quarter. He reentered the game later, but aggravated the injury in the 4.h quarter. He limped off the field and may not be able to play next week.    As for the other runner, "
