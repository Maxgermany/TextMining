He had a sack-fumble of Romo in the third quarter to set up the Bucs at the Cowboys 31-yard line, but the Dallas defense forced a punt.    The Cowboys' first score was set up by a Josh Freeman interception. The ball was deflected into the air by running back D.J. Ware and was snatched by Freeman for playing like absolute trash for 58 minutes and then spending the last 2 engineering 1 of the more epic back-door drives this decade. <i> </i>    The biggest take-away from this game is that the Cowboys' offensive line is horrible and could be the Achilles' heel that ends up sinking the team's season. Dallas' offense really struggled because the players were getting destroyed up front. Gerald McCoy and defensive end Michael Bennett dominated the Cowboys' line. The Tampa Bay defenders produced sacks at clutch times to negate potential points. McCoy had a sack-fumble on Tony Romo to bail out Tampa Bay from allowing at least a field goal. McCoy rocked Romo again in the 4.h quarter, and Dallas was lucky that its quarterback held onto the ball. Doug Free was getting whipped by Bennett for pressures, hits and holding calls.
