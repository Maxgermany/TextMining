He finished 15-of-27 for 133 yards and a score, giving him a discouraging YPA of 4.9. He did his best impression of Trent Green, often throwing short on third downs. However, 1 could argue that Campbell would have been responsible for a couple of interceptions if he went deep. Looks like it's going to take Campbell much longer to learn the West Coast offense than optimistic Redskins fans had hoped.    The Giants won, but I wasn't too convinced by their victory. They jumped out on the Redskins early with a 16-0 lead, but stalled multiple times at midfield afterward. Following a hot start, "

No overly impressive numbers from anyone on St. Louis' offense, though Donnie Avery had 4 catches and 73 yards, including a great, 1.handed, 43-yard grab that set the Rams up for their winning field goal. Torry Holt had 5 catches for 23 yards. Jackson finished with 79 yards on 22 carries. Bulger was 15-of-26 for 136 yards.    Entering this game, the Redskins' offense had no turnovers on the season, which would explain their impressive and unexpected 4-1 record. Well, they had 3 on Sunday, which would explain this loss. This was a tough spot for Washington, coming off 2 consecutive divisional victories on the road. I can't really blame them for being unfocused. That said, there's no excuse for losing to the awful Rams. I thought this game would be close, but allowing Jim Haslett, a makeshift offensive line, a crippled Bulger and a Swiss cheese defense to beat you is inexcusable.    Clinton Portis literally carried the Redskins, compiling 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jason Campbell was 18-of-26 for 208 yards, connecting with Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley 5 times each (87 yards and 57 yards, respectively)."

   "comment":"Campbell was a solid 24-of-37 for 256 yards and an interception. Not a great game by any means, but the good news is that he once again kept his turnovers down. This has been a solid trend ever since Daniel Snyder hired Bingo announcer Sherm Smith about a month ago.    Ladell Betts got the start for the Redskins, but tore his MCL after just 4 carries for 5 yards. Rock Cartwright took over and finished with 140 total yards (67 rushing, 73 receiving). Get him in your fantasy league.    Santana Moss had just 5 grabs for 38 yards. He won't do anything of note as long as this Campbell-Jim Zorn combination resides in Washington.   "

It was nothing fancy, but drive after drive, they marched in for touchdowns in the second quarter. This was supposed to be a hangover game for them flying east on a short week following a late Monday Night Football appearance in Denver. Instead, they were up 21-3 at halftime aided by a missed field goal and turnover leading to a short touchdown drive. When the second half started, everything went back to analyst expectations coming in. Buffalo came out firing on offense and playing aggressive on defense. The offense scored touchdowns all 5 times they touched the ball after the break. The defense forced a fumble on Oakland's first possession and a quick punt on their second possession. By the 4.h quarter, this was an old school AFL shootout with the teams exchanging touchdowns and the lead. Remember the passing stats from earlier? Well, in the final 3 quarters Fitzpatrick and Campbell combined to complete 45 out of 66 attempts for 565 yards and 5 touchdowns.    Campbell's numbers were solid. He completed almost 70 percent of his throws for 323 yards and a couple touchdowns. The interception was on a hail mary play the end the game, so ignore that.

   "comment":"Campbell were 6-of-13 for 32 yards, and the game was scoreless. Oakland got the running game going just enough to move the football with an occasional screen pass to Darren McFadden. It was nothing fancy, but drive after drive, they marched in for touchdowns in the second quarter. This was supposed to be a hangover game for them flying east on a short week following a late Monday Night Football appearance in Denver. Instead, they were up 21-3 at halftime aided by a missed field goal and turnover leading to a short touchdown drive. When the second half started, everything went back to analyst expectations coming in. Buffalo came out firing on offense and playing aggressive on defense. The offense scored touchdowns all 5 times they touched the ball after the break. The defense forced a fumble on Oakland's first possession and a quick punt on their second possession. By the 4.h quarter, this was an old school AFL shootout with the teams exchanging touchdowns and the lead. Remember the passing stats from earlier? Well, in the final 3 quarters Fitzpatrick and Campbell combined to complete 45 out of 66 attempts for 565 yards and 5 touchdowns.    Campbell's numbers were solid. He completed almost 70 percent of his throws for 323 yards and a couple touchdowns. The interception was on a hail mary play the end the game, so ignore that. Campbell was dealing with some different wide receivers with "

   "comment":"Campbell (15-of-35 for 190 yards). Really, neither passer was accurate, and while Schaub chewed up yardage, a lot of it was wasted. Nearly every inch of the Raiders' offense (278 total yards) wound up on the scoreboard thanks to booming field goals by Janikowski from 54, 55, 50 and 42 yards out.    Everything started out fine for Houston. The crowd was raucous with the roof closed and rain pouring down outside. Oakland ran 3 plays and punted. The Texans then got a 20-yard rumble from Arian Foster on his first carry as part of a 65-yard march for a quick 7-0 lead. Little did they know his rushes would be stuffed from that point forward, as he gained only 48 more yards on his 21 additional attempts. You don't need a calculator to figure out how low the average was on those plays. The Houston defense again stood up, forcing a 3.and-out for Oakland, but after converting their 4.h consecutive third down to open the game, Schaub was intercepted by Lamarr Houston on a pass deflected by John Henderson. Tipped passes would be a theme on the day with the Raiders finishing with 6 by my count. This was a turning point when it came to converting third downs. Houston would go just 4-for-16 the rest of the way after having converted their first 4. Even though the defense moved the Raiders back a yard, Janikowski's long field goal made it a 7-3 game. Houston had a 3.and-out, setting up another field goal drive for Oakland of minus-2 yards because Bruce Davis (no relation obviously, but fitting) blocked the punt. Then, Schaub hit tight end Owen Daniels, who had a solid game (7 receptions for 89 yards), for a pickup of 28, but the drive died when Gary Kubiak did not have the confidence to go for it on 4.h down, needing just 2 yards from the Oakland 45. The move paid off with a punt pinning the Raiders at the 2. Campbell immediately threw deep and was intercepted by Jason Allen."

Key passes to Joshua Cribbs and rookie Greg Little set up a 1-yard touchdown to tight end Alex Smith. Any momentum built up by tying the score was quickly extinguished when Jacoby Ford housed the kickoff return to put the Raiders ahead 14-7. Cleveland's offense showed a little life, converting on third down twice, but an 11-play drive covered just 34 yards and died with no points after consecutive incompletions. Later, Oakland was trying to pile on, and appeared ready to, when Campbell lunged toward a first down. He was a yard short and suffered what early reports are saying could be a season-ending injury. Again, Jackson showed the guts to roll the dice and trotted out backup "

   "comment":"Campbell as the starting quarterback. My main issue with Kansas City has been Alex Smith. With many clueless former NFL players foolishly lauding him as this great game-winner, anyone who has really watched these games knows that he's just not very good. His numbers looked pretty decent - 24-of-36 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns - but most of his yardage once again came on short throws that his weapons turned into big gains. He didn't threaten the Browns downfield at all and was nearly intercepted on a couple of occasions. He missed some open receivers, including 1 in the end zone for a potential touchdown because he floated the ball out of bounds. He also took a whopping 6 sacks. Amazingly, Jason Campbell outplayed Smith. Campbell went 22-of-36 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is crazy considering that he was battling the NFL's top defense without any sort of running game. He also endured lots of drops from his receivers, mostly "

The Bengals then scored twice on special teams and defense; a blocked punt was brought back for 6. while Chris Ogbonnaya was guilty of a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. The Bengals were up 31-13 by halftime, yet Dalton had thrown for just 63 yards on 8-of-18 passing. That's the type of weird game this was. The Browns managed just 1 touchdown following the break - a long bomb to Josh Gordon down the sideline. This was a rare, quality throw by Campbell, who had a disastrous afternoon after putting together a few good starts. Campbell's numbers don't look completely terrible - he was 27-of-56 for 248 yards and a touchdown - but he also threw 3 interceptions. His yardage was inflated - he had just 65 yards by halftime, so most of his stats came in garbage time - and he spent the entire afternoon throwing either behind or over his receivers. It's remarkable how inaccurate he was after several strong outings.    Dalton, meanwhile, wasn't any better. He threw 3 touchdowns, but that's a misleading stat, as he went 13-of-27 for 93 yards and the 2 aforementioned interceptions otherwise. He simply couldn't get anything going with Haden smothering his favorite receiver. Green finished with just 2 catches for 7 yards. With Green doing nothing, the Bengals' leading receiver, excluding "

   "comment":"Campbell made sure that didn't happen. I'll have more on Campbell later, but the Cutler-McCown storyline is the most prominent 1. The Bears escaped with a victory, as Cutler went 22-of-31 for 265 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Cutler made some great throws, but the turnovers nearly cost his team a crucial win. McCown did a great job of taking care of the football while also scoring tons of points, so even though the Bears were victorious in this game, that doesn't mean Trestman made the right choice. Cutler's carelessness could be a bigger factor going forward against tougher competition.    Cutler's touchdowns went to "
