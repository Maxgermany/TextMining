   "comment":"Jason Campbell was pretty brutal. He completed his first pass with 1 minute remaining in the second quarter! He finished 15-of-27 for 133 yards and a score, giving him a discouraging YPA of 4.9. He did his best impression of Trent Green, often throwing short on third downs. However, 1 could argue that Campbell would have been responsible for a couple of interceptions if he went deep. Looks like it's going to take Campbell much longer to learn the West Coast offense than optimistic Redskins fans had hoped.    The Giants won, but I wasn't too convinced by their victory. They jumped out on the Redskins early with a 16-0 lead, but stalled multiple times at midfield afterward. Following a hot start, "

Nearly every inch of the Raiders' offense (278 total yards) wound up on the scoreboard thanks to booming field goals by Janikowski from 54, 55, 50 and 42 yards out.    Everything started out fine for Houston. The crowd was raucous with the roof closed and rain pouring down outside. Oakland ran 3 plays and punted. The Texans then got a 20-yard rumble from Campbell (15-of-35 for 190 yards). Really, neither passer was accurate, and while Schaub chewed up yardage, a lot of it was wasted. Nearly every inch of the Raiders' offense (278 total yards) wound up on the scoreboard thanks to booming field goals by Janikowski from 54, 55, 50 and 42 yards out.    Everything started out fine for Houston. The crowd was raucous with the roof closed and rain pouring down outside. Oakland ran 3 plays and punted. The Texans then got a 20-yard rumble from Arian Foster on his first carry as part of a 65-yard march for a quick 7-0 lead. Little did they know his rushes would be stuffed from that point forward, as he gained only 48 more yards on his 21 additional attempts. You don't need a calculator to figure out how low the average was on those plays. The Houston defense again stood up, forcing a 3.and-out for Oakland, but after converting their 4.h consecutive third down to open the game, Schaub was intercepted by Lamarr Houston on a pass deflected by John Henderson. Tipped passes would be a theme on the day with the Raiders finishing with 6 by my count. This was a turning point when it came to converting third downs. Houston would go just 4-for-16 the rest of the way after having converted their first 4. Even though the defense moved the Raiders back a yard, Janikowski's long field goal made it a 7-3 game. Houston had a 3.and-out, setting up another field goal drive for Oakland of minus-2 yards because Bruce Davis (no relation obviously, but fitting) blocked the punt. Then, Schaub hit tight end Owen Daniels, who had a solid game (7 receptions for 89 yards), for a pickup of 28, but the drive died when Gary Kubiak did not have the confidence to go for it on 4.h down, needing just 2 yards from the Oakland 45. The move paid off with a punt pinning the Raiders at the 2. Campbell immediately threw deep and was intercepted by Jason Allen."

Key passes to Joshua Cribbs and rookie Campbell fell on his face on a scramble and fumbled, setting up the Browns at the Raiders' 46-yard line. Key passes to Joshua Cribbs and rookie Greg Little set up a 1-yard touchdown to tight end Alex Smith. Any momentum built up by tying the score was quickly extinguished when Jacoby Ford housed the kickoff return to put the Raiders ahead 14-7. Cleveland's offense showed a little life, converting on third down twice, but an 11-play drive covered just 34 yards and died with no points after consecutive incompletions. Later, Oakland was trying to pile on, and appeared ready to, when Campbell lunged toward a first down. He was a yard short and suffered what early reports are saying could be a season-ending injury. Again, Jackson showed the guts to roll the dice and trotted out backup "

The Bengals then scored twice on special teams and defense; a blocked punt was brought back for 6. while Chris Ogbonnaya was guilty of a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. The Bengals were up 31-13 by halftime, yet Dalton had thrown for just 63 yards on 8-of-18 passing. That's the type of weird game this was. The Browns managed just 1 touchdown following the break - a long bomb to Josh Gordon down the sideline. This was a rare, quality throw by Campbell, who had a disastrous afternoon after putting together a few good starts. Campbell's numbers don't look completely terrible - he was 27-of-56 for 248 yards and a touchdown - but he also threw 3 interceptions. His yardage was inflated - he had just 65 yards by halftime, so most of his stats came in garbage time - and he spent the entire afternoon throwing either behind or over his receivers. It's remarkable how inaccurate he was after several strong outings.    Dalton, meanwhile, wasn't any better. He threw 3 touchdowns, but that's a misleading stat, as he went 13-of-27 for 93 yards and the 2 aforementioned interceptions otherwise. He simply couldn't get anything going with Haden smothering his favorite receiver. Green finished with just 2 catches for 7 yards. With Green doing nothing, the Bengals' leading receiver, excluding "
