   "comment":"Jason Campbell was pretty brutal. He completed his first pass with 1 minute remaining in the second quarter! He finished 15-of-27 for 133 yards and a score, giving him a discouraging YPA of 4.9. He did his best impression of Trent Green, often throwing short on third downs. However, 1 could argue that Campbell would have been responsible for a couple of interceptions if he went deep. Looks like it's going to take Campbell much longer to learn the West Coast offense than optimistic Redskins fans had hoped.    The Giants won, but I wasn't too convinced by their victory. They jumped out on the Redskins early with a 16-0 lead, but stalled multiple times at midfield afterward. Following a hot start, "

I'd say it's been the worst I've ever seen, but I don't want to be fined by Roger Goodell.    That said, Campbell needs to be complimented for improving every week and learning Jim Zorn's West Coast offense very quickly. Campbell, who was 20-of-31 for 231 yards and 2 touchdowns, was a huge thorn in Dallas' side, as he kept moving the chains on third downs, and did a great job evading Dallas' pass rushers. The Cowboys had him dead to rights a couple of times, but he maneuvered his way out of sacks and located his receivers downfield.    And by receivers, I mean "

   "comment":"Jason Campbell tipped pass that landed in the arms of offensive lineman Pete Kendall. Instead of falling on the ground, Kendall started running and was subsequently stripped.    No overly impressive numbers from anyone on St. Louis' offense, though Donnie Avery had 4 catches and 73 yards, including a great, 1.handed, 43-yard grab that set the Rams up for their winning field goal. Torry Holt had 5 catches for 23 yards. Jackson finished with 79 yards on 22 carries. Bulger was 15-of-26 for 136 yards.    Entering this game, the Redskins' offense had no turnovers on the season, which would explain their impressive and unexpected 4-1 record. Well, they had 3 on Sunday, which would explain this loss. This was a tough spot for Washington, coming off 2 consecutive divisional victories on the road. I can't really blame them for being unfocused. That said, there's no excuse for losing to the awful Rams. I thought this game would be close, but allowing Jim Haslett, a makeshift offensive line, a crippled Bulger and a Swiss cheese defense to beat you is inexcusable.    Clinton Portis literally carried the Redskins, compiling 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jason Campbell was 18-of-26 for 208 yards, connecting with Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley 5 times each (87 yards and 57 yards, respectively)."

With a trip to London coming up, Denver assumed that it could just show up and beat the crappy Raiders. The Broncos put absolutely no effort into this contest, and Josh McDaniels should be completely embarrassed for failing to prepare his team.    Darren McFadden was unbelievable. Despite telling the media that he was just 70 percent, McFadden rushed for 165 yards and 3 touchdowns on 16 carries. He had a 4.h score on a reception (2 catches, 31 yards). Raider fans have to be asking why McFadden hasn't produced like this in the past 2 years.    Jason Campbell did not look like a skinny version of JaMarcus Russell this week; he went 12-of-20 for 204 yards and 2 scores. His second touchdown went to "

Pittsburgh completely dominated Oakland, outgaining them 431-182 (228-52 in the first half). It was so frustrating for the Raiders that Richard Seymour threw a punch at Ben Roethlisberger and was ejected from the game.    The Raiders just couldn't move the chains at all.

   "comment":"Jason Campbell as the starting quarterback. My main issue with Kansas City has been Alex Smith. With many clueless former NFL players foolishly lauding him as this great game-winner, anyone who has really watched these games knows that he's just not very good. His numbers looked pretty decent - 24-of-36 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns - but most of his yardage once again came on short throws that his weapons turned into big gains. He didn't threaten the Browns downfield at all and was nearly intercepted on a couple of occasions. He missed some open receivers, including 1 in the end zone for a potential touchdown because he floated the ball out of bounds. He also took a whopping 6 sacks. Amazingly, Jason Campbell outplayed Smith. Campbell went 22-of-36 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is crazy considering that he was battling the NFL's top defense without any sort of running game. He also endured lots of drops from his receivers, mostly "
