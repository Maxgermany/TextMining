   "comment":"Gordon lost a fumble. Those 3 turnovers by the Chargers played a big part in their early deficit with 1 interception returned for a touchdown and the other 2 turnovers halting what were nice drives. So in reality, San Diego's surge wasn't exactly out of the blue.    Except for a couple of poor throws on his interceptions, Philip Rivers was on target all game, completing 35-of-42 passes for 404 yards and 2 touchdowns. A whopping 17 of those passes were aimed at Keenan Allen, who caught 15 - yes, 15 - for 166 yards. Allen was unstoppable on short to intermediate routes and picked up nice yards after the catch, highlighted by a third-and-19 situation when he caught an underneath pass and gained 20 yards for the first down.    The next most-targeted Charger, with 7, was Danny Woodhead, who took a back seat to Melvin Gordon on the first few drives, but as soon as the Chargers were down by over 2 touchdowns, Woodhead was the main back due to his pass-catching/pass-blocking ability. Woodhead caught 4 passes for 20 yards, but did most of his damage on the ground as he rushed 12 times for 42 yards and 2 touchdowns. Both touchdowns came in the red zone, with 1 being a draw play from 9 yards out. The other score was a 1-yard goal-line run with 6 minutes left in the game. Gordon is more suited for goal-line carries, but his fumble earlier in the game may have given the coaching staff pause with the lead 26-21 at the time.    Melvin Gordon looked excellent early in the game with strong, chain-moving runs, yet also showed agile feet and good hands as he caught 3 passes. This came against a strong Lions run defense and bodes well for games in which the Chargers get early leads. He finished with 14 carries for 51 yards and 3 receptions on 3 targets for 16 yards.    Matthew Stafford finished with a 63-percent completion rate, but couldn't get his top receivers, "

   "comment":"Gordon's disappointing preseason seems like a million years ago. Gordon gashed the Bengals, who have a shaky run defense. He gained 88 yards on 16 carries, though he lost touches to Woodhead, who accumulated 36 rushing yards (7 carries) and 68 receiving yards (6 catches). Gordon will continue to see the majority of the workload, and he'll have a greater percentages of touches when the team isn't in catch-up mode. However, Woodhead, who had just 3 touches by halftime, will be a big part of the offense when San Diego is trailing.   "

   "comment":"Gordon didn't fare as well as he did last week, with the Vikings living in the Chargers' backfield. This offensive line will need to step up its game for Gordon to put up fantasy numbers, but it was good to see Gordon in the game even when the Chargers were trailing.    San Diego still has plenty of offensive weapons, and if the line could have picked up a few more blitzes, Rivers could have picked the Vikings apart, but it all fell on this offensive line this week and the unit couldn't hold up under the pressure.

   "comment":"Gordon benched for the first half due to his fumbles in Green Bay last week, Woodhead and Brandon Oliver were the main backs, with Woodhead taking over in hurry-up.    The Raiders looked much better post-bye than pre-bye, which leads me to believe the talent is here; they are just having trouble finding consistency. That falls on the coaching staff, so if we get another stretch of not-so-great play, I'll be looking straight at head coach, Jack of the River.    Neither team had much pass rush, which helped these 2 teams throw for more than 600 combined yards, but the 2 turnovers by Rivers look like the deciding factor after the Chargers stormed back. As usual, when you win the turnover battle, your odds of winning are greatly improved.   "

   "comment":"Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the fourth quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a fourth-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a fourth-and-7 with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the fourth quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.

   "comment":"Gordon fumbled, the punter booted it out of bounds for 19 yards - and then the officials basically gave the Raiders a touchdown after a 5-minute conference in which they completely screwed up every single aspect of the call. They ruled a pass interference when there was barely any contact (and both announcers agreed); they said that Amari Cooper didn't step out of bounds when he did; and they said Cooper didn't catch the pass, when it was clear that he did. Of course, the Raiders challenged the latter aspect and weren't rewarded with the touchdown when they should have been. Yet, the Raiders took over at the 1-yard line, giving them an even score. And this wasn't even the craziest sequence of the game! That would be the botched hold which ruined yet another potential Chargers win. Oh, Chargers...    For the Raiders to keep pace with the Denver Broncos in the AFC West and in the wild-card race, they needed to come through with a victory over a reeling team like San Diego. Once again, the Chargers hurt themselves with second-half turnovers and botched fundamentals to cost them another shot at a winnable game.    On the opening drive, Brandon Mebane picked off a screen pass as Derek Carr made a bad mistake, throwing the ball into a crowd of defenders. However, the Chargers gave it right back as Antonio Gates fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Perry Riley with Reggie Nelson recovering for Oakland. The Raiders responded with Carr using Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree to move the ball down the field. Oakland was stopped on the goal line to settle for a short field goal. Promptly, Rivers tossed an underthrown pass that was picked off by Sean Smith and returned into San Diego territory, but Sebastian Janikowski missed the field goal. The Chargers got moving and Rivers hit Tyrell Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned "

   "comment":"Gordon struggled to find running room for the most part, but finally broke free for a 48-yard gain in the third quarter. Gordon dashed for 94 yards on 27 carries.    Before moving on to the Broncos, I have to say that this was definitely a feel-good moment for Mike McCoy, who was set to be fired if the Chargers lost this game. A teary-eye McCoy addressed the media, which called for his firing during the week, and he told them that he met with his daughter right after the game.    Denver struggled to move the chains until garbage time at the end that nearly turned into an improbable comeback. The Broncos were limited to 60 net yards of offense in the opening half. Part of this was because the Chargers controlled the clock, holding the ball for 20:27 of 30 first-half minutes. The other part was that the entire offense was both ineffective and mistake-prone. Trevor Siemian struggled. His final numbers don't look horrible - 30-of-50, 230 yards, 1 touchdown - but at the end of the third quarter, he was just 10-of-19 for only 58 yards. He didn't have any significant yardage, as most came with the Broncos down 2 or 3 scores and the Chargers turning into a prevent defense that nearly lost them the game. It's unknown why they changed their strategy, but it nearly clost them. Siemian had chances to score points in meaningful action, but missed throws. He had "

   "comment":"Gordon led the NFL in rushing touchdowns entering this weekend and had 108 yards on the ground at that point in the contest, yet San Diego didn't give him a single attempt. Rivers threw the ball 4 times instead, and he was under such heavy pressure that he had to throw 2 of those passes away. Rivers went to his tight ends after that, but couldn't connect, turning the ball over on downs. The Chargers had 1 more chance after that, but without being able to pound the rock with Gordon as time was running out, they didn't have much of a chance.    Not running with Gordon on a single occasion on the goal-to-go situation was strange. Gordon gained 111 yards on 23 carries, and he had a 20-yard burst on that very drive. He was excellent against the Broncos, who have been weaker versus the rush than the pass. Not giving him 1 opportunity was inexcusable. Gordon, by the way, caught 4 passes for 44 receiving yards.    Rivers, conversely, didn't perform all that well, though it's hard to blame him. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 20-of-47 for 267 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. None of the 3 picks were his fault - 2 were tipped, while the third was the result of a miscommunication with "

   "comment":"Gordon is a beast. He almost literally carried the Chargers to victory over the Titans, saving their season. San Diego is still not in a great spot, but at 4-5, the team still has a chance to make a run at a wild-card spot. The Titans had no answer for Gordon. He gashed them the entire afternoon, generating 100 rushing yards by halftime. His best run came at the end, however. Tennessee, down 8 with a few minutes remaining, was trying to stop San Diego to get 1 final possession in regulation. On third-and-long, Gordon got the carry, and he appeared to be stuffed for a short gain. Gordon, however, broke free of 2 tackles and then eluded 2 other Tennessee players downfield. He gained 47 yards on the play, and that sealed the victory for the Chargers. Gordon finished with 196 yards and a touchdown on 32 carries. He also caught 4 balls for 65 receiving yards. The stats don't do him justice, and it could be argued that Gordon is the best running back in the AFC. The difference between him this year and last season is colossal, as Gordon is no longer nursing an injury that plagued his rookie campaign.    Aside from Gordon, San Diego's defense was the main reason for this victory. The stop unit actually struggled for most of the afternoon, but came through with 2 big plays, both of which were returned for touchdowns. The first was "

He tried to tie the game on a deep bomb, but Keith Tandy undercut the pass. Rivers didn't have his best game, but he did have an 80-yard touchdown negated by Benjamin's drop.    Rivers' touchdowns went to Dontrelle Inman (2-49) and Tyrell Williams (2-47). They were San Diego's leaders in receiving yardage aside from Gordon.

Cutler rolled out to hit Kenny Stills (2-37-1) for a 29-yard touchdown and tie the game at 10. Rivers promptly responded by connecting on a few completions, including a 21-yarder to Allen, a 10-yarder to Hunter Henry, and then a 7-yard touchdown to Antonio Gates (2-11-1). That set the NFL record for touchdown catches by a tight end with 112. Huge congratulations to Gates on making NFL history. Ajayi had some nifty runs to get the Dolphins in Los Angeles territory, and then DeVante Parker made a great leaping 31-yard reception to get inside the 10-yard line. Melvin Ingram used a speed rush to get by Laremy Tunsil for a sack to force a field gold for Miami. Cutler came back to make a money throw to Parker for a 31-yard gain inside Los Angeles' 25-yard line. Cutler then had a clutch third-down conversion to Jarvis Landry (13-78), and that set up another short field goal to cut the Chargers' lead to 17-16 with only 7 minutes remaining. The Dolphins' defense and special teams gave Cutler the ball back near the 50-yard line with just over 3 minutes remaining. Ajayi ran the ball about 15 yards, and that set up Parkey, who was good on a 54-yard field goal to give the Dolphins a 19-17 lead. Rivers got the ball at his own 20 with a 61 seconds and 2 timeouts. Rivers proceeded to hit Allen and Henry (7-80) on 2 passes to get the ball to midfield in only 11 seconds. A 10-yard pass to Gordon and a penalty on Miami moved it to the 35. With 10 seconds left though, Koo missed a 44-yard field goal wide right. It was Koo's second miss of the game on a makeable field goal.    Rivers was 31-of-39 for 331 yards with 1 touchdown. Overall, the Chargers' revamped offensive line played well as Miami had only 1 sack in the game. Rivers had a consistently clean pocket to pass from.    Gordon had only 9 carries for 13 yards and a touchdown, but he did have 7 receptions for 65 yards. Allen led the Chargers in receiving with 9 catches for 100 yards.

   "comment":"Gordon. New kicker Nick Novak cut the lead to 9-7. Late in the first half, Chargers receiver Travis Benjamin (2-18) got wide open in the end zone in busted coverage, but he had the pass bounce off his fingertips. Rivers moved inside the 5, but the drive stalled as Los Angeles settled for a field goal and a 10-9 halftime lead. In the third quarter, Rivers drove into Giants territory, but then he didn't see Darian Thompson, and the New York safety cut in front of Keenan Allen in the end zone for an interception. The Giants took advantage with Manning lofting in a touchdown pass to Roger Lewis, who beat Casey Hayward for the 29-yard score. Rivers responded by leading the Chargers down the field, spreading the ball around on a 92-yard, 12-play drive. Once again, the Giants were burned by a tight end as Rivers made a tremendous throw off his back foot to lead Hunter Henry (3-42-1) past 2 safeties for a 25-yard touchdown pass. That gave the Chargers a 17-16 lead entering the fourth quarter. The lead didn't last long as Beckham got wide open after torching Hayward for a 48-yard touchdown. A 2-point attempt failed, so New York had a 22-17 lead. Rivers led another drive deep into Giants territory, but Thompson came up big with a diving pass breakup to save a touchdown. Los Angeles cut the lead to 22-20 with just under 5 minutes remaining. Disaster than struck for New York as Beckham went down with an injury to his left leg and had to be carted off the field. That sucked the air out of the building, and on the next play, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Manning. Ingram recovered the loose ball to set up Los Angeles at the Giants' 11-yard line. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gordon in the flat, and Gordon darted into the end zone to give the Chargers a 27-22 lead. Manning had 1 more chance, but after getting to midfield, a tipped pass was picked off by "

   "comment":"Gordon was able to find a lot of holes against a leaky Oakland defense, and he was a major difference-maker for the Chargers. Gordon used his speed and strength to get to the holes quickly and power through defenders. His offensive line wasn't very good, and allowed him to be hit early often. Still, Gordon was able to power ahead for 83 yards on 25 carries. Additionally, Gordon was able to make a big impact as a receiver for another week. He saw a team-high 12 targets and caught 9 of them for 67 yards and a score. Gordon will continue to get a boatload of touches as the only proven back on the Chargers' offense. He was instrumental to setting up his team for the game-winning field goal at the end, and he should continue to see 30-plus touches each week.    In the passing game, "

   "comment":"Gordon, it would've made sense to have the offense on the field on a snap in New England territory. Instead, head coach Anthony Lynn called for a 51-yard field goal with a kicker he tried to replace this week. Yes, this actually happened. The Chargers are stupid. Very stupid.    The Patriots emerged from this game victorious, but they are still obviously a work in progress. For the second time this season, their opponent had a chance to have a late comeback in the fourth quarter. New England's defense bent but didn't break, and that's how the team won.    Instead of utilizing a traditional running attack, the Patriots opted to use their backs mostly as receivers. Tom Brady threw a great deal of short passes to the receiving backs for the team, and that, in effect, was the Patriots' rush offense. Both Rex Burkhead (7-68) and James White (5-85) had big days as receivers, and they were Brady's favorite targets for most of the game. Burkhead looked particularly good, as his elusive ability was on display and he was able to get a great deal of yards after the catch. Burkhead is worth a speculative add if you need a depth running back. Meanwhile, in terms of actual carries, the Patriots split the carries 4 ways. The aforementioned Burkhead and White only saw a combined 5 carries, so that left most of the workload for Dion Lewis and Mike Gillislee. Lewis was used as the primary running back and showed some of the ability that made him a dangerous weapon 2 years ago. He was able to make men miss at the line of scrimmage and turn gains that should have been gone nowhere into 4-to-5-yard gains. Lewis took 15 carries for 44 yards and also handled most of the goal-line work, a trend that has continued since Gillislee fumbled a couple of weeks ago. Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit Chris Hogan down the field for a touchdown. He nearly was able to get the ball to Hogan, but the more impressive thing is that Brady threw the ball 60 yards in the air with good accuracy. Brady's other excellent throw came on the final offensive drive of the game. On a second-and-20, he lofted a perfect ball over a linebacker to Rob Gronkowski to get the first down. That allowed the Patriots to run more time off the clock and seal the win. Overall, Brady finished 32-of-47 for 333 yards and a touchdown. He has been carrying the Patriots so far this season and is currently 1 of the leaders of the MVP race.    Aside from the running backs, Brady's top receivers were Gronkowski (5-57, 1 TD) and Hogan (5-60). Gronkowski didn't make a lot of catches, but he had the touchdown catch and made the big play on the final drive when it counted. He is still the best tight end in football and should have some big performances as the year goes along. Meanwhile, Hogan made a nice catch over the middle of the field and continued to operate as the team's top deep threat. Elsewhere, Brandin Cooks (5-26) had a decent performance. He was able to find open space in the first half, but he had to deal with Casey Hayward for some of the contest.    For the Chargers, this was a strong showing. While they were unable to ultimately win the contest, their defense played very well, and they had a chance to beat the Patriots late in the fourth quarter. Philip Rivers did as much as he could to help the Chargers win. Rivers was his usual solid self, and showed great accuracy during the contest. His ability to hit receivers on out routes to the sideline was very strong, and that allowed him to methodically move the ball down the field. At the same time, Rivers was forced to throw mostly short passes against the Patriots, as the team did well to protect against the deep ball. As a result, the Chargers ended up with a lot of third-and-shorts, but they couldn't convert them. Part of this was due to Rivers' inability to find open receivers in these situations, and some of it was due to Matt Patricia's ability to call the right plays at the right time. Overall, Rivers went 17-of-30 for 212 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a solid game, but he was unable to lead the team to victory at the end of the day. He had a chance on the final drive, but he was killed by a lack of timeouts and a key drop.    Rivers' top receivers during the contest were Keenan Allen (4-61) and Travis Benjamin (5-61, 1 TD). Allen was able to get open often early in the contest. Allen can be trusted as a WR2 in fantasy and may have a chance to improve. Benjamin had an impressive performance on offense, and his explosive play-making ability was on display. His touchdown saw him outrun the Patriots' defense, and he almost had a second touchdown as well, but it was called back by a penalty. He is worth adding as a boom-or-bust type of play-maker. It is worth noting, however, that Benjamin produced 1 of the worst punt returns in NFL history in this contest. He muffed the ball around the 15 before picking it up at the 10. He then proceeded to run backward into the end zone, where he was tackled for a safety. Those 2 points gave the Patriots a lead they never relinquished.    Finally, the running game for the Chargers was a strength. Melvin Gordon ran for 132 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries. Most of his yardage came on an 87-yard burst that saw him show great patience on an outside run then outrun the defense. Gordon is an RB1 in fantasy, and his performance today was indicative of that.   "

   "comment":"Gordon took off on a 10-yard touchdown run. Peterman was pressured again and threw his fifth interception of the first half. In the third quarter, the Chargers added a field goal, and Taylor replaced Peterman. McCoy ripped off some yards, and the Bills turned it into a 50-yard field goal. At the end of the third quarter, Joey Bosa beat the right tackle to get a strip-sack. Melvin Ingram scooped up loose ball and ran it 38 yards for a touchdown. Taylor led a touchdown drive, throwing a corner route to McCoy for a 12-yard touchdown.    Rivers completed 20-of-32 passes for 251 yards and 2 touchdowns. Allen has 12 receptions for 159 yards and 2 scores.    Gordon totaled 80 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown.    Taylor was 15-of-25 for 158 yards and a touchdown. Peterman was 6-of-14 for 66 yards with 5 interceptions.    McCoy was the lone bright spot for the Bills, totaling 114 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown catch.    The Chargers' defense got an excellent game from their pass-rushing tandem of Ingram and Bosa. They hit Peterman as he threw on a few of his interceptions, helping to cause some fo those turnovers; not to mention the Bosa strip-sack that Ingram returned for a score.   "
