   "comment":"Melvin Gordon's disappointing preseason seems like a million years ago. Gordon gashed the Bengals, who have a shaky run defense. He gained 88 yards on 16 carries, though he lost touches to Woodhead, who accumulated 36 rushing yards (7 carries) and 68 receiving yards (6 catches). Gordon will continue to see the majority of the workload, and he'll have a greater percentages of touches when the team isn't in catch-up mode. However, Woodhead, who had just 3 touches by halftime, will be a big part of the offense when San Diego is trailing.   "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon didn't fare as well as he did last week, with the Vikings living in the Chargers' backfield. This offensive line will need to step up its game for Gordon to put up fantasy numbers, but it was good to see Gordon in the game even when the Chargers were trailing.    San Diego still has plenty of offensive weapons, and if the line could have picked up a few more blitzes, Rivers could have picked the Vikings apart, but it all fell on this offensive line this week and the unit couldn't hold up under the pressure.

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon fumbled in the first quarter and was extremely fortunate that D.J. Fluker recovered it because there were tons of Packers around the ball. Rivers then was lucky to have a dropped interception and missed Antonio Gates for a touchdown because he was hit as he threw. On a later drive, Gates couldn't quite haul in a pass on 4.h down in the red zone. San Diego was stuck on 3 points just prior to halftime, but on the final play prior to intermission, Mike McCoy decided to take a chance and go for it rather than kick a field goal. The gamble worked, as Rivers threw a touchdown to Dontrelle Inman. This seemed to ignite the offense, as Rivers racked up 298 yards in the second half alone.    Nearly a third of Rivers' yardage went to Keenan Allen, who hauled in 14 of the 15 passes thrown to him for 157 yards. Unfortunately for Allen, he suffered a hip injury in the second half and never returned.    Believe it or not, Allen wasn't the team leader in targets. Gates held that distinction with 16. He reeled in 9 balls for 95 yards. Malcom Floyd matched that yardage total on 5 catches (12 targets).    Allen wasn't the only Charger who suffered an injury. Melvin Gordon also limped off. He actually returned to the game and promptly fumbled. I actually thought the Chargers were better off without Gordon because A) he's very fumble-prone, and B) "

The Raiders looked much better post-bye than pre-bye, which leads me to believe the talent is here; they are just having trouble finding consistency. That falls on the coaching staff, so if we get another stretch of not-so-great play, I'll be looking straight at head coach, Jack of the River.    Neither team had much pass rush, which helped these 2 teams throw for more than 600 combined yards, but the 2 turnovers by Rivers look like the deciding factor after the Chargers stormed back. As usual, when you win the turnover battle, your odds of winning are greatly improved. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.    Neither team received a good game from its defense, but Chargers rookie linebacker "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon had his fifth fumble of the season, which was recovered by the Broncos before they missed the field goal from 52 yards. San Diego wide receiver Malcom Floyd later fumbled the ball away after a hit from Josh Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position. Virgil Green burned Manti Te'o for 22 yards to get inside the 30 yards, but Osweiler threw a ball up for grabs in the end zone that Jason Verrett intercepted for San Diego. Both defenses shut the door, so there was no scoring in the second half.    Philip Rivers completed 18-of-35 passes for 202 yards and an interception. He was under heavy pressure from start to finish.    Melvin Gordon ran for 55 yards on 12 carries, but once again had ball-security issues. "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon and Danny Woodhead (3-27), and a critical third-down conversion to Travis Benjamin. Gordon finished the drive by plunging into the end zone from a few yards out. After trading punts, Bortles had a pass deflected by Casey Hayward, and Hayward caught the deflection while lying on his back. That set up the Chargers at the Jaguars' 34. Rivers took advantage with a few completions and a 6-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin. The Jaguars moved the ball into San Diego territory thanks to a completion to Allen Hurns (5-64), but Jason Myers missed a 54-yard field goal. The Chargers got Benjamin matched up on Paul Posluszny, and that led to a 43-yard completion for San Diego. The Jaguars jumped offsides on a 4.h-and-1 at the 4-yard line, and a play, later Rivers hit Antonio Gates (3-15) for a 2-yard score. With San Diego up 21-0, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.

This game promised a bunch of scoring with an over/under at 54 points, and it didn't disappoint. Philip Rivers looked great all game, especially in the first half, completing 14-of-17 passes for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. He ended the day with 321 yards, 2 scores and his first interception of the year, which came on a 4.h-and-21 to end the game. Rivers was sharp all afternoon and had very little to do with the Chargers' eventual collapse, but collapse they did. According to ESPN Stats and Info, the Chargers are 1-2 this season in games they've led by 13 or more points in 4.h quarter. The rest of the NFL is 25-0 in such games.

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon led the NFL in rushing touchdowns entering this weekend and had 108 yards on the ground at that point in the contest, yet San Diego didn't give him a single attempt. Rivers threw the ball 4 times instead, and he was under such heavy pressure that he had to throw 2 of those passes away. Rivers went to his tight ends after that, but couldn't connect, turning the ball over on downs. The Chargers had 1 more chance after that, but without being able to pound the rock with Gordon as time was running out, they didn't have much of a chance.    Not running with Gordon on a single occasion on the goal-to-go situation was strange. Gordon gained 111 yards on 23 carries, and he had a 20-yard burst on that very drive. He was excellent against the Broncos, who have been weaker versus the rush than the pass. Not giving him 1 opportunity was inexcusable. Gordon, by the way, caught 4 passes for 44 receiving yards.    Rivers, conversely, didn't perform all that well, though it's hard to blame him. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 20-of-47 for 267 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. None of the 3 picks were his fault - 2 were tipped, while the third was the result of a miscommunication with "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon is a beast. He almost literally carried the Chargers to victory over the Titans, saving their season. San Diego is still not in a great spot, but at 4-5, the team still has a chance to make a run at a wild-card spot. The Titans had no answer for Gordon. He gashed them the entire afternoon, generating 100 rushing yards by halftime. His best run came at the end, however. Tennessee, down 8 with a few minutes remaining, was trying to stop San Diego to get 1 final possession in regulation. On third-and-long, Gordon got the carry, and he appeared to be stuffed for a short gain. Gordon, however, broke free of 2 tackles and then eluded 2 other Tennessee players downfield. He gained 47 yards on the play, and that sealed the victory for the Chargers. Gordon finished with 196 yards and a touchdown on 32 carries. He also caught 4 balls for 65 receiving yards. The stats don't do him justice, and it could be argued that Gordon is the best running back in the AFC. The difference between him this year and last season is colossal, as Gordon is no longer nursing an injury that plagued his rookie campaign.    Aside from Gordon, San Diego's defense was the main reason for this victory. The stop unit actually struggled for most of the afternoon, but came through with 2 big plays, both of which were returned for touchdowns. The first was "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon ran well to set up a Chargers field goal. Philip Rivers then put together a good drive with passes to Gordon, Tyrell Williams and Antonio Gates (4-63-1) to get the ball to the Miami 11-yard line. Rivers finished the drive by throwing a bullet to Gates for the touchdown. Late in the second quarter, Tannehill threw a tremendous pass to Kenny Stills for a 39-yard touchdown to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-7 at halftime. Jay Ajayi had only 16 yards on 11 carries by halftime, but not long into the third quarter, he broke off a 40-yard run behind Laremy Tunsil. A 25-yard pass to Jarvis Landry (6-53) put the ball at the 2-yard line, and Damien Williams plunged into the end zone to give Miami the lead. San Diego responded with a completion to Tyrell Williams, a run from Gordon, and a pass interference in the end zone. On third-and-goal, Rivers connected with Hunter Henry (2-11-1) to put San Diego up 17-14. Miami quickly responded thanks to a 21-yard run from Ajayi and Tannehill had about a 15-yard run to convert a critical third-and-11. Tannehill lofted in an 18-yard touchdown pass to Williams get the Dolphins back on top 21-17. After a Miami stop, the Dolphins' Jakeem Grant muffed a punt at 5-yard line, and Darrell Stuckey recovered it for San Diego. The Dolphins had a pass interference after a third-down stop, but Rivers had a pass thrown off the mark, and it was intercepted by Tony Lippett. The Chargers were able to get the ball back, and Rivers used Dontrelle Inman (5-43) to move into Miami territory, but then he had an overthrow picked off by Byron Maxwell to deny San Diego. A good punt return set up Rivers close to midfield with 5 minutes remaining, and less than a minute later, San Diego had a 24-21 lead as Rivers hit Tyrell Williams on the run for a 51-yard touchdown. Miami came right back though, as Tannehill stepped into a hit and threw another dime deep down the field to connect with DeVante Parker for 56 yards with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Corey Liuget tacked on to put the Dolphins at the 10-yard line. Miami had to settled for a field goal though, but that still tied the game at 24. A run by Gordon of 13 yards and a screen to him of 20 yards moved the ball across midfield, but then disaster struck for Rivers as Kiko Alonso undercut a route to pick off the pass and return it 60 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Rivers had 1 minute remaining, but Tony Lippett added his second interception to clinch the Miami victory.    Philip Rivers completed 23-of-44 passes for 326 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Tyrell Williams led San Diego with 5 receptions for 125 yards and a score.    Melvin Gordon was contained by the Dolphins' talented defensive line. He had 70 yards on 24 carries, but also contributed 5 receptions for 62 yards.    Ryan Tannehill completed 17-of-24 for 240 yards on 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't illustrate that Tannehill made some phenomenal throws, and he threw the deep ball better than any game I've ever seen from him.    Jay Ajayi (19-79) was contained by the Chargers' defense. DeVante Parker (5-103) led Miami in receiving.    "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon, who had an amazing performance in the loss. He rushed for 84 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, as he pounded the Tampa front with some extremely powerful runs. He was also a big factor in the passing game with 4 catches for a team-leading 54 receiving yards. Considering that the Chargers led for most of the game, it's irresponsible that he was given just 17 attempts.    Rivers threw 26 passes, 2 of which were picked off. He went 15-of-26 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns in addition to the turnovers. One wasn't his fault, as it was tipped into the air. However, Rivers forced the issue on the second interception. He tried to tie the game on a deep bomb, but "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon had a poor performance, notching 22 yards on 10 carries despite facing a Philadelphia defense that was missing Fletcher Cox. Gordon was dealing with a minor injury, so perhaps that had an effect on him. He should bounce back, but this performance was concerning. The best run of the contest for the Chargers came from rookie "

   "comment":"Melvin Gordon was able to find a lot of holes against a leaky Oakland defense, and he was a major difference-maker for the Chargers. Gordon used his speed and strength to get to the holes quickly and power through defenders. His offensive line wasn't very good, and allowed him to be hit early often. Still, Gordon was able to power ahead for 83 yards on 25 carries. Additionally, Gordon was able to make a big impact as a receiver for another week. He saw a team-high 12 targets and caught 9 of them for 67 yards and a score. Gordon will continue to get a boatload of touches as the only proven back on the Chargers' offense. He was instrumental to setting up his team for the game-winning field goal at the end, and he should continue to see 30-plus touches each week.    In the passing game, Philip Rivers had a fairly solid performance against a weak Oakland defense, but he certainly could have been better. Rivers demonstrated nice accuracy and was able to put the ball on his receivers for most of the day. He dealt with spotty pass protection against Khalil Mack and company, but he managed to only get sacked once. Overall, Rivers was able to go 25-of-36 for 268 yards and the 1 score. He played very well on the team's final offensive drive and showed the veteran poise that has been a staple of his skill set in his career. If Rivers continues to be efficient, the Chargers could continue to improve and may make some noise in the wild-card picture.    Rivers' top receiving targets on the day were Hunter Henry (5-90) and Keenan Allen (5-45). Henry had 1 of his best performances of the season, and he was able to consistently find space against the Raiders' linebackers. Henry has TE1 upside, but he has been inconsistent this year due to the presence of Antonio Gates. As the year goes along, Henry should overtake Gates officially, and for that reason, Henry deserves a spot in most leagues. As for Allen, this performance was a bit disappointing, given that the Raiders' corners had underperformed this season. Rivers spent most of the day targeting his tight ends and Melvin Gordon in checkdowns, so it really wasn't Allen's fault. Allen is a high-end WR2 most weeks, so he should bounce back. The other receiver of note, "
