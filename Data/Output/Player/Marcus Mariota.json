   "comment":"Mariota over Jameis Winston if they had to go back in time right now. It's a loss-loss either way, really. If they wanted to make the change, they couldn't in real life, which sucks, obviously. If they don't want to swap signal-callers, it just shows that they are stubborn. I wouldn't write off Winston quite yet, or anything, but this was a very disconcerting start to his career.    You have to give credit to Titans general manager Ruston Webster, head coach Ken Whisenhunt, and director of college scouting Blake Beddingfield for trusting their evaluation and plan for Marcus Mariota. The rookie quarterback put on a clinic as the Titans blew out Tampa Bay. Of course, the Bucs passed on Mariota for Jameis Winston, and this game was a terrible start for that decision as Winston struggled, while Mariota was surgical in carving up Tampa Bay. However, you can't put blind faith in Mariota's performance because the Buccaneers' defense was atrocious.    On his first NFL drive, Mariota ripped Tampa Bay on 2 completions. He converted a third-and-10 with a laser to "

   "comment":"Mariota, who came back after missing the last 2 games due to injury, hit tight end Anthony Fasano with a 5-yard touchdown pass to seal the victory. The win snapped a 6.game losing streak by the Titans (2-6) and was their first victory since the season opener against Tampa Bay. For the Saints (4-5), the loss ended a 3.game winning streak. The loss came as rumors continue to fly about the future of Saints coach Sean Payton. There were reports Sunday morning that the Saints would allow Payton to explore other jobs in the offseason. Payton, who has been with the Saints since 2006, reportedly could draw interest from the Miami Dolphins and other teams.    Mariota had the best game of his young career. He completed 28-of-39 passes for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns with no interceptions. Mariota was calm and composed throughout the game. Despite his team's record, Mariota is worth starting on your fantasy team in favorable matchups.    Tight end "

   "comment":"Mariota, who hurt his knee in the first half and permanently left the field. It was a boring contest, though I suppose that the main take-away is that New England covered the spread in another game in which Walt Coleman has officiated. The Patriots have covered every single Coleman game in the past 10 years. Seriously.    Tom Brady, who was battling some sort of mysterious sickness during the week, played just fine, going 23-of-35 for 267 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brady was surprisingly ineffective in the second half of this contest, completing just 9 of his 16 passes after the break. The Titans put some pressure on him, which wasn't much of a surprise. New England's offensive line is very leaky, while Tennessee sports a pretty stout pass rush. Brady spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking to avoid pressure. Save for Rob Gronkowski, Brady threw the ball most to James White, who snared 7 of his 8 targets for 71 receiving yards and a touchdown. Gronkowski, meanwhile, caught 5 balls for 54 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon LaFell was the Patriot who paced the team in receiving yardage, hauling in 4 balls for 88 yards. However, he saw just 5 targets. Danny Amendola, meanwhile, was a major disappointment. He caught only 1 pass for 3 yards, and he also fumbled a punt return. He left the game early with a knee injury. Likewise, linebacker Dont'a Hightower left early with a knee issue, aggravating his previous injury. He'll be a big loss if he can't make it back to the lineup in the near future.    Many expected Brandon Bolden to handle the majority of the workload, with Matthew Berry even touting him as a value running back play in DFS. I was more skeptical, as I've been fooled by Bill Belichick's confusing running back rotations far too many times. Sure enough, Bolden was second on the team in carries, trailing some guy named Joey Iosefa, who gained 51 yards on 14 carries. Bolden accumulated 36 yards on 10 tries. There's nothing exciting here, as Iosefa is just some big fullback, who could easily vanish into oblivion next week. You simply cannot trust Belichick when it comes to fantasy running backs.    As for the Titans, Mariota didn't get to do much, going just 3-of-6 for 32 yards and a strip-six on a lost fumble that completely fooled the CBS camera man. "

   "comment":"Mariota was able to drill a touchdown in between 2 defenders to Andre Johnson to take the lead. Perrish Cox, meanwhile, clinched the victory soon after with an interception. Cox needed that, as he struggled throughout the afternoon.    Ansah was 1 of 2 primary Detroit players to leave the game. The other was Ameer Abdullah, whose presence was missed. The Lions struggled to move the ball without him, as Theo Riddick (11-37) was far less effective than Abdullah (6-38). Riddick also caught 4 balls for 28 yards.    With no Abdullah, Matthew Stafford struggled in the second half, going 11-of-21 for 96 yards and a pick following intermission. Overall, he finished 22-of-40 for 260 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Stafford should've posted better numbers, but he had 2 touchdowns wiped out by penalties, and some of his receivers dropped passes. There's also some cause for concern, as Stafford was limping around at the end when he took a hit from Jurrell Casey.    Stafford's sole score went to Anquan Boldin (4-48), who had another touchdown wiped out by a hold. Marvin Jones led the team in receiving, catching 8 passes for 118 yards. His longest gain, a 47-yarder, should've been a short haul to force a punt, but Cox whiffed on a tackle. Golden Tate (2-13) barely did anything despite seeing 9 targets. He dropped a pass, albeit because of a big hit by Sean Spence.    As for the victors, Mariota was clutch at the very end and was solid overall, though he didn't begin well. He was nearly picked on a sloppy throw, and he was only moving the chains because the Lions were giving him free yards with their dumb penalties. Mariota eventually threw a pick when he forced a pass into double coverage, but he was sharp in the second half. Going 15-of-19 for 157 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission, Mariota finished 25-of-33 for 238 yards, 2 scores and a pick overall. He didn't run very much (2-11), but 1 of his scrambles was important, as it moved the chains.    "

   "comment":"Mariota while up 20-13, but unnecessary roughness negated the turnover. The Titans maintained possession and managed to move the chains via a pair of pass-interference flags. Tennessee established a field-goal lead, and the Colts seemed willing to allow them to keep it, as Andrew Luck nearly threw an interception, though the ball was tipped and sailed into the arms of Doyle. A bit later, Luck threw a touchdown to T.Y. Hilton, but an illegal shift nullified it. Devin Street then came up with a big catch for a first down in the red zone, but was flagged for spinning the ball. It's ridiculous calls like these that are driving fans away, by the way. Roger Goodell needs to crack down on this, and he should consider getting rid of Jerome Boger, whose officiating crew bungled yet another NFL game. Luck ultimately found Doyle for what would be the decisive touchdown. The Titans still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Mariota was strip-sacked, and Robert Mathis returned the turnover for a touchdown."

They had a chance to win at the end and even had the game won, but Josh Bellamy dropped an easy catch in the end zone. This was 1 of countless drops Chicago was guilty of down the stretch. The Bears were able to get wide open against Tennessee's poor secondary, but couldn't prevent themselves from dropping lots of passes. Of course, this is what happens to a team missing 3 of its top weapons.    At any rate, Mariota finished 15-of-23 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well overall, especially in the first half, but he barely threw the ball following the break; he was just 5-of-9 for 87 yards after intermission. The Titans didn't need to throw much at first, and this appeared to ruin Mariota's rhythm. This was apparent when he overthrew a wide-open "

   "comment":"Mariota completing only 6 passes. That's because DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry gashed the Broncos throughout the afternoon, beating them both inside and outside. Opposing teams have trampled the Broncos on the ground all year, and that continued to be the case, as Murray gained 92 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, while Henry accumulated 42 yards on 12 attempts.    Meanwhile, Trevor Siemian returned following last week's hiatus, but he couldn't beat the Titan defensive backfield, at least not in the early going. Siemian struggled to start the game, as he was sacked on a third down of he opening drive, and then threw a horrible pass to Jordan Taylor on another third down. The Broncos didn't even score until the 4.h quarter when Siemian managed to catch fire. He converted a third-and-14 to put the team into scoring range and then looked like he was going to lead a potential tying drive at the very end, but A.J. Derby lost a fumble near midfield. Siemian finished 35-of-51 for 334 yards and a touchdown, with 221 of those yards coming in the second half. Siemian has been better in the second halves of games this year, so his late-game surge, especially versus a poor secondary, was far from a surprise. It needs to be noted that Siemian was incomplete on a 4.h down on a final-quarter drive. The Broncos should've kicked a field goal, and if they did, this game might have gone to overtime because Denver lost by 3. Siemian also took a sack from Aaron Wallace later, which helped force a field goal.    Neither Demaryius Thomas nor Emmanuel Sanders was doing much in the opening half, which undoubtedly had their fantasy owners worried. That changed in the second half as Siemian was able to heat up, and both receivers eclipsed the century mark. Thomas caught 10 balls for 126 yards. Sanders, meanwhile, reeled in 11 catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. He dropped a pass in the 4.h quarter.    The Broncos haven't been able to run the ball since C.J. Anderson was knocked out for the year, and that continued to be the case this week. Devontae Booker was limited to just 1 yard on 3 carries. Justin Forsett handled most of the workload, gaining 17 yards on just 6 attempts. He lost a fumble in the first half, setting up Tennessee with a field goal. Depiste the fumble, Gary Kubiak trusts Forsett more than Booker.    Going back to the Titans, Mariota has had better games. Mariota wasn't expected to perform well because of how good the Broncos are against the pass, but it was still a disappointment because Mariota was just 6-of-20 for 88 yards. He threw an apparent touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Mariota was then strip-sacked in his own territory, and then he followed that up with an underthrow that was snatched in the air with 1 hand by Kansas City's Ron Parker. At that point in the game, it appeared as though the Titans were going to shoot themselves in the foot enough to ensure a crucial loss. However, they showed resilience and never quit. Despite wasting all of their timeouts - they ran out of stoppages with 7 minutes remaining - they were able to mount a comeback. They scored what appeared to be a game-tying touchdown, but went for 2 and failed to convert. Following a Kansas City punt, the Titans were able to put themselves into field-goal range to get the unlikely victory.    Considering the extremely cold temperatures in Kansas City, the better running game was expected to win. Thus, it's no wonder that the Titans prevailed despite all of their early blunders. They have the superior ground attack, and their run defense is better than what the Chiefs have in that regard. That proved to be the case in this matchup, as DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry combined for nearly 150 rushing yards. Murray had double the amount of carries, 18-9, and he outgained Henry, 89-58, but Henry scored 2 touchdowns. Murray was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 5 balls for 52 yards.    Marcus Mariota had his skeptics entering this afternoon, as this was the coldest game the native Hawaiian would ever start in his football career. Considering the conditions - as well as Kansas City's pass rush - the second-year signal-caller performed relatively well, outside of the 2 aforementioned mistakes. Mariota finished 19-of-33 for 241 yards and the pick. He hit a big play in the early going on a flea-flicker, firing a downfield pass to Matthews for 46 yards. Mariota was a bit lucky the pass didn't get picked off, as it was thrown into double coverage. He did a great job of leading his team on a pair of 4.h-quarter drives to win a crucial game that allowed the Titans to keep the tie with the Texans atop the AFC South.    Speaking of Matthews, he managed to lead the team in receiving yards, accumulating 105 yards on 4 catches. He did more than make up for his early fumble inside the Kansas City 5-yard line. Outside of Matthews, only 4 Titans caught passes: "

That, as well as a dropped interception late in the game, were just about the only things that went right for Mariota as a passer throughout the afternoon. The performance was very discouraging, given the issues the Raiders have in their linebacking corps and secondary.    Another big surprise was that the Titans couldn't run the ball at all. "

   "comment":"Mariota missed Walker for a touchdown. The Titans then passed up a crucial field goal, opting to go for it on a 4.h down at the goal line. Derrick Henry was stuffed in the backfield, as Danny Shelton blew up pedestrian center Ben Jones. A bit later, Tennessee actually tried a kick, but Ryan Succop missed. That made it a very curious decision for the Titans to settle for a 47-yard Succop field goal in overtime, rather than getting closer for their kicker. Succop actually missed, but the whistle blew the play dead because it was the 2-minute warning. Proving that icing the kicker is a waste, Succop hit the decisive field goal following the return from commercial break.    Mariota, still not 100 percent, went 21-of-34 for 203 yards. He moved the chains on a third down with an 8-yard scramble, but that was the only run we saw from him all afternoon. He'll need to get healthy soon if the Titans want to beat real opponents (i.e. not the Colts or Browns.) Fortunately for the Titans, they have a bye next week, so perhaps Mariota will be 100 percent by Week 9.    Because overtime could've been avoided - I'm still unsure why the Titans passed on the field goal - Mike Mularkey is at least partly responsible for Delanie Walker's injury.
