   "comment":"Marcus Mariota over Jameis Winston if they had to go back in time right now. It's a loss-loss either way, really. If they wanted to make the change, they couldn't in real life, which sucks, obviously. If they don't want to swap signal-callers, it just shows that they are stubborn. I wouldn't write off Winston quite yet, or anything, but this was a very disconcerting start to his career.    You have to give credit to Titans general manager Ruston Webster, head coach Ken Whisenhunt, and director of college scouting Blake Beddingfield for trusting their evaluation and plan for Marcus Mariota. The rookie quarterback put on a clinic as the Titans blew out Tampa Bay. Of course, the Bucs passed on Mariota for Jameis Winston, and this game was a terrible start for that decision as Winston struggled, while Mariota was surgical in carving up Tampa Bay. However, you can't put blind faith in Mariota's performance because the Buccaneers' defense was atrocious.    On his first NFL drive, Mariota ripped Tampa Bay on 2 completions. He converted a third-and-10 with a laser to "

   "comment":"Marcus Mariota put a field goal drive together where he converted a third down with legs and then added nice completions to Kendall Wright, Justin Hunter and Bishop Sankey. Mariota had Kendall Wright open for a deep touchdown, but threw it short, and that allowed the defense to come back for a breakup. That was the only score in the first half. In the third quarter, Denarius Moore was stripped on a punt return by Jalston Fowler, and the Titans recovered around the Bills' 40-yard line. Mariota went to work with clutch passes to Harry Douglas to convert a third down and hit Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to Chris Hogan, who beat Coty Sensabaugh to get inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal, Taylor went back to Hogan on a sprint out for a touchdown and a 14-13 lead. The Bills' defense came up with 2 stops to clinch the victory. On the second 1. Mariota was pressured by Marcell Dareus into throwing a deep ball up for grabs that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore to end the game for Buffalo.    Taylor completed 10-of-17 passes for 109 yards with a touchdown. He ran for 76 yards and 8 carries and a score. He'll continue to be a solid starting option in fantasy because of his rushing ability.    The Bills' offense was without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins. Their top running back was Dan Herron (9-28), while Chris Hogan (3-52) led them through the air.    Marcus Mariota was 21-of-32 for 187 yards with an interception. He ran for 47 yards on 5 carries. He didn't play poorly, and the Bills' defense did a good job of bending but not breaking.    The Titans' ground game was shutdown by Buffalo as "

   "comment":"Marcus Mariota was under more duress. Perhaps the worst moment for the blockers occurred just prior to the 2-minute warning at the end of regulation. The linemen took their time getting to the line of scrimmage as Mariota tried to get 1 more play off. They showed absolutely no sense of urgency, and as a consequence, Tennessee was flagged for a procedural penalty. The lack of effort was alarming. Mariota went 22-of-35 for 231 yards to go along with 29 rushing yards and a touchdown on 5 scrambles. He missed some throws, which was discouraging. He threw behind "

   "comment":"Marcus Mariota fumble, which was forced by Melvin Ingram's helmet hitting the ball, allowing Dwight Lowery to get the scoop and score. Mariota was also responsible for the second turnover, as he fired a pick-six in Brandon Flowers' direction late in the game.    As for Philip Rivers, he had a strong performance as well. He misfired on just 9 occasions, going 24-of-33 for 275 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tennessee's secondary has struggled, so it's not a surprise that Rivers enjoyed so much success. The Titans had their usual blown coverages and missed tackles. Perrish Cox had a horrible instance of the latter in the first half.    Rivers' touchdowns went to Antonio Gates (5-75) and Tyrell Williams (6-65). Rivers didn't have his receiving and tight end corps completely intact. Hunter Henry was out, while Travis Benjamin, who caught only 1 pass for 5 yards, is dealing with a sprained PCL.    Before moving on to the Titans, it's worth noting that Orlando Franklin sustained a concussion. The Chargers have endured tons of injuries to the offensive line in recent years, so hopefully Franklin can recover quickly. The silver lining is that San Diego has a bye coming up in Week 11.    Marcus Mariota had a mixed performance for the Titans. He was responsible for the 2 turnovers that were taken back for touchdowns. He also fired another ugly interception on a careless deep shot in which he didn't see "

Considering the conditions - as well as Kansas City's pass rush - the second-year signal-caller performed relatively well, outside of the 2 aforementioned mistakes. Mariota finished 19-of-33 for 241 yards and the pick. He hit a big play in the early going on a flea-flicker, firing a downfield pass to Matthews for 46 yards. Mariota was a bit lucky the pass didn't get picked off, as it was thrown into double coverage. He did a great job of leading his team on a pair of 4.h-quarter drives to win a crucial game that allowed the Titans to keep the tie with the Texans atop the AFC South.    Speaking of Matthews, he managed to lead the team in receiving yards, accumulating 105 yards on 4 catches. He did more than make up for his early fumble inside the Kansas City 5-yard line. Outside of Matthews, only 4 Titans caught passes: "

He couldn't put any pressure on his leg while getting onto the cart, and he was later diagnosed with a fractured fibula. It's a shame for the Titans, who had been enjoying a terrific season. Granted, they were probably going to lose, but they had no chance when "

His interception-less streak in the red zone nearly ended when he threw the ball up for grabs, but the pass fell incomplete. That, as well as a dropped interception late in the game, were just about the only things that went right for Mariota as a passer throughout the afternoon. The performance was very discouraging, given the issues the Raiders have in their linebacking corps and secondary.    Another big surprise was that the Titans couldn't run the ball at all. "
