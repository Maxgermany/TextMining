   "comment":"Jordan Hill made a diving interception when Shaun Hill was trying to throw a screen pass into the turf because the play was covered. Wilson took advantage with a gain to Kevin Norwood (2-34) for 31 yards, as the Rams had busted coverage with Jenkins leaving Norwood completely uncovered. On the next play, Lynch ran into the end zone from 9 yards out. The Seahawks' defense finished the Rams off when Lance Kendricks was stripped of a reception by Bobby Wagner. Bruce Irvin caught the ball in mid-air and raced down the sideline for a 49-yard score. It was scored a pick-six for Irvin, but it really was a fumble by Kendricks that was returned for a score. The Rams moved the ball inside Seattle's 10-yard line, but Cook dropped a touchdown pass. Benny Cunningham (4-10 rushing, 7-57 receiving) then fumbled the ball out of bounds into the end zone for a Seattle touchback. Cunningham was trying to extend it for a score, but Earl Thomas slapped the ball free before it reached the goal line.    Wilson completed 17-of-25 for 239 yards with an interception. The Rams' pass rush kept Wilson from really getting into any groove.    Shaun Hill was 26-of-37 for 243 yards with 2 interceptions.    Jordan Hill had a big game for Seattle with a sack and the interception. "
