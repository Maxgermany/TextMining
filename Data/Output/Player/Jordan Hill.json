   "comment":"Hill outplay Russell Wilson in the first half. Things were back to normal in the second half, however, which preserved my sanity. After losing 4 units to the Seahawks in Week 16, I don't think I could have lived with myself if they hadn't met expectations at home against the Rams.    Facing a tough St. Louis defense, the Seahawks did their part to land home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, thanks to some huge plays from their defense. Seattle's stop-unit came up with a touchdown, 2 interceptions and a clutch goal-line fumble to make the road to the Super Bowl run through Seattle and the 12th Man in the NFC.    The Rams got on the board first with a short field goal drive. They put tons of pressure on Russell Wilson throughout the first half, which eventually paid off with Wilson scrambling and overthrowing in the middle of the field. The ball sailed to St. Louis cornerback Marcus Roberson for the interception. However, the Seahawks' pass rush stepped up to knock St. Louis backward and get the ball back. The Rams' defense took it right back after Alec Ogletree stripped Marshawn Lynch (14-60) and T.J. McDonald recovered the fumble. Greg Zuerlein kicked a 52-yarder to produce points from that turnover. Wilson moved the ball into St. Louis' territory just before the half, but Aaron Donald sacked Wilson to knock the Seahawks out of field goal range. The Rams took 6-0 lead into the half. The Seahawks got moving in the third quarter with a great leaping grab by Paul Richardson (5-60) over Janoris Jenkins that went for 32 yards. That led to a field goal before Seattle tacked on another 3.pointer to tie the game. St. Louis started moving the ball into Seahawks territory with Shaun Hill completing a clutch third-down conversion to Jared Cook (3-37), but Seattle's defense came up with a huge play as defensive tackle Jordan Hill made a diving interception when Shaun Hill was trying to throw a screen pass into the turf because the play was covered."
