Fortunately, Dallas was playing an inept Oakland team that couldn't consistently sustain drives. The Raiders didn't even cross midfield until there were 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Laughably, an Oakland receiver didn't catch a pass until there were 4 seconds left in the first half.    Speaking of the Raider wideouts, Darrius Heyward-Bey somehow caught 2 passes for 21 yards and his first career touchdown. If Heyward-Bey didn't drop a pass early in the game, Al Davis would probably be planning a parade right now.    Bruce Gradkowski went 18-of-35 for only 200 yards and that score, but didn't turn the ball over, making him better than JaMarcus Russell. However, he had 1 throw on a long out where he weakly lofted a ball that was nearly picked off. That pass pretty much exemplified why Gradkowski is a career backup in this league. He has zero arm strength.    The aforementioned Fargas ran for 63 yards on 12 carries. He was very effective early in the contest, and 1 has to wonder why the Raiders wasted their time with "
