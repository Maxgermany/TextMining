Fortunately, Dallas was playing an inept Oakland team that couldn't consistently sustain drives. The Raiders didn't even cross midfield until there were 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Laughably, an Oakland receiver didn't catch a pass until there were 4 seconds left in the first half.    Speaking of the Raider wideouts, "
