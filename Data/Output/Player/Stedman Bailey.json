   "comment":"Stedman Bailey made an awesome catch over Shareece Wright in the end zone, but an illegal hands to the face wiped that out. And if that wasn't enough, Tavon Austin took a punt return to the house to give his team the lead with barely any time remaining in regulation, but a very bogus hold nullified that. Jeff Fisher was completely furious, but Carl Cheffers and his crew could do nothing but shrug their shoulders. Despite these blown opportunities, the Rams were still in position to win the game, or at least tie it. Shaun Hill drove the team down to the San Diego 4-yard line, but even though he could have settled for a field goal to send the contest into overtime, Hill forced a poor throw into the end zone that was picked off. The Chargers escaped with their 7.h victory of the season.    Both the officials and Hill spoiled a potential upset. Hill was also responsible for a San Diego touchdown, as he lost a fumble that was returned for a score. He struggled, going 18-of-35 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The Rams would probably be a top-10 NFL team if they had a legitimate quarterback. I still can't get over how ridiculous Hill's pick was. I have no idea what he or offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer were thinking.    As for Hill's counterpart, Philip Rivers misfired on just 6 occasions, going 29-of-35 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick looked like it was going to prove to be costly, as it went 99 yards the other way in the second quarter. Rivers misread the coverage and fired a ball toward Keenan Allen in the end zone. Janoris Jenkins snatched it out of the air and recorded a pick-six. Rivers relied on mostly short throws to move the chains, as Mike McCoy wisely compensated for his offensive line's poor matchup against St. Louis' ferocious defensive front.    Allen also cost his team. He lost a fumble while fighting for extra yardage in the red zone. He made up for it though with 6 catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. Antonio Gates (2-14) had another dud outing.    Ryan Mathews handled most of the workload despite missing 20 minutes of action with a shoulder injury. Mathews burst for 105 yards and a touchdown on only 12 carries. Branden Oliver (6-17) wasn't much of a factor on the ground, though he had some nice gains as a receiver, catching 4 balls for 23 receiving yards.    As for the Rams, Stedman Bailey had a huge performance, catching 7 balls for 89 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had another score wiped out by a penalty, though his touchdown came on the same drive. Still though, Bailey was huge, coming up with clutch grabs on 4.h and third down of that possession. Kenny Britt (2-37) also got screwed over by the officials, as written earlier.    "
