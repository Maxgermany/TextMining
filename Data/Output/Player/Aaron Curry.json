Hue Jackson sent the kicking team on with a 26-14 lead and 8:04 left in the game. Apparently he was worried about the Lions scoring a touchdown and 2 field goals in that span to beat him. Instead of trying the 2.point conversion to take a 2.touchdown advantage, the lead was 27-14. On the subsequent possession, the only run was a Stafford scramble. He was only 4-for-9 on the drive, but put the ball in the end zone to "
