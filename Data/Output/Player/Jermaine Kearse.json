   "comment":"Kearse recovered the ball in the end zone, but it was ruled a safety. Official Ron Winter was too inept to make the correct call after looking at the replay. Still though, the Seahawks were up 12-0 on the Colts, who looked completely out of it. Indianapolis had 3 drops on third down at that point, so the players just appeared to be too unfocused to mount any sort of comeback. Everything changed after that, however. Not only did the Colts start generating consistent scoring drives; they also got on the board via a special-teams block of their own when a Seattle field goal was batted down and returned for a touchdown.    Andrew Luck and his receivers eventually got on the same page. Luck finished 16-of-29 for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire in the second half, going 11-of-16 for 132 yards and a score following intermission. Both of Luck's scores went to T.Y. Hilton, who caught 5 balls for 140 yards, though it should be noted that 1 of the scores could've been prevented if a lethargic Richard Sherman ran downfield instead of halfheartedly waltzing toward Hilton. Including plays nullified by penalty, Hilton saw more targets than Darrius Heyward-Bey, 8-7. Reggie Wayne, meanwhile, struggled with drops early, but finished with 6 receptions for 65 yards, with all but 1 catch coming after halftime.    Trent Richardson's stats sucked - he had 56 yards on 18 carries, most of which came on a 16-yard try - but he didn't have much of a chance behind an offensive line that couldn't open up anything for him. The Indianapolis front struggled throughout the afternoon - left tackle Anthony Castonzo was abused by Chris Clemons, who had a sack and a forced fumble - so that makes Luck's performance all that more impressive.    Russell Wilson played well despite the loss. He failed to complete half of his passes - he went 15-of-31 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception in desperation time - but he rushed for 102 yards on 13 scrambles. Wilson once again navigated the pocket like a 10-year veteran, but he had to do way too much because of injuries to his offensive line.    Marshawn Lynch matched Wilson's 102 rushing yards. The Colts simply couldn't tackle him. He was in vintage Beast Mode. He could've had a monstrous statistical outing had the Seahawks maintained their lead. Instead, he was limited to just 17 carries.    Wilson's 2 scores went to Golden Tate (5-61) and Kearse (1-28). "

   "comment":"Kearse. The Seahawks are going to the Super Bowl. The Packers are going to be kicking themselves for all of the blown opportunities they had in this contest. It began early when Aaron Rodgers threw an interception in the end zone, as Richard Sherman picked off a pass heading toward Davante Adams. After that, Green Bay had the following unforced blunders: - Following an overturned John Kuhn touchdown, Mike McCarthy opted to kick a field goal from the 1-inch line. Rodgers could've easily converted on a sneak. - McCarthy did the same exact thing on the ensuing drive that saw Rodgers miss Jordy Nelson by inches. McCarthy opted to send out Mason Crosby on the 1-yard line. His conservative play-calling left a whopping 8 points off the board in the first quarter. - Brandon Bostick dropped the ball on an attempted onside kick at the very end of the game. Bostick just had the ball slip out of his hands. Had he hung on to it, the Seahawks wouldn't have gotten the 1 possession they needed to take the lead. - Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had a chance to intercept a pass on a 2-point conversion following a Seattle touchdown that gave the Seahawks their first lead of the afternoon. Instead, the ball went right over his head and into the hands of Luke Willson. Had Clinton-Dix made the pick, Mason Crosby's 48-yard field goal at the end of regulaton would've clinched a trip to the Super Bowl for the Packers. - On Green Bay's game-tying drive, McCarthy opted not to call any timeouts. Time trickled off the clock, and Green Bay never really had an opportunity to score the go-ahead touchdown.    It would be a mistake to concentrate on the Packers exclusively, given how awesome Wilson was at the very end. Wilson, at 1 point, was 2-of-9 for only 13 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. Green Bay smothered him, as Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews put immense pressure on him. Wilson couldn't even scramble; he generated just 2 rushing yards in the opening half. Following intermission, Wilson was 12-of-20 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception that wasn't his fault, as the ball deflected off Kearse's hands. Wilson also finished with 25 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The transformation was amazing; Wilson looked like Jake Delhomme in the first half, but was his usual clutch self when the game was on the line. A tearful Wilson was overcome with emotion during his post-game interview with Erin Andrews, who had to be relieved that she wasn't getting yelled at like she was at this time last year.    Kearse was 1 of the heroes because he caught the touchdown, but he was having a miserable afternoon prior to that reception, which was his first of the contest. Kearse, who was responsible for a pick, dropped several other passes. "

Two fade pass attempts at Chicago cornerback Alan Ball came up short as Ball slapped the passes away from Graham and Rishard Matthews. A field goal closed the first half to give Seattle a 6-0 lead at the half. To open the second half, rookie speedster Tyler Lockett took the kickoff back 105 yards for a touchdown. A 21-yard run by Thomas Rawls got the Seahawks moving, and a 22-yard pass to Doug Baldwin got them to the Chicago 30. Wilson hit Graham on a crossing route, and he broke a tackle from Brock Vereen to charge into the end zone for Seattle. With a 20-0 lead, the game was essentially over. The Seahawks' offense found their groove with Rawls running for 18 yards, Kearse hauling in an 18-yarder, and Wilson running for 13 yards. That led to another Seattle field goal. A fourth-and-short pass to Graham moved the chains, and that set up a final 48-yard field goal for "

Ben Roethlisberger also put up big numbers, as you would expect with all these yards and touchdowns to go around, as he threw for 456 yards, but only connected for 1 touchdown and added 2 interceptions before leaving the game with a concussion with 2 minutes left.    A huge chunk of those yards went to Markus Wheaton, who became a huge part of the game plan as Richard Sherman shadowed Antonio Brown, and Heath Miller left the game with a rib injury. Wheaton, before this game, had never caught more than 5 passes or accumulated more than 97 yards in his 38 games. On Sunday, he caught 9-of-13 targets for 201 yards and a touchdown, the fourth of his career. Over the first 10 games of 2015, Wheaton had caught 16-of-32 targets for 273 yards and a touchdown.    On the other side, all 5 of Wilson's touchdown passes went to 2 of his wide receivers, Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse. Baldwin's 6 receptions on 8 targets for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns was his career game in both yardage and touchdowns. He's now had 2 huge games in his last 3. Wilson and Baldwin can look like this 1 game and then do very little the next game, but we know they have it in them. It will be interesting to see if they open up this passing game more as the season closes.    One problem with going more pass heavy is the season-ending injury Jimmy Graham suffered. He tore his right patellar tendon after putting together a nice game, with 4 receptions for 75 yards. This injury is a tough 1 to recover from, and it has taken some players completely out of the NFL. Graham had not put up the numbers he had in New Orleans, but still had been an integral part of the Seattle offense, averaging 4.4 receptions for 55 yards per game. "

The Seahawks were also inexplicably guilty of a false start and an illegal motion on that very same possession. The Seahawks just lacked focus all afternoon, and Pete Carroll was guilty of this as well. He could've kicked a field goal at the end of the first half, but passed up on the opportunity. Had he tried the 3, Seattle could've focused on scoring a touchdown at the end to tie the game.    Baldwin had a solid stat line despite the failed connections, catching 8 balls for 82 yards. He trailed only Kearse in the box score, as Kearse logged 11 receptions for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns. "

He scrambled 3 times for 11 rushing yards. He picked up a first down with his feet on 1 occasion, but he didn't do much else with his legs. He'll need to be completely healthy to give the Seahawks a chance to make a deep playoff run so that he can overcome his horrible blocking.    Despite the poor pass blocking, the Seahawks oddly did not try to run the ball very often. Christine Michael was given just 3 carries in the opening half, which simply doesn't make any sense. Michael finally got some work following intermission, and he and C.J. Prosise showed well in their limited opportunities. Michael gained 40 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, while Prosise registered 23 yards on 4 tries. Seattle had a successful drive in which Michael and Prosise were given carries, so it's weird that they shied away from that the rest of the afternoon.    Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving yardage, as he had 4 catches go for 80 yards. He looked great, and it's easy to see why the Seahawks cut C.J. Spiller this week in order to get Prosise more touches. Wilson otherwise spread the ball around. Jermaine Kearse (4-57), Doug Baldwin (4-51), Jimmy Graham (3-34) and Tyler Lockett (4-32) all posted underwhelming numbers."

   "comment":"Kearse for 16 yards on a third-and-5, and then following that up with a 31-yard bomb to Kerley. It looked like the Jets were going to upset the Patriots, but that's when Tom Brady happened. Brady caught fire, aside from an interception on a poor deep shot into double coverage. The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a fourth-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3, but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by Brandin Cooks, who still managed to lead the team with 6 catches for 93 yards. Brady spent most of the afternoon hurling deep balls to Cooks and some of his other receivers, and they had success doing so as the game progressed following some early struggles.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were thrown to Rob Gronkowski, who caught 6 balls for 83 yards. He nearly had a third touchdown, as he drew a pass interference penalty in the end zone. Meanwhile, Danny Amendola (3-40) and Chris Hogan (1-19) didn't do much. Hogan hurt his ribs on a fierce hit, but missed only 1 drive.    With Gillislee fumbling, Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him. Lewis gained 52 yards on 11 carries otherwise, while Gillislee tallied 44 yards on 10 attempts.    As for the Jets, McCown had a terrific stat line, going 31-of-45 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned interceptions. This is nothing new for the Patriots' defense, which hasn't been able to stop the pass all year. It's a bad sign that Bill Belichick hasn't been able to figure anything out during his 9 days off. It's amazing that New England continued to blow tons of coverage with lots of time to prepare for this game, and it didn't help that McCown had an eternity in the pocket. Perhaps the Patriots shouldn't have cut Kony Ealy.    Despite McCown's massive yardage total, no Jet player had more than 80 receiving yards. Kearse led the way with 4 grabs for 79 yards, while Robby Anderson (4-76) wasn't too far behind him. Kerley (2-61) and Seferian Jenkins (8-46) both scored touchdowns, though, as mentioned, Seferian-Jenkins should've found the end zone twice.    "

   "comment":"Kearse, and he later found Robby Anderson wide open in the end zone, thanks to a blown coverage. A chunk of McCown's yardage came via screens and blown coverages, as Miami's back 7 is an abomination. However, McCown's last pass was atrocious, especially when considering how much experience he has in the NFL.    Forte and Bilal Powell were the leaders for the Jets in receiving yardage. Forte caught 5 passes for 41 yards, while Powell had 2 catches for 40 yards. They also had similar rushing numbers, with Powell outgaining Forte, 43-41. Powell had 2 more carries than Forte (9-7).    I mentioned that Anderson (3-35) and Kearse (1-29) caught McCown's touchdowns. "
