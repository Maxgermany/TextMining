Still though, the Seahawks were up 12-0 on the Colts, who looked completely out of it. Indianapolis had 3 drops on third down at that point, so the players just appeared to be too unfocused to mount any sort of comeback. Everything changed after that, however. Not only did the Colts start generating consistent scoring drives; they also got on the board via a special-teams block of their own when a Seattle field goal was batted down and returned for a touchdown.

A field goal closed the first half to give Seattle a 6-0 lead at the half. To open the second half, rookie speedster Tyler Lockett took the kickoff back 105 yards for a touchdown. A 21-yard run by Thomas Rawls got the Seahawks moving, and a 22-yard pass to Doug Baldwin got them to the Chicago 30. Wilson hit Graham on a crossing route, and he broke a tackle from Brock Vereen to charge into the end zone for Seattle. With a 20-0 lead, the game was essentially over.

The Jets had issues stopping New England, and it didn't help that McCown began throwing interceptions. He had a poor throw where Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by Brandin Cooks, who still managed to lead the team with 6 catches for 93 yards. Brady spent most of the afternoon hurling deep balls to Cooks and some of his other receivers, and they had success doing so as the game progressed following some early struggles.    Brady's 2 touchdowns were thrown to Rob Gronkowski, who caught 6 balls for 83 yards. He nearly had a third touchdown, as he drew a pass interference penalty in the end zone. Meanwhile, Danny Amendola (3-40) and Chris Hogan (1-19) didn't do much. Hogan hurt his ribs on a fierce hit, but missed only 1 drive.    With Gillislee fumbling, Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him. Lewis gained 52 yards on 11 carries otherwise, while Gillislee tallied 44 yards on 10 attempts.    As for the Jets, McCown had a terrific stat line, going 31-of-45 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned interceptions. This is nothing new for the Patriots' defense, which hasn't been able to stop the pass all year. It's a bad sign that Bill Belichick hasn't been able to figure anything out during his 9 days off. It's amazing that New England continued to blow tons of coverage with lots of time to prepare for this game, and it didn't help that McCown had an eternity in the pocket. Perhaps the Patriots shouldn't have cut Kony Ealy.    Despite McCown's massive yardage total, no Jet player had more than 80 receiving yards. Kearse led the way with 4 grabs for 79 yards, while Robby Anderson (4-76) wasn't too far behind him. Kerley (2-61) and Seferian Jenkins (8-46) both scored touchdowns, though, as mentioned, Seferian-Jenkins should've found the end zone twice.    "

A chunk of McCown's yardage came via screens and blown coverages, as Miami's back 7 is an abomination. However, McCown's last pass was atrocious, especially when considering how much experience he has in the NFL.    Forte and Bilal Powell were the leaders for the Jets in receiving yardage. Forte caught 5 passes for 41 yards, while Powell had 2 catches for 40 yards. They also had similar rushing numbers, with Powell outgaining Forte, 43-41. Powell had 2 more carries than Forte (9-7).    I mentioned that Anderson (3-35) and Kearse (1-29) caught McCown's touchdowns. "
