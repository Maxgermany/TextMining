   "comment":"Lewis outplayed Ryan Tannehill, with the latter making so many mistakes that it cost his team the game. Tannehill open things up with a pick-six thrown right to Nickell Robey. He then was responsible for an awful end-zone interception. Many of his throws on the afternoon were wildly inaccurate, including 1 deep shot to an open Brian Hartline at the end of the game. Tannehill had Hartline for the go-ahead score, but overthrew him. Just before that, Tannehill allowed Buffalo to kick the decisive field goal because he lost a fumble on a strip-sack by Mario Williams (2 sacks) as his team was trying to run out the clock. Tannehill finished 19-of-37 for only 194 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 picks. The 3 scores are a bit misleading, as Tannehill had just 1 completion longer than 19 yards in this contest. The lone exception in terms of Tannehill's completions, by the way, was a 46-yarder to Mike Wallace, who finished with 5 receptions for 76 yards. Brandon Gibson (5-40) scored twice, while Charles Clay (1-7) caught the third touchdown.    Miami's coaching staff once again foolishly gave Daniel Thomas more carries than Lamar Miller. Thomas had 60 yards on 12 carries, while Miller gained 43 yards on 9 tries. The Dolphins' obsession with the untalented Thomas is inexplicable.    The Bills have the superior running backs, but both Fred Jackson and Tashard Choice failed to even match Miller's yardage total. Jackson, who had 36 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries and 4 catches for 49 receiving yards, had a scary moment in which he grabbed his ankle following a 21-yard screen pass. Fortunately, he would end up being OK. As for Spiller, he mustered only 11 yards on 6 tries as his epic failure of a 2013 campaign continues.    Lewis went 21-of-32 for 202 yards. He did turn the ball over on an interception, but his arm was hit as he threw, so it wasn't all on him. He also scrambled 5 times for 13 yards. Lewis completed mostly short stuff that his targets were able to turn into larger gains, thanks to inept play by the Miami linebacking corps.    Stevie Johnson led all Buffalo wideouts with 6 catches for 61 yards. "
