   "comment":"Carson Palmer threw a game-tying touchdown to Chad Ochocinco with 2 minutes remaining (the extra point was blocked). The Bengals subsequently won with 3 seconds remaining in overtime.    This was a weird game. If Donovan McNabb were watching, he may have thought that the Browns and Bengals would take about 100 overtime periods to score; neither offense could anything. Earlier, Shaun Rogers managed to block 2 kicks: a field goal and an extra point to send it to overtime. And even earlier, it appeared as though Cleveland always had the ball. Starting on the last play of the first quarter, the Browns held possession for 17.5 of the next 27.5 minutes.    As you can probably surmise, Derek Anderson did a great job moving the chains in those 2 quarters. He was 26-of-48 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Anderson made a stupid throw into the end zone which resulted in an interception, but it was very evident that Cleveland's offense was actually a threat with him under center. He needs to be the starting quarterback going forward.    As great as Anderson played, it's hard to believe that Braylon Edwards failed to log a single reception. He did drop a pass, but it was refreshing to see some other Browns step up. Mohamed Massaquoi somehow caught 8 balls for 148 yards. Steve Heiden and Jerome Harrison both snatched 5 receptions. Mike Furrey had 4 catches for 37 yards. Unfortunately, Kellen Winslow Jr.'s replacement, Robert Royal, had a pass hit him right on the helmet on Cleveland's final drive of regulation that would have given the team a huge first down.    Speaking of Jerome Harrison, Cleveland's new starting running back had 121 yards on 29 carries. He'll share time when Jamal Lewis comes back, but it's good to know that Cleveland has a viable option with James Davis on IR.    Carson Palmer wasn't on the field much in regulation, but thanks to overtime, he was able to pad his stats. He was 23-of-44 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Palmer's best play was a clutch 15-yard scramble on 4.h down in overtime that put "

The Bengals came out firing - they threw on the first 5 plays - and it nearly cost them.    Chad Ochocinco didn't get a chance to pull any sort of mustard antics. Ochocinco was limited to just 2 grabs for 29 yards. "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer impersonation, torching Cincinnati's secondary on 5-of-9 passing for 79 yards on the game-tying drive. Gradkowski converted a 4th-and-10 to Chaz Schilens for 16 yards, and then found Louis Murphy for a 29-yard score. Following the touchdown, the Bengals turned the ball over, setting up Sebastian Janikowski with a short decisive field goal. Oakland somehow won the turnover battle, 4-3.    It's amazing what can happen when your quarterback doesn't turn the ball over every other drive. Gradkowski went 17-of-34 for 183 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 pick and a fumble.    Oakland's running game was a mixed bag. Justin Fargas had 32 yards on 8 carries. Darren McFadden gained 25 yards on 6 attempts. Michael Bush took his 4 rushes for 27 yards, but fumbled.    Darrius Heyward-Bey was targeted 6 times, but came up with only 1 catch for 7 yards. He shockingly - and I'll capitalize, SHOCKINGLY - had a few drops.    The Raiders had major problems stopping Bernard Scott, who rushed for 119 yards on 21 carries. Scott also had 3 catches for 32 more yards. You may find it interesting that Larry Johnson had 5 yards on 2 attempts, but I don't.    Carson Palmer was a pedestrian 14-of-22 for 207 yards, an interception and 2 fumbles, though he saved his fantasy owners with 2 short rushing touchdowns. Four of his passes went to Chad Ochocinco, who finished with 67 yards.   "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer played dreadfully, showing absolutely no arm strength that he once possessed. He finished 34-of-50 for 345 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but most of that came when the Patriots began playing a vanilla prevent defense. On 1 play prior to halftime, Palmer was 9-of-16 for 56 yards and a pick-six.    Again, these numbers will look pretty, but they all came in the second half when the game was out of hand. Chad Ochocinco hauled in 12 balls for 159 yards and a touchdown, while "

All of his throws were of the short variety, as his arm strength is completely gone. Palmer had Chad Ochocinco wide open in the end zone at 1 point, but completely missed him. Baltimore also dropped 2 potential interceptions. Perhaps worst of all, the Bengals were able to kick 2 field goals because the Ravens were whistled for 2 bogus roughing-the-passer penalties.

That's not the worst stat line in the world, but 2 of Palmer's picks were disgustingly awful. The first was a pick-six. The second came as the Bengals were up 7 with 2 minutes remaining. There was no reason to force anything, but Palmer's noodle arm betrayed him. After a Tampa game-tying touchdown, Palmer tossed yet another interception (deflected by the receiver) to give the Buccaneers the decisive field goal.    Palmer isn't the only 1 letting the Bengals down. Chad Ochocinco, who was overly concerned with filming crap $10 reality programs this offseason, had yet another disappointing game. He recorded just 3 catches for 20 yards. He was also responsible for Palmer's third pick. "

And how are they going to fix this ridiculous penalty problem? Good God, the Raiders are a disaster.)    The wild, wild AFC West went down to the wire and, in the end, looked a lot like the NFC West of 2010. Even though the Chargers and Chiefs had nothing to play for, both came to play in Oakland and Denver respectively. In the early games, the Raiders got no wild-card help, meaning they would need to win and get a Kansas City victory for a playoff berth and AFC West title. Only half the equation worked out though, and Raider Nation finished at 8-8 again. On a random side note, while the other divisional game featured 17 punts with the Colquitts getting plenty of work, this 1 featured just a single punt. Oakland would wind up setting single-season records for penalties and penalty yards, so it was no surprise to see them flag "

If you like ugly football with inept offenses, this was the game for you. Once again, the Bucs stole a loss from the jaws of victory. Stud cornerback Patrick Peterson dominated the 4.h quarter with 2 interceptions to set up the Cardinals for a 4.h-quarter comeback win. Tampa Bay had the game in hand, up 10-0 when Doug Martin fumbled the ball away at midfield. That spotted Arizona 3 points. With 3 minutes remaining, Mike Glennon was intercepted by Peterson on a poorly thrown pass as Peterson had Vincent Jackson (2-27) perfectly covered. Peterson's return set up the Cardinals at the Bucs' 13-yard line. The next play saw Carson Palmer throw a strike to Larry Fitzgerald (6-68) for a touchdown."

   "comment":"Carson Palmer were both brutal. Beginning with Newton, he threw for 308 yards (21-of-39), but was guilty of 4 give-aways. The trouble started when Newton underthrew a pass, which Patrick Peterson picked off at the goal line. Newton later tossed 2 more picks and lost a fumble. The reason I was scared to bet on the Cardinals was because the Panthers were coming off a bye, and road favorites following a week off have a great covering history. However, I didn't want to take Carolina either because I questioned if Newton would spend the free week watching film of Arizona. As Matvei joked: It looks like Newton watched film of Derek Anderson instead of the Cardinals' defense. Newton was terrible, but I don't agree with Rodney Harrison's take that he needs to be benched. Two reasons: First, are the Panthers going to turn to Derek Anderson? Jimmy Clausen? What's their option if they're going to sit Newton? Second, this wasn't all Newton's fault. His leaky offensive line surrendered 7 sacks, 1 of which resulted in a safety. His receivers dropped passes as well. Steve Smith was especially guilty of this, as he let the ball go through his hands in the end zone during the first half. Brandon LaFell had an equally crucial drop on 4.h down in the red zone. There are, however, things Newton needs to work on. He needs to actually learn how to read defenses. He also has to use his legs more frequently. It's inexcusable that he scrambled only 4 times for 25 rushing yards.    Four Panthers had 4 or more receptions: Greg Olsen (5-79), Ted Ginn (4-78), Smith (4-60) and LaFell (4-47). Peterson did a number on Smith, who was frustrated enough to commit a pass-interference flag by pushing off the Pro Bowl corner. Daryl Washington, making his 2013 debut, also had a pick in the red zone.    It was not a surprise in the slightest that the Panthers struggled to run the ball. DeAngelo Williams gained just 39 yards on 12 carries.    Before I move on to Arizona, it must be noted that Carolina destroyed itself with penalties. The team was whistled for 9 infractions, most of which came at crucial moments. Once again, the Panthers were expected to play better coming off a bye. The fact that they struggled like this is an indication that they're poorly coached.    Carson Palmer outplayed Newton, but only by default. Whereas Newton was guilty of 4 turnovers, Palmer gave the ball away just 3 times. He similarly threw a pick at the goal line, coincidentally on the drive following Newton's aforementioned first interception. Another pick happened because Palmer didn't see "

It seemed like Palmer was sacked every single time he dropped back in the pocket. The Seahawks got to him 7 times. Palmer went 30-of-45 for 258 yards and 1 touchdown, which isn't bad, but he threw his trademark 2 interceptions. The first was on an underthrow to Fitzgerald that was tipped. The second, which came as Palmer was hit, was nearly returned for a score by "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer and the Cardinals had little trouble moving the ball. Chris Johnson helped push the lead into the depleted ozone layer as he rushed for 2 touchdowns in the second quarter to make the score 28-zilch. Johnson ran well all game with 22 attempts for 110 yards and his 2 touchdowns from 6 yards and 1 yard out. He tacked on 1 reception for 40 yards, vaulting his total yards to 150. Andre Ellington should be back next week, but Johnson has earned playing time. This backfield will remain muddy.    Coming out of halftime with a 31-7 lead, Carson Palmer finally got into the touchdown mix with a 4-yard strike to Larry Fitzgerald to make it 38-7."

   "comment":"Carson Palmer hit Darren Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal. It's not a matter of whether or not this game was fixed; it's only a question of who happened to pay off Hochuli. </i>    Bruce Arians' homecoming looked like it would be an inevitable win, even though the Cardinals' offense wasn't getting into the end zone, because Mike Vick was so unbelievably bad. At halftime, the Steelers had totaled just 59 yards, while the Cardinals had 279, but astonishingly, the score was 10-3 Cardinals (Editor's Note: Read the previous editor's note to understand why).    Carson Palmer and company were moving the ball with ease through the air, and he and Michael Floyd connected in the first quarter for a 3-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.

   "comment":"Carson Palmer, who could never get into a rhythm. The 49ers accumulated just 1 sack, but don't let that fool you; they were constantly swarming Palmer, who was hit fiercely throughout the afternoon. Palmer, as a result, struggled to connect with his receivers downfield, though he was able to find J.J. Nelson for a 34-yard connection late in the 4.h quarter. This ultimately set up an awkward-looking Palmer rushing touchdown, which turned out to be the winning score. Palmer, who was so frustrated by this defense, spiked the ball so hard that he slipped and fell, and I was actually concerned that he might be hurt. Fortunately, he was OK. Palmer finished 24-of-40 for 271 yards as well as his rushing touchdown. He also should've thrown an interception, but the defender dropped the easiest pick of all time, and I'm not exaggerating. He was just waiting in the end zone for the ball to drop to him, and it fell through his arms as if he were some little kid who hadn't been taught how to catch. Palmer owners were robbed of a passing touchdown; on 1 drive, "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer. Johnson did a great job in blitz pick-up. The Rams definitely tested him - Gregg Williams is infamous for sending too many pass-rushers, among other things - and Johnson passed with flying colors. Granted, the Rams were missing Robert Quinn, but Johnson was exceptional in terms of allowing Palmer to have enough time to find his receivers for big gains.    Palmer, as a result of Johnson's solid blitz pick-ups, went 26-of-40 for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Rams, missing Quinn and top cornerback Trumaine Johnson, had no chance to stop him. The Cardinals accumulated 524 net yards and picked up 29 first downs. By comparison, the Rams moved the sticks just 9 times.    With "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer, upstart running back David Johnson and Tyrann Mathieu all missed time in this contest with what appeared to be serious injuries at first glance. Johnson was the first to get hurt. He left the field early right before halftime, but he was on the field to begin the third quarter. Palmer then banged his hand on Connor Barwin. His finger was dislocated, but the training staff was able to pop it into place, allowing Palmer to re-take the field after being out for several plays. Mathieu sustained an injury after an interception late in regulation, but he walked off under his own power. His status, however, is still up in the air. I don't understand why Mathieu was even on the field when the score was 40-17 with just 2 minutes remaining. I appreciate Arizona going hard at the end of the year to maintain momentum, but pressing the gas pedal too hard can definitely backfire.    Outside of the injuries, Johnson is certainly the lead story. The rookie supplanted an injured and ineffective Chris Johnson and has proven to be an incredible replacement. David Johnson gained 187 yards and 3 touchdowns on 29 carries to go along with 4 catches for 42 receiving yards, and those numbers don't even tell the entire story. Johnson broke numerous tackles, as the Eagles had major problems tackling him. He was so great on 1 of his touchdown runs that Cris Collinsworth exclaimed, That's worth of Beast Mode! Johnson is also terrific as a pass-catcher in the receiving game. It's remarkable that he's such a complete back this early in his career, and beyond his tackle-breaking ability, his patience is incredible.    Carson Palmer went 20-of-32 for 274 yards and a touchdown. The only reason he didn't post sterling fantasy numbers is because Johnson hogged all the scores. Palmer nearly had a deep touchdown early, but "

How much of this dominating performance was due to lack of motivation on the Cardinals' part is hard to know, but Arizona got punched squarely in the mouth and backed down.

The Cardinals did manage to strike back in the second quarter, as Carson Palmer hit Larry Fitzgerald for a 17-yard touchdown pass, making it 10-6 Seattle, but that's when the Cardinals let their guard down and the blows started landing squarely on their face, as Russell Wilson tossed 3 touchdowns in the last 6 minutes before halftime, making it 30-6 Seattle."

   "comment":"Carson Palmer. Graham grabbed a crucial late interception that took away a scoring chance in the red zone. Graham also posted a sack and played an all-around great game.    For the Cardinals, this game was a massive disappointment. Carson Palmer was absolutely terrible, and his final numbers do not even tell the whole story. He finished the game 26-of-50 for 264 yards and a ridiculous 4 picks during the game. Palmer started the game horribly, and at 1 point, he was 2-of-10 for just 8 yards. As Walt would say, Brodie Croyle would scoff at that YPA of 0.8. Palmer threw behind receivers and constantly tried to force passes down field. His picks at the end of the game were careless, forced throws. He simply was off for the entirety of the game.    Because of Palmer's troubles, Arizona's receivers had trouble catching passes until garbage time. The team's Big Three of receivers ended up with solid numbers, but they were definitely skewed. "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer had an up-and-down performance. There were times when the veteran quarterback looked like he was regaining the momentum he had last year. He was spry in the pocket and managed to move around to complete a lot of passes. At the same time, he made numerous mistakes, including a horrific interception that allowed the 49ers to get back into the game. There were just 3 minutes left in the 4.h quarter when Palmer threw that pick, which was intended for nobody in particular. The Cardinals were leading 20-13 and could have run some more time off the clock. It was a major mistake by Palmer. Overall, Palmer's numbers were solid. He went 30-of-49 for 376 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He definitely has room for improvement on some of his decision-making, but he did give the Cardinals a chance to win it late. His performance on the final drive was strong, so perhaps he will turn that into a solid performance next weekend.    During the contest, Palmer relied heavily on "

   "comment":"Carson Palmer couldn't move the chains in a tie game. Palmer had a couple of nice drives this afternoon, but struggled for the most part. In fact, he was so bad that it makes me wonder if someone dressed up in his jersey last week because the difference was night and day, and this version of Palmer is the 1 we've seen most of the year. Palmer finished 18-of-33 for only 145 yards, 2 touchdowns, a pair of interceptions and 3 fumbles. The result could've been even worse for Palmer, as Miami dropped a couple of other potential picks. One of his actual interceptions wasn't his fault because the pass was tipped, but Palmer had a horrible afternoon overall.    With Palmer struggling in yet another road start, only 2 Cardinals accumulated more than 20 receiving yards: "

Palmer was very accurate and was able to succeed despite seeing a lot of pressure. For the first time all year, he looked entirely comfortable in the pocket, and he was able to show his arm strength as well. Perhaps the best trait about Palmer is that he knows when to target certain players. He did not try to force anything today, and that was apparent by the fact that he did not log any turnovers. Palmer should build on this skill for next season, and perhaps he will be able to do that and get the Cardinals back to the postseason.    In the receiving corps, it was clear that the Cardinals were missing "
