   "comment":"Keith Rivers in the first quarter, dishing out a nasty (but clean) block. Rivers had to leave the game with a jaw injury, and it was later announced that he would be out for the year. Maybe once Ward slows down, he can move to safety and knock people out of the game. Or he can become an analyst on ESPN and debacle people that way.    Besides killing people, Ward had 60 yards and a touchdown. "
