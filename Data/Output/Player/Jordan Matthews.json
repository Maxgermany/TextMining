He threw 2 interceptions, although 1 wasn't his fault because it went right off Matthews for an 11-yard score. Sanchez did a good job of moving the chains for most of the afternoon, though he did make some mistakes. He threw 2 interceptions, although 1 wasn't his fault because it went right off Josh Huff's hands. However, the second pick was bad, as Sanchez tried to force the issue. He also had another potential interception heaved right at the defender. Having said that, Sanchez wasn't any worse than Foles was, finishing 15-of-22 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. His numbers could've been much better, but Darren Sproles had a bad drop on what looked like a potential long gain.    Both Foles and Sanchez threw 1 score each to Maclin, who once again put together a huge outing. He snagged 6 of his team-leading 7 targets for 158 yards and the 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, Matthews (3-40) reeled in Sanchez's other score. "

Sanchez made it a point to throw to Zach Ertz as much as possible. I'm not exaggerating; Ertz drew a ridiculous 18 targets - twice more than the player who saw the next-most amount of balls thrown his way (Darren Sproles). Ertz hauled in 15 of those passes for 115 yards.    Both of Sanchez's touchdowns went to Riley Cooper (5-53), who dropped a pass. Jeremy Maclin (4-62) and Jordan Matthews (3-58) were big disappointments considering their matchup against Washington's poor secondary.    LeSean McCoy also scored. He managed 88 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and also caught 3 balls for 28 receiving yards. He had a drop, but ran well considering that Washington's defense has been so stout versus ground attacks this season.    As for the Redskins, Robert Griffin had a mixed outing, going 16-of-23 for 220 yards and an interception, which he forced into double coverage. He didn't run nearly enough - 5 scrambles, 11 rush yards - and he was nearly pick-sixed early in the game, but he completed a pair of deep bombs to Jackson. He made some mistakes, showing poor footwork on some attempts and holding on to the ball too long, but he was robbed of a touchdown when Allen tackled Jackson in the end zone prior to the ball arriving.    Jackson talked trash about the Eagles leading up to this game, and he backed up his talk. He caught 4 balls for 126 yards, reeling in receptions of 55 and 51 yards. There's no doubt that Philadelphia missed Jackson's game-breaking ability this year, but it's not like he's done much for the Redskins.

   "comment":"Jordan Matthews deep downfield. I'd say that Philadelphia fans should be more optimistic going forward in the wake of Bradford's second-half performance, but we saw this in Atlanta back in Week 1. Besides, the Redskins have an abysmal pass defense, so Bradford should have been even better.    Bradford's touchdowns went to Riley Cooper (2-72) and Brent Celek (1-10), neither of whom is worth owning. The team's top receiver, Jordan Matthews, caught only 3 balls for 50 yards. As mentioned, Bradford missed him for a score, though Matthews didnt help his stat line by dropping more passes. That's been a huge issue for him this season.

To no surprise, Matthews dropped a pass, which would've been a touchdown if it weren't for a penalty. As for Agholor, I keep saying that he doesn't belong on fantasy rosters, yet he's owned in 45 percent of leagues. I don't get it. He's not an efficient player, and Bradford isn't good enough to compensate for that.    Meanwhile, the Saints' offense struggled immensely, as "

   "comment":"Jordan Matthews, Wendell Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed. Special-teamer Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and Zach Ertz (6-55)."

Matthews will be a low-end WR2 most weeks, but the performance from Green-Beckham is encouraging. He has a lot of talent, so maybe he can become a weapon in the Eagles' offense. I would not recommend adding him yet though, as a chunk of his production came in garbage time.    Tight end "
