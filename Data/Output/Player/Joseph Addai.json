   "comment":"Joseph Addai with 7 minutes remaining. Houston eventually drove down to the Indianapolis 24 with just 1 second on the clock. Unfortunately, the kicker missed a 42-yard field goal, failing to send it into overtime. Good grief, Kris Brown.    The story in this game was the amount of dumb errors the Texans continuously made. They were repeatedly offsides in the first half, negating a Colts punt and a sack of Peyton Manning. Matt Schaub tossed a first-quarter interception into triple coverage. Ryan Moats lost a fumble on Indianapolis' 1-yard line. And of course, there was the missed kick. Houston is now 0-8 at Indianapolis, but they could have easily won this game. The players shouldn't hang their heads at all.    Aside from that bad pick, Schaub played pretty well, finishing 32-of-43 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (the second pick wasn't his fault).    Schaub found Andre Johnson 10 times. The athletic receiver turned those receptions into 103 yards.    Without Owen Daniels, Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, Dallas Clark caught a career-high 14 balls for 119 yards. It's almost unfair that a fantasy owner can use him as a tight end.    Reggie Wayne (8 catches, 64 yards), Pierre Garcon (5-60) and Joseph Addai (5-49, TD) were also a big part of the offense. Amusingly, Wayne tossed an interception on a trick play. Guess there won't be a quarterback change in Indianapolis anytime soon.    With Donald Brown out, Addai had all but 2 of Indianapolis' carries in this contest. He rushed for 63 yards and a score on 14 attempts. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
