   "comment":"Addai fumbled the ball at midfield. On the next possession, the Colts stalled in the red zone and had to kick a field goal. Toward the end of the first half, Peyton Manning fumbled the ball away on Cleveland's 1-yard line. In the second half, Manning threw an interception and Adam Vinatieri missed a 46-yard field goal.    Though they didn't get the cover, the Colts were able to win this larcenous contest, thanks to a 37-yard fumble return by Robert Mathis.    Anderson, who was responsible for the coughed-up ball, later left the game with a knee injury, coincidentally caused by Mathis. Anderson could be out for the year, leaving the Browns with Ken Dorsey. Anderson was a meager 16-of-26 for 110 yards. No 1 he threw to caught more than 3 balls. Braylon Edwards paced the team with 36 receiving yards.    Jamal Lewis rushed for 77 yards on 24 carries. It's sad to say that he was Cleveland's most potent offensive weapon on this day.    Speaking of offensive woes, Manning was a horrific 15-of-21 for 125 yards, 2 picks and a fumble (though 1 of the interceptions was on a Hail Mary.) Reggie Wayne (4 catches, 26 yards) was his leading receiver.    Addai also epically failed. In addition to his fumble, he rushed for just 57 yards on 15 carries against 1 of the worst rush defenses in the NFL.    With the loss, the Browns are now 4-8. Many of the loyal fans who attended the game were seen holding up signs that read, Cowher Power!   "

   "comment":"Addai with 7 minutes remaining. Houston eventually drove down to the Indianapolis 24 with just 1 second on the clock. Unfortunately, the kicker missed a 42-yard field goal, failing to send it into overtime. Good grief, Kris Brown.    The story in this game was the amount of dumb errors the Texans continuously made. They were repeatedly offsides in the first half, negating a Colts punt and a sack of Peyton Manning. Matt Schaub tossed a first-quarter interception into triple coverage. Ryan Moats lost a fumble on Indianapolis' 1-yard line. And of course, there was the missed kick. Houston is now 0-8 at Indianapolis, but they could have easily won this game. The players shouldn't hang their heads at all.    Aside from that bad pick, Schaub played pretty well, finishing 32-of-43 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions (the second pick wasn't his fault).    Schaub found Andre Johnson 10 times. The athletic receiver turned those receptions into 103 yards.    Without Owen Daniels, Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, Dallas Clark caught a career-high 14 balls for 119 yards. It's almost unfair that a fantasy owner can use him as a tight end.    Reggie Wayne (8 catches, 64 yards), Pierre Garcon (5-60) and Joseph Addai (5-49, TD) were also a big part of the offense. Amusingly, Wayne tossed an interception on a trick play. Guess there won't be a quarterback change in Indianapolis anytime soon.    With Donald Brown out, Addai had all but 2 of Indianapolis' carries in this contest. He rushed for 63 yards and a score on 14 attempts.   "

   "comment":"Addai, who didn't seem to have any clue as to what was going on because he didn't practice all week, had to be moved around by Painter. As Peyton Manning's replacement was doing this, Jeff Saturday inexplicably snapped the ball, catching Painter off-guard. The Saints recovered the fumble and quickly scored. New Orleans then scored again. And scored. And scored. And scored. And scored. And scored some more. Want to know how efficient the Saints were? They didn't punt the ball until there were a few minutes remaining in regulation - only because Drew Brees was removed at the end of the third quarter.    Brees was unbelievable. He went 31-of-35 for 325 yards and 5 touchdowns. Four Saints had at least 5 receptions: Marques Colston (7-98, 2 TDs), Pierre Thomas (5-68), Jimmy Graham (6-54, 2 TDs) and Darren Sproles (6-19, TD).    Speaking of Sproles, he had 88 rushing yards and another score on just 12 carries. Mark Ingram led the team on the ground with 91 yards on 14 attempts. Unfortunately, Ingram limped off the field in the 4.h quarter.    The only stat of note for the Colts is Delone Carter's 89 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries, although he lost a fumble in the first quarter. Addai started, but was quickly benched after 2 carries (8 yards), since he had absolutely no idea what to do or where to line up. Not that it would have made much of a difference, but Jim Caldwell made a huge mistake by starting Addai. For thoughts on Ravens-Jaguars, check out my updated   "
