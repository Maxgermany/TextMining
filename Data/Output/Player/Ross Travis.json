   "comment":"Travis Kelce in the end zone for what should've been a touchdown. Smith had an awful sequence in the red zone in the 4.h quarter. He had a wide-open Kelce in the end zone, but checked the ball down instead. He then had an open Chris Conley for a touchdown, but overshot him. Smith followed that up by throwing short of the first-down marker by tossing a meaningless 5-yard completion to Ross Travis. Smith finished 25-of-38 for only 178 yards and a pick. He struggled mightily, though his receivers did hurt him by some drops. Still, Smith had a great matchup against a poor Carolina secondary, but couldn't take advantage of it. Despite the victory, the Chiefs have to feel discouraged about this, as Smith is the 1 holding this team back.    With Jeremy Maclin out, "
