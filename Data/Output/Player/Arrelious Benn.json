   "comment":"Arrelious Benn was intercepted by Chris Houston.    Freeman engineered a 2.minute drill to produce a field goal just before halftime. The third quarter saw Freeman struggle some more. He was injured and left the game after getting tackled by multiple Lions defenders. Freeman went into the locker room with cramps, but returned to the game early in the 4.h quarter after backup Josh Johnson played for 1 possession. It wasn't until late in the 4.h quarter that Freeman finally guided the Bucs offense to a touchdown. He hit wideout Mike Williams for a 5-yard score. It was a phenomenal catch by Williams. For the day, Freeman completed 28-of-43 passes for 257 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. Here were Freeman's targets: Mike Williams: 9 Earnest Graham: 9 Kellen Winslow: 8 Arrelious Benn: 7 Preston Parker: 5 Dezmon Briscoe: 1 Kregg Lumpkin: 1 Luke Stocker: 1    Buccaneers running back LeGarrette Blount couldn't get going in the first half with 13 yards on 4 carries."

Freeman finished the game 22-of-31 for 243 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception.    Blount's big second half was the key to the Buccaneers comeback win. Hw finished the game with 71 yards on 13 carries and 2 touchdowns.    Backup wide receiver Parker led Tampa Bay in receiving with 98 yards on 6 receptions. Winslow totaled 44 yards on 4 receptions. Williams finished the game with only 1 catch for minus-4 yards.    The Vikings started the game by running the ball down the throat of the Buccaneers.
