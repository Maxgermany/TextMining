Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.    The Falcon defensive line got some pressure on Freeman but never sacked him. Defensive end Ray Edwards was held in check by Bucs right tackle Jeremy Trueblood. Left tackle Donald Penn was called for a holding on John Abraham, but otherwise, he limited Abraham to 1 hit on Freeman. Atlanta's defensive line did not defend the run that well either.    Matt Ryan answered the first 3 points from the Bucs with a field goal on an 84-yard drive midway through the first half. Ryan moved the ball by throwing the ball up and letting his receivers make some plays. Julio Jones and Roddy White both made big grabs in the first half. Late in the second quarter, Ryan was sacked by rookie defensive end Adrian Clayborn. Ryan put the ball on the ground and it was recovered by Bucs defensive end Michael Bennett. When Ryan started to throw more to Jones in the second half, good things happened for Atlanta. Jones beat Talib to the end zone on a pass that was overthrown by Ryan. Later in the fourth quarter, Jones beat Talib and the safety in zone coverage for a 49-yard pass to the Bucs' 10-yard line. Jones had to stop and wait for the ball, and a better pass would have been a score. Ryan finished the drive on the next play with a 10-yard touchdown to Gonzalez. Ryan later had White for a potential touchdown, but his No. 1 wideout dropped the ball. Atlanta had to settle for a field goal and never got the ball back because Tampa Bay was able to run out the clock.    Each team featured a young defensive tackle that was a disruptive force in the game. For Atlanta, third-year pro "

   "comment":"Benn. The second-year wide out ran wide open in busted coverage, and Freeman lofted a ball that led him down the field. Backup running back Earnest Graham then had a 34-yard run and a 19-yard screen pass to set up a field goal for the Buccaneers. Safety Tanard Jackson made his first start since Week 2 of 2010 after a 19-game suspension by the NFL for failed drug tests. Late in the second quarter, he caught a deflected pass to set up Tampa Bay in excellent field position. A few plays later, Freeman threw a dart to a wide receiver for a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Buccaneers' defense came to play, as they intercepted Brees twice in the first half along with their forced fumble. Tampa Bay led 20-10 at halftime. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, Brees made a crucial third-down conversion on a perfect pass to Lance Moore. He beat cornerback E.J. Biggers down the sideline and Brees dropped the ball in precisely for a 40-yard gain. That set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Mark Ingram. The Buccaneers answered with a field goal to take a 6-point lead. Next, Brees started moving the ball down the field with precision passing. The drive stalled inside the Tampa Bay 5-yard line. On fourth-and(-2 at the 4-yard line, Brees did a bootleg but finding nobody open, threw a jump ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Buccaneers linebacker Quincy Black. Tampa Bay's offense maintained possession of the ball to secure the win. In the game, Brees was 29-of-45 for 383 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Ingram ran for 22 yards on 9 carries. The Buccaneers had no answer for tight end Jimmy Graham. He totaled 124 yards on 7 catches. Colston also had 7 receptions for 118 yards. Freeman completed 23-of-41 passes for 303 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. It was a good bounce-back performance for the Buccaneers' signal caller after a horrible game a week ago against the 49ers. Earnest Graham ran for 109 yards on 17 carries. He stepped up and did an excellent job filling in for the injured LeGarrette Blount. Benn had 3 receptions for 83 yards while Mike Williams had 6 catches for 59 yards."
