   "comment":"Amos caught the deflection, returning the ball 90 yards for a touchdown. That gave the Bears a 24-13 lead with only 5 minutes remaining. The Ravens produced a field-goal drive to make it 24-16. Just after the 2-minute warning, Baltimore's Michael Campanaro returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown, and Flacco found Boyle wide open in the flat for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 24 and force overtime. It was a terrible move by Bears punter Pat O'Donnell to give Campanaro a chance. In overtime, Jordan Howard broke downfield on a 53-yard run to the Baltimore 40. Trubisky made a great play, scrambling to avoid rushers and slinging a pass to Kendall Wright (2-36) for a leaping grab of 18 yards. That set up Connor Barth to hit the game-winning field goal from 40 yards out.    Trubisky was 8-of-16 for 113 yards with a touchdown. Chicago clearly doesn't trust him to throw the ball, as the team had a lot of carries for its running backs. At halftime, Trubisky was only 2-of-7 for 29 yards. Howard ran for 167 yards on 36 carries.    Flacco was 24-of-41 for 180 yards with 2 interceptions. Alex Collins (15-74) led Baltimore in rushing, while Chris Moore (3-44) paced the team in receiving yards.    The MVP of the game for Chicago was definitely Kyle Fuller. He was targeted all day and kept producing incompletions, including 3 passes in a goal-line situation. Later, Fuller made the deflection that produced Amos' interception, which was the death blow for Baltimore. The Ravens' defense played well for their part. Linebacker "
