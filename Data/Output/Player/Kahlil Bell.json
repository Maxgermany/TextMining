   "comment":"Kahlil Bell, and short, accurate throws from McCown. The defense, meanwhile, buckled down and forced Green Bay into 3 consecutive 3.and-outs. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. The Bears killed themselves with stupid mistakes (penalties, missed field goal, 2 interceptions), while Rodgers caught fire, continuously torching beleaguered cornerback Zackary Bowman. Rodgers was ultimately pulled when the score was 35-10.    Rodgers went 21-of-29 for 283 yards and 5 touchdowns. He was sacked only once, which is key because of what happened in Kansas City last week. The Packers as a whole played a perfect game, committing no turnovers and zero penalties.    Rodgers' threw a pair of scores to Jordy Nelson (6-115) and James Jones (4-50). The fifth, as mentioned, went to Finley (3-20).    The Packers didn't really try to run the ball at all. But when they did, Ryan Grant (8-44) had more touches than James Starks (6-13). Starks screwed up on 2 assignments, resulting in busted plays where Rodgers had to scramble for short gains.    As mentioned, the Bears moved the chains pretty effectively, mostly on the ground. Both Kahlil Bell (23-121) and Armando Allen (11-40) found huge holes, as Chicago's offensive line dominated Green Bay's front."
