As a comparison, New England was 9-of-18 when trying to move the chains.    Speaking of Martz, the self-proclaimed genius called just 12 runs for Frank Gore. O'Sullivan passed 29 times. The 49ers either had the lead or trailed by only 3 until midway through the third quarter, so it's not like San Francisco was so far behind it couldn't pound the rock with its best player. And it's not like Gore wasn't effective; he gained 54 yards on those 12 attempts, which is an average of 4.5.    Oh, and in case you didn't know, O'Sullivan sucks, and is far from the Super Awesome Quarterback No. 1 Martz described him as a few weeks ago. O'Sullivan somehow threw 3 touchdowns, but he also tossed 3 picks and failed to complete 50 percent of his passes. His YPA was a minuscule 4.5. On San Francisco's final offensive play, O'Sullivan needed to convert a 4.h-and-long. Instead of firing the ball downfield, he attempted some sort of weird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar-like hook shot. I can't describe it better than that. I would have laughed if I wasn't too busy crying, as my 5.unit play on the 49ers went down the drain.    "
