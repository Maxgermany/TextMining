As NFL.com pointed out, If Roethlisberger was less elusive, the Eagles very easily could have tallied 15 sacks or more.    With that in mind, no Eagles fan has the right to complain about the missed Brian Westbrook face mask penalties in the Cowboys game (though they had a right to do so before this contest). The officials missed tons of penalties on Philadelphia, including some late hits, face masks and throat grabs. There was also a blown call on a Roethlisberger safety.    Though the Steelers managed only 3 sacks of their own, both quarterbacks had to leave the game with injuries. Roethlisberger's shoulder exploded on 1 of his 50,000 sacks, while McNabb hurt his chest on a first-quarter tackle. Neither signal caller threw for more than 200 yards, though McNabb completed his first 15 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Westbrook also had to leave the Broken Bone Bowl. He'll have an MRI on his ankle on Monday. Awful news for Philadelphia's offense. Westbrook couldn't really do anything versus Pittsburgh's stout front while he was in the game; he carried the ball 5 times for 12 yards.    Like Westbrook, Willie Parker didn't have much luck on the ground. Parker tallied only 20 yards on 13 rushes.    Neither quarterback had much of a pocket to work with, so as you can imagine, no receiver really did much. Heath Miller led the Steelers with 63 receiving yards. Hines Ward (4 catches, 34 yards) and Santonio Holmes (3 catches, 32 yards) disappointed fantasy owners. Meanwhile, Hank Baskett paced the Eagles with 8 grabs and 85 yards.

Brian Westbrook rushed only 6 times for 28 yards, but left the game with yet another concussion. He could be shut down for the rest of the season; he can't possibly risk a third concussion in a span of 2 months or less. LeSean McCoy took over, but carried the ball just 3 times for 5 yards.    Philip Rivers was almost perfect, going 20-of-25 for 231 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was sacked only 2 times.    The Eagles once again had major problems stopping the tight end, as Antonio Gates caught 7 balls for 78 yards. Vincent Jackson surprisingly caught only 1 ball for 10 yards on what probably should have been offensive pass interference.    Reports of LaDainian Tomlinson's demise have clearly been exaggerated. Tomlinson somehow gained 96 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. This really came out of nowhere, and it was shocking because the Eagles came into this contest ranked second against the run. It's amazing what can happen when you actually have quality blocking, eh? Congratulations to Tomlinson, by the way, who passed Marcus Allen for third all-time in career touchdowns with 146. Tomlinson is only behind Jerry Rice (208) and our pal Emmitt Smith (175).    I promised I'd get to Boger, and I'm keeping my word. Though Boger called shady holding penalties throughout the contest, he didn't catch my attention until the final drive. Boger thrice let extra seconds tick off the clock. One example: DeSean Jackson caught a pass along the sidelines with 21 seconds remaining. As the play ended, the clock ticked away to 20 and 19 seconds. I was hoping Boger would see this and ask for the time to be reset to 20 or 21 seconds. Instead, Boger asked for the game clock to be reset to 18 seconds! Again, this happened 3 times! Boger's children better receive some great Christmas gifts because their father clearly made tons of money on this game.   "

Donovan McNabb was pressured throughout the evening, taking 4 sacks and fumbling twice, 1 of which was the result of a botched Nick Cole snap. When McNabb actually had time, he was able to hit most his targets (though he did miss some routine throws). He went 20-of-36 for 223 yards.    Andy Reid did a poor job with his offensive balance. While McNabb threw 36 times, Philly running backs carried the ball on just 7 occasions. That's really embarrassing. Brian Westbrook led the backs with 5 carries for 17 yards.

Inside linebacker Stewart Bradley endured a concussion. Kevin Kolb suffered a similar fate later on. And for the Packers, Ryan Grant left the game with an ankle injury. Both Kolb and Grant are in danger of missing their Week 2 games.    Thanks in part to immense pressure in his face, Kolb was awful in the season opener, going just 5-of-10 for 24 yards before getting knocked out of the game. QB Dog Killer entered afterward, and caught an unprepared Packers defense off-guard by rushing for 103 yards on 11 carries. The Packers didn't prepare to defend QB Dog Killer going into the contest, so don't buy the deranged psychopath's performance.    With Kolb out or struggling, none of Philadelphia's receivers did much. DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin each had 4 catches for 30 and 38 yards, respectively, with Maclin scoring once."

Down 18, Reid had a 4th-and-goal at the 4-yard line. Reid opted to kick a field goal to bring the deficit to within 15, which I don't have a big problem with. However, on the next drive, the Eagles had a 4th-and-goal at the 18. Reid called for another field goal despite the fact that there was 4:52 remaining in regulation. Now, converting a 4th-and-goal from the 18 is pretty improbable, but what the hell was the point of that field goal? Whether the deficit is 15 or 12, the Eagles still needed 2 touchdowns. There simply wasn't enough time for a meaningless kick like that.    At any rate, QB Dog Killer's touchdowns went to Celek (3-50) and "

At the end of the play, Jackson stopped before reaching the end zone, and then tipped himself over sideways across the goal line, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. The infraction would prove to be inconsequential, but Andy Reid can't be pleased after scolding Jackson a couple of weeks earlier from clowning around. Reid will probably take a cheesesteak break during the week and warn Jackson not to mess around again.    "

   "comment":"DeSean Jackson (5-86, TD), LeSean McCoy (11-80, TD) and Jeremy Maclin (6-54, TD) all made their owners happy.Jackson took advantage. He rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. He was also effective in the passing game, catching 6 balls for 85 receiving yards. The Eagles also gave this game away with sloppy play on offense. QB Dog Killer went 26-of-40 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns with 90 rushing yards. However, he also had 4 interceptions. Two of the picks weren't his fault. The first 1 was the result of a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage. The final interception occurred because the ball popped out of Jason Avant's hands. Avant had been enjoying a great game (9-139) prior to that mental error. This marked the third time in 4 weeks that an Eagle wideout screwed up on the final possession. Jeremy Maclin was the culprit against the Falcons and 49ers, dropping a catchable first down and fumbling, respectively. QB Dog Killer's other picks were his responsibility. He was hit as he threw on his second interception, but he held on to the ball way too long in the pocket. The other was a poor pick-six. Speaking of waiting too long in the pocket, the Eagles cost themselves 3 points at the end of the first half. The clock was running out, but QB Dog Killer held on to the ball too long. He fired an incompletion as time expired, so they weren't able to attempt a field goal. Sadly, Philadelphia fans have gotten used to this in the Andy Reid era.    Quality fantasy performances: DeSean Jackson (5-86, TD), LeSean McCoy (11-80, TD) and Jeremy Maclin (6-54, TD) all made their owners happy."

   "comment":"DeSean Jackson (6-99). Jeremy Maclin played, but barely did anything, catching just 1 pass for 7 yards.    LeSean McCoy was the star for Philadelphia, rushing for 123 yards on just 23 carries. His cutting ability was simply a pleasure to watch. It's almost physically impossible to run like he does.    The Giants, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all; Ahmad Bradshaw had nearly triple the amount of carries compared to Andre Brown, 13-5, respectively, but they gained just 53 combined yards, with Brashaw getting 39 and Brown tallying 14. Eli Manning consequently had to do pretty much everything, and he basically did. He went 24-of-42 for 309 yards, 2 touchdowns and an uncharacteristic interception in the end zone in which he was fooled by the defense. Manning was able to complete multiple long gains against Philadelphia's tough cornerback group, a unit that missed Nnamdi Asomugha for nearly half the game because he was poked in the eye. It was initially reported that he would have to go to the hospital, but he felt better and returned to the field in the 4.h quarter.    Manning's touchdowns went to Victor Cruz (9-109) and Bear Pascoe (1-6). Ramses Barden (2-36) was very disappointing. Not only was he outclassed by Domenik Hixon (6-114); he committed an egregious offensive pass interference on the final series of the game, putting the Giants out of field-goal range. Naturally, Lawrence Tynes was short on his 54-yard try.    A couple of interesting things in this game: - Brian Dawkins was due to have his number retired at halftime. He was also the final player introduced prior to kickoff, which really pumped up the team and the crowd. - The Giants were able to have good field position all evening because of David Wilson's kickoff returns. Wilson averaged 36 yards per attempt, as there were gaping holes nearly every time the ball was kicked to him. The crowd eventually booed after each Giants' kickoff. - Speaking of an angry crowd, I thought it was hilarious that the fans jeered AndWy Reid when he challenged a DeSean Jackson reception. It's amazing how little confidence Philadelphians have in their head coach. - Giants' safety Jackson (6-99). Jeremy Maclin played, but barely did anything, catching just 1 pass for 7 yards.

   "comment":"DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin were inexplicably on the sidelines. Oh, and speaking of McCoy, he lost a fumble deep in his own territory at the end of the second quarter, giving the Redskins a chip-shot field goal. A good coach might be able to fix this at halftime, but not Reid. The Eagles came out of the tunnel to have their opening drive ruined by a delay of game and a Foles fumble. The Redskins were struggling offensively up until this point, but Robert Griffin and his receivers finally started clicking. Washington would soon extend its lead and never look back.    Foles finished 21-of-46 for 204 yards and the 2 picks. He wasn't terrible, but didn't show any signs that he can be a starter in this league. That stat line is especially disappointing considering how porous Washington had been against the pass all year, though it's worth noting that Brandon Meriweather, who was on the field for the first time all year, was a force in a pedestrian secondary. Unfortunately, Meriweather suffered a knee injury in the second half. He limped off, which is a shame because he just can't stay healthy.    Speaking of injuries, LeSean McCoy was knocked out with a concussion. He was carted off, and it didn't look like he knew where he was at that moment. McCoy rushed for just 45 yards on 15 carries and that aforementioned fumble. The concussion, by the way, occurred when the Eagles were down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Afterward, Reid was asked why McCoy was still on the field at that point. His answer? We were trying to catch up to win the game. They were trying to catch up to win the game... down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Oh OK, that makes sense.    McCoy (6 catches, 67 yards) happened to be the Eagles' leading receiver, as Foles threw tons of screens. DeSean Jackson (2-5) and Jeremy Maclin (0-0) were major disappointments.    Griffin, meanwhile, was nearly perfect, going 14-of-15 for 200 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also scrambled 12 times for 84 rushing yards. One of his best players in terms of running came on a 3rd-and-14 in the third quarter when this was an 11-point game. Despite the long-distance situation, Griffin managed to pick up the first down with a 23-yard scramble.

The first drive of the game was a clinic as Philadelphia moved the ball at will. It started with a 44-yard screen pass to LeSean McCoy. Foles hit big completions to Cooper and Jackson before keeping it himself for a 5-yard score. On the next possession, McCoy had a good run going before he fumbled the ball while in air. Darrelle Revis recovered the it. That spotted Tampa Bay a field goal. Eric Page had a 42-yard punt return and set up a 24-yard touchdown pass from Mike Glennon to Vincent Jackson. After the Bucs took a 10-7 lead, Foles threw a 12-yard strike to DeSean Jackson after he beat Revis and Mark Barron crossing the back of the end zone.Jackson. The Glazers, the Bucs owners, and general manager Mark Dominik had to be thinking of what could have been with Chip Kelly. A Bucs source told me that Chip Kelly was Tampa Bay's head coach for 6 hours or so before changing his mind. Instead of landing Kelly, the organization hired Greg Schiano.

   "comment":"DeSean Jackson disappointed (3-21), but he can't be blamed for that. Jackson expressed frustration with Foles' accuracy woes throughout the afternoon. He also appeared to injure his ankle in the third quarter when he grabbed it in pain, but he missed only a few plays.    In addition to poor quarterbacking, the Eagles were guilty of some horrible coaching decisions. Chip Kelly has proven himself to be incapable of making big choices in key moments thus far in his NFL career. At the end of the first half, the Eagles had the ball just over midfield with 14 seconds and 1 timeout remaining. Faced with a 4.h-and-1, Kelly opted for a 60-yard field goal despite there being some wind. The 2 better options would've been to go for it and pick up extra yardage, or to simply punt it away. The long kick, which was predictably missed, set up Dallas in great field position.    The Cowboys didn't have a great offensive showing themselves, mustering only 3 points in the first half. It was odd, but Philadelphia's defense actually played well for the first time all year. Then again, the Cowboys' inability to score wasn't all because of the Eagles; Dallas kicked itself in the foot repeatedly with dumb penalties, as the team was whistled for 9 infractions in the opening 30 minutes alone.

There was more of the same from Griffin in the second half. He led some scoring drives, though he was aided by a horrible call on Harrison Smith, who was flagged for hitting Griffin as he slid feet-first. Smith, who had a tremendous performance, barely even touched Griffin. It was a truly awful penalty that allowed Griffin to keep the drive alive and ultimately lead his team into the end zone. However, Griffin took some bad sacks and couldn't get anything going on the team's final drive as a consequence. He was also hesitant to run on a crucial 4.h-and-6, hurling a low throw instead, turning the ball over on downs. Griffin finished 18-of-28 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He also picked up 24 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The important thing is that he finished this game unscathed, but there was a scary moment in the first half when he was sacked. He was bent backward awkwardly and limped around for a bit. He was fine, however.    Griffin's sole aerial score went to DeSean Jackson, who totaled 4 catches for 120 yards.

   "comment":"DeSean Jackson. Jackson. Kirk Cousins took advantage of this liability in the early going, as Jackson accumulated 51 receiving yards in the first quarter alone. Jackson only caught 1 pass after than (4 receptions, 55 yards), but that was part Cousins being inconsistent and part Jackson's ineptitude; Jackson dropped a touchdown at 1 point, though the Redskins ultimately found the end zone on the same drive. Speaking of Cousins, he struggled to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-34 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that happened to be a pick-six; Cousins launched the turnover off his back foot while under pressure. He panicked, and it was the sort of blunder Cousins has been guilty of far too often. Cousins was just 6-of-14 in the second half with a pass that was nearly intercepted in the end zone, as his inaccuracy allowed the Eagles to hang around. Fortunately for the Redskins, Philadelphia couldn't muster anything offensively, so it didn't matter at all.    Both of Cousins' touchdowns went to the players replacing Jordan Reed's production: "

Cousins focused on targeting Jordan Reed early and often. Reed racked up 9 catches for 99 yards and a touchdown, trailing only Jamison Crowder (9-107), who also found the end zone. Crowder and Reed share the middle of the field, so it's surprising to see both of them post huge numbers. Elsewhere, Vernon Davis (5-93) and Pierre Garcon (6-67) both had solid performances.

As mentioned, the lead receiver for the Buccaneers was Evans (7-93, 1 TD). Evans was able to gain separation from Chicago's poor secondary easily, and justified his first-round fantasy billing. He will continue to be a WR1 week in and week out, and he can be trusted in almost any matchup. Elsewhere, DeSean Jackson had a solid performance, but it could have been better.

With Case Keenum at quarterback, nobody was really giving the Vikings a chance to beat the up-and-coming Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but Keenum looked like Fran Tarkenton as he shredded the Bucs' defense to lead Minnesota to a shocking victory. Tampa Bay's secondary had no answer for Keenum, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, as they led Minnesota to 21 first-half points. The Vikings then used their defense to close out the win by generating 3 interceptions.    To get the game started, Keenum lofted in a beautiful pass to Adam Thielen for 45 yards after he got separation on Vernon Hargreaves running a go route down the sideline. A 16-yard pass to Dalvin Cook set up Cook to plunge over the goal line for his first career touchdown. The Bucs answered with a field goal drive. The Vikings were set up for more points as Keenum hit Thielen (5-98) for 19 yards and a holding call on T.J. Ward in the end zone set up a first-and-goal. Keenum tossed an easy pass to Jarius Wright to give Minnesota a 14-3 lead. The Bucs started moving the ball with DeSean Jackson getting the best of Trae Waynes for a nice gain, but then Winston forced a pass downfield to Jackson, who didn't have separation on Waynes, and the third-year corner picked off the pass.Jackson not to celebrate touchdowns when down 14 points?
