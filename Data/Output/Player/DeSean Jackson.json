   "comment":"Jacksonville in the playoffs. Pittsburgh failed to address the front, and it seemed like they were fine going into this contest. But of course, the Texans and Browns have pretty sorry defenses... Philadelphia's front 7 completely dominated Pittsburgh's offensive line. It actually looked like grown men were attacking helpless young children. The Eagles sacked Roethlisberger 9 times (6 times in the second quarter alone), and registered tons of pressures and knockdowns. As NFL.com pointed out, If Roethlisberger was less elusive, the Eagles very easily could have tallied 15 sacks or more.    With that in mind, no Eagles fan has the right to complain about the missed Brian Westbrook face mask penalties in the Cowboys game (though they had a right to do so before this contest). The officials missed tons of penalties on Philadelphia, including some late hits, face masks and throat grabs. There was also a blown call on a Roethlisberger safety.    Though the Steelers managed only 3 sacks of their own, both quarterbacks had to leave the game with injuries. Roethlisberger's shoulder exploded on 1 of his 50,000 sacks, while McNabb hurt his chest on a first-quarter tackle. Neither signal caller threw for more than 200 yards, though McNabb completed his first 15 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Westbrook also had to leave the Broken Bone Bowl. He'll have an MRI on his ankle on Monday. Awful news for Philadelphia's offense. Westbrook couldn't really do anything versus Pittsburgh's stout front while he was in the game; he carried the ball 5 times for 12 yards.    Like Westbrook, Willie Parker didn't have much luck on the ground. Parker tallied only 20 yards on 13 rushes.    Neither quarterback had much of a pocket to work with, so as you can imagine, no receiver really did much. Heath Miller led the Steelers with 63 receiving yards. Hines Ward (4 catches, 34 yards) and Santonio Holmes (3 catches, 32 yards) disappointed fantasy owners. Meanwhile, Hank Baskett paced the Eagles with 8 grabs and 85 yards. DeSean Jackson registered 40 yards on 5 receptions.    "

By the way, Mornhinweg and Reid called a combined 10 runs in this contest. The balance the Eagles had in the middle of the year was nowhere to be found.    When Dallas had possession, "

And for the Packers, Ryan Grant left the game with an ankle injury. Both Kolb and Grant are in danger of missing their Week 2 games.    Thanks in part to immense pressure in his face, Kolb was awful in the season opener, going just 5-of-10 for 24 yards before getting knocked out of the game. QB Dog Killer entered afterward, and caught an unprepared Packers defense off-guard by rushing for 103 yards on 11 carries. The Packers didn't prepare to defend QB Dog Killer going into the contest, so don't buy the deranged psychopath's performance.    With Kolb out or struggling, none of Philadelphia's receivers did much. DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin each had 4 catches for 30 and 38 yards, respectively, with Maclin scoring once."

Down 18, Reid had a 4th-and-goal at the 4-yard line. Reid opted to kick a field goal to bring the deficit to within 15, which I don't have a big problem with. However, on the next drive, the Eagles had a 4th-and-goal at the 18. Reid called for another field goal despite the fact that there was 4:52 remaining in regulation. Now, converting a 4th-and-goal from the 18 is pretty improbable, but what the hell was the point of that field goal? Whether the deficit is 15 or 12, the Eagles still needed 2 touchdowns. There simply wasn't enough time for a meaningless kick like that.    At any rate, QB Dog Killer's touchdowns went to Celek (3-50) and Jeremy Maclin (4-47).

If Aaron Rodgers plays next week, it would not surprise me if the Giants lost the final 2 games on their schedule. It's a shame too because New York had the perfect game plan against the Eagles. The Giants swarmed the backfield and kept QB Dog Killer contained in the pocket for the first 3 quarters. QB Dog Killer threw an ugly interception and continuously took vicious hits all afternoon, bogging down the Eagles' scoring attack. But QB Dog Killer took matters into his own hands in an MVP-type final quarter. He finished 21-of-35 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interceptions, along with 130 rushing yards and another score on 10 attempts.    Two of QB Dog Killer's touchdowns went to Jeremy Maclin (7-59). The other was to Brent Celek (2-72), who finally contributed on offense. DeSean Jackson had just 3 grabs for 52 yards, but had the breath-taking, decisive punt return. Jackson also lost a key fumble that wasn't really a fumble, but Andy Reid inexplicably refused to challenge the easy call.    Though the Eagles have pretty much clinched the NFC East, they suffered a big loss in this contest. Rookie free safety "

   "comment":"Jackson took advantage. He rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. He was also effective in the passing game, catching 6 balls for 85 receiving yards. The Eagles also gave this game away with sloppy play on offense. QB Dog Killer went 26-of-40 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns with 90 rushing yards. However, he also had 4 interceptions. Two of the picks weren't his fault. The first 1 was the result of a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage. The final interception occurred because the ball popped out of Jason Avant's hands. Avant had been enjoying a great game (9-139) prior to that mental error. This marked the third time in 4 weeks that an Eagle wideout screwed up on the final possession. Jeremy Maclin was the culprit against the Falcons and 49ers, dropping a catchable first down and fumbling, respectively. QB Dog Killer's other picks were his responsibility. He was hit as he threw on his second interception, but he held on to the ball way too long in the pocket. The other was a poor pick-six. Speaking of waiting too long in the pocket, the Eagles cost themselves 3 points at the end of the first half. The clock was running out, but QB Dog Killer held on to the ball too long. He fired an incompletion as time expired, so they weren't able to attempt a field goal. Sadly, Philadelphia fans have gotten used to this in the Andy Reid era.    Quality fantasy performances: DeSean Jackson (5-86, TD), LeSean McCoy (11-80, TD) and Jeremy Maclin (6-54, TD) all made their owners happy."

Jackson hasn't been any good this year - in fact, he's barely done anything since suffering a concussion against the Texans last season - but the absence of the illusion of what he can do is what really bogged down Philadelphia's offense in this contest. Defenses are scared that Jackson can burn them deep, so they have to play their safeties back when he's in the lineup. That wasn't the case today, so the Cardinals were able to sit on the Eagle receivers and really limit the offense. It didn't help that "

   "comment":"Jackson (6-99). Jeremy Maclin played, but barely did anything, catching just 1 pass for 7 yards.    LeSean McCoy was the star for Philadelphia, rushing for 123 yards on just 23 carries. His cutting ability was simply a pleasure to watch. It's almost physically impossible to run like he does.    The Giants, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all; Ahmad Bradshaw had nearly triple the amount of carries compared to Andre Brown, 13-5, respectively, but they gained just 53 combined yards, with Brashaw getting 39 and Brown tallying 14. Eli Manning consequently had to do pretty much everything, and he basically did. He went 24-of-42 for 309 yards, 2 touchdowns and an uncharacteristic interception in the end zone in which he was fooled by the defense. Manning was able to complete multiple long gains against Philadelphia's tough cornerback group, a unit that missed Nnamdi Asomugha for nearly half the game because he was poked in the eye. It was initially reported that he would have to go to the hospital, but he felt better and returned to the field in the 4.h quarter.    Manning's touchdowns went to Victor Cruz (9-109) and Bear Pascoe (1-6). Ramses Barden (2-36) was very disappointing. Not only was he outclassed by Domenik Hixon (6-114); he committed an egregious offensive pass interference on the final series of the game, putting the Giants out of field-goal range. Naturally, Lawrence Tynes was short on his 54-yard try.    A couple of interesting things in this game: - Brian Dawkins was due to have his number retired at halftime. He was also the final player introduced prior to kickoff, which really pumped up the team and the crowd. - The Giants were able to have good field position all evening because of David Wilson's kickoff returns. Wilson averaged 36 yards per attempt, as there were gaping holes nearly every time the ball was kicked to him. The crowd eventually booed after each Giants' kickoff. - Speaking of an angry crowd, I thought it was hilarious that the fans jeered AndWy Reid when he challenged a DeSean Jackson reception. It's amazing how little confidence Philadelphians have in their head coach. - Giants' safety "

   "comment":"Jackson and Jeremy Maclin were inexplicably on the sidelines. Oh, and speaking of McCoy, he lost a fumble deep in his own territory at the end of the second quarter, giving the Redskins a chip-shot field goal. A good coach might be able to fix this at halftime, but not Reid. The Eagles came out of the tunnel to have their opening drive ruined by a delay of game and a Foles fumble. The Redskins were struggling offensively up until this point, but Robert Griffin and his receivers finally started clicking. Washington would soon extend its lead and never look back.    Foles finished 21-of-46 for 204 yards and the 2 picks. He wasn't terrible, but didn't show any signs that he can be a starter in this league. That stat line is especially disappointing considering how porous Washington had been against the pass all year, though it's worth noting that Brandon Meriweather, who was on the field for the first time all year, was a force in a pedestrian secondary. Unfortunately, Meriweather suffered a knee injury in the second half. He limped off, which is a shame because he just can't stay healthy.    Speaking of injuries, LeSean McCoy was knocked out with a concussion. He was carted off, and it didn't look like he knew where he was at that moment. McCoy rushed for just 45 yards on 15 carries and that aforementioned fumble. The concussion, by the way, occurred when the Eagles were down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Afterward, Reid was asked why McCoy was still on the field at that point. His answer? We were trying to catch up to win the game. They were trying to catch up to win the game... down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Oh OK, that makes sense.    McCoy (6 catches, 67 yards) happened to be the Eagles' leading receiver, as Foles threw tons of screens. DeSean Jackson (2-5) and Jeremy Maclin (0-0) were major disappointments.    Griffin, meanwhile, was nearly perfect, going 14-of-15 for 200 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also scrambled 12 times for 84 rushing yards. One of his best players in terms of running came on a 3rd-and-14 in the third quarter when this was an 11-point game. Despite the long-distance situation, Griffin managed to pick up the first down with a 23-yard scramble. A few plays later, Griffin connected with "

A Bucs source told me that Chip Kelly was Tampa Bay's head coach for 6 hours or so before changing his mind. Instead of landing Kelly, the organization hired Greg Schiano. The Bucs are now 7-14 under Schiano and 24-45 under Dominik with an 0-5 start to 2013. With the NFC East wide open, the Eagles showed they are just as dangerous, if not more so, with Nick Foles at quarterback. The first drive of the game was a clinic as Philadelphia moved the ball at will. It started with a 44-yard screen pass to LeSean McCoy. Foles hit big completions to Cooper and Jackson before keeping it himself for a 5-yard score. On the next possession, McCoy had a good run going before he fumbled the ball while in air. "

   "comment":"Jackson disappointed (3-21), but he can't be blamed for that. Jackson expressed frustration with Foles' accuracy woes throughout the afternoon. He also appeared to injure his ankle in the third quarter when he grabbed it in pain, but he missed only a few plays.    In addition to poor quarterbacking, the Eagles were guilty of some horrible coaching decisions. Chip Kelly has proven himself to be incapable of making big choices in key moments thus far in his NFL career. At the end of the first half, the Eagles had the ball just over midfield with 14 seconds and 1 timeout remaining. Faced with a 4.h-and-1, Kelly opted for a 60-yard field goal despite there being some wind. The 2 better options would've been to go for it and pick up extra yardage, or to simply punt it away. The long kick, which was predictably missed, set up Dallas in great field position.    The Cowboys didn't have a great offensive showing themselves, mustering only 3 points in the first half. It was odd, but Philadelphia's defense actually played well for the first time all year. Then again, the Cowboys' inability to score wasn't all because of the Eagles; Dallas kicked itself in the foot repeatedly with dumb penalties, as the team was whistled for 9 infractions in the opening 30 minutes alone.

   "comment":"Jackson. The Raiders also missed a number of assignments, as Philadelphia's receivers were open all afternoon. So, what happened? Foles was so dreadful against the Cowboys. He couldn't even complete simple, 5-yard passes. The big difference - aside from all of the blown coverages - was the pass rush. Foles was constantly harassed versus Dallas, but he barely felt any heat in this contest. This was a strange development, as Philadelphia's offensive line has struggled this year, while the Raiders maintained a quality pass rush, led by Lamarr Houston. The fact that Oakland couldn't rattle Foles at all or cover whatsoever tells me that the team simply mailed this 1 in, as it was overconfident following last week's victory over the Steelers. This is a shame for Raider fans, who have been excited for their team for the first time in a decade.    The Eagles hit a number of big plays in this contest.

   "comment":"Jackson and Riley Cooper were able to gain separation with ease, while Brent Celek had a long reception because Washington couldn't bring him down. Much of the same was expected from Philadelphia's stop unit, but the Eagles were inexplicably dominant on the defensive side of the ball. They put a massive amount of pressure on Robert Griffin, who often didn't have any time to throw whatsoever. This was particularly prevalent on a trip to the red zone when Griffin was hit as he was about to release the ball. He lost a fumble as a result, negating Washington's best scoring chance of the day until a late touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Griffin struggled to get anything going for most of the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - a high number considering that he scrambled out of some tackles - and as a result, he was just 7-of-15 for 57 yards and an interception on a tipped screen that was overturned before Philadelphia's defense eased up a bit. Griffin finished 17-of-35 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick along with 44 rushing yards on 10 scampers, but don't be fooled; the Eagles smothered him, prompting many poor throws, including 1 where he missed an open Logan Paulsen to set up the offense in the red zone. This was all thanks to outstanding performances by Fletcher Cox, Connor Barwin, DeMeco Ryans and others.    The Eagles were guilty of some pretty poor prevent defense in the 4.h quarter, allowing Griffin to make this result a lot closer than it really was. Griffin actually had a chance to tie the game, as he reached the end zone with less than a minute remaining in regulation, but he was once again under pressure, forcing an incredibly dumb throw in which he heaved the ball off his back foot. The pass was easily intercepted, ending the game.    Nick Foles, chosen way after Griffin in the 2012 NFL Draft, was the better quarterback on the field. He continuously torched Washington's helpless stop unit, going 17-of-26 for 298 yards along with 47 rushing yards and a touchdown on 9 scrambles. Foles would've had an even greater statistical day had the Redskins been able to keep up; he had 217 yards on 9-of-15 passing at intermission. Foles had been targeting Riley Cooper frequently over the past few weeks, but he spread the ball around evenly in this contest. No Eagle had more than 4 catches, as DeSean Jackson led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 82 yards. Cooper managed only 3 catches for 37 yards.    LeSean McCoy also had 4 receptions (73 receiving yards) to go along with 77 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. McCoy went down and grabbed his hamstring in the second quarter. It appeared to be serious, but he was able to take the field after intermission.    Some Washington numbers: - "

White was later whistled for a 40-yard pass interference on Jackson, allowing the Eagles to score 2 plays later.    Nick Foles played relatively well in his first postseason appearance. He went 23-of-33 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns. Proving Cris Collinsworth right, he took some bad sacks, including 1 where he seemingly had 10 seconds in the pocket and failed to throw the ball away. This was huge because a first-and-10 at the New Orleans 15-yard line ultimately transformed into a 48-yard field goal that was missed.

   "comment":"Jackson would've both left the game in the first quarter, my initial reaction would've been to confidently say the Jaguars would pull the upset. But then I would've thought about it and changed my mind because both Griffin and Jackson are wildly overrated. I called Griffin Commander Checkdown last week because all he did was toss short passes all while being reluctant to run. Jackson, meanwhile, is as fragile as they come. He's a 1.trick pony who doesn't deserve all of the attention he always receives from opposing defenses. Thus, it's no surprise that the Redskin replacements fared better than the starters. Kick Cousins dissected Jacksonville's inept secondary with ease. He wasn't even challenged. It seemed like there were wide-open targets for him on every single play. His first score was to fullback "

   "comment":"Jackson, who was making his first trip to Philadelphia as an opposing player. Jackson, of course, was a surprise cut in the offseason, so this was his chance to get revenge on his former team. Jackson, who was met with a wall of boos, as Joe Buck called it, put together a brilliant performance, but the Eagles ultimately had the last laugh because they escaped with a 3.point victory. With all of the Jackson-related emotions, it's no surprise that tempers flared on numerous occasions. It started early when "

   "comment":"Jackson followed that up with a drop, and the Giants proceeded to march down the field for another score. With Washington down early, the blunders multiplied. There was holding in the red zone. Logan Paulsen, playing for a concussed Niles Paul, then fumbled deep in New York territory to cost his team at least 3 points. After that, Cousins began firing countless interceptions. The first occurred because he predetermined where he was going to throw the ball and fired it to a covered receiver. The second was heaved carelessly downfield as he lofted the ball out of the back of the end zone. The third was heaved right at Trumaine McBride, and I just don't know what Cousins was possibly thinking on that play. The 4.h was a dying pass because Cousins had pressure in his face and couldn't step up in the pocket. Cousins finished 19-of-33 for 257 yards, 1 touchdown and the 4 picks. He was solid at times early on, but by the end of the evening, he looked defeated as he sat on the bench. It appears as though all of his confidence is gone, so it's a good thing that he'll have 10 days of rest to figure things out before the next game. The bad news? Washington has Seattle in Week 5.    As mentioned, Paul was knocked out of the game on a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit over the middle of the field. Paul (3-60) appeared to lose consciousness. He was helped off the field and never returned.    Neither of the primary Washington wideouts did anything. Garcon hauled in 2 balls for 28 yards, while Jackson reeled in just 1 pass for 9 yards. Jackson had a nice sideline catch taken away from him by a poor officiating ruling. "

However, Griffin took some bad sacks and couldn't get anything going on the team's final drive as a consequence.

He also picked up 24 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The important thing is that he finished this game unscathed, but there was a scary moment in the first half when he was sacked. He was bent backward awkwardly and limped around for a bit. He was fine, however.    Griffin's sole aerial score went to DeSean Jackson, who totaled 4 catches for 120 yards.

However, Griffin took some bad sacks and couldn't get anything going on the team's final drive as a consequence. He was also hesitant to run on a crucial 4.h-and-6, hurling a low throw instead, turning the ball over on downs. Griffin finished 18-of-28 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He also picked up 24 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The important thing is that he finished this game unscathed, but there was a scary moment in the first half when he was sacked. He was bent backward awkwardly and limped around for a bit. He was fine, however.    Griffin's sole aerial score went to DeSean Jackson, who totaled 4 catches for 120 yards. Jackson made a great reception in double coverage during the first half. "

Cousins spent the majority of the early part of the afternoon firing passes to Jordan Reed, whom the Browns had no answer for. Reed caught 9 passes for 73 yards and 2 touchdowns.

Jackson only caught 1 pass after than (4 receptions, 55 yards), but that was part Cousins being inconsistent and part Jackson's ineptitude; Jackson dropped a touchdown at 1 point, though the Redskins ultimately found the end zone on the same drive. Speaking of Cousins, he struggled to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-34 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that happened to be a pick-six; Cousins launched the turnover off his back foot while under pressure. He panicked, and it was the sort of blunder Cousins has been guilty of far too often. Cousins was just 6-of-14 in the second half with a pass that was nearly intercepted in the end zone, as his inaccuracy allowed the Eagles to hang around. Fortunately for the Redskins, Philadelphia couldn't muster anything offensively, so it didn't matter at all.    Both of Cousins' touchdowns went to the players replacing Jordan Reed's production: "

Cousins focused on targeting Jordan Reed early and often. Reed racked up 9 catches for 99 yards and a touchdown, trailing only Jamison Crowder (9-107), who also found the end zone. Crowder and Reed share the middle of the field, so it's surprising to see both of them post huge numbers. Elsewhere, Vernon Davis (5-93) and Pierre Garcon (6-67) both had solid performances. Jackson (3-48) left the game with a concussion.    The Redskins were missing Matt Jones, allowing Kelley to start. Kelley had a solid showing, gaining 87 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. "

Evans was able to gain separation from Chicago's poor secondary easily, and justified his first-round fantasy billing. He will continue to be a WR1 week in and week out, and he can be trusted in almost any matchup. Elsewhere, DeSean Jackson had a solid performance, but it could have been better. Jackson caught 3 passes for 39 yards, but saw 7 targets in the game. Had Winston hit Jackson on some of the occasions when he was open, he could have had a superior line. Jackson is a boom-or-bust FLEX play, but can definitely be trusted against weaker secondaries.    Tampa Bay's run game started the contest poorly, but "

With Case Keenum at quarterback, nobody was really giving the Vikings a chance to beat the up-and-coming Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but Keenum looked like Fran Tarkenton as he shredded the Bucs' defense to lead Minnesota to a shocking victory. Tampa Bay's secondary had no answer for Keenum, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, as they led Minnesota to 21 first-half points. The Vikings then used their defense to close out the win by generating 3 interceptions.    To get the game started, Keenum lofted in a beautiful pass to Adam Thielen for 45 yards after he got separation on Vernon Hargreaves running a go route down the sideline. A 16-yard pass to Dalvin Cook set up Cook to plunge over the goal line for his first career touchdown. The Bucs answered with a field goal drive. The Vikings were set up for more points as Keenum hit Thielen (5-98) for 19 yards and a holding call on T.J. Ward in the end zone set up a first-and-goal. Keenum tossed an easy pass to Jarius Wright to give Minnesota a 14-3 lead. The Bucs started moving the ball with DeSean Jackson getting the best of Trae Waynes for a nice gain, but then Winston forced a pass downfield to Jackson, who didn't have separation on Waynes, and the third-year corner picked off the pass."

Winston was excellent in the 4.h quarter, nearly leading his team back from a 16-7 deficit, but time just ran out. Winston finished 26-of-46 for 334 yards and a touchdown. He didn't have a poor performance, but it was an underwhelming 1. Winston's ball placement was erratic, and this is something that needs to improve if he wants to take the next step.    Doug Martin provided the Buccaneers with a huge spark. Playing his first game of the season, Martin muscled his way for 74 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored a touchdown. He was a breath of life for a dead rushing attack. He should receive a larger workload going forward.    Mike Evans didn't have a great stat line, catching 5 balls for only 49 yards.
