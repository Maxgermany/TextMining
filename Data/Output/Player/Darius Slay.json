However, Stafford made a bad decision by throwing a ball up for grabs, as it was picked off in the end zone by Brock Vereen. Once again, a good Lions' drive ended with a Stafford interception. An inaccurate pass to Tate was picked off by Ryan Mundy. Clausen had a nice possession with some precision passes to move the ball. Darius Slay got away with a pass interference to prevent about a 50-yard touchdown to Alshon Jeffery (6-72), but the Lions had a punt bounce off their returner that was recovered by the Bears inside the 15-yard line."
