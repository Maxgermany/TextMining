However, Stafford made a bad decision by throwing a ball up for grabs, as it was picked off in the end zone by Brock Vereen. Once again, a good Lions' drive ended with a Stafford interception. An inaccurate pass to Tate was picked off by Ryan Mundy. Clausen had a nice possession with some precision passes to move the ball. Darius Slay got away with a pass interference to prevent about a 50-yard touchdown to Alshon Jeffery (6-72), but the Lions had a punt bounce off their returner that was recovered by the Bears inside the 15-yard line."

The Lions took over in Philadelphia territory and were able to kick what would turn out to be the game-winning field goal from 29 yards out. Wentz nearly had an interception on the opening drive when he tried to fit a ball into tight coverage. However, he bounced back to play well overall. He finished 25-of-33 for 238 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick despite having some issues with the noise at Ford Field. He had nothing to do with this defeat, as the Eagles racked up 111 yards in penalties (76 in the opening half). The defense also struggled to get off the field; "
