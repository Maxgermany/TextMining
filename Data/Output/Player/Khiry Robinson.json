For the Giants (4-4), Manning had a performance that, under normal circumstances, would have been more than enough for a victory. But these circumstances weren't at all normal. Manning completed 30-of-41 passes for 350 yards and 6 touchdowns as the Giants tried to play catch up most of the day.    If you're not starting Beckham on your fantasy team, perhaps you should consider other hobbies. Beckham had 8 catches for 130 yards and 3 touchdowns.    New York wide receiver "
