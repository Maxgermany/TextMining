Robinson is someone to watch out for in fantasy next year; as the FOX broadcasters let us know repeatedly, Bill Parcells called Sean Payton during the week and told him that Robinson reminds him of Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin.    Speaking of Payton, he had some poor coaching gaffes in the second half. He burned a pair of timeouts, which was absolutely crucial, as the Saints simply ran out of time on their final drive. He then had Graham try an 48-yard field goal into the wind instead of having Brees attempt to move the chains. Sure, it was a fourth-and-15, but Graham had zero chance in that spot. Even a punt would've been a better choice. Payton then wasted his final timeout when challenging what seemed like a sure reception on Seattle's final offensive possession. It was a big gain, but Payton simply couldn't throw the red flag there unless he was absolutely sure that "

   "comment":"Robinson rushed for 89 yards and the decisive touchdown on 21 carries.    Graham, as mentioned, was knocked out of the game with a shoulder injury. He caught just 2 balls for 36 yards and frustrated his fantasy owners with a pair of drops, including 1 in the red zone that would've set up a first-and-goal early on.    With Graham out, all Brees could do was throw short passes to Pierre Thomas and Brandin Cooks. Thomas caught 8 balls for 77 yards and 2 total touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing), while Cooks logged 9 grabs for 56 yards. Marques Colston (3-63) had a big drop late in the game that was nearly a fumble. It was reminiscent of the play in which he coughed up a ball in overtime of the season opener in Atlanta.    As for the Buccaneers, Mike Glennon once again looked much more competent than Josh McCown ever did, going 19-of-32 for 249 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick wasn't even really his fault, as it was a great play by Patrick Robinson. There was a sequence in which Glennon was a perfect 8-of-8 for 92 yards over a span of 2 drives. However, he took a bad safety that ultimately allowed the Saints to tie the game. Glennon's scores went to "
