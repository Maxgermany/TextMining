   "comment":"Thomas. The Dolphins were mixing both of them into the game, but Bush gave Miami a reason to keep him on the sidelines when he fumbled the ball away in the first quarter. Browns safety T.J. Ward among others hit Bush and he put the ball on the ground. Bush had another fumble in the second quarter, but he recovered on that loose ball. On Cleveland's first possession, Colt McCoy rolled out and threw a bad pass that was intercepted by Dolphins cornerback Jimmy Wilson. There weren't any open receivers and McCoy threw behind wide Mohammed Massaquoi. Wilson made an easy pick to set the Dolphins up at the Browns 43-yard line. On the next possession, McCoy had Josh Cribbs running wide open down the middle of the field. It was an easy pass that Cribbs would have turned into an 80-yard touchdown, but McCoy's pass was horribly overthrown, and the Browns had to punt. McCoy came back and got the Browns on the board in the second quarter. He rolled out of the pocket and tossed a jump ball into the end zone for Cribbs. The wide receiver made a leaping catch in front of cornerback Shaun Smith for the game-tying score. To start the second half, McCoy helped lead another tying drive with a lot of passes to Ben Watson.    McCoy struggled with his accuracy. There were a number of receivers that McCoy had open, but his passes were off the mark. On the final drive of the game for Cleveland, McCoy got his act together and moved the ball down the field with Cleveland down 6 by dinking and dunking. He completed 9-of-13 passes on the drive. McCoy capped the possession off with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Massaquoi who beat Wilson. The score put Cleveland up by 1 with a minute remaining. For the game, McCoy was 19-of-39 for 210 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Montario Hardesty was the lead back as Peyton Hllis was out of the game due to illness. Hardesty ran hard and averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He totaled 67 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 19 yards. Watson led Cleveland in receiving with 5 receptions for 64 yards. Cribbs had 3 catches for 49 yards with a score. Massaquoi had 2 receptions for 26 yards and a score, but was covered well for most of the game by Vontae Davis.    Miami turned McCoy's first quarter interception into a touchdown on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Thomas. The Dolphins executed a screen pass well and Thomas coasted into the end zone.    "

   "comment":"Thomas (8-30).    Despite this strong showing by Miami's offense, there is a big concern, which is pass protection. Tannehill took 5 sacks and was stripped twice. The Colts don't even have a good pass rush, so what's going to happen when the Dolphins battle a team that has a strong front 7 (the Browns don't count because they can't score, so the strength of their defense doesn't matter)?    The Colts also have pass-protection issues. In fact, owner Jim Irsay took to Twitter and demanded for better blocking from his offensive line. Luck was sacked 3 times, but that doesn't tell the story of how much pressure Luck saw throughout the afternoon. Making matters worse, Indianapolis lost starting guard Donald Thomas for the season with a torn quad.    Luck went 25-of-43 for 321 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The quarterback didn't have much fortune in the second half, as 2 touchdowns were wiped out because of a drop and an illegal shift. Luck's sole score went to "
