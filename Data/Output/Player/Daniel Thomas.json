   "comment":"Daniel Thomas actually led the Dolphins in carries, but his 17 attempts went for only 42 yards. Reggie Bush (14-47, 2 TDs) was much better. The holes were there for Thomas, but he seldom saw them. He's just a really poor runner at this stage of his career.    Speaking of running backs... well... you know where I'm going with this. Mike Shanahan is a Grade-A a**hole. Two weeks ago, it was Ryan Torain. Last week, it was Roy Helu. Despite Helu's great performance against the 49ers, Torain got the nod again today. Torain (10-20) paled in comparison to Helu (6-41), so you really have to wonder what the hell Shanahan is thinking. At this point, you can't trust either of these guys. I'm not sure if I'd even recommend rostering them.    And while we're on the subject of new starters, I loved how Shanahan waited until Sunday to announce that he was giving Rex Grossman the nod over John Blegh. The offense looked more smooth with Grossman about 90 percent of the time. It was the other 10 percent that killed Washington. Grossman tossed 2 horrendous interceptions inside the Miami 25, blowing 2 precious scoring opportunities. Grossman otherwise finished 21-of-32 for 215 yards. With Santana Moss out, rookie Leonard Hankerson really took advantage of his opportunity, catching 8 balls for 106 yards.    Another Redskin rookie who stood out was Ryan Kerrigan, who had 6 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. However, he made a really dumb late-hit personal-foul penalty on Daniel Thomas in the first half, setting up a chip-shot field goal for the Dolphins.   "

The Colts don't even have a good pass rush, so what's going to happen when the Dolphins battle a team that has a strong front 7 (the Browns don't count because they can't score, so the strength of their defense doesn't matter)?    The Colts also have pass-protection issues. In fact, owner Jim Irsay took to Twitter and demanded for better blocking from his offensive line. Luck was sacked 3 times, but that doesn't tell the story of how much pressure Luck saw throughout the afternoon. Making matters worse, Indianapolis lost starting guard "
