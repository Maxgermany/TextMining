He fell just 7 yards short of Flipper Anderson's all-time record of 336 yards in a single contest.    Johnson had about 2.thirds of Stafford's yards. Stafford was brilliant if you exclude the 2 picks, as he went 33-of-48 for 488 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) otherwise. He was especially brilliant after halftime. He let the ball hit the ground just 5 times, going 20-of-25 for 296 yards and the rushing score following the break.    Only 4 Lions caught more than 1 pass: Johnson, Durham (4-54), "
