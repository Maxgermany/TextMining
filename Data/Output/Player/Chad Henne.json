   "comment":"Chad Henne obviously had much less experience than Edwards going into this game, but he out-performed his counterpart, going 14-of-22 for 115 yards and a touchdown. Like Chad Pennington would have done, Henne did a great job managing the contest, converting 9-of-17 of his third downs. The difference was that Henne actually took some downfield shots. Henne didn't convert any of them, but he stretched the field and opened up room for his running game.    Speaking of Miami's ground attack, "

   "comment":"Chad Henne threw an ugly interception to Darren Sharper. Sharper returned it 42 yards and was signaled in for a touchdown by official John Parry. However, Sharper CLEARLY fumbled before he reached the end zone. It wasn't even close. It should have been overturned into a touchback. Instead, Parry, who obviously had money on the Saints, called it a touchdown. A Dolphins field goal (off a Brees fumble) and a Saints touchdown later, the score was 27-24. However, I was relieved to see Henne complete a 67-yard strike to Brian Hartline, setting up Ricky Williams for a 4-yard touchdown. With Miami up 34-24 and taking 6.5, I thought my bet was safe. Nope. In a span of 5 minutes, Brees led the Saints on 2 touchdown drives. Fortunately, John Carney missed an extra point, so a later field goal made it a 6-point game. With 3:23 remaining, my +6.5 5-unit play was still safe. Down 6. Henne drove the Dolphins to their 41. After a penalty and 2 incomplete passes (1 via a Ricky Williams drop), Henne tossed a desperation heave, allowing Tracy Porter to intercept it and returned the ball 54 yards for a pick-six. You've gotta be kidding me. Not only did the Dolphins blow a 24-3 lead, they also allowed a pick-six to lose the cover. But it gets worse... Miami somehow put together a drive to get down to the Saints 26. Henne lofted a beautiful pass to Ted Ginn Jr. in the end zone, but Ginn dropped it (more on this later). On the next play, Henne connected with Hartline for an 18-yard pass down to the Saints 8-yard line. With time ticking down, Henne spiked the ball with 1 second on the clock. The Dolphins seemed to have 1 more play, but Parry, who wanted to ensure that New Orleans would cover, suddenly stopped Miami when the team walked up to the line of scrimmage and announced that 1 of the Dolphins wideouts was not lined up properly on the previous spike, meaning the game was over. Congrats, Parry, you crook. I hope you won a ton of money.    With a game like this, a lot of people deserve a ton of blame. Here's my top 5. 5. Chad Henne - Thanks for the 2 pick-sixes. Henne is low on this list because he played well early, but he sure took his jolly good time in the final few minutes when Miami was trying to get a backdoor score. 4. Tony Sparano - If you're a coach on any level reading this, take note: DO NOT CALL A TIMEOUT WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING AT THE END OF A HALF ON THE 1-YARD LINE WHEN THE OTHER TEAM HAS ITS FIELD GOAL TEAM OUT THERE. As soon as Sparano called his timeout, I yelled, F*** you at the TV because I knew what was coming. 3. God - Players thank God for a win. I'm blaming God for this loss and blown cover. It was that bad. Actually, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't blame God. So... 3. "

   "comment":"Chad Henne missed a wide-open Anthony Fasano in the end zone on 3rd-and-goal at the 1-yard line. And unlike the past 2 weeks, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a field goal.    Joe Flacco was prolific in this game (20-27, 266, 2 TDs), but the guy who made things happen was Ray Rice, who registered 180 total yards (83 rushing, 97 receiving). Unfortunately for Rice owners, Willis McGahee vultured a touchdown on a 32-yard first-quarter reception. Derrick Mason (4-42) had Flacco's other score. Anquan Boldin (2-28) didn't do much statistically.    Chad Henne made some nice throws in this game, but was his usual erratic self; he went 22-of-34 for 231 yards and 3 interceptions, though 1 of the picks wasn't his fault because Brian Hartline fell down."

He went 16-of-32 for 174 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. The first pick was a poor underthrow. The second was a horrible overthrow. And the third gave the Browns their game-winning field goal - ironically a minute after Delhomme nearly tossed his own pick-six. Not even the Dolphins coaching staff had any faith in Henne; amid numerous Wildcat plays - "

   "comment":"Chad Henne stepped in and the drop-off was immediately noticeable. Henne, who went 9-of-20 for 71 yards, displayed zero pocket awareness and terrible accuracy. He didn't even look like he was sober. It seemed like he just walked out of a Michigan frat party and a Jacksonville coach ran up to him and said, Chad, we know you're over the legal limit, but Blaine is hurt and we really need you to play! Mularkey's horrible coaching first was apparent when he went for it on a 4th-and-1 at midfield in the second quarter with a 17-3 lead. The Raiders had nothing going on offense, yet Mularkey had Henne run a bootleg, which resulted in a loss of downs. Oakland scored an ensuing quick field goal - 3 points that would have been extremely useful for Jacksonville late in the game. In the second half, Mularkey continuously had Henne pass the ball despite never trailing. It's a borderline miracle that he was never picked off. The Raiders eventually tied it. They tried their best to lose this game themselves, wasting timeouts and turning the ball over (thrice). "
