   "comment":"Randall Cobb's muffed punt at midfield in the first quarter and A.Cobb's muffed punt at midfield in the first quarter and A.J. Hawk's phantom roughing-the-passer penalty that helped set up a Minnesota touchdown in the final period. However, since the Vikings actually outgained the Packers, it's hard to call shenanigans.    So, what happened? To put it simply, Christian Ponder. The rookie signal-caller out of Florida State definitely exceeded expectations. His completion percentage (13-of-32) and touchdown-interception ratio (2-2) doesn't indicate that, but Ponder was very effective in both navigating the pocket to avoid pressure and converting third downs (9-of-16). He finished with 219 yards, including a 72-yard bomb to Michael Jenkins to open the game. Troy Aikman had some complimentary things to say about Ponder. Here are 2 quotes: <i> Christian Ponder has already had a better rookie year than I had. I don't think these Viking receivers are accustom to the ball coming out that quick. </i>    Though Donovan McNabb proved otherwise, it's not that difficult to look good with Adrian Peterson in the backfield. Peterson rushed for 175 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries.    The Packers were able to ultimately prevail because of Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers was nearly perfect, going 24-of-30 for 335 yards and 3 touchdowns. One of his incompletions was a red-zone drop by Cobb, who will owe all of the other Packer receivers a $100 Best Buy gift card. Curiously though, Green Bay was just 2-of-8 on third downs, so maybe those missed conversions are the shenanigans I'm looking for.    Green Bay ran the ball well with "

Rodgers' other touchdown went to Cobb, who had a whopping 9 catches for 77 yards. He should be available, so pick him up if he is.    Rodgers' other touchdown went to Jermichael Finley (7-47). Finley, who had a couple of bad drops, scored 1 play after he suffered an apparent injury. Perrish Cox flipped Finley over after a pass-interference call and then stepped on his ankle. It's good to know that Cox is still a scumbag.    It's time to address the aforementioned special-teams gaffe that occurred during Cobb's 75-yard return touchdown. There was a flag on the play, and as soon as Cobb saw it, he sulked in the end zone. There was an obvious block in the back, and it appeared as though the score would be nullified. The officials did, in fact, call a block in the back - on the 49ers. Yep. The Niners, who were punting, were blocking for some reason. These refs are geniuses.

Another negated an attempted fake field goal try. - There were some drops, including 1 by Jordy Nelson on the opening drive. It negated a first down and ultimately forced a punt. - Mason Crosby nailed the spread-covering field goal, but missed 3 other kicks. The box score may say that he was 1-of-3, but he actually whiffed on a try just as Jim Schwartz called a timeout. One of Crosby's failed attempts was from 38 yards out. - The Packers had some time management issues prior to halftime. They let 30 seconds tick off in Detroit territory before settling for a long field goal, which was 1 of Crosby's misses. - Green Bay ran the ball too much. A statement like that may anger Tom Jackson, but James Starks was incredibly ineffective, rushing for just 74 yards on 25 carries. There was 1 sequence in which the Packers had a 1st-and-5. Starks was given 2 carries and picked up just 3 total yards. Following an incompletion on a 3rd-and-2, the team had to settle for a field goal, which was 1 of Crosby's misses. - Aaron Rodgers tossed an interception right before that, but Green Bay had possession only because of a Matthew Stafford fumble. Rodgers went 19-of-27 for 236 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. His best play occurred at the end of the first quarter when he showed tremendous elusiveness under pressure, evading the Detroit pass-rushers and finding Donald Driver for a first down. Rodgers was sacked 3 times, twice by Nick Fairley, who was completely dominant.    Rodgers' scores went to Cobb (9-74) and Jermichael Finley (3-66)."

Jones just missed out on a second touchdown in the final period. He seemingly scored, but replay showed that he had 1 foot inbounds. The funny thing about this was that Jones, attempting a Lambeau Leap, couldn't jump high enough to get into the stands. He also failed to do so when he legitimately found the end zone earlier.    As for Aaron Rodgers, he went 20-of-30 for 274 yards and the big score to Jones. He missed out on 2 touchdowns: the aforementioned Jones' 1.footer, and a Jordy Nelson drop on what would've been a 34-yard score. Nelson tried to make up for the miscue, finishing with 5 catches for 82 yards. Meanwhile, Cobb's receiving totals were poor (4-35), but he made an amazing, 1.handed catch on third down in the middle of the opening quarter.    The Packers welcomed back "

There was some good and some bad from Rodgers, who finished 25-of-39 for 318 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. This was to be expected though, and he should only be better next week when he takes on the 49ers.    There was also a major plot line regarding Chicago's quarterbacking situation. There was major debate whether Jay Cutler or Josh McCown should start. Cutler, 1-7 against the Packers heading into this contest, actually performed well despite the loss. He went 15-of-24 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that came at the very end on a Hail Mary. Cutler has choked versus Green Bay in the past, but this loss certainly wasn't his fault. His usually reliable weapons had a hand in this defeat. Alshon Jeffery (3-80) lost a fumble in the first half, while Brandon Marshall (6-74, TD) was guilty of a drop on the final drive.    Chicago's defense was ultimately to blame for this loss because it blew a coverage on Cobb's decisive touchdown. It also didn't pay attention on a weird play in which Rodgers fumbled and then "

Cobb paced the team in targets with 4. catching 3 of them for 34 yards. Adams' score was also his only catch, an 11-yarder. He had an opportunity to reel in another reception, but he slipped in the red zone.    Green Bay's defense was just as excellent as its offense. It made Ponder look terrible. His final numbers - 22-of-44, 222 yards, 2 interceptions - aren't indicative of how poorly he played. As mentioned, the Vikings didn't run a play past midfield until there were 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ponder was then able to rack up some garbage yardage to make his stats look respectable. Ponder had major issues with pass protection. The Packers swarmed his backfield and brought him down on 6 occasions. They also forced some holding penalties. "

At the end of the game, Rodgers had Cobb isn't 100 percent, and his offensive line is iffy, but Rodgers still missed some throws he ordinarily makes. At the end of the game, Rodgers had Richard Rodgers open in the end zone twice, but overthrew him on both occasions. As a consequence, Rivers had a chance to tie at the very end, but came up just a bit short. Rodgers finished 16-of-29 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those aren't bad numbers, by any means, but Rodgers simply didn't look right. His receiving corps and offensive line need to improve. The Packers have a bye week to get their act together.    Panic time for Eddie Lacy owners? Lacy was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 3 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Lacy had a 10.er ankle, which begs the question, why did he even play? Lacy looked slow and sluggish. He also fumbled, but was fortunate to have a teammate fall on the ball. James Starks, on the other hand, gained 112 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries, with most of his production coming on a 65-yard sprint to the end zone early on. Starks also caught a 5-yard touchdown on his only catch.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb is hurting. That was apparent, as he was able to catch just 2 balls for 38 yards. He also was guilty of a drop. "

The protection might only get worse, as center Corey Linsley got knocked out with an injury.    A positive sign for Green Bay is that the running game appears to be back on track. Eddie Lacy, who was fat and lethargic earlier in the season, suddenly had this inexplicable burst in this contest, rushing for an even 100 yards on just 22 carries. James Starks got the start, but quickly gave way to Lacy, who looked like the talented runner of old. Starks managed just 14 yards on 8 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb had numerous drops.

Rodgers suffered through some drops from his receivers, but as I wrote earlier, he still doesn't seem like himself. One pass that stands out was a horrible miss to Jones that a healthy Rodgers would've hit 10 out of 10 times.    To illustrate how inefficient some of the Packer receivers were, Jones caught 4 passes for 102 yards, but it took him 13 targets to get there. Meanwhile, Cobb logged 6 catches, but for only 37 yards.

Adams caught a ridiculous 13 passes for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is remarkable because he wasn't even expected to play, given that he was going through concussion protocol on a short work week. Cobb snatched 11 balls for 95 yards and a late score, though he dropped an early touchdown on the opening drive. Montgomery, meanwhile, played running back, yet was still able to catch 10 passes for 66 yards. He also rushed for 60 yards on 9 carries. The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy. As for Nelson, it's clear that he's not 100 percent. "

Rainey fielded a kickoff at the 3-yard line and inexplicably fell out of bounds. That put the Giants in a horrible field position and forced a quick punt, which the Packers turned into a score. It also obviously helped that Rodgers was on fire in the second half. His final numbers were 25-of-40 for 362 yards and 4 touchdowns. However, prior to the Hail Mary, he was only 10-of-21 for 113 yards and a score. That means that his numbers in the second half, plus the final play prior to the break looked like this: 15-of-19, 249 yards and 3 touchdowns. There was simply nothing the Giants could do about that. Sure, they were missing Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, who was knocked out on the first defensive series of the game, but Green Bay lost Jordy Nelson as well when an uncalled illegal hit aggravated his previously injured hip.    With Nelson out, Cobb and Davante Adams stepped up big time."

   "comment":"Randall Cobb were also knocked out. With so many injuries on both sides of the ball, the Packers couldn't be very competitive with the Falcons, who were an offensive machine in this contest despite losing a tackle themselves (Cobb were also knocked out. With so many injuries on both sides of the ball, the Packers couldn't be very competitive with the Falcons, who were an offensive machine in this contest despite losing a tackle themselves (Ryan Schraeder). Clay Matthews had success with Schraeder's backup, but that barely slowed down Atlanta. Matt Ryan's numbers don't look great - 19-of-28, 252 yards and a touchdown - but only because he barely threw following intermission. Out of 252 yards, 201 came prior to halftime. Ryan didn't do much in the second half, but he was effective on the 8 throws, as he completed 6 of them. They involved moving the chains and keeping the Packers off the field, chewing up enough clock for Atlanta to hold on to a giant lead for a change. Why the Packers never attempted an onside kick is beyond me. The Atlanta defense, meanwhile, did a tremendous job, although the stats don't show it. Rodgers finished 33-of-50 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 10-of-18 for 85 yards and a pick in the first half. The Falcons changed their defensive philosophy when they were way ahead, playing way off Green Bay's receivers. This allowed the Packers to accumulate tons of garbage yardage, but it also took a ton of time as well. Helping the Falcons' defense's cause was the play that occurred right before halftime. Rodgers, hit by Vic Beasley, fired a pass that was scooped up by Desmond Trufant, who ran the ball into the end zone. It looked like the pass was going forward, but the officials ruled it to be a lateral. Following the challenge, they inexplicably allowed the call to stand even though it was clearly the wrong 1. Suddenly, a 17-7 deficit turned into a 24-7 disadvantage at halftime, and the injured Packers couldn't climb out of that hole.    The Packers had a number of other things go against them as well. In addition to all the injuries, 2 big Cobb plays were negated by offensive pass interference. Mike McCarthy was so furious about the first that he was flagged for an unsportsmanlike penalty. As mentioned, Cobb (6-60) was knocked out with a shoulder injury, joining Nelson on the sidelines. Meanwhile, "
