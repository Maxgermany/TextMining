   "comment":"Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson and Jermichael Finley. His only poor throw was a complete miss of James Jones (3-33, 2 TDs) for a potential third touchdown, as he beat Kareem Jackson downfield. Of course, Rodgers' outstanding performance is just 1 reason why the Packers were victorious. The other is Houston's unbelievable lack of discipline. The Texans gave Green Bay 14 free points because of a trio of dumb penalties. DeVier Posey was offside on a punt, which allowed Rodgers to find Nelson for a 41-yard score on the very next play. In the third quarter, a Mason Crosby field goal was wiped off the board because of a Connor Barwin leaping penalty. Houston stopped them again, but Danieal Manning hit a Packer in the head for an unsportsmanlike penalty. Rodgers then found Nelson for another score.    Nelson had 3 of Rodgers' 6 touchdowns. He finished with 9 catches for 121 yards. Jones found the end zone twice, while Tom Crabtree had the 6.h score. Randall Cobb (7-102) had a nice performance without crossing the goal line, while Finley (2-12) sucked yet again.    "

Going back to Manning, he displayed no remnants of a tired arm that plagued him prior to the bye. Save for an ugly overthrow in the end zone on the opening drive, Manning was pretty much flawless, going 16-of-30 for 249 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Manning's scores went to "

   "comment":"Randall Cobb for a touchdown, but overthrew him. Mason Crosby then whiffed on a 43-yard field goal that wasn't even close. - Ryan Grant (8-32) lost a fumble near midfield. - Crosby missed another field goal. He hit the left upright on a 42-yard try. - The Packers, for whatever reason, attempted a backward pass on a punt return, up 21-10 with 8 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. The throw was dropped, which gave Chicago a fumble recovery. Unfortunately for the Bears, they could do very little with it, mustering just a field goal.    Rodgers was great enough to overcome those errors. Though he blew a potential touchdown, he threw 3 more on 23-of-36 passing for 291 yards. He took 3 sacks despite the Bears missing top interior pass-rusher Henry Melton, so the offensive line continues to be a big concern.    All 3 of Rodgers' scores went to James Jones (5-60). Randall Cobb (6-115) and trash-talker Jermichael Finley (5-61) both had good games."

Cobb, however, redeemed himself with a touchdown later on with an amazing, diving, 1.handed snag. He finished with 4 catches for 72 yards.    Lacy ran pretty well, totaling 50 yards on 14 carries to go along with 3 catches for 68 receiving yards, most of which came on that aforementioned screen. Lacy would've had a much better statistical outing if the Bears would've been competitive and allowed him to carry the load for the entire 60 minutes. Of course, that could be said for all of the Packers; perhaps Rodgers would've thrown double-digit touchdowns.    It goes without saying that the Bears were a complete disgrace. They surrendered the most points in a half in franchise history (42), and they permitted the Packers to score more points (55) than they ever had at Lambeau in franchise history. Heads can roll after an embarrassing defeat like this, so if things don't turn around, Marc Trestman and/or "

   "comment":"Randall Cobb (3-38). Both had some negative moments, however. Cobb dropped a pass, while Adams sustained a knee injury in the second half. It's a shame, as Adams was having a rare, great performance, which included an amazing catch. James Jones (7-81) paced the team with 11 targets.    Unlike Rodgers, Cousins regressed as the evening went on. Cousins went 12-of-18 for 127 yards and a touchdown in the first half, but couldn't do anything following the opening drive of the third quarter. The Packers put a great amount of pressure on him, sacking him a whopping 6 times. Cousins ultimately finished 29-of-46 for 329 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and a lost fumble. He was very fortunate not to be intercepted, as Green Bay had chances to pick him off on multiple occasions. Cousins played well overall, but Green Bay overwhelmed him in the second half. The offensive line will have to be upgraded, which is what I have happening in the day-two rounds of my .    Cousins had the most success throwing to Jordan Reed, whom the Packers couldn't cover. Reed caught 9 of his 17 targets for 120 yards and a touchdown.    Aside from Reed, only 2 Redskins logged more than 20 receptions: Chris Thompson (8-89) and Pierre Garcon (5-70). Jackson, who snatched 2 receptions for 17 yards, was predictably ineffective against a strong opponent.    Matt Jones didn't play, so Alfred Morris handled the entire workload. He gained 50 yards on 11 carries, but most of it came on a 19-yard burst. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

He looked fully healthy for the first time in a couple seasons, and Rodgers threw to him a whopping 13 times. Cobb ended up catching 9 balls for 85 yards, and he appears to be Rodgers' second receiver, which will make him a WR2 in fantasy. Meanwhile, Nelson (7-79, 1 TD) looked like his typical self and should be a weapon for the team. "
