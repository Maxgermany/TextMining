   "comment":"Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle "
