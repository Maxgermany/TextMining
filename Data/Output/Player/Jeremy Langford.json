This occurred on a third down, and a reception would've moved the sticks. Instead, the Vikings were able to obtain possession and ultimately win the game on the ensuing drive.    Cutler had a solid outing, going 22-of-33 for 211 yards and a touchdown. He didn't win the game, but took just 1 sack and continued to play mistake-free football, which is huge for him.    "
