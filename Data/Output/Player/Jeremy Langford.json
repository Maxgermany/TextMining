This occurred on a third down, and a reception would've moved the sticks. Instead, the Vikings were able to obtain possession and ultimately win the game on the ensuing drive.    Cutler had a solid outing, going 22-of-33 for 211 yards and a touchdown. He didn't win the game, but took just 1 sack and continued to play mistake-free football, which is huge for him.    "

   "comment":"Jeremy Langford plunged into the end zone from a yard out and gave the Bears a quick 7-0 lead. Chicago's defense quickly got off the field and Eddie Royal had a 31-yard punt return to the Texans' 40-yard line, but the Texans stopped the Bears on 4.h-and-1 to get the ball back. Houston was able to get a field goal drive thanks to Miller's running. The Texans took the lead with a 23-yard touchdown to Hopkins as, once again, he made a phenomenal contested catch. At the end of the second quarter, Will Fuller dropped what would have been an 83-yard touchdown, and the Bears responded by hitting Jeffery for a 54-yard gain. With only a play before having to settle a field goal, Cutler threw a perfect strike to Royal for a 19-yard touchdown after he worked over Kareem Jackson. That gave the Bears a 14-10 halftime lead. At the start of the third quarter, Kevin White ran the wrong route, and that let Andre Hal pick off a pass to set up the Texans in Chicago territory. Houston had to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, Fuller caught a 27-yard pass to get into Bears territory. He finished the drive by making a shoestring catch on a wide receiver screen before using his speed to dart down the field for an 18-yard touchdown. Shortly later on a third down, Fuller made a superb leaping grab of about 30 yards and set up a short field goal for Nick Novak. Houston's defense then slammed the door for the win.    Brock Osweiler completed 22-of-35 for 231 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He threw the ball better than the numbers illustrate, and he easily could have had a couple more touchdown passes.    Lamar Miller ran for 106 yards on 28 carries with 4 receptions for 11 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins had 5 catches for 54 yards with a score. Will Fuller (5-107-1) had a great debut aside from his drop. Chicago's corners couldn't run with Fuller, especially in the second half. Osweiler targeted Fuller heavily, at times more than Hopkins, and if you need a wideout for your fantasy team, Fuller could be an adept pickup.    Jay Cutler was 16-of-29 for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He played better than the numbers illustrate as well. The Bears' offensive tackles got whipped in the second half.    Jeremy Langford ran for 57 yards on 17 carries, but bailed out his fantasy owners with a score.    Alshon Jeffery had 4 catches for 105 yards. Eddie Royal (4-57-1) chipped well in the first half, and Kevin White (3-34) flashed at times.    Chicago's front 7 played well overall, but the secondary struggled. "
