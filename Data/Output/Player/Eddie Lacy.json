The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. "

The noodle-armed Flynn opted to check the ball down to Lacy much more frequently than Tolzien, and the results were tremendous. Lacy caught 6 balls for 48 receiving yards to go along with his 110 rushing yards and touchdown. Those numbers don't tell the whole story though, as Lacy ran extremely violently. In fact, 1 of the FOX announcers exclaimed, He's throwing Vikings defenders all over the place!    Four Packers had more than 3 catches. I already mentioned Lacy.

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy also scored, which finally made his fantasy owners happy. However, he managed just 48 yards on 17 carries, as the Green Bay offensive line couldn't open up any holes for him.    Some Chicago stats: - Cutler's final numbers were 22-of-34 for 256 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. He made some great plays in the first half, especially when ad libbing after those botched snaps, but his mistakes cost his team late. - Bennett had a big game. He led the team with 9 receptions for 134 yards. As mentioned, he nearly missed out on a touchdown because he was tackled inches short of the goal line. - Both "

After struggling to find any running lanes during the first 4 weeks of the year, Lacy tallied 105 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 carries. Lacy ran with such power and explosion that Mike McCarthy even laughed and shook his head in disbelief when his running back carried a defender into the end zone on 1 second-half attempt. If Lacy continues to run this way, the Packers are going to be very difficult to beat.    Rodgers' touchdowns went to "

He was in the goal-line package, and Rodgers actually lobbed it up for him. Peppers, however, couldn't come down with the score. - Eddie Lacy had an awesome performance in front of his hometown crowd. His rushing numbers weren't great - 13 carries, 59 rushing yards, including 1 stuff on 4.h-and-1 - but he was a big part of the passing attack, reeling in 8 catches for 123 receiving yards.

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy gained 98 yards on 21 carries. He had some big gains on the opening drive that really got things rolling for Green Bay.    As for the Patriots, Brady didn't have his best outing. Unlike Rodgers, Brady didn't have very good protection and had to rush some of his throws. His offensive line cost him big time on a third down of the final offensive drive for his team. He took a sack, which ended the drive and made Gostkowski's cover-killing field goal that much harder. Brady finished 22-of-35 for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns. He made some clutch throws, including a 4.h-and-3 to "

He did not disappoint, finishing with 101 yards on just 19 carries.    The Cowboys also moved the chains well on the ground, as DeMarco Murray accumulated 123 yards and a touchdown on 25 attempts. However, he let his team down with a lost fumble, his first since Week 8. The turnover led to a Green Bay field goal.    Romo misfired on just 4 of his passes, going 15-of-19 for 191 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had trouble getting up after hitting Jason Witten on a completion, and whatever injury he sustained hindered his mobility for the rest of the afternoon. Romo was sacked twice on back-to-back plays on the ensuing drive.    Dallas' leader in receiving yardage was Witten (6-71), who was the only Cowboy player over 40. Bryant (3-38) disappointed those who used him in FanDuel, though, as mentioned, he was screwed out of a great, leaping reception that may have won Dallas the game. Meanwhile, Romo's touchdowns went to Terrance Williams (1-38) and Tyler Clutts. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

The Packers' defense continued to dominate as they were constantly harassing and sacking Kaepernick. He heaved a desperation bomb that was picked off by Sam Shields. Kaepernick threw his best pass of the game for a 47-yard completion to Torrey Smith, but on a 4.h-and-5, Kaepernick was sacked by Mike Neal to finish off San Francisco.    Aaron Rodgers completed 22-of-32 passes for 224 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 33 yards. He played well, but he had trouble sustaining some drives because his offensive line surrendered lots of pressures and 3 sacks.    Randall Cobb had 5 receptions for 44 yards, while Richard Rodgers (5-45) and James Jones (5-98) contributed. Eddie Lacy totaled 90 yards on 18 carries. He ran well for Green Bay.    Colin Kaepernick was 13-of-25 for 160 yards with an interception. He ran for 57 yards on 10 carries, but Kaepernick's regression is in full-blown crisis mode for San Francisco.    "

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy and Rodgers, but Green Bay went up 14-3. Rodgers expanded the Packers' lead with a field goal drive. The Packers' defense continued to dominate as they were constantly harassing and sacking Kaepernick. He heaved a desperation bomb that was picked off by Sam Shields. Kaepernick threw his best pass of the game for a 47-yard completion to Torrey Smith, but on a 4.h-and-5, Kaepernick was sacked by Mike Neal to finish off San Francisco.    Aaron Rodgers completed 22-of-32 passes for 224 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 33 yards. He played well, but he had trouble sustaining some drives because his offensive line surrendered lots of pressures and 3 sacks.

Dubbed Eddie Lazy by Awesome Kelly from Arizona prior to kickoff, the troubled runner had 1 of his best performances of the year, gashing the Cowboys for 124 yards and a touchdown on 24 attempts. Lacy still appears to be overweight, but he ran with more energy than we've seen in a long time. On 1 carry, Lacy dragged numerous defenders, drawing a comparison to Marshawn Lynch. "
