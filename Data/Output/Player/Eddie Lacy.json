The Packers converted 4 third downs, ultimately capping off their opening possession with a Rodgers touchdown to Jordy Nelson. Green Bay would end up scoring on its next 8 possessions, including a Micah Hyde punt return. Rodgers misfired on just 5 passes, finishing 24-of-29 for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which went to Nelson (7-123). He also had 6 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. It's amazing that he's so productive while throwing to guys named Jarret Boykin, Myles White and Andrew Quarless. Three other Packers had more than 2 receptions: Boykin (5-89), White (5-35) and Lacy (4-18). Speaking of Lacy, the powerful runner gained 94 yards on 29 carries. He's such a tough runner, as he broke numerous tackles and carried Minnesota defenders around. "

Jordy Nelson led all Green Bay wideouts with 8 catches for 117 yards. Jarrett Boykin also had a nice outing (6-91), thanks to a 52-yard grab. James Jones didn't do much (2-55).    Mike McCarthy made a couple of questionable decisions in this contest. He tried a fake punt in the third quarter just over midfield that failed by about a yard. That wasn't too terrible, but with that attempt in mind, I had to wonder why he didn't go for it on 4.h-and-inches on his own 29 with 8:30 remaining, down 2 touchdowns. Lacy probably could've easily converted, but the Packers chose to punt instead, allowing the Giants to take a big chunk of the clock on the ensuing possession.   "

   "comment":"Lacy missed a blitz pick-up, which ultimately led to a Tony Gonzalez touchdown. Flynn was then pick-sixed by Sean Weatherspoon, who missed some action with a shoulder injury. The interception was a weird 1. as it bounced off linebacker Paul Worrilow's foot. Ryan, meanwhile, misfired on just 4 passes in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 85 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons were up 21-10 and appeared as though they'd cruise to victory, effectively eliminating Green Bay from playoff contention. Mike McCarthy and his coaching staff made some awesome adjustments at halftime, however, which is something I never thought I'd write. Flynn was simply unbelievable in the second half, going 10-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown. Of course, much of this can be attributed to the ineptitude of the Atlanta defense, but the important thing is that Flynn bought his team another week for Aaron Rodgers to return. With the Lions losing, Green Bay is just half a game out of the division lead. Rodgers could return next week, which would give the team a great chance to claim the NFC North.    Flynn ultimately finished 24-of-32 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. His score went to tight end Andrew Quarless, who finally came alive with 6 catches for 66 yards. Jordy Nelson (4-85) led the team in receiving, while James Jones (4-19) didn't do much.    Lacy was responsible for that aforementioned strip-sack, but he made up for it with a touchdown in the first half. However, he didn't run as well as expected, given the matchup. He managed just 65 yards on 20 carries to go along with 3 catches for 25 receiving yards. The issue was the Falcons, like the Lions, stacked the line of scrimmage and dared Flynn to throw. Flynn made them pay.    There are some new defensive concerns for the Packers. A couple of inside linebackers sustained injuries in this contest. As if things couldn't get any worse for Green Bay's stop unit.    As for Ryan, he struggled in the second half, going 11-of-22 for just 121 yards and a pick following the break, though that interception was a desperation heave at the end of the game. His supporting cast let him down (6 drops), including Tony Gonzalez (3-25, TD) who had a huge 4.h-down drop on the penultimate drive of the game. Ryan's scores went to Gonzalez and "

   "comment":"Lacy took off on a 60-yard run. That led to Jordy Nelson (5-61) outfighting Orlando Scandrick on a jump ball for a touchdown. After another Bailey field goal, the Packers got 6 more with Flynn leading a drive. He connected with Andrew Quarless on a short slant for the score. Datone Jones and Clay Matthews sacked Romo on a third down just in front of the end zone. A punt return by Micah Hyde set up Green Bay at the Dallas 22-yard line. The drive finished with a middle screen to James Starks for a score. The Packers looked ready to take the lead when a pass deflected off Witten and was intercepted by Tramon Williams. He returned the pass inside the Dallas 10, but the review ruled Williams had trapped the ball. Romo took advantage of the opportunity and hit another big gainer down the seam to Witten. To end the drive, Bryant made a miraculous catch over 2 defenders for a touchdown. Flynn got a big completion to Jarrett Boykin (6-83) to move the ball inside the 10-yard line. A short toss to Jones (3-49) went for the score. The Cowboys had some questionable play-calling as they continued to throw rather than run the ball with Murray (18-134). Sam Shields soon made a superb interception to give Green Bay the ball at mid-field down by 5 with about 3 minutes remaining. A completion to Quarless (6-66), a pass-interference penalty and runs from Lacy moved the ball to the goal line. Lacy then dived over the top to grab the lead. The 2.point conversion was incomplete. To end the game, Romo had a pass off the mark and Williams made a diving interception to clinch the victory for Green Bay.    Romo completed 29-of-48 passes for 358 yards for 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Bryant was a beast with 11 catches for 153 yards and a score.    Flynn was 26-of-39 for 299 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He really struggled in the first half, but made some clutch throws in the final 2 quarters.

   "comment":"Lacy, who gained 84 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries, suffered an ankle injury in the third quarter and never returned, and the offense sputtered afterward as a consequence. This is why it's absolutely crucial for Rodgers to return. If the Packers don't have him or Lacy, they'll have major problems moving the chains next week despite how awful Chicago's defense looked Sunday night.    Lacy wasn't the only major Packer to suffer an injury. "

Rodgers threw 2 touchdowns to Jordy Nelson, who caught 6 balls for 152 yards in just slightly more than 2 quarters of action. Nelson nearly had a third score, but he was tackled at the 5-yard line. Randall Cobb proceeded to fumble into the end zone on that same drive, which was Green Bay's only mistake in meaningful action. Cobb, however, redeemed himself with a touchdown later on with an amazing, diving, 1.handed snag. He finished with 4 catches for 72 yards.    Lacy ran pretty well, totaling 50 yards on 14 carries to go along with 3 catches for 68 receiving yards, most of which came on that aforementioned screen. Lacy would've had a much better statistical outing if the Bears would've been competitive and allowed him to carry the load for the entire 60 minutes. Of course, that could be said for all of the Packers; perhaps Rodgers would've thrown double-digit touchdowns.    It goes without saying that the Bears were a complete disgrace. They surrendered the most points in a half in franchise history (42), and they permitted the Packers to score more points (55) than they ever had at Lambeau in franchise history. Heads can roll after an embarrassing defeat like this, so if things don't turn around, Marc Trestman and/or "

   "comment":"Lacy and Randall Cobb were the 2 Packers who came to play. Lacy gained 97 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries, while Randall Cobb led the Packers with 7 catches for 96 receiving yards. Nelson was horribly inefficient, converting on just 5 of his 12 targets for 55 yards, though he broke up what was going to be a pick-six. If you have Nelson on your fantasy roster and lost by 15 or fewer points, you can thank the Packer wideout for ruining your potential trip to the championship.    Meanwhile, the Bills would've completely run away with this game if they had a competent quarterback. "

   "comment":"Lacy and Rodgers, but Green Bay went up 14-3. Rodgers expanded the Packers' lead with a field goal drive. The Packers' defense continued to dominate as they were constantly harassing and sacking Kaepernick. He heaved a desperation bomb that was picked off by Sam Shields. Kaepernick threw his best pass of the game for a 47-yard completion to Torrey Smith, but on a 4.h-and-5, Kaepernick was sacked by Mike Neal to finish off San Francisco.    Aaron Rodgers completed 22-of-32 passes for 224 yards with a touchdown. He also ran for 33 yards. He played well, but he had trouble sustaining some drives because his offensive line surrendered lots of pressures and 3 sacks.    Randall Cobb had 5 receptions for 44 yards, while Richard Rodgers (5-45) and James Jones (5-98) contributed. Eddie Lacy totaled 90 yards on 18 carries. He ran well for Green Bay.    Colin Kaepernick was 13-of-25 for 160 yards with an interception. He ran for 57 yards on 10 carries, but Kaepernick's regression is in full-blown crisis mode for San Francisco.    "

   "comment":"Lacy lost a fumble in his own territory in the second quarter. The Bears, who had gone 3.and-out on 4 of their first 5 drives, used the turnover to get momentum, scoring their first touchdown of the night. - An offensive pass interference call ruined a chance for the Packers to score a touchdown right before halftime. The officials called James Jones for a pick. - Adams dropped a pass to move the chains in the third quarter. Adams then dropped another ball on the same possession, and this was followed by a botched snap that ruined field goal position. - Rodgers threw an interception because Adams was bumped off the route. - Adams - you guessed it - dropped another pass in the 4.h quarter. - On the final drive, James Starts was guilty of letting the ball fall through his hands, and then Jones dropped the game-winning touchdown. The final drive stalled. As you can see, the Packers absolutely wrecked themselves with mental errors. They managed to outgain the Bears, 365-290, but no team could've overcame all of those horrible mistakes. So, what can the Packers do to improve this? I'm not sure there are any clear answers besides removing Adams from the lineup. He is absolute trash. He saw a team-high 11 targets, but caught only TWO passes for 14 yards. That's ridiculous! He might just be the least-efficient receiver in the NFL, taking that distinction from Mike Wallace. Meanwhile, the other receivers aren't helping Rodgers. Cobb (6-74) continues to underwhelm, while Jones, who couldn't reel in any of his 6 targets, looks like he's running in slow motion. I didn't think Green Bay would miss Jordy Nelson when he went down in the preseason, given that Rodgers has gotten the most out of pedestrian talents before, but I think most Packer fans would kill to have him back in the lineup right now.    Getting to the numbers, Rodgers went 22-of-43 for only 202 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. I counted at least half-a-dozen drops, 2 of which could've been scores, so Rodgers should've had a much bigger game. Then again, Rodgers nearly threw an interception, but the defender dropped the ball in the end zone in the second quarter. There was also a scary moment where Rodgers appeared to hurt his hand while recovering a botched snap. However, he didn't miss any time. Cris Collinsworth speculated that Rodgers simply banged his funny bone.    The Packers ran very well on the Bears. Lacy gained 105 yards on 17 carries, but was benched for a few drives because of his early fumble. Lacy, however, was given 7 carries following intermission. "

I would've gone in a different direction, but maybe I just have a bad taste of play-calling.    OK, enough with the food references. Let's discuss the Jaguars, who nearly won this game, and perhaps would've prevailed had they not burned all 3 of their timeouts in the first 22 minutes of the second half. They almost got there though, albeit with the help of some horrible officiating, as 1 seemingly corrupt ref threw a flag way late on a play that should've ended the game.
