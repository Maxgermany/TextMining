The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy was the 1 who sparked Green Bay's offense in the 4.h quarter. The noodle-armed Flynn opted to check the ball down to Lacy much more frequently than Tolzien, and the results were tremendous. Lacy caught 6 balls for 48 receiving yards to go along with his 110 rushing yards and touchdown. Those numbers don't tell the whole story though, as Lacy ran extremely violently. In fact, 1 of the FOX announcers exclaimed, He's throwing Vikings defenders all over the place!    Four Packers had more than 3 catches. I already mentioned Lacy. The others were James Jones (7-80), "

Some Chicago stats: - Cutler's final numbers were 22-of-34 for 256 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. He made some great plays in the first half, especially when ad libbing after those botched snaps, but his mistakes cost his team late. - Bennett had a big game. He led the team with 9 receptions for 134 yards. As mentioned, he nearly missed out on a touchdown because he was tackled inches short of the goal line. - Both "

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy had the best performance of his season. After struggling to find any running lanes during the first 4 weeks of the year, Lacy tallied 105 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 carries. Lacy ran with such power and explosion that Mike McCarthy even laughed and shook his head in disbelief when his running back carried a defender into the end zone on 1 second-half attempt. If Lacy continues to run this way, the Packers are going to be very difficult to beat.    Rodgers' touchdowns went to "

Adams snared 7 catches for 75 yards, though a couple of his receptions came when Matt Flynn entered the game at the very end. - The Packers used Julius Peppers on 1 offensive play during the second drive. He was in the goal-line package, and Rodgers actually lobbed it up for him. Peppers, however, couldn't come down with the score. - Eddie Lacy had an awesome performance in front of his hometown crowd. His rushing numbers weren't great - 13 carries, 59 rushing yards, including 1 stuff on 4.h-and-1 - but he was a big part of the passing attack, reeling in 8 catches for 123 receiving yards. Lacy was extremely difficult to tackle, as he broke free from countless defenders.   "

His offensive line cost him big time on a third down of the final offensive drive for his team. He took a sack, which ended the drive and made Gostkowski's cover-killing field goal that much harder.

However, he lost a fumble in the red zone and was stuffed on multiple tries at the goal line, as the Packers failed on 7 tries from the 1-yard line in the first quarter, as Lacy was ultimately stymied on a 4.h-and-goal try at the 1-yard line.

   "comment":"Eddie Lacy, who generated 45 yards on the first drive. The coaching staff inexplicably went away from him for the remainder of the initial half, but went back to him afterward. He did not disappoint, finishing with 101 yards on just 19 carries.    The Cowboys also moved the chains well on the ground, as DeMarco Murray accumulated 123 yards and a touchdown on 25 attempts. However, he let his team down with a lost fumble, his first since Week 8. The turnover led to a Green Bay field goal.    Romo misfired on just 4 of his passes, going 15-of-19 for 191 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had trouble getting up after hitting Jason Witten on a completion, and whatever injury he sustained hindered his mobility for the rest of the afternoon. Romo was sacked twice on back-to-back plays on the ensuing drive.    Dallas' leader in receiving yardage was Witten (6-71), who was the only Cowboy player over 40. Bryant (3-38) disappointed those who used him in FanDuel, though, as mentioned, he was screwed out of a great, leaping reception that may have won Dallas the game. Meanwhile, Romo's touchdowns went to Terrance Williams (1-38) and Tyler Clutts. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
