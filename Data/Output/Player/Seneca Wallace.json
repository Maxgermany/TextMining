   "comment":"Seneca Wallace began the contest by throwing a 90-yard pass off his back foot from his own end zone to Koren Robinson.    The Eagles did a great job limiting the Seahawks after that, but Donovan McNabb really struggled, completing just 3 of his first 13 passes for 57 yards and an end-zone interception. Part of McNabb's problem was that he kept throwing the ball to a double-covered Kevin Curtis, despite the fact that DeSean Jackson had single coverage on struggling corner Kelly Jennings. McNabb eventually figured things out, finishing 28-of-43, 349 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception.    While Curtis led all wideouts with 6 grabs for 83 yards, the star for the Eagles was second-year tight end Brent Celek, who had 6 receptions for 131 yards in relief of L.J. Smith. Jackson had 2 catches for 20 yards.    Brian Westbrook wasn't as prevalent in the box score, offering his services as a decoy. Westbrook had 61 yards on the ground and 35 yards as a receiver.    As for the Seahawks, they couldn't do anything right after that 90-yard bomb. Seneca Wallace had 79 passing yards if you exclude that play. "
