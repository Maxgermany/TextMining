Garcon's second score was more legitimate, but it didn't really matter at that point (save for any poor bettor who had the Patriots in a teaser.)    Orlovsky went 30-of-37 for 353 yards, the 2 touchdowns to Garcon and an interception. Don't buy into these numbers though; most of Orlovsky's yardage came in garbage time.
