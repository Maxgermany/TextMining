He took a sack on first down; completed a short pass on second down; and fumbled the ball away on the final play. The sack and fumble put the Ravens back on their own 11, forcing poor field position on the ensuing punt. The Colts scored a touchdown on the next drive.    In total, the Ravens had just 14 rushing yards at halftime, which was shocking because the Colts have been so porous against opposing ground attacks. But looking at the plays, Baltimore ran the ball just 10 times in the first 30 minutes. That's not nearly enough against a defense whose strength is defending the pass.    It was clear early that Indianapolis didn't respect the pass. Good call on their part; Joe Flacco was completely abysmal, throwing 3 picks and fumbling twice.    Meanwhile, McGahee and McClain finished with terrible numbers. McGahee had 18 yards on 8 carries, while McClain had minus-2 yards and a fumble on 2 attempts. "

He also had an incredible deep throw on third-and-13, connecting 48 yards downfield with Derrick Mason (5 rec., 78 yards, TD) for a touchdown. Amazingly, Flacco has not thrown a pick or taken a sack in the postseason thus far. Flacco threw the ball just 22 times. In the Live In-Games Thread, I continuously complained that Cam Cameron was being way too conservative and not throwing enough on first down. But in hindsight, I think he made all the right moves. After all, the Ravens didn't turn the ball over, unlike the Titans. And prior to Saturday evening, no rookie quarterback had ever won 2 playoff games in NFL history.    Some quick stats. For the Ravens: "

Anquan Boldin (2-9) once again did absolutely nothing statistically.    If the Ravens don't win the Super Bowl this season, it might be because of something stupid that offensive coordinator Cam Cameron does. Cameron, who has already taken tons of flack for not running the ball with a lead to keep the clock moving in several games, failed to feature Ray Rice early on. Rice finally got the ball in the second half, but this was when the Steelers were already up big on Cleveland. It's almost as if Cameron thought, We have no chance of getting the bye. Let me use my best player now!    Pass protection also has to be an issue for Baltimore. Flacco took 4 sacks.    "

   "comment":"Flacco fumbled at midfield. A couple of plays later, Jamaal Charles broke through for a 41-yard touchdown run. When this happened, I wrote, Are the Chiefs really going to get another B.S. win? Thankfully, the better team won in Arrowhead this time. I just didn't feel like watching a Round 2 blowout in Pittsburgh. The 4 units didn't hurt either.    Not to completely rag on the Chiefs - OK, fine, this is fun - Phil Simms said at the end of the broadcast, The Ravens exposed some of Kansas City's flaws, but they'll take care of them this offseason. I really don't think that's possible. The offensive line stinks, there's no No. 2 receiver and the defense has holes, but the Chiefs' greatest flaw is Matt Cassel. Cassel (9-of-18, 70 yards, 3 INTs) is not a legitimate starting quarterback in the NFL. He thrived this season because of all the horrific opponents he played, but as Simms said, Baltimore finally exposed Kansas City's flaw. Adding insult to injury, things won't be any better for Cassel next year with Charlie Weis headed to Florida.    You really have to wonder what happened to Charles (9-82, TD). He ran the ball just twice in the second half. One of those carries was the turning point of the game - down 10-7 early in the third quarter, Todd Haley opted to go for it on 4th-and-inches on Baltimore's 33. Charles was stuffed for a 4-yard loss, and didn't receive a single carry after that. Following that botched 4.h-down attempt, the Chiefs' offense had minus-23 yards of offense with 3 turnovers. There was nearly a 4.h, but Cassel was saved by the tuck rule.    One more thing on the Chiefs: Dwayne Bowe didn't catch a single pass. It's hard to tell whether Cassel was too inept to get him the ball, or Bowe was actually hurt despite the fact that Kansas City took him off the injury report late in the week.    As for the Ravens, they'll move on to play the Steelers next week. Flacco has never beaten Ben Roethlisberger, so this would be a good time to get over that hurdle. Flacco played great Sunday, as he improved to 4-2 in the postseason. Flacco went 25-of-34 for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns, breaking Baltimore single-game playoff records for yards and completions. He took some sacks early and had that aforementioned fumble - "

However, he was 0-of-10 with an interception in the second quarter, and he didn't complete a pass until the final period.    Only 2 Ravens caught at least 2 passes: Ed Dickson (4-45) and Ray Rice (2-64). Rice also had 66 yards and a touchdown on 25 attempts. Torrey Smith, meanwhile, had just 1 catch for a single yard. Smith had a potentially long touchdown in the first half, but Flacco missed him deep.    Not that this really affected the outcome, but this game featured some very shady officiating in Baltimore's favor. The refs missed a blatant roughing-the-punter penalty. "

   "comment":"Flacco threw the ball 19 times in the same span amid a close contest. Cam Cameron seemed to be up to his old tricks, so someone must have threatened him during intermission because Baltimore came out running. A 59-yard scamper later, and the Ravens were able to kick a field goal after stalling inside the Cincinnati 5-yard line. The 3 points made it a 2.possession game, which, at the time, seemed to put this game away for Baltimore because the Bengals had issues moving the chains.    Andy Dalton definitely didn't look like himself early on with A.J. Green out of the lineup. This was extremely apparent when Dalton attempted a 45-yard heave into the end zone during the second quarter. Green caught such a pass for a touchdown against the Steelers, but Andre Caldwell didn't have nearly as much success. Ed Reed picked off the pass. However, Dalton caught fire in the 4.h quarter and was able to finish 24-of-45, 373 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He made some really great throws and was a Calvin Johnson rule away from tying the game. The Bengals lost both contests against Baltimore and Pittsburgh, but their fan base really has to be thrilled with Dalton. He's just going to get better.    Dalton's 1 score went to Caldwell (3-63), but Jerome Simpson was the 1 who picked up the slack in the wake of Green's absence. Simpson hauled in 8 balls for a whopping 152 yards.    As for the Ravens, Flacco continued to be inconsistent. He led the Ravens to just 1 first down in the first quarter and had a botched handoff with his running back. The offense as a whole just looked really sloppy. But in the ensuing quarter, he started connecting on deep bombs to "

This was a good rebound performance for Flacco, who struggled at Seattle and was inconsistent last week against the Bengals. For whatever reason, Flacco plays down to his competition but steps up against elite opposition. I guess that can be a good thing.    As mentioned earlier, the Ravens notched 9 sacks. Suggs had 3 of them with a forced fumble. "

Flacco's reaching the level where you're scared to death when he's about to throw if you're betting against him. He had so many great throws in this contest, though there were 3 situations in which the Patriots missed out on an interception. Two potential picks were dropped, while the third never occurred because "

   "comment":"Flacco fumbled the ball late in the 4.h quarter, and the Chiefs recovered it and scored a touchdown. Except it never happened because the officials blew the play dead. Yeah, this isn't a Kansas City mistake, but it was amusing watching an ultra-nice Romeo Crennel refrain from lashing out at the refs in his post-game press conference.    Cassel suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. The crowd cheered when Cassel was on the ground, which drew the ire of right tackle Eric Winston. It's 100-percent sickening, Winston said angrily afterward. Cassel was replaced by Brady Quinn, who completed all 3 of his passes for 32 yards. Quinn looked confident and may be named the team's starter going forward. The coaching staff showed no confidence in Cassel anyway, opting to run a draw play on a 3rd-and-8 in Baltimore territory in the opening quarter.    The Chiefs ran the ball extremely well against the Ravens, who surrendered triple-digit rushing yards in a half for the first time since 1998. Jamaal Charles gained 140 yards on 30 carries. Shaun Draughn, playing for an injured Peyton Hillis, chipped in with 40 yards on 12 attempts.    The Ravens also did a great job of moving the ball on the ground. Ray Rice totaled 102 rushing yards on 17 carries. The question is, why didn't Rice receive more than 17 attempts? The Ravens, despite being outplayed, never trailed in this contest. Cam Cameron, once again, inexplicably forgot about him.    Joe Flacco went just 13-of-27 for 187 yards and an interception. There were 2 reasons why the Ravens couldn't do anything aerially. First, the team dropped a ton of passes. Second, Flacco was constantly pressured. He was sacked 4 times, twice each by "

Starting with the victor, Flacco opened up 10-of-12 for 110 yards, leading the Ravens to a pair of first-quarter touchdowns to establish a quick, 14-0 advantage. He was then was 4 of his next 11 for just 24 yards. He had several passes that easily could have been picked off.

   "comment":"Flacco couldn't find anyone downfield, so he just gave up, checking the ball down to Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Justin Tucker hit a field goal to send it to overtime. The Chargers punted twice because of a trio of drops. A pass interference was called on San Diego despite a ball being uncatchable. Torrey Smith made an amazing catch on a third down. And then Tucker made the decisive kick.    The Ravens clearly should have lost this game, as they never had a lead. However, I'll give credit to Rice (22 carries, 97 rush yards; 8 catches, 67 rec. yards) for that play, Joe Flacco (30-of-51, 355 yards, TD) for being a masterful 12-of-24 on third downs and Smith (7-144) for making that amazing 31-yard grab to set up Tucker for the game-winning kick.    One other thing on the Ravens: "

   "comment":"Flacco. Now I've seen everything. I picked the Steelers to cover, but I thought this would be a low-scoring, grind-it-out football game. When the Ravens took a 13-3 lead in the second quarter, I thought Pittsburgh was screwed. Batch, after all, couldn't even beat the Browns, though he was betrayed by all of his running backs. Instead, Batch lit it up in the second half. It's still hard to believe, but Batch went 14-of-20 for 219 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception after intermission. His numbers could have been even better, but Emmanuel Sanders appeared content to sabotage this game. Sanders caught a pass in the open field and had a long touchdown in his sights, but inexplicably lost a fumble even though he wasn't touched. Sanders then dropped a pass near the red zone, though he would ultimately redeem himself with a clutch reception in Baltimore territory.    Batch (final numbers: 25-of-36, 276 yards, TD, INT) focused on throwing the ball to Sanders (5-60), Heath Miller (5-97, TD), Antonio Brown (5-58) and Mike Wallace (5-44). Wallace had yet another drop on a deep ball, while Brown made a terrible decision and heaved an interception on a trick play. Phil Simms called Brown's attempt a great throw, but he was obviously on crack because it was awful.    After fumbling it twice last week, Rashard Mendenhall was a healthy scratch. Jonathan Dwyer (16-49, TD) handled most of the work, while Isaac Redman (9-43) worked as the change-of-pace back. The key is that unlike last week, none of the running backs fumbled.    Joe Flacco, meanwhile, went 16-of-34 for 188 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad interception he forced downfield. This pick was his first in 5 meetings against the Steelers. He was just 5-of-12 for 54 yards after intermission.    Pittsburgh once again did a great job of taking away "

   "comment":"Flacco barely had anyone in his pocket.    Beginning with the Giants, Manning went just 14-of-28 for 150 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked 3 times, but that number might as well have been 10. Manning had just 1 completion longer than 14 yards - an impressive heave to Rueben Randle as he was getting hit. It was 1 of those plays where Manning chucks and ducks and doesn't appear to be looking where he's launching the ball, but it's somehow completed. However, he just didn't have the time in the pocket to consistently find his receivers downfield.    Manning's top wideouts barely did anything. Victor Cruz (3-21) took a fierce helmet-to-helmet hit from Ed Reed late in the game, while Hakeem Nicks didn't log a single reception.    Ahmad Bradshaw (9-39) and David Wilson (3-17, TD) probably would have been able to gash the Ravens had New York been able to stick with the running game. The Giants had to abandon that because they were down by double digits for most of the contest.    As mentioned, Flacco didn't have to worry about any pressure. He consequently went 25-of-36 for 309 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), though it helped that... - New York dropped 2 interceptions ("

They had just 2 sacks - including 1 by Barkevious Mingo that helped push the Ravens out of field goal position - but that's misleading because they were dominant in the trenches. Flacco, however, willed his team to victory with a very strong second half. His overall numbers weren't very impressive - 22-of-33, 211 yards and a touchdown - but he misfired on just 2 attempts after intermission; he was 10-of-12 for 102 yards and the score in the third and 4.h quarters.

   "comment":"Flacco at the very end of the first half to set up a Mason Crosby field goal, had to leave the game. The Packers then had to roll with players named Nate Palmer and Andy Mulumba as its outside linebackers. The defense understandably wasn't the same after that, but the offense made the appropriate adjustments. Rodgers completed fewer than half of his passes prior to intermission and had a pick dropped by Daryl Smith, but was 7-of-11 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (a great play by Jimmy Smith) after the break. Rodgers ultimately finished 17-of-32 for 315 yards, 1 score and the pick. The stop unit, meanwhile, had some great performances from rookie Micah Hyde and A.J. Hawk (3 sacks).    The Packers may have lost a game like this last year, but they were able to pull out a victory, thanks to Eddie Lacy. The rookie runner was a stud, bulldozing Baltimore's strong ground defense for 120 yards on 23 carries. The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. Jermichael Finley (3-75) wasn't much of a factor, as a 52-yard reception of his came when Green Bay was running out the clock.    Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage. This included some red-zone ineptness in the second quarter. "

First of all, I don't know why in the world he kept snapping the ball with 12-15 seconds on the play clock in the final period. Second, Flacco lost a fumble at midfield. This allowed the Bengals to drive deep into Baltimore territory, but the defense bailed out its quarterback with a pick. - Time was running out for Cincinnati.

   "comment":"Flacco was 13-of-31 for 95 yards and an interception. He was hurt by some drops, particularly by Steve Smith, but he was off the mark for the most part. It didn't help him that the offensive line couldn't pass protect or run block, or do anything correctly, but Flacco looked like 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for most of this contest. Flacco ended up 35-of-62 for 345 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That stat line is misleading, though Flacco did get into a rhythm in the second half. However, he screwed up on numerous occasions and took unnecessary sacks. A sack actually ended the game, but the play that most sticks out occurred just prior to intermission. With limited time remaining on the clock, Flacco scrambled to avoid pressure. The coaches yelled at him to throw the ball away, but he ran around like an idiot instead. Time ultimately ran out, as Baltimore screwed up a chance to kick a field goal.    Flacco's sole score went to Steve Smith, who found the end zone on an 80-yard touchdown where he muscled defenders away. Smith finished with 7 grabs for 118 yards, though those numbers are bogus because most of them came on 1 play. Smith was highly inefficient for most of the afternoon.    "

   "comment":"Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore. He played lethargically in 2013 and simply looked done as a result. The Panthers made the right move by getting rid of him based on his performance this past season.    The Panthers, meanwhile, were bludgeoned quite literally. "

   "comment":"Flacco and Andy Dalton were trying their best to lose. Both signal-callers had miserable performances, with each being responsible for multiple turnovers. Dalton, however, was the least worse of the 2. and he managed to stop being inept enough to lead his team to a victory at the very end. Dalton's completion percentage and yardage don't look terrible - 21-of-28, 266 yards - but he had the fans moaning and groaning in the 4.h quarter. Most of Dalton's errors came late. He had an overthrow in the end zone, missing a potential touchdown. He then did a poor job of securing the football and lost a fumble. Dalton followed that up with an interception on the next drive, but that was really a Mohamed Sanu fumble; it would've been ruled that way if Sanu had possession of the ball for a second longer. Dalton managed to heave a low pass to Greg Little, which had the fans booing him. As mentioned though, Dalton put together a game-winning drive, highlighted by a 53-yard bomb to Sanu on third-and-10. He capped it off with a quarterback sneak on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, scoring for the second time on the ground.    With Green out, all Dalton had to work with was Sanu, who stepped up with 5 grabs for 125 yards, though he was responsible for the interception. On the bright side, he also made an amazing, 1.handed catch. Dalton will need A.J. Green to return soon, as he had to rely on Greg Mr. Dependable Little to be his second receiver. Mr. Dependable (3-42) did make a catch on third-and-long in the first half and also had a big gain wiped out by an Andre Smith hold.    Giovani Bernard didn't find much running room, but managed to score once. He gained 45 yards on 16 carries otherwise. Unfortunately, he left the game with a hip injury. Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker "

James Harrison, who was retired slightly more than a month ago, was a monster Sunday evening, registering 2 sacks. Unfortunately, the Steelers lost Ryan Shazier and Troy Polamalu to injuries. Flacco was able to compile some junk yardage to make his numbers look better - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but he struggled to complete half of his passes during meaningful action. In fact, he was just 9-of-17 going into halftime. Flacco simply had no time to throw; his pick came when he was under pressure. He heaved up a desperate pass that was picked off, and the Steelers capitalized with 1 of Roethlisberger's aerial scores.

   "comment":"Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. Antonio Gates (7-83) was worked on early before the Ravens took him away from Will Hill. Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65).

   "comment":"Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.    Of course, the Packers will be favored against all of those teams because of Aaron Rodgers, who was mostly spectacular in this contest. With no pressure in his face for nearly the entire game, he was able to go 24-of-36 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 5 scrambles for 28 rushing yards. There was some complacency in the second half, however. Rodgers wasn't nearly as sharp as he was prior to intermission, completing just 6-of-11 attempts. He missed an open Jordy Nelson for a touchdown (he connected with him, but Nelson had to dive for an inaccurate ball). His teammates seemed to be out of sync as well, as Eddie Lacy dropped a pass, while the special teams didn't have enough players on the field for a punt. As a result, the Packers nearly squandered their 31-7 lead. The Falcons scored 4 touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, ultimately covering the spread.    Lacy gashed the Falcons in the early going. He ripped through Atlanta's poor defense and had 56 yards and a touchdown by halftime. However, he finished with 73 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown, as Atlanta clamped down on the run in the second half - save for a big James Starks gain at the very end. Starks actually outgained Lacy as a result, finishing with 75 yards and a score on 10 attempts, though Lacy had the better fantasy day because he caught 5 balls for 33 receiving yards and a second touchdown.    Rodgers' other scores went to Jordy Nelson, who reeled in 8 of 10 targets for a whopping 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. No other Packer had more than 58 receiving yards, however, with Randall Cobb holding that distinction on 4 catches.    As for the Falcons, I already mentioned Jones' dominance. I have to emphasize how incredible he was. He caught 11 balls for a ridiculous 259 yards and a touchdown. The Packers looked completely clueless trying to stop him, and he would've had a bigger night, but 3 things happened: First, Jones nearly had a second score, but could only get 1 foot inbounds. Second, he was tackled at the 3-yard line on a 79-yard gain. And third, he was knocked out of the game with an injury. He wasn't present on the field for Atlanta's final offensive drive, though the Falcons found the end zone anyway for the dreaded backdoor cover.    Matt Ryan was terrific in the second half. He finished 24-of-39 for 375 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but he was 18-of-25 for 263 yards and a quartet of scores following intermission. His pick was a poor decision, as he threw the ball toward Devin Hester without looking while under pressure. However, he rebounded and nearly led an unbelievable comeback. Though the Falcons lost, their outlook in terms of winning the division is positive because Ryan is performing on a much higher level than Brees.    Excluding Jones, the players who reeled in Ryan's touchdowns were Roddy White (3-42), who barely did anything prior to Jones getting hurt, Harry Douglas (2-11) and Eric Weems.    Steven Jackson, meanwhile, looked functional for the second week in a row. He gained 50 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Most of his yardage came in the first half, but the Falcons had to abandon the run for the most part because they were so far behind. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

He had so much pressure in his face, thanks to both of his offensive tackles being out, that he just didn't have enough time in the pocket to find his receivers downfield. He was sacked only once, but the Browns brought plenty of heat and forced many errant passes. As a restult, he was 11-of-18 for just 97 yards heading into halftime. Just prior to the break, he was stripped of the football, which bounced backward and took the team out of field-goal range.

He was sharp for most of the game, with his only blemish being a dropped interception in the second half. As mentioned, Flacco was fantastic on third-and-long situations, and he even converted a key 4.h-and-1 near midfield with a sneak.    "

   "comment":"Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith. After the 2-minute warning, the Bengals were set up for a 4.h-and-1 that needed a half yard. Marvin Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by "

   "comment":"Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle Aaron Donald and had his forearm broken like some old dried-up peanut brittle from last Christmas, which was not pleasant for anyone involved, especially him. Rookie running back Javorius Allen took over after Forsett went down and had plenty of work, with 27 touches for 115 yards. He was stifled on the ground though, with 22 carries for 67 yards, which came out to a poor 3 yards per carry. Of course, this is a St. Louis defense that had allowed just 3.7 yards per carry on the season.    There weren't many bright spots for the Ravens, but tight end Crockett Gillmore did catch 5-of-8 targets for 101 yards and Kamar Aiken caught a 3-yard touchdown to go along with 5 receptions on 8 targets for 50 yards. These 2 and Allen are the core of this group, which going forward will be weakened by Matt Schaub, but Allen should at least see plenty of work, as he is competent in both the receiving and rushing game.    The first score in this matchup came from the rookie running back on the other side, Todd Gurley. Gurley scored from 1 yard out to give his team a 7-0 lead, and despite Keenum completing just 3-of-10 passes for 31 yards and the whole team at 73 total yards of total offense at halftime, the Rams led 7-3.    If it weren't for the Ravens also making mistakes, they would have probably had an easier time in this game. It always looked like the winner would be the team that capitalized on a turnover last, and that's exactly what happened when Keenum was hit by Courtney Upshaw, fumbling the ball away with 54 seconds to go in a tie game.    Flacco then came in and moved the ball into field goal range, but in the process, tore his ACL and possibly his MCL, ending his season. He had never missed a game in his 8 years in the league, so I guess that's why they invested in the likes of Schaub to back him up. Justin Tucker was then able to hit a game-winning 47-yard field goal, but it was a hollow victory, having already lost Forsett and Flacco.    Schaub will take over as quarterback, which hurts the Ravens' chances of winning, while also hurting the offensive players all around. The only possible upside of Schaub playing is that opposing defenses should be able to average a pick-six or 2 against him.    The Rams totaled 213 yards on the day for a measly 3.8 yards per play with Keenum at the helm, and they continued to waste a good defense and a great running back. It had looked like there was some chance the Rams could win games based solely on those 2 parts of their offense, but the incredibly poor quarterback play was just not able to sustain even a run-based offense with a stud running back. Becoming 1.dimensional on offense is not going to be sustainable.    The Ravens' defense had been their Achilles heel this season, but once Steve Smith Sr. went out for the year, it felt somewhat hopeless if you wanted to see Flacco and company to have any consistency moving the ball. Of course now, they are without Flacco and Forsett, which means they are truly done, just as the Rams look to be with no startable quarterback in the building.   "

   "comment":"Flacco hit Crockett Gilmore (4-28) for a touchdown. The Redskins got on the scoreboard as Jamison Crowder ripped off an 85-yard punt return for a score, but Washington missed the extra point. Baltimore soon added a field-goal drive, with the big playing being a 26-yard pass interference on linebacker Will Compton. The Ravens were set up for more points when Zach Orr caused and recovered a fumble from Matt Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the 4.h quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over "

   "comment":"Flacco had an open receiver at the 5-yard line, but overthrew him. Flacco then had to try a Hail Mary, and that fell incomplete as time expired.    As you can tell, this game was insane, with so many twists and turns. Either team could have won it; the Ravens failed to convert a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Plus, these teams weren't far apart in terms of net yardage (435-391, Giants), and Baltimore won the time-of-possession battle by more than 10 minutes.    Speaking of twists and turns, that could appropriately describe Eli Manning's performance. Manning began very poorly; as mentioned, he was throwing way behind countless receivers. However, his deep connections to Beckham bolstered his stat line, and he finished 32-of-46 for 403 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first score was the 300th of his career. By the way, neither of Manning's interceptions were his fault; I mentioned Shepard fell down during 1 of them. The other occurred when Manning tried to make something happen at the end of the first half, so the turnover didn't hurt at all.    Beckham had just 2 catches for 11 yards at halftime, and as mentioned, he was dealing with a hip pointer. However, he came alive following intermission, and he finished with 8 catches for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns, as Baltimore's beleaguered secondary blew coverage after coverage.    "

   "comment":"Flacco. Flacco didn't look right whatsoever. Some expected him to torch the Jets' miserable secondary, but he couldn't because he obviously wasn't 100 percent. He threw 2 interceptions; 1 pass was telegraphed, while the other was made because he heaved the ball off his back foot, prompting a high pass. Flacco actually seldom stepped into his passes in this contest. His mechanics were horrible, which might be a sign that he wasn't feeling well. Flacco finished 25-of-44 for 248 yards and those 2 picks. It wasn't all on him, as he didn't get much help from both his offensive line and receiving corps, missing stud guard Marshal Yanda and Steve Smith, respectively.    Only 3 Ravens accumulated more than 11 receiving yards: "

   "comment":"Flacco's career, and with a field goal as time ran down on the first half, the Ravens led 10-0. Wallace came into the league with the Steelers, so there must have been a little revenge factor for him this week. He ended up with 124 yards on 4 receptions to go along with his 4.h touchdown of the year. On the day, the Ravens totaled just 179 yards on 14 drives, if you take Wallace's huge gainer out of the equation. Baltimore also couldn't run the ball, with Terrance West rushing 15 times for 21 yards and Kenneth Dixon seeing 9 attempts for 13 yards. That is a good sign for the Steelers, who were being gashed by opposes runners lately.    The Ravens' defense and special teams won this game for their team. They shut down Le'Veon Bell to just 32 yards on 12 carries, and of course, the utter devastation of the Steelers' offense through 3 quarters.    Penalties also made this game tough to watch. Pittsburgh had more penalty yards than offensive yards through the first half! On the day, the 2 teams accumulated 21 penalties for 193 yards, which is slightly less than the Raiders last week, but still too much for most football games.    At any rate, another field goal and then a blocked punt for a touchdown put the Ravens in control 21-0 with just 13 minutes left in the game. That's when Pittsburgh's offense finally woke up. That awakening was, of course, helped by a defense with a 21-point lead, but there's no doubt that Roethlisberger was more accurate after getting 3 quarters of practice. He finally started connecting with Antonio Brown, finding him on a 23-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 21-7. Brown, after barely seeing the ball through most of the game, ended up with 7 receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown. The fact that Roethlisberger didn't hurt himself anymore and looked strong to finish the game is actually a decent outcome from this ugly game. Roethlisberger again moved his team down the field with time waning and ended up rushing for a touchdown to make the game 21-14 with 48 seconds left on the clock. Of course, an onside kick was in order, but instead we saw the worst possible whiff on a kick by Chris Boswell, who will have a time living that play down.    Steve Smith returned after missing 2 games with an ankle injury. He ended up with 4 receptions for 47 yards, but the good news is that he made it through the game healthy and should continue to be a top target for Flacco. Oh, and the Ravens get to play the Browns this Thursday night.    The Steelers have now lost 3 in a row, and the Ravens have taken over the lead in the NFC North based on their head-to-head record since both teams are now 4-4. Pittsburgh takes on a hot Dallas Cowboys team next.   "

   "comment":"Flacco finished 30-of-41 for 296 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. One of his picks was an overthrow toward Steve Smith, while the other was a horrible pass he telegraphed into the end zone while throwing late across his body, and Joe Haden read his eyes perfectly. Flacco, however, was nearly perfect otherwise following intermission, as his second-half numbers were 13-of-17 for 163 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. The offense went into a quick tempo, and Flacco's throws were mostly precise, though Cleveland's atrocious defense made things very easy for him.    While Flacco's 3 touchdowns all went to different players, they mostly had a common theme: An offensive lineman sustained an injury following 2 of his scores. Guard "

   "comment":"Flacco then gift-wrapped an easy scoring opportunity when he threw an interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Bengals took over deep in Baltimore territory, but a botched snap gave the ball right back to the Ravens on a fumble recovery. In the second quarter, the Bengals were given a generous spot on a third down, converting it. They took a timeout for some reason, and Baltimore used that time to determine that the spot was off. John Harbaugh challenged the play, and won the review. The Bengals then declined a penalty that would've taken the Ravens out of field-goal range. Instead, Baltimore was able to kick for 3 points - 1 of 2 occasions in which Justin Tucker drilled a 50-yard field goal in the first half alone. Things didn't get much better for the Bengals after halftime. Mike Nugent missed yet another extra point - this prevented the Bengals from covering the spread - and Andy Dalton was strip-sacked a whopping THREE times. Dalton was fortunate that 2 fumbles that were forced by Terrell Suggs were recovered, but the third 1. created by Elvis Dumervil, was the decisive 1. as Baltimore was able to fall on the football.    Dalton couldn't do much without A.J. Green, going 26-of-48 for only 283 yards and a touchdown. That's a YPA of 5.89, which is pretty bad. He wasn't intercepted, but he easily could've been picked off by Eric Weddle in the first half, as the stud safety dropped the ball. It was apparent that Dalton missed Green, as he threw some passes up for grabs that his pedestrian receivers couldn't come up with. Dalton also had numerous passes tipped at the line of scrimmage. It seemed like this happened 4 times in the final quarter alone.    Only 3 Bengals logged more than 38 receiving yards: Eifert (5-68), Boyd (5-62) and Jeremy Hill (6-61). Eifert reeled in Dalton's sole touchdown. Brandon LaFell couldn't do much - 3 catches, 38 yards - but the fact that the officials allowed the Raven defensive backs to get away with murder didn't help matters. There were 2 occasions in which Tavon Young should've been flagged for obvious pass-interference calls, but the officials didn't penalize the Ravens. They threw the flags once on 1 of the instances, but they changed their mind and inexplicably said that there was no penalty. The CBS announcers vehemently disagreed.    Hill did a good job of racking up receiving yardage, replacing the injured Bernard. However, he didn't do much on the ground, as he was limited to just 21 yards on 12 carries. He was outgained by Rex Burkhead (5-29).    Moving on to the Ravens, Flacco finished 25-of-36 for 234 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Flacco appeared to injure himself on an awkward slide in the second quarter and even sought some attention from the team doctors immediately afterward. However, if Flacco was affected by this, I didn't notice, and the stats would say the same thing. Flacco went 8-of-11 for 73 yards following intermission. Flacco played very well overall, which hasn't always been the case this year. However, before anyone gets too excited, Flacco was up against a secondary that has been atrocious this year. "

Considering the Eagles had done nothing offensively for most of the afternoon, that seemed like too tall of a challenge, but Wentz engineered a terrific drive. Zach Ertz helped him by making some great catches, and thanks to a couple of Baltimore defensive penalties, Wentz scrambled into the end zone on a 4-yard run.

He finished 22-of-42 for 170 yards and an interception to go along with 8 rushing yards and his score on the ground. He was also strip-sacked, but was fortunate that the ball trickled out of bounds. Fierce winds, poor protection and horrible receivers all betrayed Wentz. In fact, the Eagles were down to their fifth-string right tackle, Isaac Seumalo, who is a natural guard. Seumalo got banged up in the game, as he was slow to get up on Wentz's interception.    Ertz was great on the final drive, and he played well overall, catching 6 passes for 80 yards. In fact, Ertz was the only Eagle with more than 30 receiving yards. Jordan Matthews (6-27) was next on the list, while Dorial Green-Beckham and Nelson Agholor caught 1 pass each. Check out the 2017 NFL Draft Wide Receiver Prospect Rankings to see which wideouts the Eagles could be targeting in the draft.

   "comment":"Flacco. As with Roethlisberger, the Baltimore quarterback began slowly. He threw a Sam Bradford-type short pass on a third-and-6 on 1 occasion, and then he fired behind Dennis Pitta inside the 5-yard line. However, he caught fire before Roethlisberger managed to do so. He did this in the third quarter, and as a result, he managed to go 16-of-22 for 125 yards, 1 touchdown and a meaningless interception following intermission. Flacco's final numbers looked like this: 30-of-44, 262 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick. Flacco should've thrown a second score, but as mentioned, Waller was guilty of a drop in the end zone. The interception occurred on the final play of the game when Flacco was just trying to get something going downfield.    Flacco spread the ball around, targeting 4 players on 5 or more occasions. "

   "comment":"Flacco fired an interception on a first-and-goal, telegraphing a horrible pass to Shawn Williams. The Ravens later went for it on a 4.h-and-1 inside the red zone, but failed to convert. They were down 20-3 and needed 2 touchdowns and a field goal, so kicking would've made the most sense. This was evident when the Ravens had possession, down 20-10, with 5:40 remaining. Had they opted for the field goal, they would've been down just 1 score with the ball. John Harbaugh's brain fart was inexplicable.    As for the man of the hour, Smith had a pretty nondescript game. He caught 3 passes for 34 yards, and in typical Smith fashion, he got into a scuffle with a Cincinnati defender following a catch and a subsequent late push by Shawn Williams out of bounds. Congratulations to Smith on what has been a terrific career. He has finished 7.h all time in receiving yards.    Flacco did at least play well in between the 20s. He finished 32-of-49 for 267 yards and an interception. However, this wasn't the first time he was guilty of red-zone blunders this year. This has been a constant problem for him, and it's something the Ravens need to address this offseason. Perhaps Flacco will be better in his second year back from hs ACL tear.    "

   "comment":"Flacco was sacked twice on the first 3 drives, and the pressure affected his throws as well, as his ball placement was way off. The Ravens couldn't reach positive yardage until their 4.h drive, and they failed to convert a first down or complete a pass until 4:15 was remaining in the second quarter! It didn't help that there were some drops by Jeremy Maclin, Terrance West and Michael Campanaro in the opening half. In addition to being sloppy and inefficient, the Ravens also suffered injuries. Defensive lineman Brent Urban was knocked out with a foot sprain, while Maclin exited with a concussion (though he returned in the second half). Baltimore did not look prepared to play this silly 9:30 a.m. Eastern game, and it may have impacted the team's health as well. The NFL needs to abolish these horrible early games, as it is alienating West Coast football fans, who need to wake up at 6 a.m. to set their fantasy lineups. At any rate, Flacco finished 8-of-18 for 28 yards and 2 interceptions. One wasn't his fault, as the ball bounced off Maclin's hands, but the other occurred because Flacco stared down his receiver, allowing "

   "comment":"Flacco, connecting with the deep speed of Mike Wallace to lead to a road victory. The Ravens' offensive line played much better than it had in recent weeks, and the Raiders' offense was unable to keep up because Derek Carr was sidelined by his back injury. Later this season, this could be a very significant win for the Ravens to get a tiebreaker over Oakland because this is a conference victory. Conversely, the Raiders have to hope they can get Carr back soon, as it will be very hard for them to win without him. Oakland's defense is just not good enough to carry the team to wins.    On the first drive of the game, Flacco aired out a bomb to Wallace for a 52-yard completion. The Ravens got into the end zone a few plays later on a jet sweep run by wideout "

Chicago's defense continued to control the point of attack in the third quarter, with Hicks notching a sack to get the ball back for the Bears. Trubisky started a drive crossing midfield with an 18-yard completion to Kendall Wright. To end the drive, Trubisky rolled out and found Dion Sims (2-42-1) for a 27-yard touchdown. Baltimore got right back into the game as Bobby Rainey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. It was a weird play where Rainey was tripped up by his own teammate and the Bears' coverage unit stopped pursuing thinking he was down, but Rainey got up to dart downfield for the score. Late in the third quarter, the Ravens got a well-timed turnover as Eric Weddle stripped Cohen (14-32) of the ball, and Baltimore pounced on it to get set up at the Bears' 39-yard line. Flacco moved the ball inside the 10 with a third-down conversion to Nick Boyle, but Chicago's defense held strong to force a field goal and maintain a 17-13 lead."

He finished 20-of-31 for 188 yards and an interception at the beginning of the game, which was a downfield touch pass. Because of his meager numbers, no 1 in the Minnesota receiving corps topped 55 receiving yards. Jarius Wright led the way with 3 grabs for 54 yards, which includes an acrobatic, 30-yard reception that he made as the Vikings were eating up the clock in the 4.h quarter. Elsewhere, Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen caught 5 balls each for 43 and 41 yards, respectively. Thielen saw 12 targets, so he could have put together a better performance, but had some bad luck with a couple of inaccurate balls from Keenum.    Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon split touches almost evenly, but despite McKinnon's recent success, Murray was the 1 who had an explosive stat line. He gashed the Ravens for 113 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries despite the Ravens having nose tackle Brandon Williams back in the lineup. Murray had been very pedestrian prior to this game, while Williams should have made Baltimore much better versus the rush, so this result just seems illogical.    Moving on to something more predictable, Flacco was atrocious once again. His final stat line is even misleading - he was 27-of-39 for only 186 yards and a touchdown - as he didn't even break the century mark until the 4.h quarter. Flacco didn't have a chance once "

   "comment":"Flacco scrambled and slid just shy of the first-down marker. Linebacker Kiko Alonso dived right at Flacco's head, delivering a forearm blow at his helmet. Flacco's helmet popped off, and he didn't look like he knew what planet he was on. A fight naturally ensued, and I have no idea how several players weren't ejected because of it. Better yet, I don't know why Alonso was allowed to keep playing. He blatantly tried to injure Flacco, and he was successful in doing so. I'd be shocked if he doesn't receive a suspension for what he did. Flacco was naturally knocked out for the rest of the game with a concussion. If there's a silver lining for the Ravens, it's that they have 9 days off for Flacco to clear protocol before they battle the Titans. They'll need Flacco back, as "

   "comment":"Flacco threw behind Mike Wallace and then Jeremy Maclin dropped a pass on the third down on the opening drive. However, the Ravens picked up the slack after that and roasted Detroit's incompetent defense. Flacco finished 23-of-36 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. He has struggled for most of the season, but this was 1 of his best performances. He hit some bombs, particularly to Wallace, and he didn't make many mistakes.    Wallace ended up leading the Ravens with 5 catches and 116 yards. He snared a 66-yard reception in the second quarter to set up a short touchdown pass to "
