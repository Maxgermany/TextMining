He took a sack on first down; completed a short pass on second down; and fumbled the ball away on the final play. The sack and fumble put the Ravens back on their own 11, forcing poor field position on the ensuing punt. The Colts scored a touchdown on the next drive.    In total, the Ravens had just 14 rushing yards at halftime, which was shocking because the Colts have been so porous against opposing ground attacks. But looking at the plays, Baltimore ran the ball just 10 times in the first 30 minutes. That's not nearly enough against a defense whose strength is defending the pass.    It was clear early that Indianapolis didn't respect the pass. Good call on their part; Joe Flacco was completely abysmal, throwing 3 picks and fumbling twice.    Meanwhile, McGahee and McClain finished with terrible numbers. McGahee had 18 yards on 8 carries, while McClain had minus-2 yards and a fumble on 2 attempts. "

Dallas took a 7-0 lead, and it appeared as though Flacco was going to melt down in a big road game. Apparently not. Tony Romo was the 1 who choked, living up to his nickname of Aurora Snowmo.    Snowmo finished the contest 24-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers were pretty artificial; Snowmo compiled that yardage and the 2 scores in a pair of futile drives in the 4.h quarter. At 1 point in this contest, Snowmo was 13-of-25 for 90 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. This was yet another instance of Snowmo coming up small in December. I still don't understand how he beat the Giants. I know the defense stepped up, but Snowmo actually looked decent in that contest. He was dreadful on Saturday night until it was clear that the game was out of hand, enabling Snowmo to exit out of choke mode.    Excluding Snowmo's follies, the biggest difference in this contest was the coaching mismatch. If you couldn't tell that by the penalty difference (Baltimore 3 for 19 yards; Dallas 10 for 86 yards), how about the fake field goal Baltimore ran in the second half? John Harbugh caught the feeble Wade Phillips completely off guard. Later, when Phillips should have kicked onside, Harbaugh called a timeout prior to the kickoff, but not before Nick Folk sailed the attempt deep. This gave the Ravens an idea of what Phillips was planning to do. And despite the extra chance to call for an onside attempt, Phillips elected to relinquish possession, which epically failed because LeRon McClain broke free for an 82-yard touchdown run on Baltimore's first play. This eclipsed the Ravens' previous offensive play - a 77-yard Willis McGahee scamper.    McClain (22 carries, 139 yards, TD) and McGahee (8 carries, 108 yards, TD) weren't the whole story on offense. Joe Flacco's numbers weren't spectacular - 17-of-25 for 149 yards and a touchdown - but made clutch throws, allowing the Ravens to keep drives alive. Romo had nearly double the yardage, but Flacco was infinitely better.    Flacco found Flacco fumbled the ball away on his first possession, giving the Cowboys a touchdown a few plays later. Dallas took a 7-0 lead, and it appeared as though Flacco was going to melt down in a big road game. Apparently not. "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco completed only 4 passes. Flacco was 4-of-10 for 34 yards and an ugly interception. It's worth noting that Flacco tossed a beautiful deep ball to Demetrius Williams, but watched his inept receiver drop it.    The big story here was Tom Brady's ineffectiveness. Brady appeared rattled and looked like a guy a year removed from knee surgery. He was 23-of-42 for just 154 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. He was constantly under pressure; he took 3 sacks and seldom had the opportunity to look deep for Randy Moss (5 catches, 48 yards).    Wes Welker's absence was huge. Julian Edelman came up with 6 receptions for 44 yards and 2 touchdowns, and showed a lot of heart on some plays, but it was painfully obvious that Brady really missed his favorite receiver. I don't know if the Patriots would have won with Welker in the lineup, but this game would have been much more competitive. It certainly would have prevented the Ravens from blitzing as much as they did. Remember what Texans cornerback Dunta Robinson said last week - as soon as Welker left the lineup, it gave Houston more freedom to blitz Brady. Baltimore continued this strategy Sunday afternoon.    By the way, before moving off New England, it's worth noting that this was Brady's first home loss since Nov. 12, 2006. Wowwa weewa.    John Harbaugh is lucky his team won this game because he made a huge mistake in the second quarter that seemed like it might give New England the momentum it needed down 24-0. The Ravens muffed a punt deep into their own territory, which New England seemingly recovered. However, after looking at the replay, it was obvious that the Patriots player never had full control before he went out of bounds. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms were practically begging Harbaugh to challenge this play, but no red flag came out of the coach's hand. The Patriots went on to score a touchdown. I don't know why Harbaugh didn't challenge this. You have to wonder if he watched Marvin Lewis screw up on Saturday and vowed that he would only throw the red flag if he was 100-percent sure he would get it right.   Flacco completed only 4 passes. Flacco was 4-of-10 for 34 yards and an ugly interception. It's worth noting that Flacco tossed a beautiful deep ball to Demetrius Williams, but watched his inept receiver drop it.    The big story here was Tom Brady's ineffectiveness. Brady appeared rattled and looked like a guy a year removed from knee surgery. He was 23-of-42 for just 154 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. He was constantly under pressure; he took 3 sacks and seldom had the opportunity to look deep for Randy Moss (5 catches, 48 yards).    Wes Welker's absence was huge.

Flacco threw the ball 19 times in the same span amid a close contest. Cam Cameron seemed to be up to his old tricks, so someone must have threatened him during intermission because Baltimore came out running.

The 3 points made it a 2.possession game, which, at the time, seemed to put this game away for Baltimore because the Bengals had issues moving the chains.    Andy Dalton definitely didn't look like himself early on with A.J. Green out of the lineup. This was extremely apparent when Dalton attempted a 45-yard heave into the end zone during the second quarter. Green caught such a pass for a touchdown against the Steelers, but Andre Caldwell didn't have nearly as much success. Ed Reed picked off the pass. However, Dalton caught fire in the 4.h quarter and was able to finish 24-of-45, 373 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He made some really great throws and was a Calvin Johnson rule away from tying the game. The Bengals lost both contests against Baltimore and Pittsburgh, but their fan base really has to be thrilled with Dalton. He's just going to get better.    Dalton's 1 score went to Caldwell (3-63), but Jerome Simpson was the 1 who picked up the slack in the wake of Green's absence. Simpson hauled in 8 balls for a whopping 152 yards.    As for the Ravens, Flacco continued to be inconsistent. He led the Ravens to just 1 first down in the first quarter and had a botched handoff with his running back. The offense as a whole just looked really sloppy. But in the ensuing quarter, he started connecting on deep bombs to "

This was a good rebound performance for Flacco, who struggled at Seattle and was inconsistent last week against the Bengals. For whatever reason, Flacco plays down to his competition but steps up against elite opposition. I guess that can be a good thing.    As mentioned earlier, the Ravens notched 9 sacks. Suggs had 3 of them with a forced fumble. "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco went just 13-of-27 for 187 yards and an interception. There were 2 reasons why the Ravens couldn't do anything aerially. First, the team dropped a ton of passes. Second, Flacco was constantly pressured. He was sacked 4 times, twice each by Flacco fumbled the ball late in the 4.h quarter, and the Chiefs recovered it and scored a touchdown. Except it never happened because the officials blew the play dead. Yeah, this isn't a Kansas City mistake, but it was amusing watching an ultra-nice Romeo Crennel refrain from lashing out at the refs in his post-game press conference.    Cassel suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. The crowd cheered when Cassel was on the ground, which drew the ire of right tackle Eric Winston. It's 100-percent sickening, Winston said angrily afterward. Cassel was replaced by Brady Quinn, who completed all 3 of his passes for 32 yards. Quinn looked confident and may be named the team's starter going forward. The coaching staff showed no confidence in Cassel anyway, opting to run a draw play on a 3rd-and-8 in Baltimore territory in the opening quarter.    The Chiefs ran the ball extremely well against the Ravens, who surrendered triple-digit rushing yards in a half for the first time since 1998. Jamaal Charles gained 140 yards on 30 carries. Shaun Draughn, playing for an injured Peyton Hillis, chipped in with 40 yards on 12 attempts.    The Ravens also did a great job of moving the ball on the ground. Ray Rice totaled 102 rushing yards on 17 carries. The question is, why didn't Rice receive more than 17 attempts? The Ravens, despite being outplayed, never trailed in this contest. Cam Cameron, once again, inexplicably forgot about him.    Joe Flacco went just 13-of-27 for 187 yards and an interception. There were 2 reasons why the Ravens couldn't do anything aerially.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco couldn't find anyone downfield, so he just gave up, checking the ball down to Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Justin Tucker hit a field goal to send it to overtime. The Chargers punted twice because of a trio of drops. A pass interference was called on San Diego despite a ball being uncatchable. Torrey Smith made an amazing catch on a third down. And then Tucker made the decisive kick.    The Ravens clearly should have lost this game, as they never had a lead. However, I'll give credit to Rice (22 carries, 97 rush yards; 8 catches, 67 rec. yards) for that play, Joe Flacco (30-of-51, 355 yards, TD) for being a masterful 12-of-24 on third downs and Smith (7-144) for making that amazing 31-yard grab to set up Tucker for the game-winning kick.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco. Now I've seen everything. I picked the Steelers to cover, but I thought this would be a low-scoring, grind-it-out football game. When the Ravens took a 13-3 lead in the second quarter, I thought Pittsburgh was screwed. Batch, after all, couldn't even beat the Browns, though he was betrayed by all of his running backs. Instead, Batch lit it up in the second half. It's still hard to believe, but Batch went 14-of-20 for 219 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception after intermission. His numbers could have been even better, but Emmanuel Sanders appeared content to sabotage this game. Sanders caught a pass in the open field and had a long touchdown in his sights, but inexplicably lost a fumble even though he wasn't touched. Sanders then dropped a pass near the red zone, though he would ultimately redeem himself with a clutch reception in Baltimore territory.    Batch (final numbers: 25-of-36, 276 yards, TD, INT) focused on throwing the ball to Sanders (5-60), Heath Miller (5-97, TD), Antonio Brown (5-58) and Mike Wallace (5-44). Wallace had yet another drop on a deep ball, while Brown made a terrible decision and heaved an interception on a trick play. Phil Simms called Brown's attempt a great throw, but he was obviously on crack because it was awful.    After fumbling it twice last week, Rashard Mendenhall was a healthy scratch. Jonathan Dwyer (16-49, TD) handled most of the work, while Isaac Redman (9-43) worked as the change-of-pace back. The key is that unlike last week, none of the running backs fumbled.    Joe Flacco, meanwhile, went 16-of-34 for 188 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad interception he forced downfield. This pick was his first in 5 meetings against the Steelers. He was just 5-of-12 for 54 yards after intermission.    Pittsburgh once again did a great job of taking away Flacco. Now I've seen everything. I picked the Steelers to cover, but I thought this would be a low-scoring, grind-it-out football game. When the Ravens took a 13-3 lead in the second quarter, I thought Pittsburgh was screwed. Batch, after all, couldn't even beat the Browns, though he was betrayed by all of his running backs. Instead, Batch lit it up in the second half. It's still hard to believe, but Batch went 14-of-20 for 219 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception after intermission. His numbers could have been even better, but Emmanuel Sanders appeared content to sabotage this game.

Manning had just 1 completion longer than 14 yards - an impressive heave to Rueben Randle as he was getting hit. It was 1 of those plays where Manning chucks and ducks and doesn't appear to be looking where he's launching the ball, but it's somehow completed. However, he just didn't have the time in the pocket to consistently find his receivers downfield.    Manning's top wideouts barely did anything. Victor Cruz (3-21) took a fierce helmet-to-helmet hit from Ed Reed late in the game, while Hakeem Nicks didn't log a single reception.    Ahmad Bradshaw (9-39) and David Wilson (3-17, TD) probably would have been able to gash the Ravens had New York been able to stick with the running game. The Giants had to abandon that because they were down by double digits for most of the contest.    As mentioned, Flacco didn't have to worry about any pressure.

The Packers may have lost a game like this last year, but they were able to pull out a victory, thanks to Eddie Lacy. The rookie runner was a stud, bulldozing Baltimore's strong ground defense for 120 yards on 23 carries. The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. Jermichael Finley (3-75) wasn't much of a factor, as a 52-yard reception of his came when Green Bay was running out the clock.    Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage.

That certainly didn't seem like the case when Baltimore entered the 4.h quarter with a 7-6 lead in what was a turnover-filled, defensive slug-fest. The Ravens seemingly had control of this contest despite the slim margin because Cassel simply couldn't get anything going, but an ugly Flacco interception helped Minnesota establish its first lead of the afternoon. Things looked bleak for the Ravens, but Flacco eventually found Dennis Pitta in the end zone. As this happened, I quickly jotted down, Pitta game-winning touchdown. Huge second half. Despite calling it a game-winning score, there were FOUR more touchdowns after that, as the Vikings and Ravens went back and forth with some brilliant plays in the final couple of minutes. The mayhem began when the Ravens inexplicably couldn't tackle Toby Gerhart on a 41-yard score. That accounted for nearly half of Gerhart's yardage, as he tallied 89 yards and that score on 15 carries along with a lost fumble that should have been overturned by the officials. Gerhart replaced Adrian Peterson (7-13), who was carted into the locker room at the beginning of the second quarter with an ankle injury. Jacoby Jones responded with a kickoff return touchdown on a pooch kick, but the Vikings came back with a score on a 79-yard Cordarrelle Patterson score in which he broke free following a reception caught behind the line of scrimmage. Once again, the Ravens should have been able to bring him down, but the defense disappointed. Just when all hope was lost, Joe Flacco hit a big pass to Marlon Brown for 35 yards.Flacco and Matt Cassel in snowy conditions would end up being 1 of the most entertaining games of the year?

He was hurt by some drops, particularly by Steve Smith, but he was off the mark for the most part. It didn't help him that the offensive line couldn't pass protect or run block, or do anything correctly, but Flacco looked like 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for most of this contest. Flacco ended up 35-of-62 for 345 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That stat line is misleading, though Flacco did get into a rhythm in the second half. However, he screwed up on numerous occasions and took unnecessary sacks. A sack actually ended the game, but the play that most sticks out occurred just prior to intermission. With limited time remaining on the clock, Flacco scrambled to avoid pressure. The coaches yelled at him to throw the ball away, but he ran around like an idiot instead. Time ultimately ran out, as Baltimore screwed up a chance to kick a field goal.    Flacco's sole score went to Steve Smith, who found the end zone on an 80-yard touchdown where he muscled defenders away. Smith finished with 7 grabs for 118 yards, though those numbers are bogus because most of them came on 1 play. Smith was highly inefficient for most of the afternoon.    "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore. He played lethargically in 2013 and simply looked done as a result. The Panthers made the right move by getting rid of him based on his performance this past season.    The Panthers, meanwhile, were bludgeoned quite literally. Greg Olsen limped off early, and then DeAngelo Williams followed him. I've always said that the toughest thing NFL coaches have to do is making in-game adjustments to injuries to their high-impact players. The Panthers couldn't do anything once Williams left the field. With Jonathan Stewart also out, Carolina had no choice but to turn to scrubs like Darrin Reaves and Taurean Poole. Reaves couldn't do anything on the ground with his 12 carries for 26 yards, while Poole lost a fumble near midfield in the second half. Cam Newton was also beaten to a pulp. He didn't leave the game until it got out of hand, but he was constantly hit and harassed. His offensive line couldn't do anything to protect him, as Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to Kelvin Benjamin, who caught 5 balls for 76 yards, though most of that came during garbage time in the second half. Benjamin nearly secured a second score, but after replay, the officials ruled that his toe was out of bounds. Benjamin had some drops and was also whistled for an offensive pass interference, which knocked Carolina out of field goal range on what looked like a promising opening drive.    Carolina's defense was equally disappointing, as it surrendered big play after big play throughout the afternoon. The team had major problems tackling, while the defensive interior was easily pushed around by Baltimore's front. The Ravens basically had anything they wanted in the middle, which would explain how Justin Forsett (14-66, TD) and Lorenzo Taliaferro (15-58, TD) combined for 124 yards on the ground. Forsett also logged 3 catches for 31 receiving yards. Taliaferro, meanwhile, racked up his yardage in garbage time. Bernard Pierce was nowhere to be seen despite being probable.    Joe Flacco also had an easy afternoon. He had zero pressure in his face throughout despite Eugene Monroe's absence, allowing him to go 22-of-31 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, 2 of the scores went to Steve Smith. The other was thrown to Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco and Andy Dalton were trying their best to lose.Flacco and Andy Dalton were trying their best to lose. Both signal-callers had miserable performances, with each being responsible for multiple turnovers. Dalton, however, was the least worse of the 2. and he managed to stop being inept enough to lead his team to a victory at the very end. Dalton's completion percentage and yardage don't look terrible - 21-of-28, 266 yards - but he had the fans moaning and groaning in the 4.h quarter. Most of Dalton's errors came late. He had an overthrow in the end zone, missing a potential touchdown. He then did a poor job of securing the football and lost a fumble. Dalton followed that up with an interception on the next drive, but that was really a Mohamed Sanu fumble; it would've been ruled that way if Sanu had possession of the ball for a second longer. Dalton managed to heave a low pass to Greg Little, which had the fans booing him. As mentioned though, Dalton put together a game-winning drive, highlighted by a 53-yard bomb to Sanu on third-and-10. He capped it off with a quarterback sneak on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, scoring for the second time on the ground.    With Green out, all Dalton had to work with was Sanu, who stepped up with 5 grabs for 125 yards, though he was responsible for the interception. On the bright side, he also made an amazing, 1.handed catch. Dalton will need A.J. Green to return soon, as he had to rely on Greg Mr. Dependable Little to be his second receiver. Mr. Dependable (3-42) did make a catch on third-and-long in the first half and also had a big gain wiped out by an Andre Smith hold.    Giovani Bernard didn't find much running room, but managed to score once. He gained 45 yards on 16 carries otherwise. Unfortunately, he left the game with a hip injury. Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. Antonio Gates (7-83) was worked on early before the Ravens took him away from Will Hill. Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65). Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.    Of course, the Packers will be favored against all of those teams because of Aaron Rodgers, who was mostly spectacular in this contest. With no pressure in his face for nearly the entire game, he was able to go 24-of-36 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 5 scrambles for 28 rushing yards. There was some complacency in the second half, however. Rodgers wasn't nearly as sharp as he was prior to intermission, completing just 6-of-11 attempts. He missed an open Jordy Nelson for a touchdown (he connected with him, but Nelson had to dive for an inaccurate ball). His teammates seemed to be out of sync as well, as Eddie Lacy dropped a pass, while the special teams didn't have enough players on the field for a punt. As a result, the Packers nearly squandered their 31-7 lead. The Falcons scored 4 touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, ultimately covering the spread.    Lacy gashed the Falcons in the early going. He ripped through Atlanta's poor defense and had 56 yards and a touchdown by halftime. However, he finished with 73 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown, as Atlanta clamped down on the run in the second half - save for a big James Starks gain at the very end. Starks actually outgained Lacy as a result, finishing with 75 yards and a score on 10 attempts, though Lacy had the better fantasy day because he caught 5 balls for 33 receiving yards and a second touchdown.    Rodgers' other scores went to Jordy Nelson, who reeled in 8 of 10 targets for a whopping 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. No other Packer had more than 58 receiving yards, however, with Randall Cobb holding that distinction on 4 catches.    As for the Falcons, I already mentioned Jones' dominance. I have to emphasize how incredible he was. He caught 11 balls for a ridiculous 259 yards and a touchdown. The Packers looked completely clueless trying to stop him, and he would've had a bigger night, but 3 things happened: First, Jones nearly had a second score, but could only get 1 foot inbounds. Second, he was tackled at the 3-yard line on a 79-yard gain. And third, he was knocked out of the game with an injury. He wasn't present on the field for Atlanta's final offensive drive, though the Falcons found the end zone anyway for the dreaded backdoor cover.    Matt Ryan was terrific in the second half. He finished 24-of-39 for 375 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but he was 18-of-25 for 263 yards and a quartet of scores following intermission. His pick was a poor decision, as he threw the ball toward Devin Hester without looking while under pressure. However, he rebounded and nearly led an unbelievable comeback. Though the Falcons lost, their outlook in terms of winning the division is positive because Ryan is performing on a much higher level than Brees.    Excluding Jones, the players who reeled in Ryan's touchdowns were Roddy White (3-42), who barely did anything prior to Jones getting hurt, Harry Douglas (2-11) and Eric Weems.    Steven Jackson, meanwhile, looked functional for the second week in a row. He gained 50 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Most of his yardage came in the first half, but the Falcons had to abandon the run for the most part because they were so far behind. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.

He had so much pressure in his face, thanks to both of his offensive tackles being out, that he just didn't have enough time in the pocket to find his receivers downfield. He was sacked only once, but the Browns brought plenty of heat and forced many errant passes. As a restult, he was 11-of-18 for just 97 yards heading into halftime. Just prior to the break, he was stripped of the football, which bounced backward and took the team out of field-goal range. Flacco wasn't any better in the third quarter, as he was nearly picked in the red zone. However, something finally clicked in the final frame, as he found "

However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith. After the 2-minute warning, the Bengals were set up for a 4.h-and-1 that needed a half yard. Marvin Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.

The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle Aaron Donald and had his forearm broken like some old dried-up peanut brittle from last Christmas, which was not pleasant for anyone involved, especially him. Rookie running back Javorius Allen took over after Forsett went down and had plenty of work, with 27 touches for 115 yards. He was stifled on the ground though, with 22 carries for 67 yards, which came out to a poor 3 yards per carry. Of course, this is a St. Louis defense that had allowed just 3.7 yards per carry on the season.    There weren't many bright spots for the Ravens, but tight end Crockett Gillmore did catch 5-of-8 targets for 101 yards and Kamar Aiken caught a 3-yard touchdown to go along with 5 receptions on 8 targets for 50 yards. These 2 and Allen are the core of this group, which going forward will be weakened by Matt Schaub, but Allen should at least see plenty of work, as he is competent in both the receiving and rushing game.    The first score in this matchup came from the rookie running back on the other side, Todd Gurley. Gurley scored from 1 yard out to give his team a 7-0 lead, and despite Keenum completing just 3-of-10 passes for 31 yards and the whole team at 73 total yards of total offense at halftime, the Rams led 7-3.    If it weren't for the Ravens also making mistakes, they would have probably had an easier time in this game. It always looked like the winner would be the team that capitalized on a turnover last, and that's exactly what happened when Keenum was hit by Courtney Upshaw, fumbling the ball away with 54 seconds to go in a tie game.    Flacco then came in and moved the ball into field goal range, but in the process, tore his ACL and possibly his MCL, ending his season. He had never missed a game in his 8 years in the league, so I guess that's why they invested in the likes of Schaub to back him up. Justin Tucker was then able to hit a game-winning 47-yard field goal, but it was a hollow victory, having already lost Forsett and Flacco.    Schaub will take over as quarterback, which hurts the Ravens' chances of winning, while also hurting the offensive players all around. The only possible upside of Schaub playing is that opposing defenses should be able to average a pick-six or 2 against him.    The Rams totaled 213 yards on the day for a measly 3.8 yards per play with Keenum at the helm, and they continued to waste a good defense and a great running back. It had looked like there was some chance the Rams could win games based solely on those 2 parts of their offense, but the incredibly poor quarterback play was just not able to sustain even a run-based offense with a stud running back. Becoming 1.dimensional on offense is not going to be sustainable.    The Ravens' defense had been their Achilles heel this season, but once Steve Smith Sr. went out for the year, it felt somewhat hopeless if you wanted to see Flacco and company to have any consistency moving the ball. Of course now, they are without Flacco and Forsett, which means they are truly done, just as the Rams look to be with no startable quarterback in the building.   "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco was 30-of-46 for 210 yards and 1 touchdown. Baltimore's offensive line had problems protecting Flacco in the second half. Terrance West (11-95) led the Ravens on the ground.    Mike Wallace (7-63) was Baltimore's leading receiver. Flacco hit Crockett Gilmore (4-28) for a touchdown. The Redskins got on the scoreboard as Jamison Crowder ripped off an 85-yard punt return for a score, but Washington missed the extra point. Baltimore soon added a field-goal drive, with the big playing being a 26-yard pass interference on linebacker Will Compton. The Ravens were set up for more points when Zach Orr caused and recovered a fumble from Matt Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the 4.h quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco had an open receiver at the 5-yard line, but overthrew him. Flacco then had to try a Hail Mary, and that fell incomplete as time expired.    As you can tell, this game was insane, with so many twists and turns. Either team could have won it; the Ravens failed to convert a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Plus, these teams weren't far apart in terms of net yardage (435-391, Giants), and Baltimore won the time-of-possession battle by more than 10 minutes.    Speaking of twists and turns, that could appropriately describe Eli Manning's performance. Manning began very poorly; as mentioned, he was throwing way behind countless receivers. However, his deep connections to Beckham bolstered his stat line, and he finished 32-of-46 for 403 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first score was the 300th of his career. By the way, neither of Manning's interceptions were his fault; I mentioned Shepard fell down during 1 of them. The other occurred when Manning tried to make something happen at the end of the first half, so the turnover didn't hurt at all.    Beckham had just 2 catches for 11 yards at halftime, and as mentioned, he was dealing with a hip pointer. However, he came alive following intermission, and he finished with 8 catches for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns, as Baltimore's beleaguered secondary blew coverage after coverage.    "

Baltimore also couldn't run the ball, with Terrance West rushing 15 times for 21 yards and Kenneth Dixon seeing 9 attempts for 13 yards. That is a good sign for the Steelers, who were being gashed by opposes runners lately.    The Ravens' defense and special teams won this game for their team. They shut down Le'Veon Bell to just 32 yards on 12 carries, and of course, the utter devastation of the Steelers' offense through 3 quarters.    Penalties also made this game tough to watch. Pittsburgh had more penalty yards than offensive yards through the first half! On the day, the 2 teams accumulated 21 penalties for 193 yards, which is slightly less than the Raiders last week, but still too much for most football games.    At any rate, another field goal and then a blocked punt for a touchdown put the Ravens in control 21-0 with just 13 minutes left in the game. That's when Pittsburgh's offense finally woke up. That awakening was, of course, helped by a defense with a 21-point lead, but there's no doubt that Roethlisberger was more accurate after getting 3 quarters of practice. He finally started connecting with Antonio Brown, finding him on a 23-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 21-7. Brown, after barely seeing the ball through most of the game, ended up with 7 receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown. The fact that Roethlisberger didn't hurt himself anymore and looked strong to finish the game is actually a decent outcome from this ugly game. Roethlisberger again moved his team down the field with time waning and ended up rushing for a touchdown to make the game 21-14 with 48 seconds left on the clock. Of course, an onside kick was in order, but instead we saw the worst possible whiff on a kick by Chris Boswell, who will have a time living that play down.    Steve Smith returned after missing 2 games with an ankle injury. He ended up with 4 receptions for 47 yards, but the good news is that he made it through the game healthy and should continue to be a top target for Flacco. Oh, and the Ravens get to play the Browns this Thursday night.    The Steelers have now lost 3 in a row, and the Ravens have taken over the lead in the NFC North based on their head-to-head record since both teams are now 4-4. Pittsburgh takes on a hot Dallas Cowboys team next.   "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco then gift-wrapped an easy scoring opportunity when he threw an interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Bengals took over deep in Baltimore territory, but a botched snap gave the ball right back to the Ravens on a fumble recovery. In the second quarter, the Bengals were given a generous spot on a third down, converting it. They took a timeout for some reason, and Baltimore used that time to determine that the spot was off. John Harbaugh challenged the play, and won the review. The Bengals then declined a penalty that would've taken the Ravens out of field-goal range.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco interception in the red zone, the Eagles still had 1 more chance to send the game to overtime, but they had to go 59 yards with less than 2 minutes remaining. Considering the Eagles had done nothing offensively for most of the afternoon, that seemed like too tall of a challenge, but Wentz engineered a terrific drive. Zach Ertz helped him by making some great catches, and thanks to a couple of Baltimore defensive penalties, Wentz scrambled into the end zone on a 4-yard run. It appeared as though the game would go to overtime, but the Eagles opted to go for 2. They failed to convert, but it ultimately didn't matter in the grand scheme of things because Philadelphia was already out of playoff contention. The only impact it had was the Browns' draft positioning improving, but Cleveland will likely squander that pick anyway. Wentz had that great drive, but as mentioned, he struggled otherwise. He finished 22-of-42 for 170 yards and an interception to go along with 8 rushing yards and his score on the ground. He was also strip-sacked, but was fortunate that the ball trickled out of bounds. Fierce winds, poor protection and horrible receivers all betrayed Wentz. In fact, the Eagles were down to their fifth-string right tackle, Isaac Seumalo, who is a natural guard. Seumalo got banged up in the game, as he was slow to get up on Wentz's interception.    Ertz was great on the final drive, and he played well overall, catching 6 passes for 80 yards. In fact, Ertz was the only Eagle with more than 30 receiving yards. Jordan Matthews (6-27) was next on the list, while Dorial Green-Beckham and Nelson Agholor caught 1 pass each. Check out the to see which wideouts the Eagles could be targeting in the draft.    Ryan Mathews was pretty much the only healthy running back, so Doug Pederson couldn't play games at the position this week. Mathews ran surprisingly well versus Baltmore's tough defense, gaining 128 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.    Joe Flacco, meanwhile, was pretty inconsistent, which I guess is the norm for him now.

The Ravens' offensive line played much better than it had in recent weeks, and the Raiders' offense was unable to keep up because Derek Carr was sidelined by his back injury. Later this season, this could be a very significant win for the Ravens to get a tiebreaker over Oakland because this is a conference victory. Conversely, the Raiders have to hope they can get Carr back soon, as it will be very hard for them to win without him. Oakland's defense is just not good enough to carry the team to wins.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco's sole touchdown came as time expired.    Flacco's sole touchdown came as time expired.    Case Keenum didn't have the prettiest stats, but he was very efficient when he needed to be. He finished 20-of-31 for 188 yards and an interception at the beginning of the game, which was a downfield touch pass. Because of his meager numbers, no 1 in the Minnesota receiving corps topped 55 receiving yards. Jarius Wright led the way with 3 grabs for 54 yards, which includes an acrobatic, 30-yard reception that he made as the Vikings were eating up the clock in the 4.h quarter. Elsewhere, Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen caught 5 balls each for 43 and 41 yards, respectively. Thielen saw 12 targets, so he could have put together a better performance, but had some bad luck with a couple of inaccurate balls from Keenum.    Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon split touches almost evenly, but despite McKinnon's recent success, Murray was the 1 who had an explosive stat line. He gashed the Ravens for 113 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries despite the Ravens having nose tackle Brandon Williams back in the lineup. Murray had been very pedestrian prior to this game, while Williams should have made Baltimore much better versus the rush, so this result just seems illogical.    Moving on to something more predictable, Flacco was atrocious once again. His final stat line is even misleading - he was 27-of-39 for only 186 yards and a touchdown - as he didn't even break the century mark until the 4.h quarter. Flacco didn't have a chance once "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco scrambled and slid just shy of the first-down marker. Linebacker Flacco scrambled and slid just shy of the first-down marker. Linebacker Kiko Alonso dived right at Flacco's head, delivering a forearm blow at his helmet. Flacco's helmet popped off, and he didn't look like he knew what planet he was on. A fight naturally ensued, and I have no idea how several players weren't ejected because of it. Better yet, I don't know why Alonso was allowed to keep playing. He blatantly tried to injure Flacco, and he was successful in doing so. I'd be shocked if he doesn't receive a suspension for what he did. Flacco was naturally knocked out for the rest of the game with a concussion. If there's a silver lining for the Ravens, it's that they have 9 days off for Flacco to clear protocol before they battle the Titans. They'll need Flacco back, as "
