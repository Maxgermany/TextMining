Harbaugh later went for it and converted again in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-one Cleveland's 29.    Not much else of note from Baltimore's offense. LeRon McClain and "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco's second throw was an interception. Two possessions later, Flacco dropped back in the pocket on all 3 downs. He took a sack on first down; completed a short pass on second down; and fumbled the ball away on the final play. The sack and fumble put the Ravens back on their own 11, forcing poor field position on the ensuing punt. The Colts scored a touchdown on the next drive.    In total, the Ravens had just 14 rushing yards at halftime, which was shocking because the Colts have been so porous against opposing ground attacks. But looking at the plays, Baltimore ran the ball just 10 times in the first 30 minutes. That's not nearly enough against a defense whose strength is defending the pass.    It was clear early that Indianapolis didn't respect the pass. Good call on their part; Joe Flacco was completely abysmal, throwing 3 picks and fumbling twice.    Meanwhile, McGahee and McClain finished with terrible numbers. McGahee had 18 yards on 8 carries, while McClain had minus-2 yards and a fumble on 2 attempts. "

Flacco converted 5 third downs with 7 or more yards to go in the first half alone!    Coming out of the witness-protection program, Clayton had 5 receptions for 164 yards. He caught the aforementioned touchdown, and he threw a score of his own as well. "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco fumbled the ball away on his first possession, giving the Cowboys a touchdown a few plays later. Dallas took a 7-0 lead, and it appeared as though Flacco was going to melt down in a big road game. Apparently not. Tony Romo was the 1 who choked, living up to his nickname of Aurora Snowmo.    Snowmo finished the contest 24-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers were pretty artificial; Snowmo compiled that yardage and the 2 scores in a pair of futile drives in the 4.h quarter. At 1 point in this contest, Snowmo was 13-of-25 for 90 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. This was yet another instance of Snowmo coming up small in December. I still don't understand how he beat the Giants. I know the defense stepped up, but Snowmo actually looked decent in that contest. He was dreadful on Saturday night until it was clear that the game was out of hand, enabling Snowmo to exit out of choke mode.    Excluding Snowmo's follies, the biggest difference in this contest was the coaching mismatch. If you couldn't tell that by the penalty difference (Baltimore 3 for 19 yards; Dallas 10 for 86 yards), how about the fake field goal Baltimore ran in the second half? John Harbugh caught the feeble Wade Phillips completely off guard. Later, when Phillips should have kicked onside, Harbaugh called a timeout prior to the kickoff, but not before Nick Folk sailed the attempt deep. This gave the Ravens an idea of what Phillips was planning to do. And despite the extra chance to call for an onside attempt, Phillips elected to relinquish possession, which epically failed because LeRon McClain broke free for an 82-yard touchdown run on Baltimore's first play. This eclipsed the Ravens' previous offensive play - a 77-yard Willis McGahee scamper.    McClain (22 carries, 139 yards, TD) and McGahee (8 carries, 108 yards, TD) weren't the whole story on offense. Joe Flacco's numbers weren't spectacular - 17-of-25 for 149 yards and a touchdown - but made clutch throws, allowing the Ravens to keep drives alive. Romo had nearly double the yardage, but Flacco was infinitely better.    Flacco found "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco completed only 4 passes. Flacco was 4-of-10 for 34 yards and an ugly interception. It's worth noting that Flacco tossed a beautiful deep ball to Demetrius Williams, but watched his inept receiver drop it.    The big story here was Tom Brady's ineffectiveness. Brady appeared rattled and looked like a guy a year removed from knee surgery. He was 23-of-42 for just 154 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. He was constantly under pressure; he took 3 sacks and seldom had the opportunity to look deep for Randy Moss (5 catches, 48 yards).    Wes Welker's absence was huge. Julian Edelman came up with 6 receptions for 44 yards and 2 touchdowns, and showed a lot of heart on some plays, but it was painfully obvious that Brady really missed his favorite receiver. I don't know if the Patriots would have won with Welker in the lineup, but this game would have been much more competitive. It certainly would have prevented the Ravens from blitzing as much as they did. Remember what Texans cornerback Dunta Robinson said last week - as soon as Welker left the lineup, it gave Houston more freedom to blitz Brady. Baltimore continued this strategy Sunday afternoon.    By the way, before moving off New England, it's worth noting that this was Brady's first home loss since Nov. 12, 2006. Wowwa weewa.    John Harbaugh is lucky his team won this game because he made a huge mistake in the second quarter that seemed like it might give New England the momentum it needed down 24-0. The Ravens muffed a punt deep into their own territory, which New England seemingly recovered. However, after looking at the replay, it was obvious that the Patriots player never had full control before he went out of bounds. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms were practically begging Harbaugh to challenge this play, but no red flag came out of the coach's hand. The Patriots went on to score a touchdown. I don't know why Harbaugh didn't challenge this. You have to wonder if he watched Marvin Lewis screw up on Saturday and vowed that he would only throw the red flag if he was 100-percent sure he would get it right.   "

This was a good rebound performance for Flacco, who struggled at Seattle and was inconsistent last week against the Bengals. For whatever reason, Flacco plays down to his competition but steps up against elite opposition. I guess that can be a good thing.    As mentioned earlier, the Ravens notched 9 sacks.

   "comment":"Joe Flacco couldn't find anyone downfield, so he just gave up, checking the ball down to Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Justin Tucker hit a field goal to send it to overtime. The Chargers punted twice because of a trio of drops. A pass interference was called on San Diego despite a ball being uncatchable. Torrey Smith made an amazing catch on a third down. And then Tucker made the decisive kick.    The Ravens clearly should have lost this game, as they never had a lead. However, I'll give credit to Rice (22 carries, 97 rush yards; 8 catches, 67 rec. yards) for that play, Joe Flacco (30-of-51, 355 yards, TD) for being a masterful 12-of-24 on third downs and Smith (7-144) for making that amazing 31-yard grab to set up Tucker for the game-winning kick.    One other thing on the Ravens: "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco. Now I've seen everything. I picked the Steelers to cover, but I thought this would be a low-scoring, grind-it-out football game. When the Ravens took a 13-3 lead in the second quarter, I thought Pittsburgh was screwed. Batch, after all, couldn't even beat the Browns, though he was betrayed by all of his running backs. Instead, Batch lit it up in the second half. It's still hard to believe, but Batch went 14-of-20 for 219 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception after intermission. His numbers could have been even better, but Emmanuel Sanders appeared content to sabotage this game. Sanders caught a pass in the open field and had a long touchdown in his sights, but inexplicably lost a fumble even though he wasn't touched. Sanders then dropped a pass near the red zone, though he would ultimately redeem himself with a clutch reception in Baltimore territory.    Batch (final numbers: 25-of-36, 276 yards, TD, INT) focused on throwing the ball to Sanders (5-60), Heath Miller (5-97, TD), Antonio Brown (5-58) and Mike Wallace (5-44). Wallace had yet another drop on a deep ball, while Brown made a terrible decision and heaved an interception on a trick play. Phil Simms called Brown's attempt a great throw, but he was obviously on crack because it was awful.    After fumbling it twice last week, Rashard Mendenhall was a healthy scratch. Jonathan Dwyer (16-49, TD) handled most of the work, while Isaac Redman (9-43) worked as the change-of-pace back. The key is that unlike last week, none of the running backs fumbled.    Joe Flacco, meanwhile, went 16-of-34 for 188 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad interception he forced downfield. This pick was his first in 5 meetings against the Steelers. He was just 5-of-12 for 54 yards after intermission.    Pittsburgh once again did a great job of taking away "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco at the very end of the first half to set up a Mason Crosby field goal, had to leave the game. The Packers then had to roll with players named Nate Palmer and Andy Mulumba as its outside linebackers. The defense understandably wasn't the same after that, but the offense made the appropriate adjustments. Rodgers completed fewer than half of his passes prior to intermission and had a pick dropped by Daryl Smith, but was 7-of-11 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (a great play by Jimmy Smith) after the break. Rodgers ultimately finished 17-of-32 for 315 yards, 1 score and the pick. The stop unit, meanwhile, had some great performances from rookie Micah Hyde and A.J. Hawk (3 sacks).    The Packers may have lost a game like this last year, but they were able to pull out a victory, thanks to Eddie Lacy. The rookie runner was a stud, bulldozing Baltimore's strong ground defense for 120 yards on 23 carries. The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. Jermichael Finley (3-75) wasn't much of a factor, as a 52-yard reception of his came when Green Bay was running out the clock.    Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage. This included some red-zone ineptness in the second quarter. "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco (20-of-36 for 140 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions) had a pick dropped at the beginning of the 4.h quarter. On the very next play, Flacco was intercepted, helping to set up a Cincinnati score. - Flacco then did a poor job of bleeding out the clock. First of all, I don't know why in the world he kept snapping the ball with 12-15 seconds on the play clock in the final period. Second, Flacco lost a fumble at midfield. This allowed the Bengals to drive deep into Baltimore territory, but the defense bailed out its quarterback with a pick. - Time was running out for Cincinnati. Dalton had to attempt a Hail Mary from his own 49-yard line. He heaved it into the end zone. The ball bounced off a cluster of players, and then safety "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco and Matt Cassel in snowy conditions would end up being 1 of the most entertaining games of the year? That certainly didn't seem like the case when Baltimore entered the 4.h quarter with a 7-6 lead in what was a turnover-filled, defensive slug-fest. The Ravens seemingly had control of this contest despite the slim margin because Cassel simply couldn't get anything going, but an ugly Flacco interception helped Minnesota establish its first lead of the afternoon. Things looked bleak for the Ravens, but Flacco eventually found Dennis Pitta in the end zone. As this happened, I quickly jotted down, Pitta game-winning touchdown. Huge second half. Despite calling it a game-winning score, there were FOUR more touchdowns after that, as the Vikings and Ravens went back and forth with some brilliant plays in the final couple of minutes. The mayhem began when the Ravens inexplicably couldn't tackle Toby Gerhart on a 41-yard score. That accounted for nearly half of Gerhart's yardage, as he tallied 89 yards and that score on 15 carries along with a lost fumble that should have been overturned by the officials. Gerhart replaced Adrian Peterson (7-13), who was carted into the locker room at the beginning of the second quarter with an ankle injury. Jacoby Jones responded with a kickoff return touchdown on a pooch kick, but the Vikings came back with a score on a 79-yard Cordarrelle Patterson score in which he broke free following a reception caught behind the line of scrimmage. Once again, the Ravens should have been able to bring him down, but the defense disappointed. Just when all hope was lost, Joe Flacco hit a big pass to Marlon Brown for 35 yards."

   "comment":"Joe Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore. He played lethargically in 2013 and simply looked done as a result. The Panthers made the right move by getting rid of him based on his performance this past season.    The Panthers, meanwhile, were bludgeoned quite literally. Greg Olsen limped off early, and then DeAngelo Williams followed him. I've always said that the toughest thing NFL coaches have to do is making in-game adjustments to injuries to their high-impact players. The Panthers couldn't do anything once Williams left the field. With Jonathan Stewart also out, Carolina had no choice but to turn to scrubs like Darrin Reaves and Taurean Poole. Reaves couldn't do anything on the ground with his 12 carries for 26 yards, while Poole lost a fumble near midfield in the second half. Cam Newton was also beaten to a pulp. He didn't leave the game until it got out of hand, but he was constantly hit and harassed. His offensive line couldn't do anything to protect him, as Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to Kelvin Benjamin, who caught 5 balls for 76 yards, though most of that came during garbage time in the second half. Benjamin nearly secured a second score, but after replay, the officials ruled that his toe was out of bounds. Benjamin had some drops and was also whistled for an offensive pass interference, which knocked Carolina out of field goal range on what looked like a promising opening drive.    Carolina's defense was equally disappointing, as it surrendered big play after big play throughout the afternoon. The team had major problems tackling, while the defensive interior was easily pushed around by Baltimore's front. The Ravens basically had anything they wanted in the middle, which would explain how Justin Forsett (14-66, TD) and Lorenzo Taliaferro (15-58, TD) combined for 124 yards on the ground. Forsett also logged 3 catches for 31 receiving yards. Taliaferro, meanwhile, racked up his yardage in garbage time. Bernard Pierce was nowhere to be seen despite being probable.    Joe Flacco also had an easy afternoon. He had zero pressure in his face throughout despite Eugene Monroe's absence, allowing him to go 22-of-31 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, 2 of the scores went to Steve Smith. The other was thrown to "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. Antonio Gates (7-83) was worked on early before the Ravens took him away from Will Hill. Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65).

   "comment":"Joe Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.    Of course, the Packers will be favored against all of those teams because of Aaron Rodgers, who was mostly spectacular in this contest. With no pressure in his face for nearly the entire game, he was able to go 24-of-36 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 5 scrambles for 28 rushing yards. There was some complacency in the second half, however. Rodgers wasn't nearly as sharp as he was prior to intermission, completing just 6-of-11 attempts. He missed an open Jordy Nelson for a touchdown (he connected with him, but Nelson had to dive for an inaccurate ball). His teammates seemed to be out of sync as well, as Eddie Lacy dropped a pass, while the special teams didn't have enough players on the field for a punt. As a result, the Packers nearly squandered their 31-7 lead. The Falcons scored 4 touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, ultimately covering the spread.    Lacy gashed the Falcons in the early going. He ripped through Atlanta's poor defense and had 56 yards and a touchdown by halftime. However, he finished with 73 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown, as Atlanta clamped down on the run in the second half - save for a big James Starks gain at the very end. Starks actually outgained Lacy as a result, finishing with 75 yards and a score on 10 attempts, though Lacy had the better fantasy day because he caught 5 balls for 33 receiving yards and a second touchdown.    Rodgers' other scores went to Jordy Nelson, who reeled in 8 of 10 targets for a whopping 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. No other Packer had more than 58 receiving yards, however, with Randall Cobb holding that distinction on 4 catches.    As for the Falcons, I already mentioned Jones' dominance. I have to emphasize how incredible he was. He caught 11 balls for a ridiculous 259 yards and a touchdown. The Packers looked completely clueless trying to stop him, and he would've had a bigger night, but 3 things happened: First, Jones nearly had a second score, but could only get 1 foot inbounds. Second, he was tackled at the 3-yard line on a 79-yard gain. And third, he was knocked out of the game with an injury. He wasn't present on the field for Atlanta's final offensive drive, though the Falcons found the end zone anyway for the dreaded backdoor cover.    Matt Ryan was terrific in the second half. He finished 24-of-39 for 375 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but he was 18-of-25 for 263 yards and a quartet of scores following intermission. His pick was a poor decision, as he threw the ball toward Devin Hester without looking while under pressure. However, he rebounded and nearly led an unbelievable comeback. Though the Falcons lost, their outlook in terms of winning the division is positive because Ryan is performing on a much higher level than Brees.    Excluding Jones, the players who reeled in Ryan's touchdowns were Roddy White (3-42), who barely did anything prior to Jones getting hurt, Harry Douglas (2-11) and Eric Weems.    Steven Jackson, meanwhile, looked functional for the second week in a row. He gained 50 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Most of his yardage came in the first half, but the Falcons had to abandon the run for the most part because they were so far behind. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco was dreadful in the early going. He had so much pressure in his face, thanks to both of his offensive tackles being out, that he just didn't have enough time in the pocket to find his receivers downfield. He was sacked only once, but the Browns brought plenty of heat and forced many errant passes. As a restult, he was 11-of-18 for just 97 yards heading into halftime. Just prior to the break, he was stripped of the football, which bounced backward and took the team out of field-goal range. Flacco wasn't any better in the third quarter, as he was nearly picked in the red zone. However, something finally clicked in the final frame, as he found "

To start the game, Oakland's No. 1 draft pick Amari Cooper dropped 2 passes, but the disappointment over those drops was quickly erased as he went right by cornerback Jimmy Smith and Carr put a post pattern right on the money for Cooper to waltz in for a 68-yard touchdown. That set the tone for an effective pass-first attack for the rest of the game.    Joe Flacco responded at the end of the first quarter with a touchdown pass to second-year tight end Crockett Gilmore, who went on to catch another touchdown, i.e. the Bengals tight end "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco. Flacco didn't look right whatsoever. Some expected him to torch the Jets' miserable secondary, but he couldn't because he obviously wasn't 100 percent. He threw 2 interceptions; 1 pass was telegraphed, while the other was made because he heaved the ball off his back foot, prompting a high pass. Flacco actually seldom stepped into his passes in this contest. His mechanics were horrible, which might be a sign that he wasn't feeling well. Flacco finished 25-of-44 for 248 yards and those 2 picks. It wasn't all on him, as he didn't get much help from both his offensive line and receiving corps, missing stud guard Marshal Yanda and Steve Smith, respectively.    Only 3 Ravens accumulated more than 11 receiving yards: "

Wallace came into the league with the Steelers, so there must have been a little revenge factor for him this week. He ended up with 124 yards on 4 receptions to go along with his 4.h touchdown of the year. On the day, the Ravens totaled just 179 yards on 14 drives, if you take Wallace's huge gainer out of the equation. Baltimore also couldn't run the ball, with "

   "comment":"Joe Flacco interception in the red zone, the Eagles still had 1 more chance to send the game to overtime, but they had to go 59 yards with less than 2 minutes remaining. Considering the Eagles had done nothing offensively for most of the afternoon, that seemed like too tall of a challenge, but Wentz engineered a terrific drive. Zach Ertz helped him by making some great catches, and thanks to a couple of Baltimore defensive penalties, Wentz scrambled into the end zone on a 4-yard run. It appeared as though the game would go to overtime, but the Eagles opted to go for 2. They failed to convert, but it ultimately didn't matter in the grand scheme of things because Philadelphia was already out of playoff contention. The only impact it had was the Browns' draft positioning improving, but Cleveland will likely squander that pick anyway. Wentz had that great drive, but as mentioned, he struggled otherwise. He finished 22-of-42 for 170 yards and an interception to go along with 8 rushing yards and his score on the ground. He was also strip-sacked, but was fortunate that the ball trickled out of bounds. Fierce winds, poor protection and horrible receivers all betrayed Wentz. In fact, the Eagles were down to their fifth-string right tackle, Isaac Seumalo, who is a natural guard. Seumalo got banged up in the game, as he was slow to get up on Wentz's interception.    Ertz was great on the final drive, and he played well overall, catching 6 passes for 80 yards. In fact, Ertz was the only Eagle with more than 30 receiving yards. Jordan Matthews (6-27) was next on the list, while Dorial Green-Beckham and Nelson Agholor caught 1 pass each. Check out the to see which wideouts the Eagles could be targeting in the draft.    Ryan Mathews was pretty much the only healthy running back, so Doug Pederson couldn't play games at the position this week. Mathews ran surprisingly well versus Baltmore's tough defense, gaining 128 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.
