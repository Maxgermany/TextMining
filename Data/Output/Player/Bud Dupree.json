   "comment":"Dupree smacked Moore in the jaw, drawing a roughness penalty. Moore sat out 1 play, as it didn't appear as though he went through concussion protocol, even though he appeared to be out of it upon getting crushed. Moore reentered the game and instantly lost a fumble, his first of 3 turnovers. Moore didn't look like quite himself until late in the game when he engineered a garbage-time touchdown drive. Moore was actually playing well beforehand; he was 10-of-13 for 140 yards by halftime. The turnovers were killers, however. He was strip-sacked by both "
