   "comment":"Bowman to pounce on it for a touchdown. Wells was benched, giving way for an equally ineffective (but more careful) LaRod Stephens-Howling (11-20). Of course, Ryan Lindley's play didn't help. He went 17-of-30 for 141 yards and an interception. He had a second pick that was nullified by a penalty. He was benched after his real interception (returned for a touchdown) in favor of Brian Hoyer, who was added off the waiver wire. Hoyer went 11-of-19 for 105 yards and a telegraphed interception in relief. Hoyer wasn't good or anything, but he looked like a legitimate NFL quarterback (albeit a backup), as he was actually capable of getting the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, who hauled in 8 catches for 111 yards. Fitzgerald hadn't topped the century mark since Week 3 when Arizona beat the Eagles to improve to 3-0. That seems like a million years ago.    Multiple Chicago defenders are worth noting. I already mentioned Bowman. "
