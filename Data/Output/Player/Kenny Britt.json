   "comment":"Kenny Britt coughed the ball up at midfield. Jared Cook also fumbled in the second half; his 2 catches for 6 yards makes you wonder why no team wanted to acquire him at the trade deadline.    Jay Cutler didn't have to do much, but he put together a solid performance. He went 19-of-26 for 229 yards and 3 touchdowns, though it's worth noting that most of his production came when his team was well ahead and several of the Titans seemed to quit. Amazingly though, Cutler was sacked thrice, which makes you wonder how he would have survived had Tennessee not killed itself with stupid mistakes.    All 3 of Cutler's touchdowns went to Brandon Marshall, who had a monstrous afternoon with 9 catches for 122 yards. Only 1 other Bear caught more than 2 passes (Earl Bennett: 4-22).    Matt Forte was set up with a short touchdown thanks to Hester's aforementioned return. He received just 12 carries on the afternoon, but was able to finish with 103 yards and the score.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, finished with 141 yards and a touchdown on just 16 attempts. Those are pretty bogus numbers, however, because he scored on an 80-yard scamper in garbage time. He otherwise would have mustered 61 yards on 15 tries, most notably getting stuffed twice on 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 on the second drive. He also fumbled twice.    Hasselbeck finished 20-of-35 for 194 yards, 1 score (to Nate Washington, 2-35) and the aforementioned pick-six. The stats don't look bad, but Hasselbeck wasn't able to do much until this game was out of hand.    Tennessee's leading receiver was Kenny Britt, who had 5 catches for 67 yards. "

   "comment":"Kenny Britt. Peterson ran the ball back to the house. On the ensuing drive, Davis was strip-sacked. Antonio Cromartie scooped up the ball and sprinted to the end zone this time. Suddenly, the Cardinals' 14-10 deficit transformed into a 31-14 advantage, prompting the FOX announcers to repeatedly call this sequence a Cardinals' avalanche.    Palmer had been enjoying a fairly decent outing before getting knocked out of the game. He went 25-of-36 for 241 yards and an interception, which he telegraphed in the red zone. However, Palmer endured some drops and did a good job of brushing off a potential sack and connecting with Larry Fitzgerald on a scoring drive. Stanton, meanwhile, went 3-of-5 for 85 yards and the touchdown to Brown (5-73, TD), which was a 48-yard bomb that looked like it was going to be overthrown before the rookie secured the ball with a diving catch.    Fitzgerald once again had a strong outing, catching 9 of his 10 targets for 112 yards. As for Michael Floyd, the young wideout once again did nothing (1 catch, 11 yards).    Andre Ellington's numbers were minimal. He couldn't get anything on the ground against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 23 yards on 18 carries. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, he found the end zone once and snagged 5 catches for 19 receiving yards.    Some quick St. Louis stats: - Davis wasn't having a bad game prior to the Cardinals' avalanche. He was 8-of-10 for 110 yards and a touchdown in the opening half, but that's not indicative of his play, as he struggled with pressure. In his defense, no 1 was getting open. Davis finished 17-of-30 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and the pair of interceptions to Peterson. He nearly had a third pick at the very end - it was getting ridiculous at that point - but defensive lineman Ed Stinson dropped the ball. - Tre Mason looked decent. His rushing numbers weren't great - 14 carries, 48 yards - but he was going up against a top-five ground defense. Mason had some nice runs, which bodes well for the future. He also caught 4 balls for 33 receiving yards. He limped off the field at 1 point, but returned shortly afterward. Zac Stacy, meanwhile, didn't have a single touch. - Jared Cook led the team with 84 receiving yards on 2 catches. He had Davis' lone aerial score. Kenny Britt (3-31) struggled to get open.   "

   "comment":"Kenny Britt that would've been a touchdown had it been on the money, and then he was nearly picked off on a pass thrown behind Jared Cook. However, Hill settled in and continuously threw great strikes, finishing 20-of-29 for 220 yards and a touchdown.    The Rams had just 1 receiver who totaled more than 31 receiving yards. That was Britt, who was a monster, securing 4 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown. One of the CBS announcers even exclaimed, The Broncos can't handle Kenny Britt!    Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of this loss for Denver was that its run defense allowed Tre Mason to have a big game."

His forearm was definitely under the ball, yet the incompetent officials somehow overturned it to the surprise of the 2 CBS announcers. I'd say this ended up costing the Rams a victory, but that would be a lie; I'm not sure their inept offense could've achieved another first down after that.

   "comment":"Kenny Britt. Todd Gurley finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then, the Rams went for the ill-fated 2.point conversion that saw a Gurley run stopped. The decision was even more questionable shortly later when Greg Zuerlein drilled a 61-yard field goal. Nick Foles led 2 more field goal drives, and the Rams took a 15-10 lead into the half. After a hot start, the Vikings' offense cooled. Bridgewater threw a deep ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Trumaine Johnson. Some runs by Peterson got Minnesota righted though, and Bridgewater ran in a 6.yard touchdown. He also ran in the 2.point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown. Then, the Vikings lost Bridgewater when he got nailed by a dirty hit from Lamarcus Joyner. Bridgewater was sliding and Joyner dived at his head. That knocked Bridgewater out of the game with concussion-like symptoms. After being held in check for most of the game, Gurley started pounding the Vikings' defense and moved the ball into Minnesota territory. That set up Zuerlein, but a 48-yard field goal attempt went wide right. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, Vikings backup Shaun Hill took a sack for an 11-yard loss. St. Louis timeouts between plays set up the Rams' offense to get the ball back at the Minnesota 39-yard line with a 1:12 to go. A completion and pass interference on Trae Waynes put the ball on the Vikings' 36-yard line. Zuerlein connected on his 53-yarder to force overtime. If the Rams had not gone for 2 in the first quarter, that would have won the game on that kick. In overtime, the Vikings forced a 3.and-out, before Marcus Sherels returned the punt 26 yards to midfield. Peterson did the rest to set up Blair Walsh as he was good on a 40-yarder, and Minnesota won its 4.h straight game.    Teddy Bridgewater was 13-of-21 for 144 yards with an interception. He ran 3 times for 17 yards and a score.    Adrian Peterson ran for 125 yards on 29 carries with a touchdown. Stefon Diggs, meanwhile, was held to 42 yards on 3 receptions, but that led the Vikings through the air.    Nick Foles was 18-of-33 for 168 yards. He had a decent game, but saw steady pressure as the Rams' offensive line was underwhelming.    Todd Gurley had 89 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown, breaking his consecutive streak of 100-yard rushing performances.    Tavon Austin had 8 carries for 66 yards and 4 receptions for 15 yards. Kenny Britt (3-87) was St. Louis' leading receiver. The latter should be ignored in fantasy.    Vikings defensive tackle "

Late in the first quarter, the 49ers got moving with a screen pass to DuJuan Harris for 31 yards.The first play of the second quarter saw Anquan Boldin out-fight Janoris Jenkins to catch a pass and coast into the end zone with a 33-yard score after Jenkins fell down. San Francisco added a field goal and the Rams answered with 1 of their own. The 49ers tried to set up a screen, but Aaron Donald tipped the pass. Eugene Sims picked it off and ran it 42 yards to San Francisco's 4-yard line. Tre Mason then ran the ball into the end zone for the score. The Rams quickly got the ball back, and Benny Cunningham ripped off a 40-yard run. That set up 1 more field goal, and St. Louis took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bruce Ellington got open running deep and Blaine Gabbert hit him for 44 yards. The 49ers settled for another Phil Dawson field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, Case Keenum moved the ball across midfield with a completion to Britt for 18 yards. However, Dontae Johnson blocked a 48-yard field goal to keep the 49ers alive. San Francisco took advantage with a 15-yard pass to Torrey Smith, a roughing the passer penalty, and a 33-yard screen to Quinton Patton. That set up a short field goal for Phil Dawson to mercifully end this game.    Blaine Gabbert was 28-of-44 for 354 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. He didn't play poorly, but he spent most of the afternoon checking the ball down.    DuJuan Harris had a nice game for the 49ers with 67 yards on 16 carries and 86 yards on 8 receptions. Torrey Smith (5-61) and Boldin (5-71-1) led San Francisco's receivers.    Case Keenum was 22-of-37 for 231 yards. Kenny Britt led the St. Louis receivers with 3 catches for 81 yards.

   "comment":"Kenny Britt on what could've been an 80-yard touchdown. Keenum then effectively lost the game with a miserable interception; the game was tied at 10, but he fired an inaccurate ball to Austin, which was tipped by Keenan Robinson and caught by Collins again. The Giants scored shortly later, taking their first and only lead of the contest. Keenum managed to drive deep into New York territory twice after that, but sailed a horrible ball into double coverage, which was picked off. He had another interception, but Brian Quick ran the incorrect route. Keenum, as mentioned, began the game well, but his numbers after his first 10 throws display how bad he was. He was 23-of-43 for 200 yards and 4 interceptions after the first couple of drives (32-of-53, 291 yards, TD, 4 INTs overall), and those numbers even include garbage time on the last couple of possessions. Keenum was even worse than those stats indicate. He was wildly inaccurate, had numerous other picks dropped, showed zero pocket awareness - he ran into multiple sacks - and he constantly threw short of the first-down marker on third down. He is garbage, and he needs to be benched in favor of Jared Goff. There's no point in starting this middling backup anymore.    Austin, despite his mistakes, caught 10 passes for 57 yards and the early touchdown. Quick (4-92) led the Rams in yardage, while Kenny Britt (3-43) predictably disappointed because, well, he's Kenny Britt. To be fair though, Britt should've had an 80-yard score, but Keenum overthrew him.    "

   "comment":"Kenny Britt, meanwhile, snatched 4 balls for 49 yards and a late touchdown.    Speaking of the Britt touchdown, it came under strange circumstances. The Rams were down 10 at the Carolina 10-yard line with about 30 seconds left. They needed a field goal, an onside kick recovery and a touchdown in some order. Considering it was 4.h down, the announcers just assumed that Fisher would summon his kicking unit. Following a timeout, Fisher apparently changed his mind and went for the touchdown. Britt magically caught the ball in the end zone. The touchdown pushed the spread, which made me wonder if Fisher happened to be more concerned with covering/pushing than actually winning the game. I know that may seem strange to say, but there's no logical reason to bypass the field goal at that juncture. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Kenny Britt on a third-and-9 and a 6-yard completion to Britt on a third-and-4. Revis then allowed Britt to come away with a 1.handed catch for a gain of 25. The Rams were able to reach the red zone as a result of this, but squandered their opportunity, failing to get into the end zone despite having a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line. On the following drive, Britt torched Revis on a bomb for a 46-yard completion. It seemed as though this would be the formula the Rams could utilize successfully throughout the afternoon, but they went away from it for some reason. They focused instead on short throws and runs in the second half to milk the clock. It worked, but only because the Jets could do nothing on offense. At any rate, Keenum finished 17-of-30 for only 165 yards with no touchdowns or turnovers, though he was close to being picked off by "
