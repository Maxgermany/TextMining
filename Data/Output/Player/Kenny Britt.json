   "comment":"Britt coughed the ball up at midfield. Jared Cook also fumbled in the second half; his 2 catches for 6 yards makes you wonder why no team wanted to acquire him at the trade deadline.    Jay Cutler didn't have to do much, but he put together a solid performance. He went 19-of-26 for 229 yards and 3 touchdowns, though it's worth noting that most of his production came when his team was well ahead and several of the Titans seemed to quit. Amazingly though, Cutler was sacked thrice, which makes you wonder how he would have survived had Tennessee not killed itself with stupid mistakes.    All 3 of Cutler's touchdowns went to Brandon Marshall, who had a monstrous afternoon with 9 catches for 122 yards. Only 1 other Bear caught more than 2 passes (Earl Bennett: 4-22).    Matt Forte was set up with a short touchdown thanks to Hester's aforementioned return. He received just 12 carries on the afternoon, but was able to finish with 103 yards and the score.    Chris Johnson, meanwhile, finished with 141 yards and a touchdown on just 16 attempts. Those are pretty bogus numbers, however, because he scored on an 80-yard scamper in garbage time. He otherwise would have mustered 61 yards on 15 tries, most notably getting stuffed twice on 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 on the second drive. He also fumbled twice.    Hasselbeck finished 20-of-35 for 194 yards, 1 score (to Nate Washington, 2-35) and the aforementioned pick-six. The stats don't look bad, but Hasselbeck wasn't able to do much until this game was out of hand.    Tennessee's leading receiver was Kenny Britt, who had 5 catches for 67 yards. "

   "comment":"Britt. Peterson ran the ball back to the house. On the ensuing drive, Davis was strip-sacked. Antonio Cromartie scooped up the ball and sprinted to the end zone this time. Suddenly, the Cardinals' 14-10 deficit transformed into a 31-14 advantage, prompting the FOX announcers to repeatedly call this sequence a Cardinals' avalanche.    Palmer had been enjoying a fairly decent outing before getting knocked out of the game. He went 25-of-36 for 241 yards and an interception, which he telegraphed in the red zone. However, Palmer endured some drops and did a good job of brushing off a potential sack and connecting with Larry Fitzgerald on a scoring drive. Stanton, meanwhile, went 3-of-5 for 85 yards and the touchdown to Brown (5-73, TD), which was a 48-yard bomb that looked like it was going to be overthrown before the rookie secured the ball with a diving catch.    Fitzgerald once again had a strong outing, catching 9 of his 10 targets for 112 yards. As for Michael Floyd, the young wideout once again did nothing (1 catch, 11 yards).    Andre Ellington's numbers were minimal. He couldn't get anything on the ground against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 23 yards on 18 carries. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, he found the end zone once and snagged 5 catches for 19 receiving yards.    Some quick St. Louis stats: - Davis wasn't having a bad game prior to the Cardinals' avalanche. He was 8-of-10 for 110 yards and a touchdown in the opening half, but that's not indicative of his play, as he struggled with pressure. In his defense, no 1 was getting open. Davis finished 17-of-30 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and the pair of interceptions to Peterson. He nearly had a third pick at the very end - it was getting ridiculous at that point - but defensive lineman Ed Stinson dropped the ball. - Tre Mason looked decent. His rushing numbers weren't great - 14 carries, 48 yards - but he was going up against a top-five ground defense. Mason had some nice runs, which bodes well for the future. He also caught 4 balls for 33 receiving yards. He limped off the field at 1 point, but returned shortly afterward. Zac Stacy, meanwhile, didn't have a single touch. - Jared Cook led the team with 84 receiving yards on 2 catches. He had Davis' lone aerial score. Kenny Britt (3-31) struggled to get open.   "

   "comment":"Britt, who beat Brandon Flowers. That was brought back by a very questionable penalty on a lineman. Much later, Stedman Bailey made an awesome catch over Shareece Wright in the end zone, but an illegal hands to the face wiped that out. And if that wasn't enough, Tavon Austin took a punt return to the house to give his team the lead with barely any time remaining in regulation, but a very bogus hold nullified that. Jeff Fisher was completely furious, but Carl Cheffers and his crew could do nothing but shrug their shoulders. Despite these blown opportunities, the Rams were still in position to win the game, or at least tie it. Shaun Hill drove the team down to the San Diego 4-yard line, but even though he could have settled for a field goal to send the contest into overtime, Hill forced a poor throw into the end zone that was picked off. The Chargers escaped with their 7.h victory of the season.    Both the officials and Hill spoiled a potential upset. Hill was also responsible for a San Diego touchdown, as he lost a fumble that was returned for a score. He struggled, going 18-of-35 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The Rams would probably be a top-10 NFL team if they had a legitimate quarterback. I still can't get over how ridiculous Hill's pick was. I have no idea what he or offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer were thinking.    As for Hill's counterpart, Philip Rivers misfired on just 6 occasions, going 29-of-35 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick looked like it was going to prove to be costly, as it went 99 yards the other way in the second quarter. Rivers misread the coverage and fired a ball toward Keenan Allen in the end zone. Janoris Jenkins snatched it out of the air and recorded a pick-six. Rivers relied on mostly short throws to move the chains, as Mike McCoy wisely compensated for his offensive line's poor matchup against St. Louis' ferocious defensive front.    Allen also cost his team. He lost a fumble while fighting for extra yardage in the red zone. He made up for it though with 6 catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. Antonio Gates (2-14) had another dud outing.    Ryan Mathews handled most of the workload despite missing 20 minutes of action with a shoulder injury. Mathews burst for 105 yards and a touchdown on only 12 carries. Branden Oliver (6-17) wasn't much of a factor on the ground, though he had some nice gains as a receiver, catching 4 balls for 23 receiving yards.    As for the Rams, Stedman Bailey had a huge performance, catching 7 balls for 89 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had another score wiped out by a penalty, though his touchdown came on the same drive. Still though, Bailey was huge, coming up with clutch grabs on 4.h and third down of that possession. Kenny Britt (2-37) also got screwed over by the officials, as written earlier.    "

One was a botched snap near midfield, while the other was the aforementioned Seattle touchdown that appeared to give the Seahawks a victory. I'm interested to see how Foles plays going forward. A 34-point showing versus Seattle is impressive on the surface, but the Seahawks played terribly defensively. They couldn't generate a pass rush for the most part, and they inexplicably gave up big gains after short throws, primarily to Cunningham. That would explain how Cunningham generated 77 receiving yards on 4 catches (to go along with his 45 rushing yards on 16 carries). On 1 instance, Cunningham picked up a third-and-15 on a screen. The Seahawks from 2014 and before would never have allowed something like that. It's not like they allowed this to Todd Gurley. Cunningham won't even be on the field in a few weeks.    St. Louis' leading receiver was tight end "

Britt is a lethargic bum who can't be counted on, but he was robbed of a key reception at the very end of the game. Britt made a great grab to move the chains on St. Louis' final drive. His forearm was definitely under the ball, yet the incompetent officials somehow overturned it to the surprise of the 2 CBS announcers. I'd say this ended up costing the Rams a victory, but that would be a lie; I'm not sure their inept offense could've achieved another first down after that.    Aside from Britt, only 1 other Ram collected more than 18 receiving yards. That would be "

   "comment":"Britt. Todd Gurley finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then, the Rams went for the ill-fated 2.point conversion that saw a Gurley run stopped. The decision was even more questionable shortly later when Greg Zuerlein drilled a 61-yard field goal. Nick Foles led 2 more field goal drives, and the Rams took a 15-10 lead into the half. After a hot start, the Vikings' offense cooled. Bridgewater threw a deep ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Trumaine Johnson. Some runs by Peterson got Minnesota righted though, and Bridgewater ran in a 6.yard touchdown. He also ran in the 2.point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown. Then, the Vikings lost Bridgewater when he got nailed by a dirty hit from Lamarcus Joyner. Bridgewater was sliding and Joyner dived at his head. That knocked Bridgewater out of the game with concussion-like symptoms. After being held in check for most of the game, Gurley started pounding the Vikings' defense and moved the ball into Minnesota territory. That set up Zuerlein, but a 48-yard field goal attempt went wide right. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, Vikings backup Shaun Hill took a sack for an 11-yard loss. St. Louis timeouts between plays set up the Rams' offense to get the ball back at the Minnesota 39-yard line with a 1:12 to go. A completion and pass interference on Trae Waynes put the ball on the Vikings' 36-yard line. Zuerlein connected on his 53-yarder to force overtime. If the Rams had not gone for 2 in the first quarter, that would have won the game on that kick. In overtime, the Vikings forced a 3.and-out, before Marcus Sherels returned the punt 26 yards to midfield. Peterson did the rest to set up Blair Walsh as he was good on a 40-yarder, and Minnesota won its 4.h straight game.    Teddy Bridgewater was 13-of-21 for 144 yards with an interception. He ran 3 times for 17 yards and a score.    Adrian Peterson ran for 125 yards on 29 carries with a touchdown. Stefon Diggs, meanwhile, was held to 42 yards on 3 receptions, but that led the Vikings through the air.    Nick Foles was 18-of-33 for 168 yards. He had a decent game, but saw steady pressure as the Rams' offensive line was underwhelming.    Todd Gurley had 89 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown, breaking his consecutive streak of 100-yard rushing performances.    Tavon Austin had 8 carries for 66 yards and 4 receptions for 15 yards. Kenny Britt (3-87) was St. Louis' leading receiver. The latter should be ignored in fantasy.    Vikings defensive tackle "

   "comment":"Britt in stride with a 60-yard bomb in the first quarter. He later showed great touch when lofting a pass over a defender's head to Jared Cook for a 17-yard gain. He then managed to complete another deep pass by threading the needle in between 2 defenders. Keenum made just 2 errors in this contest, both of which occurred on the final drive of the opening half. He had a pass that was dropped by a Tampa defender, and then he took a horrible sack to give his team no chance on a third down. However, those were his only blemishes. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the next couple of games. If Keenum puts together a pair of quality performances, the Rams may eschew taking a quarterback in the first round, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    As for Gurley, he had trouble finding room against a tough Tampa Bay run defense. He still performed well for his owners, however, as he generated 48 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He was in position for a second score following a Benny Cunningham kickoff return down to the 2-yard line, but he was stuffed on 3 consecutive plays.    Tavon Austin had a spectacular night. He scored twice; once rushing and once receiving. He compiled 32 rushing yards (4 carries) and 41 receiving yards (3 catches). It actually makes me wonder why he touched the ball just 7 times.    St. Louis' 2 leading receivers were Britt (2-71, TD) and Cook (4-64). It was surprising to see both try hard. They must have been motivated because they didn't want to embarrass themselves on national TV.    Moving on to the Buccaneers, Winston struggled, despite what his numbers may say. Winston went 29-of-50 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Those stats are completely misleading, as Winston was just 6-of-12 for 49 yards at halftime. A large chunk of his yardage, as well as both scores, came in garbage time. Winston was very inaccurate throughout the evening. He sailed passes over his receivers' heads, including "

   "comment":"Britt ran by man coverage for 54 yards to get into San Francisco territory. That set up a St. Louis field goal. Late in the first quarter, the 49ers got moving with a screen pass to DuJuan Harris for 31 yards.The first play of the second quarter saw Anquan Boldin out-fight Janoris Jenkins to catch a pass and coast into the end zone with a 33-yard score after Jenkins fell down. San Francisco added a field goal and the Rams answered with 1 of their own. The 49ers tried to set up a screen, but Aaron Donald tipped the pass. Eugene Sims picked it off and ran it 42 yards to San Francisco's 4-yard line. Tre Mason then ran the ball into the end zone for the score. The Rams quickly got the ball back, and Benny Cunningham ripped off a 40-yard run. That set up 1 more field goal, and St. Louis took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bruce Ellington got open running deep and Blaine Gabbert hit him for 44 yards. The 49ers settled for another Phil Dawson field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, Case Keenum moved the ball across midfield with a completion to Britt for 18 yards. However, "

   "comment":"Britt on what could've been an 80-yard touchdown. Keenum then effectively lost the game with a miserable interception; the game was tied at 10, but he fired an inaccurate ball to Austin, which was tipped by Keenan Robinson and caught by Collins again. The Giants scored shortly later, taking their first and only lead of the contest. Keenum managed to drive deep into New York territory twice after that, but sailed a horrible ball into double coverage, which was picked off. He had another interception, but Brian Quick ran the incorrect route. Keenum, as mentioned, began the game well, but his numbers after his first 10 throws display how bad he was. He was 23-of-43 for 200 yards and 4 interceptions after the first couple of drives (32-of-53, 291 yards, TD, 4 INTs overall), and those numbers even include garbage time on the last couple of possessions. Keenum was even worse than those stats indicate. He was wildly inaccurate, had numerous other picks dropped, showed zero pocket awareness - he ran into multiple sacks - and he constantly threw short of the first-down marker on third down. He is garbage, and he needs to be benched in favor of Jared Goff. There's no point in starting this middling backup anymore.    Austin, despite his mistakes, caught 10 passes for 57 yards and the early touchdown. Quick (4-92) led the Rams in yardage, while Kenny Britt (3-43) predictably disappointed because, well, he's Kenny Britt. To be fair though, Britt should've had an 80-yard score, but Keenum overthrew him.    "

   "comment":"Britt, meanwhile, snatched 4 balls for 49 yards and a late touchdown.    Speaking of the Britt touchdown, it came under strange circumstances. The Rams were down 10 at the Carolina 10-yard line with about 30 seconds left. They needed a field goal, an onside kick recovery and a touchdown in some order. Considering it was 4.h down, the announcers just assumed that Fisher would summon his kicking unit. Following a timeout, Fisher apparently changed his mind and went for the touchdown. Britt magically caught the ball in the end zone. The touchdown pushed the spread, which made me wonder if Fisher happened to be more concerned with covering/pushing than actually winning the game. I know that may seem strange to say, but there's no logical reason to bypass the field goal at that juncture.   "

   "comment":"Britt on a third-and-9 and a 6-yard completion to Britt on a third-and-4. Revis then allowed Britt to come away with a 1.handed catch for a gain of 25. The Rams were able to reach the red zone as a result of this, but squandered their opportunity, failing to get into the end zone despite having a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line. On the following drive, Britt torched Revis on a bomb for a 46-yard completion. It seemed as though this would be the formula the Rams could utilize successfully throughout the afternoon, but they went away from it for some reason. They focused instead on short throws and runs in the second half to milk the clock. It worked, but only because the Jets could do nothing on offense. At any rate, Keenum finished 17-of-30 for only 165 yards with no touchdowns or turnovers, though he was close to being picked off by "

   "comment":"Britt. Goff did a number of positive things in his debut, including a conversion on a third-and-10 in which he found his target for a first down after avoiding the pass rush. Goff later spun out of a sack and picked up some yardage to move his team into field goal range. Goff had a nice pick-up on the ground a bit later, but his 10-yard scramble was negated by a Greg Robinson hold. There were plenty of negatives, however. Goff was nearly picked in the first quarter, and on the same drive, he held on to the ball too long and took a sack on a third-and-4. Goff later fired a poor pass to Todd Gurley, who was double covered, and then missed Lance Kendricks on a low throw. At the very end of the game, Goff showed absolutely no urgency. Starting around his own 40-yard line, Goff threw just a 7.yard pass in the middle of the field and then walked to the line of scrimmage despite there being about just 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Jeff Fisher had to bail out his rookie quarterback with a timeout. After 2 incompletions that weren't even close, Goff attempted a Hail Mary on the final snap, but threw the ball into the end zone before any of his teammates could get there. Goff finished 17-of-31 for only 134 yards. I'd give him a C for this performance. He did some good things, and the heavy rain prevented him from completing anything downfield. However, he had accuracy issues at times, and the lack of both awareness and urgency was alarming. I don't understand how any NFL quarterback can throw a short pass over the middle and then walk to the line of scrimmage when there's less than half a minute remaining in regulation.    As for the Dolphins, I still have no idea how they won this game. They literally did nothing all afternoon. Of their first 11 offensive drives, 10 resulted in a punt, while the other finished with a Ryan Tannehill interception. However, following a Greg Zuelein missed field goal without 5 minutes remaining, the Dolphins inexplicably caught fire. Ryan Tannehill led 2 touchdown drives with the help of some horrible Los Angeles penalties, including a ridiculous Aaron Donald helmet-to-helmet cheap shot. Tannehill's second score was to DeVante Parker, which was the decisive touchdown. Tannehill finished 24-of-34 or 172 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which was a deep shot into the end zone from midfield. Tannehill, despite the 10 incompletions, had a very rough afternoon. He threw some ugly passes and easily could've been picked off 3 times. Unfortunately for the Rams, T.J. McDonald and Mark Barron were guilty of drops. McDonald's bobble ruined what would've been the easiest interception of his career, as the pass sailed right to him. Tannehill also took 4 sacks, but was hit hard on so many occasions that it's a minor miracle that he survived the game without sustaining an injury.    Tannehill's touchdowns went to Parker (8-79) and Jarvis Landry (5-28). Parker was a monster down the stretch, while Landry suffered an injury on the final drive.    Jay Ajayi posted 77 yards on 16 carries despite missing 2 of his best offensive linemen. However, that's misleading because most of Ajayi's yardage came on 1 36-yard burst. Ajayi couldn't find any room otherwise against Los Angeles' stout front.    Ajayi just barely outgained Todd Gurley, who tallied 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. As with Ajayi, a big chunk of Gurley's yardage came on 1 attempt, a 24-yarder that happened to be a first-quarter touchdown. The Dolphins stacked the line of scrimmage, much like every other team this year, daring the Los Angeles quarterback to beat them. Goff, like Case Keenum, couldn't get the job done to open up some running room for his stud running back.    No Ram accumulated more than 50 receiving yards. Britt led the way with 5 grabs for 43 yards, though he did draw a pass-interference flag on third down near midfield. Kendricks was next (4-38), but he lost a fumble in his own territory when "

   "comment":"Britt. Donald then forced Brees into an intentional-grounding penalty, putting the Saints into a third-and-15. The Rams, who were winning at the time, had a ton of momentum, but it quickly vanished when a pass interference bailed New Orleans out. Ever since that play, the Saints were unstoppable on offense. They ripped through Los Angeles' defense with ease, thanks to poor tackling and even worse play-calling by Gregg Williams. The Saints' former coordinator was absolutely bewildered at times. He had no sense for what the Saints were trying to do, getting caught with his pants down on some trick plays. He also called a completely senseless blitz on a third-and-long, allowing Brees to score a touchdown to Mark Ingram on a simple dump-off pass.    Brees finished a nearly flawless 28-of-36 for 310 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Again, he was guilty of 2 early mistakes, but he recovered and was completely unstoppable after that. He misfired on just 3 occasions after halftime!    Two of Brees' 4 aerial touchdowns went to Michael Thomas, who reeled in 9 of his 10 targets for 108 yards. Thomas was a monster, as he was able to rebound off of 2 poor performances. The dynamic rookie made only 1 mistake on the afternoon, failing to run out of bounds in the 2-minute drill, which negated a scoring opportunity. Brees, meanwhile, didn't throw at all to Brandin Cooks. He was definitely on the field a bunch, but he inexplicably didn't see a single target. It's impossible to criticize this, however, as the Saints scored 49 points. Brees' other scores were thrown to Mark Ingram and Brandon Coleman. Tim Hightower also scored on a reception, a 50-yarder, but that was thrown by Willie Snead. Hightower was wide open, as it was 1 of Gregg Williams' many blunders of the afternoon.    Speaking of the running backs, Ingram performed brilliantly. He burst for a 61-yard rush to open the third quarter and later scored a touchdown when Williams foolishly called an all-out blitz. Ingram gained a whopping 146 yards on the ground and 2 total touchdowns on just 14 carries. Hightower (15-51) saw most of his workload in garbage time.    Moving on to the Rams, they had some unexpected offensive success in the early going, as Jared Goff torched the Rams on the opening drive. Delvin Breaux tripped on a completion to Kenny Britt, and then Tavon Austin torched B."

DeShone Kizer took a 15-yard sack when the ball was snapped over his head, and he didn't think quickly enough to throw it out of bounds after collecting it. Pacman Jones then had a 40-yard punt return to set up a touchdown. The Browns proceeded to move the chains after that, but a pair of drops ended the drive. Britt's drop turned into an interception because the ball popped into the air, and that set up another Cincinnati score. "
