   "comment":"Josh Sitton) and best corner (Tracy Porter) all to injury by the middle of the third quarter. The Bears were up when these injuries began taking place, so I have to imagine that they may have won. Instead, the Giants have become quite possibly the worst 7-3 team of all time.    The Giants are 7-3, but came close to a let-down loss against Chicago. The Bears outplayed New York in the first half as the Giants were flat, but in the second half of the game, New York's defense pitched a shutout to keep the Giants in prime position for a wild-card slot. The Bears (2-8) are already out of the playoff race, so losing maintains their draft position.    The Bears struck first early in the first quarter as they moved down the field before Jay Cutler threw a beautiful 19-yard pass to Zach Miller. New York quickly responded with an 11-yard run from Paul Perkins (4-16), a completion to Odell Beckham Jr., and a 4.h-down conversion to Sterling Shepard (5-50-1). To finish the drive, Rashad Jennings had a short touchdown run. The score was tied at 6. as both Connor Barth and Robbie Gould missed the extra points. Cutler threw another great pass to lead Miller down the seam for a gain of 34 yards, and that set up a 40-yard field goal for Barth. Chicago kept moving the ball with Jordan Howard running the ball well on New York and Jeremy Langford (6-8-1) plunging into the end zone from a yard out. Another 4.h-down conversion helped the Giants cross Chicago's 30-yard line, but New York settled for a field goal after the Bears' Adrian Amos dropped an interception. The Bears took a 16-9 lead into the half, but suffered a huge loss with Miller leaving the game due to an injury. The Giants took the opening possession of the second half down the field, and Manning threw a short touchdown pass to tight end Will Tye (2-12-1). New York got in position to take the lead as Victor Cruz (1-48) got behind the coverage for his only reception. To finish the drive, Shepard got wide open down the seam for a 15-yard score. Gould missed the extra point again. Late in the third, Cutler made a great play, escaping a sack and hitting Cameron Meredith (4-49) to convert a third down. A screen to Jordan Howard then moved the ball into New York territory. Barth, however, missed a long field goal. The Giants' defense did a good job of stopping Chicago on a few drives. Late in the 4.h quarter, Cutler made some great plays and threw some dimes to move the ball into New York territory, but Landon Collins intercepted Cutler to clinch the win for the Giants.    Manning completed 21-of-36 for 227 yards and 2 scores with zero interceptions. Beckham saw tons of double coverage and totaled 46 yards on 5 catches.    Rashad Jennings ran for 85 yards on 21 carries with a score.    Cutler played very well even though the numbers don't clearly indicate it. He completed 17-of-30 for 252 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception.    Jordan Howard ran for 77 yards on 17 carries. Meanwhile, Zach Miller (3-61-1) led the Bears in receiving even though he only played half the game.    Defensively, Landon Collins continued his breakout year with 6 tackles and an interception. Jason Pierre-Paul was superb as he notched 2.5 sacks, 5 tackles and 1 forced fumble. Olivier Vernon, Johnathan Hankins and Snacks Harrison overwhelmed Chicago's offensive line. Part of the reason was Bears guard Josh Sitton being carted off the field with an injury. "

   "comment":"Josh Sitton came out late with a malady of his own. They are the 2 best linemen on the team, and the offense can ill afford to lose them.    For the Buccaneers, this was an excellent way to start off their season. After missing Week 1 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Bucs' offense looked like they hadn't missed a beat. Jameis Winston was sharp in his first start of the season. The third-year quarterback showed off his strong arm and was very accurate for a majority of the contest. He was under pressure at times due to the mediocre play of left tackle "
