  "comment":"Josh Sitton came out late with a malady of his own. They are the 2 best linemen on the team, and the offense can ill afford to lose them.    For the Buccaneers, this was an excellent way to start off their season. After missing Week 1 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Bucs' offense looked like they hadn't missed a beat. Jameis Winston was sharp in his first start of the season. The third-year quarterback showed off his strong arm and was very accurate for a majority of the contest. He was under pressure at times due to the mediocre play of left tackle ",
