   "comment":"Maxwell suffered an injury. Sherman was flagged for a penalty on 1 occasion, but it was a bogus call. Terrance Williams (2-70) led the team in receiving.    As for Murray, he became only the second player in NFL history to open a game with 6 consecutive 100-yard rushing performances. The first was Jim Brown. Murray bulldozed a stalwart Seattle front, gaining 115 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. He didn't lose a fumble officially, but the ball fell out of his hands in the first half. Luckily for him, it trickled out of bounds.    Romo's scores went to his tight ends: Jason Witten (2-24) and Gavin Escobar. The latter touchdown came right after Maxwell dropped a potential Romo pick-six early on, which would've made the score 17-0. Romo was also charged with a lost fumble much later, but that was the center's fault, as it was a botched snap on a silent count.    Wilson, meanwhile, completed just half of his passes, going 14-of-28 for 126 yards and an interception, which came very late on an overthrow. He salvaged his fantasy day with 12 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground, but he had a miserable performance overall. Wilson and the rest of the team simply looked unprepared. The Seahawks were penalized 9 times, and many of the infractions were very sloppy, such as flags for 12 men on the field. The Seahawks also uncharacteristically burned through their timeouts in the second half, which they desperately needed in crunch time.    Lynch, as mentioned, didn't get much work. He was given just 10 carries, but ran well when given the opportunity. He managed 61 yards on his limited attempts.    "

   "comment":"Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Jason Peters in the first half. Peters was carted off the field with a back injury, and losing him could be a huge blow to the Eagles' offense.    Ryan Mathews led the Eagles with 97 yards on 6 carries and a touchdown. DeMarco Murray had 65 yards on 18 carries.    Tight end Zach Ertz led Philadelphia's receivers with 5 catches for 63 yards. Jordan Matthews (3-14), Darren Sproles (5-31) and Miles Austin (4-52) were contained by Carolina's tough defense.    The Panthers' defense got another excellent game out of defensive tackle Kawann Short. For the second-straight week, Short recorded 2 sacks and caused a lot of disruption in the backfield. Jared Allen also had 2 sacks, including a clutch 1 late in the 4.h quarter. Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Josh Norman all had excellent games for Carolina. Philadelphia's defense received good games from Malcolm Jenkins, Byron Maxwell and Mychal Kendricks."
