   "comment":"Lang was carted into the locker room. This is the second straight week that Rodgers has been rushed heavily, so this has to be a concern for the team going forward.    Jones and Montgomery, who had the 2 scores, led the team in receiving yardage. The former caught 2 balls for 77 yards, while Montgomery snared 4 balls for 59 yards. If you want to own Montgomery, that's fine, but keep in mind that he was 4.h on the team in targets despite his output. He saw just 5 balls go his way, and if you take away the 31-yard score, his final numbers would've been 3 receptions for 28 yards. I'm not going to add him to my fantasy roster.    "

   "comment":"Lang suffered a more gruesome injury near the end. Lang was carted off and covered up his face so no 1 could see his tears. Lang was set to hit free agency this offseason, so it's a shame that he incurred a serious leg issue just a month-and-a-half prior to his contract expiring. Lang was third in our NFL Free Agent Guard Rankings. A couple of other things to note about Rodgers: His pick shouldn't be held against him, as he launched a ball up for grabs on third-and-21 from deep in his own end zone. It effectively was a 55-yard punt. Besides, the interception should've never happened because the officials missed a blatant defensive hold on "
