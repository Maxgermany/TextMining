   "comment":"T.J. Lang, but it wasn't all on the offensive line. On several occasions, Rodgers simply held on to the ball too long. Don't get me wrong; the front-line blockers were horrible, but they don't deserve all the blame.    Rodgers otherwise played well, going 26-of-41 for 287 yards and 3 touchdowns. Most of his yardage went to his 2 receivers. "
