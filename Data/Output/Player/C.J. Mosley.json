   "comment":"C.J. Mosley doesn't fumble on his pick-six attempt, the Ravens probably win this game. Instead, the Redskins went down the field and were able to prevail. When I re-wathced the 2015 season to prepare for this year, I marveled at how many games were truly 50-50 that were swung by a play like Mosley's fumble.       This Beltway Battle meets once every 4 years, so the Redskins will have bragging rights until 2020. Washington won its third-straight game to overcome the 0-2 start to the season. Baltimore started the game well, but the Redskins' defense was excellent, pitching a shut out in the second half to protect the win for Washington.    The Ravens got rolling on the opening drive as Terrance West ripped a run of 35 yards to get inside the Redskins' red zone. A pass to Mike Wallace moved the ball to the 7-yard line, and the next play saw Flacco hit Crockett Gilmore (4-28) for a touchdown. The Redskins got on the scoreboard as Jamison Crowder ripped off an 85-yard punt return for a score, but Washington missed the extra point. Baltimore soon added a field-goal drive, with the big playing being a 26-yard pass interference on linebacker Will Compton. The Ravens were set up for more points when Zach Orr caused and recovered a fumble from Matt Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the 4.h quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over "

Speaking of Brown, he was quiet for most of the evening, but came up big on the final drive. He managed to convert 10 of his 11 targets for 96 yards and a touchdown.
