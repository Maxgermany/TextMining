   "comment":"Davis. Easier said than done, apparently. Given their lacking effort, especially on defense, it's a shame that the Chargers are rewarded with a playoff berth. They should be ashamed of how inept they were when it came to stopping Kansas City's second-string offense. It was ridiculous that Daniel was able to go 21-of-30 for 200 yards and a touchdown along with 59 rushing yards on the ground. Daniel actually looked very similar to Alex Smith, constantly throwing short passes and scampering for decent gains on the ground. Despite this style of attack, San Diego simply couldn't get off the field. Kansas City actually had the yardage lead heading into the final quarter of regulation.    The Chargers' offense, meanwhile, had some poor moments. Philip Rivers forced an interception early on, as someone named Ron Parker came up with the pick. There were too many 3.and-outs, and some drops didn't help. Rivers, however, got his act together in the final 2 frames, ultimately finishing 22-of-33 for 229 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Of course, the Chargers were very fortunate to score at the very end because they converted a fake punt on a sketchy spot. Not only was the play unmeasured; it also wasn't reviewed because the Chiefs appeared to recover a fumble returned for what seemed to be a game-winning score. Play just continued on, as the inept officiating crew didn't seem to realize what happened. Another poor call came on a Ryan Succop missed 41-yard field goal at the end of regulation. The Chargers were actually lined up illegally and should have been whistled for a 5.yard penalty. Succop would've had a chance at a 36-yarder to win the game. Steeler fans have to be pissed,    Rivers' 3 scores went to Antonio Gates (4-31), Ladarius Green and Eddie Royal (3-34), who had a big drop. Keenan Allen led the team in receiving with 5 grabs for 89 yards.    The Chargers at least ran the ball well, as Ryan Mathews rushed for 144 yards on 24 carries. Danny Woodhead didn't get nearly as much work on the ground (5-18), but he chipped in with 7 catches for 42 receiving yards.    Some Kansas City notes/stats: - Daniel had a chance to lead the team to victory or at least tie the game in overtime, but pulled a Greg McElroy when he fired a 4.h-down pass 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.  - Daniel's lone touchdown went to Dexter McCluster (6-62). - A.J. Jenkins paced the Chiefs in receiving yardage. He tallied 67 yards on 3 catches. - Knile Davis, who had an ugly fumble last week, redeemed himself with 2 touchdowns on the ground while gashing San Diego's porous defense for 81 yards on 27 carries. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

It's amazing how unfortunate the Rams have been. They've had injury issues to their linemen for years. They've missed Sam Bradford over the past couple of seasons. Chris Long has been out this year.

West looked slow and sluggish, and he was stopped on a 4.h-down run in the red zone when Sharrif Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    "
