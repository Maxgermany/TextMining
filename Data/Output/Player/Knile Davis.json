   "comment":"Knile Davis. Easier said than done, apparently. Given their lacking effort, especially on defense, it's a shame that the Chargers are rewarded with a playoff berth. They should be ashamed of how inept they were when it came to stopping Kansas City's second-string offense. It was ridiculous that Daniel was able to go 21-of-30 for 200 yards and a touchdown along with 59 rushing yards on the ground. Daniel actually looked very similar to Alex Smith, constantly throwing short passes and scampering for decent gains on the ground. Despite this style of attack, San Diego simply couldn't get off the field. Kansas City actually had the yardage lead heading into the final quarter of regulation.    The Chargers' offense, meanwhile, had some poor moments. Philip Rivers forced an interception early on, as someone named Ron Parker came up with the pick. There were too many 3.and-outs, and some drops didn't help. Rivers, however, got his act together in the final 2 frames, ultimately finishing 22-of-33 for 229 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Of course, the Chargers were very fortunate to score at the very end because they converted a fake punt on a sketchy spot. Not only was the play unmeasured; it also wasn't reviewed because the Chiefs appeared to recover a fumble returned for what seemed to be a game-winning score. Play just continued on, as the inept officiating crew didn't seem to realize what happened. Another poor call came on a Ryan Succop missed 41-yard field goal at the end of regulation. The Chargers were actually lined up illegally and should have been whistled for a 5.yard penalty. Succop would've had a chance at a 36-yarder to win the game. Steeler fans have to be pissed,    Rivers' 3 scores went to Antonio Gates (4-31), Ladarius Green and Eddie Royal (3-34), who had a big drop. Keenan Allen led the team in receiving with 5 grabs for 89 yards.    The Chargers at least ran the ball well, as Ryan Mathews rushed for 144 yards on 24 carries. Danny Woodhead didn't get nearly as much work on the ground (5-18), but he chipped in with 7 catches for 42 receiving yards.    Some Kansas City notes/stats: - Daniel had a chance to lead the team to victory or at least tie the game in overtime, but pulled a Greg McElroy when he fired a 4.h-down pass 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.  - Daniel's lone touchdown went to Dexter McCluster (6-62). - A.J. Jenkins paced the Chiefs in receiving yardage. He tallied 67 yards on 3 catches. - Knile Davis, who had an ugly fumble last week, redeemed himself with 2 touchdowns on the ground while gashing San Diego's porous defense for 81 yards on 27 carries. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Knile Davis punched the ball into the end zone on a 21-yard run. An Alex Smith 26-yard pass to Joe McKnight and some runs by Davis set up a short dump-off pass from Smith to Travis Kelce (3-36), and the big tight end rumbled into the end zone from 20 yards out. Tannehill then led a drive inside the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but because of the clock, the Dolphins settled for a 22-yard field goal to get on the board for a 14-3 score at the half. In the third quarter, the Chiefs allowed their 4.h sack of the afternoon as Jared Odrick stripped Smith of the ball, which was recovered by Derrick Shelby. That set up the Dolphins at the Kansas City 20-yard line. A few plays later, Tannehill hit Brian Hartline (3-25) for a 1-yard touchdown pass. The Chiefs answered with a pretty drive. Smith and Davis had good runs with McKnight making 2 big catches, including an 11-yard touchdown. After some ugly plays earlier in the game, Jarvis Landry redeemed himself with a 73-yard kickoff return. Caleb Sturgis then drilled a 51-yard field goal after Miami couldn't move the ball. Randy Starks and Jelani Jenkins combined to sack Smith for a safety, but after that, it was all Kansas City. The Chiefs' defense held up thanks to some sacks of Tannehill, and Frankie Hammond had a 47-yard punt return. Davis ran it down Miami's throat, and McKnight caught another short touchdown. After Kansas City's defense had a great series, Knile Davis fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Brent Grimes."

   "comment":"Knile Davis took the opening kickoff of the second half 99 yards for a touchdown. It completely broke open a game in which Kansas City had outgained St. Louis by just 17 yards until that point.    The Chiefs were able to ice this game following the kickoff return with Alex Smith's precision passing and some long Jamaal Charles gains. Smith misfired just 4 times, going 24-of-28 for 226 yards. He struggled with pressure early - his offensive line couldn't deal with Robert Quinn's great pressure - but the Chiefs made the appropriate second-half adjustments. It also helped that the Rams displayed very poor tackling after halftime and couldn't maintain possession on offense because of their injury woes. Smith did a good job of spreading the ball around, as a quintet of Chiefs had 4 or more targets, yet none of them saw more than 6. Dwayne Bowe (6-64) and Travis Kelce (4-45) led the way.    Charles, meanwhile, mustered 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 13 carries to go along with 4 catches and 44 receiving yards. Most of his production came in the second half, as he messed up early with a lost fumble on a handoff. This didn't hurt the Chiefs, however, as the Rams whiffed on that aforementioned field goal. Knile Davis (16-49) also scored, though that occurred in garbage time.   "
