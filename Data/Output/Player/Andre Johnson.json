   "comment":"Andre Johnson who screwed up early on. Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands. The Texans recovered and were able to establish a 20-10 lead at halftime, but now there's a different question: Can they win with T.J. Yates? Leinart suffered a broken collarbone just prior to intermission. He finished 10-of-13 for 57 yards and a touchdown. Leinart was used in many bootlegs and tossed mostly checkdowns. The offense was just really limited with him. A penalty forced them into a 1st-and-20 at some point, and it was evident that they didn't stand a chance to convert the first down. Not that it matters though because Leinart is likely out for the year. Yates looked great on his first drive in the 2-minute drill, but was dreadful after the break. Finishing 8-of-15 for 70 yards, Yates converted only 1 first down in the second half. With Houston unable to run the ball, the team just hung on for its life. Fortunately for them, the Jaguars were so inept on offense that it didn't matter.    Blaine Gabbert was so bad in this contest that he was benched in favor of Luke McCown. Gabbert went 13-of-29 for 136 yards and an interception that looked like a punt. Once again, he had major issues with pocket awareness. He also has a terrible habit of not looking downfield amid a pass rush, and shows terrible body language when things aren't going well (which is often the case). Gabbert's inaccuracy doesn't help matters. It was so bad that the CBS announcers made fun of him. After a poor pass, the color analyst (I think it was Rich Gannon) said: You have throw the ball to the receiver; not close to the receiver. Gabbert actually should have thrown a touchdown, but Marcedes Lewis had a really bad drop. This was actually hilarious because a minute earlier, the CBS announcers were pleading for Gabbert to go to Lewis more often.    The Jaguars were able to stay competitive because of Maurice Jones-Drew, who rushed for 99 yards on 18 carries. He also paced the team in receptions (4) and receiving yards (67) because many of Gabbert's completions were checkdowns.    Speaking of checkdowns, Arian Foster hauled in 7 balls for 24 yards to go along with his mediocre rushing numbers (22-65, TD). Andre Johnson, meanwhile, had just 2 receptions for 22 yards because his quarterbacks couldn't get him the football. His first catch came with 2 minutes to go in the third quarter.    As for Houston's defense, Wade Phillips' unit compiled 7 sacks. Four of those came from Johnson who screwed up early on. Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands.

   "comment":"Andre Johnson on an impressive 50-yard completion and did a good job moving the chains, converting 9-of-18 third downs. Yates had a lost fumble in the first quarter, but I thought it was a terrible call by the officials, as it was clear to me that the rookie quarterback's arm was moving forward with the ball in hand.

It's worth noting that Yates was just 2-of-7 for 34 yards in the second half, as the coaching staff understandably didn't really trust him. Of course, with a dynamic running game (Arian Foster: 31-111, TD) at his disposal, why would Gary Kubiak air it out with a rookie signal-caller?    This was a really gutsy win by the Texans.

Yates wasn't the only player giving the ball up. Jacoby Jones made 1 of the dumbest plays in NFL history when he picked up a bouncing punt amid traffic. He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy. He was understandably dejected afterward, and Foster looked even more frustrated. You have to feel for the Texans, who would probably be the Super Bowl favorites if Matt Schaub were still healthy.

   "comment":"Andre Johnson (7-97). Minnesota made an extra effort to shut down Schaub's tight ends.    Johnson to 26 yards.    Ponder's lone touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (3-39). Jarius Wright was the team's leading receiver; he had 5 receptions for 53 yards.    As for the Texans, Matt Schaub just looked completely lost without a running game, which is the main concern for this team. If they battle an opponent in the playoffs that is capable of shutting down Foster, will they be able to move the chains consistently? They certainly weren't able to do that in this contest, as Schaub went 18-of-32 for 178 yards.    The only Houston player with more than 3 catches and 27 receiving yards was Andre Johnson (7-97). Minnesota made an extra effort to shut down Schaub's tight ends.    "

The unit is giving up 11.6 points per contest on the season and still hasn't allowed more than 16 points to any team. Their 35 sacks lead the league.

But then, all of the energy left the stadium. As the teams were walking off the field and into the locker room for intermission, Gary Kubiak collapsed. He got down on 1 knee and then fell to the ground. He had his eyes closed the entire time. He was carted off into an ambulance, which took him to the hospital. The Texans ruled out a heart attack and told the media that Kubiak was coherently talking to people, so that's a great sign. Unfortunately, Houston never recovered on the field. The Texans didn't seem to have the same pace without their play-caller. Keenum, who was hot in the first half - 9-of-17, 208 yards, 3 touchdowns - cooled off following intermission. He was 11-of-17 after halftime, but for a lower YPA (142 yards). He also nearly turned the ball over a couple times. The defense, meanwhile, struggled as Wade Phillips had to take over as the acting head coach. Andrew Luck had way more success downfield, torching Houston's secondary with multiple deep bombs to T.Y. Hilton. The second-year wideout had 7 catches for 121 yards and 3 touchdowns. Most of his production came after halftime, as he let his team down with a first-half drop on third down that would've moved the chains.    Luck, meanwhile, finished 18-of-40 for 271 yards and the 3 scores to Hilton. He was woeful in the first half - he completed just 3 passes - as he had issues getting anything out of the slot position. Pass protection was also an issue; he took 4 sacks and had to scramble around to avoid other hits. There was 1 sequence in which he took consecutive sacks and nearly lost a fumble in the process. He later took a sack in the red zone and then was hit as he threw on the following play. However, things really opened up for him following intermission, with Phillips focusing on managing the game, as mentioned.    Houston's quarterback actually had the superior statistical performance. Keenum's final numbers were 20-of-34 for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cris Collinsworth remarked that Keenum reminded him of Tony Romo - an undrafted quarterback with a quick release, a 10.ency to take shots downfield and some scrambling ability (3 scrambles, 26 rushing yards). Even though the Texans lost and their season is over, the silver lining is that they may just have something with Keenum.    Andre Johnson has to be thrilled with Keenum. Whereas Matt Schaub was scared to take shots downfield, Keenum had no concerns airing it out. Johnson, who didn't score a touchdown all year going into this contest, hauled in 3 touchdowns in addition to 9 catches for 229 yards. However, Johnson couldn't come up with an important third-down catch in the 4.h quarter, as he bobbled the ball out of bounds along the sideline. Instead of the chains being moved, Houston had to punt, ultimately leading to Indianapolis' decisive touchdown.    Johnson. The crowd was fired up.

The pass was beautiful, as Patrick Peterson, who had great coverage on Johnson, couldn't do anything about it. Keenum ultimately went 15-of-26 for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half. Things were looking promising for Keenum, who helped the Texans outscore the Cardinals, 17-7, after the initial strip-six. However, things fell apart for him after intermission. Arizona's defense made some great adjustments and sent some creative blitzes Keenum's way. Keenum, perhaps due to inexperience, couldn't handle Arizona's blitzes. He was sacked only 3 times - 1 of which was for a 22-yard loss - but that's not indicative of the pressure he was under in the second half. Keenum, who went just 7-of-17 for 42 yards and a score following the break, was lucky to get away with what should have been a couple of interceptions. He also launched a couple of deep balls that sailed out of bounds on his final possession.    The Texans were able to hang around despite Keenum's second-half struggles because of poor Arizona coaching. The defense did a great job, but I have no idea what Bruce Arians was doing at times. Arians did a great job early on of setting up weird screens for his tight ends, which is something the Texans couldn't handle. But Arians' obsession with giving the ball to "

Going up against a dreadful secondary, Keenum went 18-of-34 for 169 yards and an interception that was really Keshawn Martin's fault. However, Keenum took another 1 of his trademark horrible sacks, losing a ridiculous 19 yards on 1 take-down. He was also extremely inaccurate throughout the entire afternoon.    Some noteworthy stats: - Chad Henne went 23-of-32 for 239 yards. A big chunk of his yardage came early on when he hit Ace Sanders (4-61) for a gain of 51. - Cecil Shorts logged 8 catches for 71 yards. He nearly scored a touchdown in the opening quarter, but was brought down inches short of the goal line as he was falling out of bounds. The CBS announcers actually thought Shorts scored and urged Gus Bradley to challenge the call, but they were wrong. - Andre Johnson was a disappointment, catching just 2 passes for 36 yards. "

   "comment":"Andre Johnson (5-58) both had marginal outings for their fantasy owners. Excluding Foster, they were the only players to see more than 2 targets.    It's a short trip, but I was impressed by the Texans' fans, who made the trip to Dallas. They made their presence known throughout the afternoon, as Bloooo was heard every time Johnson on a big third-and-8 near midfield in the second quarter. However, Fitzpatrick was actually near-perfect in the second half; in fact, he didn't throw a post-halftime incompletion until there was 2:30 remaining in regulation. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-25 for 154 yards and the pick. He was nearly intercepted late in the end zone, and he couldn't get the team moving in overtime. The Texans, as you can imagine, ran their offense through Arian Foster, who looked much healthier this week. He gained 157 yards and 2 touchdowns on 23 carries. He dominated 1 drive single-handedly, bursting for a big gain and then making a nice cut, juking Barry Church, and running into the end zone.    DeAndre Hopkins (6-63) and Andre Johnson (5-58) both had marginal outings for their fantasy owners. Excluding Foster, they were the only players to see more than 2 targets.

Clay Harbor dropped a long reception downfield, but landed a penalty via a late hit from D.J. Swearninger. On the Jaguars' next drive, Marqise Lee (5-67) made a great leaping catch over A.J.

He also had a few picks dropped. Bortles really struggled in the second half, and the rush seemed to get in his head as his accuracy fell part.    Once again, J.J. Watt was dominant. The Jaguars' offensive tackles, Luke Joeckel and Sam Young, were completely overwhelmed by the league's best player.

After a 3.and-out by the Jaguars, the Texans drove for a field goal to ice the game.    Foster carried the Texans with 127 yards on 24 carries and 2 receptions for 21 yards. Fitzpatrick was 13-of-19 for 135 yards and 19 rushing with a score. DeAndre Hopkins had 49 yards on 4 catches.    Bortles finished 20-of-39 for 205 yards with a touchdown and interception. He also had a few picks dropped. Bortles really struggled in the second half, and the rush seemed to get in his head as his accuracy fell part.    Once again, J.J. Watt was dominant. The Jaguars' offensive tackles, Luke Joeckel and Sam Young, were completely overwhelmed by the league's best player. Watt had 3 sacks and another tackle for a loss, batted down a pass on a third down and drew 2 holding penalties.    The other No. 99 in this game played well. The Jaguars' Sen'Derrick Marks had 1.5 sacks and 2 tackles for a loss.    Andre Johnson took a vicious hit from Telvin Smith in the second quarter that popped Johnson's helmet off."

Not only did I lose 3 units on it, but I had to sit through the inept duo of Matt Millen and Walt Coleman. Millen didn't call anyone a 100-percent USDA Man, or anything like that, but he sounded like he wanted to have some kielbasa antics with Greg Manusky. Coleman, meanwhile, offered up this gem: The ruling on the field stands. The pass is complete. The pass has been ruled incomplete. It was amusing to see the fans in the stands look so completely confused. Later, Coleman called the Buccaneers for leaping on an Indianapolis field goal. The Colts were awarded a first down and ultimately found the end zone. However, this never should've been called. A frustrated Mike Pereira sighed, It's certainly not leaping... Coleman is incompetent and corrupt, and he shouldn't be refereeing in the NFL anymore. Sadly, however, he wasn't even 1 of the 2 worst officials on the field Sunday. Stay tuned for notes on those guys.   "

Houston's offense finally did something positive with a 41-yard run from Blue, but Bill O'Brien made a very questionable decision to have Nick Novak attempt a 57-yard field goal that wasn't even close. Before the half, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates moved the ball into Colts' territory, but went down with a knee injury that ended his day. Weeden finished the drive with a few completions to get inside the 5-yard line before having to settle for a field goal. The Colts took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bernardrick McKinney sacked Hasselbeck at the 1-yard line on a third down, and that set up the Texans to start a drive at the Colts' 32-yard line. Penalties on Houston's inept tight ends killed some nice plays, and Houston settled for a 47-yard field goal from Novak. After going 25 straight drives without a touchdown, the Texans started at their 11-yard line, and Weeden moved down the field with passes to Hopkins. Houston converted a 4.h-and-1 with Blue, and had a pass interference on Dwight Lowery move the ball to inside the 20-yard line. To end the drive, Weeden hit Jaelen Strong on the run for an 8-yard touchdown and a 13-10 Houston lead. After trading punts, the Colts got the ball back at midfield with 3 minutes remaining. Hasselbeck completed a pass to Griff Whalen, but Johnathan Joseph knocked the ball loose and Kareem Jackson returned the fumble 34 yards to Indianapolis' 21-yard line. That set up a short field goal for Novak to give the Texans a 16-10 lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Hasselbeck throw a ball up for grabs down the middle of the field, and A.J.

The Vikings had some issues with Marcus Mariota in the first half, but made the appropriate adjustments at intermission and limited him to 12-of-20, 125 yards, 1 touchdown, an interception and a fumble after the break. Mariota looked great early on, as he appeared to be on his way to a big afternoon after going 13-of-21 for 146 yards and a touchdown in the opening half.

Cox needed that, as he struggled throughout the afternoon.    Ansah was 1 of 2 primary Detroit players to leave the game. The other was Ameer Abdullah, whose presence was missed. The Lions struggled to move the ball without him, as Theo Riddick (11-37) was far less effective than Abdullah (6-38). Riddick also caught 4 balls for 28 yards.    With no Abdullah, Matthew Stafford struggled in the second half, going 11-of-21 for 96 yards and a pick following intermission. Overall, he finished 22-of-40 for 260 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Stafford should've posted better numbers, but he had 2 touchdowns wiped out by penalties, and some of his receivers dropped passes. There's also some cause for concern, as Stafford was limping around at the end when he took a hit from Jurrell Casey.    Stafford's sole score went to Anquan Boldin (4-48), who had another touchdown wiped out by a hold. Marvin Jones led the team in receiving, catching 8 passes for 118 yards. His longest gain, a 47-yarder, should've been a short haul to force a punt, but Cox whiffed on a tackle. Golden Tate (2-13) barely did anything despite seeing 9 targets. He dropped a pass, albeit because of a big hit by Sean Spence.    As for the victors, Mariota was clutch at the very end and was solid overall, though he didn't begin well. He was nearly picked on a sloppy throw, and he was only moving the chains because the Lions were giving him free yards with their dumb penalties. Mariota eventually threw a pick when he forced a pass into double coverage, but he was sharp in the second half. Going 15-of-19 for 157 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission, Mariota finished 25-of-33 for 238 yards, 2 scores and a pick overall. He didn't run very much (2-11), but 1 of his scrambles was important, as it moved the chains.    DeMarco Murray was a big reason the Titans moved the ball so effectively. He was effective both as a runner and a passer, gaining 89 rushing yards (12 carries) and 56 through the air (7 catches). Derrick Henry was mixed in but wasn't as effective, managing only 40 yards on 9 attempts.    While Johnson had the game-winning score, Delanie Walker was the more impactful player to catch a Mariota touchdown, snatching 6 balls for 83 yards."
