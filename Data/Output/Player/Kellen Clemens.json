OK, so the Bears' defense didn't exactly surrender 42 points. One early touchdown happened because Matt Forte lost a fumble inside his own 10-yard line. Another occurred on a Josh McCown strip-six in desperation time. Still, Chicago surrendered 406 net yards of offense to the Rams. Even with all of the injuries, this should not happen. The Bears fell behind early, thanks to a Tavon Austin 65-yard fake reverse and the aforementioned Forte turnover. This allowed the Rams to lean heavily on the run, which is 1 area Chicago's defense fails miserably. Zac Stacy rumbled for 87 yards and a touchdown on just 12 carries, but left early because of a concussion. Benny Cunningham stepped in and was able to pick up where Stacy left off; Cunningham gained 109 yards and a score on 13 attempts.    St. Louis didn't have to ask Clemens to do much.

Bobby Rainey (20-37) ran the ball into the end zone from a couple of yards out. St. Louis came back with a methodical drive that was aided by some Tampa Bay penalties. The Rams then tied the game at 7 when Zac Stacy (33-104) dove into the end zone from a yard out. Alec Ogletree stripped the ball away from Rainey on the next drive. Following the sudden change, St. Louis dialed up an awesome double-reverse to Stedman Bailey (3-44), who bolted down the field for a 27-yard touchdown run. The Rams should have scored more often, but had ball-security issues. On a third-and-goal, Kellen Clemens fumbled the ball away on a quarterback draw.
