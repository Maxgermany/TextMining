Right tackle Jason Smith (sprained ankle) and corner Ronald Bartell (stinger) were also hurt, but the big blow was to Sam Bradford, who suffered a finger injury in the 4.h quarter. The Rams are fearful that Bradford may have suffered nerve damage, and Steve Spagnuolo went on to say, I'll be praying all night.    As far as the Rams beating themselves, the score of this game isn't nearly as indicative of how these 2 teams played. St. Louis easily could have held the lead going into the 4.h quarter, but continuously shot itself in the foot with mistakes: - The Eagles scored their second touchdown on a fumble return. Late in the first quarter, Bradford stumbled trying to get the ball to his running back. He lost control of the ball, which was returned 56 yards by Juqua Thomas-Parker. - Rookie tight end Lance Kendricks had 2 huge drops, including 1 that would have set the Rams up with a first-and-goal at the 5-yard line. - Brandon Gibson dropped a potential first down in the second quarter. - Amendola dropped a first-down conversion in the third quarter. - "

   "comment":"Amendola. Bradford a nightmare of an afternoon. He went 18-of-35 for 152 yards and 2 interceptions. He took a whopping 6 sacks behind an offensive line ravaged by injuries. Bradford was able to successfully dink and dunk against a poor Washington defense last week, but that doesn't work versus elite units like Chicago's. It's worth noting though that he was betrayed by his pedestrian receivers, who dropped several passes.    The Rams couldn't move the chains whatsoever. In a pathetic effort, they had just 20 yards of total offense just prior to the 2.minute warning of the first half. In addition to being unable to advance the ball aerially, they also struggled on the ground. Steven Jackson gained only 29 yards on 11 carries. He was on and off the field because of his knee injury. In fact, it looked like he would be pulled after 3 carries. He stood on the sideline with an enormous ice pack on his knee, but he reentered the contest. You have to admire Jackson's courage to play through pain, but it was really a stupid idea. Jackson should have taken the time to heal; instead, his football arrogance hurt his team because it kept a healthy Daryl Richardson, a better option considering the circumstances, on the sideline.    The only St. Louis receiver to accumulate more than 20 receiving yards was Amendola, who had 5 catches for 66 yards. Second-round rookie Brian Quick wasn't even active. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

In fact, it wasn't even the only 1 that eliminated a play by Amendola that almost resulted in a touchdown. An illegal block above the waste negated an Amendola punt return to the San Francisco 2-yard line. St. Louis had some stupid penalties, like a delay-of-game on a 3rd-and-2 on a good-looking drive.

But Brady proved everyone wrong in vintage fashion, hitting his receivers with strikes of 23, 15, 6, 9 and 17 yards, with the latter being a touchdown to Kenbrell Thompkins. Brady had his ups and downs in this performance. In terms of positives, Brady led that game-winning drive and also engineered many other scoring possessions. He was mostly responsible for picking up 26 first downs. Despite suffering through several drops, many of which were from Aaron Dobson (6-63), Brady went 25-of-43 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The negatives include that pick, which was an extremely careless throw into double coverage, as well as a poor overthrow of Danny Amendola for what should've been an 83-yard touchdown.

   "comment":"Amendola. Two of those plays featured awful calls by the officiating crew. The Patriots appeared to touch the football before it went 10 yards on the onside kick. The play was reviewed, but was strangely not overturned. The pass interference was way more egregious. McFadden barely touched Boyce. The infraction was obviously huge, as it set up New England at the 1-yard line. The key point is that the Patriots shouldn't have needed this miraculous comeback in the first place, but they played like complete crap early on. Brady, who was just 7-of-19 for 95 yards in the opening half, suffered from a whopping 5 drops, including 2 by Edelman. Brady also had a pick prior to intermission, as he forced it into double coverage. New England would ultimately come back, but it came at a price. Rob Gronkowski went down awkwardly in the third quarter and then was carted into the locker room. It was later speculated that Gronkowski tore his ACL, which is obviously a huge blow for New England's offense.    Brady ultimately finished 32-of-52 for 418 yards, 2 touchdowns, the pick and a lost fumble. As mentioned, his scores went to Edelman (6-64) and Amendola (4-36). Brady's primary weapon was "

The play was made by Michael Thomas, who was just signed off San Francisco's practice squad. Thomas also happened to be the player who pick off Brady to seal the victory.    Brady targeted Julian Edelman and Amendola relentlessly, as you might expect him to with Gronkowski, Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins all out.

That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain. A few more short throws moved the ball to the Jets' 6-yard line before the drive stalled and ended in another field goal. The Jets finally put together a nice drive after falling dormant in the middle of the game. They methodically moved the ball down the field before Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center "

   "comment":"Amendola, all of whom are key members of their roster. There's no such thing as a Pyrrhic loss, but perhaps they'll have to invent that term for what transpired in this contest. New England's second-worst fears occurred late in the game when a Denver defensive back collided with Rob Gronkowski's knees. Gronkowski was rolling around on the ground, writhing in pain. He was carted off, rendering New England's offense completely threat-less. The only thing that would've been worse would've been an injury to Brady. Fortunately for the Patriots, Adam Schefter is reporting that the injury isn't serious. Gronkowski will still undergo more tests, so he's not out of the woods yet, but it's sounding like he avoided a ligament tear.    The Gronkowski injury was the prominent storyline. If he hadn't gotten hurt, everyone would be talking about all of the bogus calls at the end of the game. I bet on the Broncos, but I'll even admit that the Patriots were hosed on several occasions. It began when a holding penalty negated a 51-yard Tom Brady pass to an open Keshawn Martin. Gronkowski was then called for a very ticky-tack offensive pass interference, wiping out a significant gain. Later on, when the Broncos were in the red zone, Brock Osweiler took a sack from Alan Branch, who destroyed his center, but Denver was given new life on a defensive hold. It was more blatant than what happened to the Titans, as the New England defender actually touched Demaryius Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the 4.h horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a 4.h timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell."

   "comment":"Amendola, was taken back the other way for a 99-yard touchdown. It was the first time the Eagles had ever intercepted Brady. Even when Brady had time to throw, he couldn't locate any open receivers. No 1 could get open, save for Amendola on occasion, and even Amendola screwed up sometimes; he dropped 2 passes, including a potential touchdown. Brady had so many miscommunications with his other wideouts, who also dropped balls. In fact, New England's failed, final offensive drive featured a whopping 3 drops. However, despite all of these issues, Brady still posted a strong fantasy stat line, going 29-of-56 for 312 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 interceptions. Most of this came in garbage time, though 2 of his scores occurred in the early going when New England established a 14-0 lead that quickly vanished. It should be noted that Brady also caught a 36-yard pass from Amendola on a trick play, but an interception was thrown right afterward.    Brady's 3 touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Amendola for what would have been a long, first-down completion. Instead, the rookie overshot him. Brissett just could not help the team move the ball. The Patriots had numerous 3.and-outs in the first half, and did not convert on any of the 5 third downs they faced before the break. He also tried to do too much in the red zone during the contest. Brissett nearly threw a pick once, and on another occasion, he tried to scramble for a first down. There was no chance of making the marker, but instead of sliding, he ran straight into a tackle. Brissett fumbled as a result and cost the Patriots some points. In short, he looked like a rookie today, making a lot of mistakes. It seems like his thumb was not fully healthy.    Because of Brissett's troubles, New England's receiving corps was unable to do much today. "

   "comment":"Amendola and Julian Edelman wide open on 1 side of the field. No defender was within 10 yards of either of them. Edelman would have had the touchdown had it not been for the penalty. Later, the Bills made the mistake of somehow putting Nickell Robey-Coleman on Rob Gronkowski. Coleman is a 5-foot-8 slot corner, while Gronkowski is a 6-foot-6 monster. The big tight end easily beat Coleman for a 53-yard touchdown. It was the easiest throw that Brady made all day long. Of all the corners on the field on Sunday, the worst may have been Stephon Gilmore. He was terrible in this game. Something must be wrong with him. Gilmore was torched repeatedly by the Patriots, and he allowed a 53-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    "

Surprisingly, the 49ers answered with a field goal drive thanks to a 26-yard pass to Shaun Draughn on a wheel route and an 11-yard run by Carlos Hyde. New England quickly tacked on another touchdown as LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5.yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the 4.h quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.

Amendola, however, was concussed. He has 10 days to clear concussion protocol, but it's a reminder of how utterly fragile Amendola is. I think the Patriots are going to regret not keeping preseason stud Austin Carr, as he could slot right in for Amendola. Perhaps Hogan will do that; Hogan snared just 1 of his 5 targets for only 8 yards.    I haven't gotten to Brady yet. His stat line was very uncharacteristic, as he went 16-of-36 for 267 yards.
