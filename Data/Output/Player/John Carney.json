Sure enough, Brees convinced Payton to go for it during the stoppage, and Brees managed to sneak it in to make the game 24-10. A dumb mistake, but not a big deal with getting 6.5 points. At least that's what I thought at the time. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Chad Henne threw an ugly interception to Darren Sharper. Sharper returned it 42 yards and was signaled in for a touchdown by official John Parry. However, Sharper CLEARLY fumbled before he reached the end zone. It wasn't even close. It should have been overturned into a touchback. Instead, Parry, who obviously had money on the Saints, called it a touchdown. A Dolphins field goal (off a Brees fumble) and a Saints touchdown later, the score was 27-24. However, I was relieved to see Henne complete a 67-yard strike to Brian Hartline, setting up Ricky Williams for a 4-yard touchdown. With Miami up 34-24 and taking 6.5, I thought my bet was safe. Nope. In a span of 5 minutes, Brees led the Saints on 2 touchdown drives. Fortunately, John Carney missed an extra point, so a later field goal made it a 6-point game. With 3:23 remaining, my +6.5 5-unit play was still safe. Down 6. Henne drove the Dolphins to their 41.
