   "comment":"Kaeding's game-winning 52-yard field goal.    Chad Ochocinco planned on wearing Chris Henry's No. 15 jersey, but decided against it because he didn't want to cause a distraction. However, Ochocinco scored a touchdown in the second quarter. He had no crazy celebration planned; instead, he looked toward the sky, knelt down and prayed. A classy move by Ochocinco.    "

   "comment":"Kaeding for a second. The Chargers were guilty of numerous mental errors early on, from botched snaps, to fumbles (3) to Philip Rivers interceptions (2) to poor third-down conversions (4-of-13; 1-of-6 in the first half). San Diego, like Indianapolis on Saturday night, looked completely out of synch after taking numerous weeks off. But unlike the Ravens, the Jets didn't debaclize themselves with careless fumbles and dumb penalties, and give the game away.    And now for Kaeding: If I were coach of the Chargers, I wouldn't have tried any field goals longer than 20 yards with him. I'm not kidding. The camera panned to Kaeding in the first half, and he looked like he was going to vomit. Either he had the Ebola virus, or was in an Aurora Snow-type choke mode. Maybe both. Kaeding missed kicks from 36, 57 and 40. Unless you're a Chargers fan, the most humorous aspect of this were the changes people made to Kaeding's Wikipedia page after the contest was over. I'll have those in my <b> </b>.    It's a shame that San Diego's once-promising season has to end like this; the Chargers actually outgained the Jets, 344-262, but were simply plagued by all of those errors and missed field goals. New York didn't even get its initial first down until 7 minutes into the second quarter. Having said that, the Jets deserve a lot of credit for sticking to their game plan. Even though they fell behind early, they kept on running the ball with "
