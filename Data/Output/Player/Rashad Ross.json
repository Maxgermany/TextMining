   "comment":"Rashad Ross.    Moore, meanwhile, was 33-of-48 for 435 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but don't be fooled by those numbers. With Washington's first-stringers on the field, Moore was just 6-of-10 for 55 yards anda pick. Moore did a great job of picking up garbage time in meaningless action to perhaps keep his NFL career alive.    "
