   "comment":"Wheaton. Roethlisberger followed that up by throwing way behind Justin Brown on a third down, which would've been a big play because Brown was wide open. The Steelers had multiple chances to get back into the game in the second half, but committed way too many personal foul penalties. One was bogus, but the infractions allowed the Ravens to register touchdowns, allowing them to put this contest away. The scores were to Owen Daniels, who was wide open on both occasions, thanks to blown coverages. You'd think Pittsburgh would've learned the second time, but its defense is so anemic that it can't really do anything correctly. The nail in the coffin was a Heath Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated. Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with Bernard Pierce and Justin Forsett in the first half, but Pierce ended up with way more carries. Pierce gained 96 yards on 22 attempts, while Forsett managed 56 yards on just 8 tries. Most of Forsett's yardage came on 1 41-yard burst when the game was out of hand. Forsett appeared to land in the end zone, but was ruled inches short. John Harbaugh considered challenging, but opted against it. Forsett was a bigger factor in the passing game - 4 catches, 16 receiving yards - but it was disappointing to see Pierce utilized much more. It should be noted that Pierce (1 catch, 7 rec. yards) also dropped a pass.    As for the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 22-of-37 for 217 yards and a garbage-time interception off a tip by Haloti Ngata. The Ravens were able to put considerable pressure on him, which was a bit of a surprise because Andy Dalton was hit only once last week. It's not nearly all Roethlisberger's fault, but the Steelers have just 9 points in their previous 6 quarters. That's just awful. Roethlisberger targeted Antonio Brown more than anyone despite the fact that the speedy wideout missed about a quarter of action. Brown hauled in 7 balls for 90 yards. Wheaton (5-38) and Miller (4-35) also contributed.    The only Steeler offensive player who played a great full game was "

This wasn't the first time the Steelers squandered a scoring opportunity, as they opted to run with LeGarrette Blount on third-and-goal at the 3-yard line, which was absolutely insane. Why give the ball to a backup on such an important down? The mistakes and poor play-calling continued, as Pittsburgh opted to throw a deep pass toward Wheton on a third-and-1, down 14-3, which sailed out of bounds. Lance Moore then followed that up with a dropped third-and-17 conversion. There was also an epic failure of a red zone trip in the 4.h quarter. Kelvin Beanchum kicked things off with a personal foul at the Cleveland 1-yard line. Wheaton dropped a pass, which was followed by Roethlisberger completely missing an open Wheaton with no pressure on his face. On 4.h down, a Roethlisberger-to-Wheaton attempt fell incomplete because Wheaton wasn't even looking for the football.    Roethlisberger had an awful afternoon, going 21-of-42 for 228 yards, 1 touchdown (in garbage time to Moore) and an interception, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Much of his yardage came in meaningless action. Roethlisberger has awful chemistry issues with all of his receivers not named "

Green Bay scored 21 points off Glennon's turnovers, which was exactly the margin of victory. Glennon gave this game away. Any other coach would've turned to Mitchell Trubisky. Most would've done so before this game. John Fox, however, is completely incompetent and is incapable of making logical decisions. He's coaching like it's 1995, and he believes he can win with just a running game. Trubisky would give the Bears some hope, despite the poor receiving corps, while Glennon isn't even a good fit for the offense, as Tony Romo repeatedly pointed out. Glennon finished 21-of-32 for 218 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. The Bears have extra time until their Monday Night Football affair, so they can prepare Trubisky to start. If Fox decides to keep Glennon as his quarterback, the Bears should part ways with him.    You'd think the Bears would've tried to establish the dynamic "
