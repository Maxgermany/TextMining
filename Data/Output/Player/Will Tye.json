Beckham, on the other hand, snatched 6 balls for 149 yards and a touchdown, as he had the luxury of battling the Jets, who didn't have Darrelle Revis available. Beckham's afternoon was highlighted by a 72-yard catch-and-run score. However, as mentioned, he had some mistakes in overtime. He also dropped a touchdown as a result of a fierce Calvin Pryor hit.    Excluding Beckham and Tye, only 2 Giants had multiple receptions: Rueben Randle (2-22) and Shane Vereen (2-7)."
