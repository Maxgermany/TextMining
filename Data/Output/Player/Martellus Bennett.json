Cutler finished 32-of-46 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and a late interception when he underthrew his receiver in the end zone. Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

One of the picks was tipped, but Hundley simply didn't look like he should be an NFL starter. He didn't even appear as though he was ready to play at all, as he was flagged for a delay of game on a third down during his first full drive. Green Bay had to waste a timeout, only to see Hundley get picked off immediately afterward. Perhaps the Packers can do a good job of preparing him with a whole week of practice, but the early returns aren't promising.    With Rodgers gone, the Packer receivers had their stats suppressed.
