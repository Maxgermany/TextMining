Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Gronkowski missed a bit of action with what appeared to be a concussion, but he was able to return to action and was ultimately targeted on the final real play of the game.    Brady's fantasy owners weren't pleased because their quarterback didn't throw any touchdowns. LeGarrette Blount had all the scores, plunging into the end zone 3 times.

   "comment":"Bennett, he was hit and landed awkwardly on his shoulder. He was carted into the locker room minutes later, and even though he was listed as questionable to return, he didn't make it back to the field. It was later ruled that Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone, and he'll miss most or all of the season as a result. Check my for more. Adding more injuries to injury, the Packers also saw David Bakhtiari, Bryan Bulaga and Lane Taylor leave the game with various injuries. Bulaga was concussed. Brett Hundley quarterbacked the Packers the rest of the way, and Green Bay didn't stand much of a chance with him. Hundley barely completed half of his passes, going 18-of-33 for only 157 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One of the picks was tipped, but Hundley simply didn't look like he should be an NFL starter. He didn't even appear as though he was ready to play at all, as he was flagged for a delay of game on a third down during his first full drive. Green Bay had to waste a timeout, only to see Hundley get picked off immediately afterward. Perhaps the Packers can do a good job of preparing him with a whole week of practice, but the early returns aren't promising.    With Rodgers gone, the Packer receivers had their stats suppressed. Jordy Nelson led the team with 6 catches for only 60 yards. Davante Adams (5-54) caught Hundley's only touchdown. Randall Cobb (3-28) and Martellus Bennett (2-22) might be droppable in fantasy.    The Packers made the mistake of starting an injured "
