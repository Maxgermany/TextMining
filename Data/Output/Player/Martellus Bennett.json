   "comment":"Martellus Bennett (7-37) secured Cutler's 4.h touchdown. Cutler went 23-of-34 for 176 yards and the 4 scores. He had major issues early on - he was 10-of-20 for just 54 yards in the opening half and had 3 passes that could have easily been picked - but he caught fire after taking a brutal hit to the sternum just prior to halftime. Cris Collinsworth actually thought Cutler would have to sit out the rest of the game.    The Bears came into this game determined to run it frequently. They couldn't do so whatsoever. "

The Bears held on the play, granting Green Bay with a first-and-goal opportunity. Rodgers took advantage with a touchdown on the very next snap. That put the Packers up 21, icing the second victory for them. Cutler had a miserable second half, going 7-of-13 for 83 yards and the 2 picks following intermission. He had a third potential interception that was dropped. Green Bay's defensive improvement after halftime was inexplicable, though Cutler melting down had something to do with it.    Rodgers, meanwhile, was brilliant throughout. He backed up his message about relaxing despite the team's 1-2 start by going 22-of-28 for 302 yards and 4 touchdowns.

Forte had the aforementioned receiving stats on top of his rushing numbers, which were 71 yards on 18 attempts. Forte had just 7 carries in the second half because his team was behind by 2 scores most of the time.   "

Chancellor stripped the ball away, and it set up Seattle's game-winning touchdown. Gronkowski, meanwhile, also appeared to fumble, but replay review showed that his bionic commando arm was down. Gronkowski missed a bit of action with what appeared to be a concussion, but he was able to return to action and was ultimately targeted on the final real play of the game.    Brady's fantasy owners weren't pleased because their quarterback didn't throw any touchdowns. LeGarrette Blount had all the scores, plunging into the end zone 3 times. He finished with 69 yards on 21 carries, while "

   "comment":"Martellus Bennett, he was hit and landed awkwardly on his shoulder. He was carted into the locker room minutes later, and even though he was listed as questionable to return, he didn't make it back to the field. It was later ruled that Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone, and he'll miss most or all of the season as a result. Check my for more. Adding more injuries to injury, the Packers also saw David Bakhtiari, Bryan Bulaga and Lane Taylor leave the game with various injuries. Bulaga was concussed. Brett Hundley quarterbacked the Packers the rest of the way, and Green Bay didn't stand much of a chance with him. Hundley barely completed half of his passes, going 18-of-33 for only 157 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One of the picks was tipped, but Hundley simply didn't look like he should be an NFL starter. He didn't even appear as though he was ready to play at all, as he was flagged for a delay of game on a third down during his first full drive. Green Bay had to waste a timeout, only to see Hundley get picked off immediately afterward. Perhaps the Packers can do a good job of preparing him with a whole week of practice, but the early returns aren't promising.    With Rodgers gone, the Packer receivers had their stats suppressed. Jordy Nelson led the team with 6 catches for only 60 yards. Davante Adams (5-54) caught Hundley's only touchdown. Randall Cobb (3-28) and Martellus Bennett (2-22) might be droppable in fantasy.    The Packers made the mistake of starting an injured "
