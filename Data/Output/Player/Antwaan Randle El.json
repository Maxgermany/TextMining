   "comment":"El picked it up in garbage time, snatching 7 catches for 73 yards. Santana Moss chipped in with 37 yards and a touchdown on 5 receptions.    Jason Campbell was pretty brutal. He completed his first pass with 1 minute remaining in the second quarter! He finished 15-of-27 for 133 yards and a score, giving him a discouraging YPA of 4.9. He did his best impression of Trent Green, often throwing short on third downs. However, 1 could argue that Campbell would have been responsible for a couple of interceptions if he went deep. Looks like it's going to take Campbell much longer to learn the West Coast offense than optimistic Redskins fans had hoped.    The Giants won, but I wasn't too convinced by their victory. They jumped out on the Redskins early with a 16-0 lead, but stalled multiple times at midfield afterward. Following a hot start, Eli Manning was errant on many of his passes. He had a pick, but he could have easily thrown 3.    "

   "comment":"Eleven points? How does a team score 11 points? I'll tell you how - completely inept coaching. The Browns were down 14-3 late in the 4.h quarter. As Bill Simmons would write, any 17-year-old Madden geek could tell you that they needed 2 scores: a field goal and a touchdown plus 2. Well, Cleveland was faced with a 4.h-on-three on Washington's 3-yard line with 5:58 remaining in regulation. Instead of going for a field goal and drawing the score to within 8. the Browns went for it. Derek Anderson's pass to Braylon Edwards fell incomplete. Three minutes later, the Browns scored a touchdown and converted the 2-point try, which would explain the 14-11 score. As time was expiring, Cleveland lined up for an improbable 54-yard field goal. If Cleveland tried the aforementioned kick, Phil Dawson's long attempt would have been a potential game-winner; not a tying try. Apparently, Romeo Crennel didn't want to go into overtime; I guess he was late for his .    Anyway, it should be no surprise that Anderson's pass failed. Anderson reverted to pre-Giants game form; he was 3-of-14 for 17 yards at halftime. Anderson finished a woeful 14-of-37 for 136 yards and a touchdown. Braylon Edwards caught 4 balls for 58 yards, while Kellen Winslow Jr. managed just 2 receptions.    While Cleveland scored 11, it's surprising that Washington didn't tally more than 14 points, given that Clinton Portis registered 175 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries.    Jason Campbell was somewhat efficient and pretty unspectacular, going 14-of-23 for 164 yards and a touchdown. Santana Moss, Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley each caught 4 passes."

   "comment":"Eli Manning's passes. My response was that the receiver position is a vastly overrated 1. The Giants win games in the trenches. As it turns out, Manning indeed does have wideouts to throw to. Steve Smith caught 6 balls for 80 yards. Mario Manningham, meanwhile, caught 3 balls for 58 yards and a touchdown. First-round rookie Hakeem Nicks hauled in 2 passes for 18 yards. Unfortunately, Nicks sprained his foot and left the game in the 4.h quarter. While it looked really serious and nearly caused Troy Aikman to have an aneurysm, it turns out the injury could only keep Nicks out for 2-3 weeks.    While Smith and Manningham stepped up, Domenik Hixon was nowhere to be found. Hixon caught only 1 ball for 10 yards.    On NBC's recap show, Tiki Barber said the Giants are now a pass-first team. I had a good laugh. New York will continue to rely heavily on Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw. Jacobs had 46 yards on 16 carries, while Bradshaw mustered 60 yards on 12 attempts.    So much for Ladell Betts stealing Clinton Portis' touches. Portis had 62 yards on 16 rushes against a very tough Giants defense. Betts, meanwhile, had only 3 touches.    Jason Campbell was 19-of-26 for 211 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Those numbers look solid, but a chunk of his yardage and his touchdown came in garbage time on a back-door scoring drive. Jim Zorn showed very little confidence in Campbell, taking the ball out of his hands on a few key occasions.    Santana Moss had just 2 catches for 6 yards, while Antwaan Randle El had 7 grabs for 98 yards. With Giants defenders in his face, Campbell had to resort to shorter stuff, which would explain Randle El's numbers. "
