   "comment":"El picked it up in garbage time, snatching 7 catches for 73 yards. Santana Moss chipped in with 37 yards and a touchdown on 5 receptions.    Jason Campbell was pretty brutal. He completed his first pass with 1 minute remaining in the second quarter! He finished 15-of-27 for 133 yards and a score, giving him a discouraging YPA of 4.9. He did his best impression of Trent Green, often throwing short on third downs. However, 1 could argue that Campbell would have been responsible for a couple of interceptions if he went deep. Looks like it's going to take Campbell much longer to learn the West Coast offense than optimistic Redskins fans had hoped.    The Giants won, but I wasn't too convinced by their victory. They jumped out on the Redskins early with a 16-0 lead, but stalled multiple times at midfield afterward. Following a hot start, Eli Manning was errant on many of his passes. He had a pick, but he could have easily thrown 3.    "

As Bill Simmons would write, any 17-year-old Madden geek could tell you that they needed 2 scores: a field goal and a touchdown plus 2. Well, Cleveland was faced with a 4.h-on-three on Washington's 3-yard line with 5:58 remaining in regulation. Instead of going for a field goal and drawing the score to within 8. the Browns went for it. Derek Anderson's pass to Braylon Edwards fell incomplete. Three minutes later, the Browns scored a touchdown and converted the 2-point try, which would explain the 14-11 score. As time was expiring, Cleveland lined up for an improbable 54-yard field goal. If Cleveland tried the aforementioned kick, Phil Dawson's long attempt would have been a potential game-winner; not a tying try. Apparently, Romeo Crennel didn't want to go into overtime; I guess he was late for his Cookie Break.    Anyway, it should be no surprise that Anderson's pass failed. Anderson reverted to pre-Giants game form; he was 3-of-14 for 17 yards at halftime. Anderson finished a woeful 14-of-37 for 136 yards and a touchdown. Braylon Edwards caught 4 balls for 58 yards, while Kellen Winslow Jr. managed just 2 receptions.
