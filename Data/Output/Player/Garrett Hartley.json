He converted, and the Packers ended up scoring on the drive.    Both quarterbacks were amazing in this game. "

   "comment":"Hartley whiffed on 2 field goals, while Drew Brees was whistled for a pair of false starts in the red zone. Those penalties were so bizarre; all Brees was trying to do was audible, yet the officials flagged him on consecutive plays. It was so suspicious that I assumed the game was fixed (Hartley's 2 misses factored into my conspiracy theory), but the Saints ultimately got their act together, establishing a double-digit lead and never looking back.    Drew Brees was amazing in this victory. He let the ball hit the ground on just 8 occasions, going 26-of-34 for 332 yards and a whopping 5 touchdowns. This type of outing was remarkable, considering he was under heavy pressure throughout the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - 1.5 from "

   "comment":"Hartley finished the drive by hitting a chip shot. The Saints got the ball back and moved to tie the game. The play of the game happened when Brooks had a sack-fumble on Brees that was recovered by the 49ers, but a roughing-the-passer was called on Brooks to take the turnover away. It was a questionable call, but that is the 2013 NFL. Brees connected with Colston to set up a game-tying 42-yard field goal for Hartley. "
