He was lucky to retain possession, but only temporarily, because he gave away a turnover when there was a botched snap.    Wilson still came away with the victory though, and that's all that will matter during the playoff push. Wilson went 20-of-32 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick that wasn't his fault. Wilson missed several open targets, but picked up some decent chunks on the ground, gaining 35 rushing yards on 6 scrambles.    Wilson's sole score ended up going to Willson, which won the game. "

   "comment":"Willson for an 80-yard touchdown when this game was still in doubt. Wilson's touchdown run can be seen on <i>SportsCenter</i>; the reigning Super Bowl champion quarterback stiff-armed Alex Okafor, juked Antonio Cromartie and then sprinted into the end zone. It looked like something out of a movie.    Marshawn Lynch, meanwhile, didn't see a single touch in the first quarter. He had a stomach bug and ran out of the locker room with a stocking cap on after the first play. However, he grabbed some Skittles (seriously), stuffed them into his mouth and entered the game. He was stuffed on his initial carry, but eventually had a strong touchdown run. Of course, his best play was a 79-yard burst in which he broke numerous tackles, including 1 from Patrick Peterson, who helplessly tried to strip the ball out of his arm. Lynch finished with 113 yards and a 2 touchdowns on just 10 carries. While he was out, Robert Turbin (10-38) and Christine Michael (6-26) were able to split the workload.

Marshawn Lynch had trouble finding running room behind his poor offensive line. He ran like a bull, but there were just too many instances in which he didn't have any lanes. He mustered 71 yards on 21 carries.    Graham paced the Seahawks in targets (10), catches (7) and receiving yards (75).

   "comment":"Willson of The Royal Tenenbaums' fame, will take over as the starter.    As this game went back and forth, with little defense to speak of, Tomlin made a curious decision after Roethlisberger drove the ball down to the 3.yard line, down by 5 points with 3:02 left on the clock. Instead of going for the touchdown on 4.h down, Tomlin opted for a field goal to make the score 32-30 Seattle. Tomlin is known for not playing conservatively, and with his defense giving up yards in fat chunks, the odds of the Steelers getting the ball back, still down just 2.points, was slim. Some have pontificated that he went for the field goal because Roethlisberger was feeling concussion-like symptoms, but if Pittsburgh knew Landry Jones was going to be the quarterback, then why not go for it at the 3. rather than hoping the Steelers' defense could stop Wilson and then hoping some more that Jones could then move them into "
