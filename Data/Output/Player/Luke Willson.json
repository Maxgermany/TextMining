   "comment":"Luke Willson followed that up with a drop near the goal line on the same possession. After that, Wilson had issues holding on to the ball. He dropped a read-option exchange. He was lucky to retain possession, but only temporarily, because he gave away a turnover when there was a botched snap.    Wilson still came away with the victory though, and that's all that will matter during the playoff push. Wilson went 20-of-32 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick that wasn't his fault. Wilson missed several open targets, but picked up some decent chunks on the ground, gaining 35 rushing yards on 6 scrambles.    Wilson's sole score ended up going to Willson, which won the game. "

As this game went back and forth, with little defense to speak of, Tomlin made a curious decision after Roethlisberger drove the ball down to the 3.yard line, down by 5 points with 3:02 left on the clock. Instead of going for the touchdown on 4.h down, Tomlin opted for a field goal to make the score 32-30 Seattle. Tomlin is known for not playing conservatively, and with his defense giving up yards in fat chunks, the odds of the Steelers getting the ball back, still down just 2.points, was slim. Some have pontificated that he went for the field goal because Roethlisberger was feeling concussion-like symptoms, but if Pittsburgh knew Landry Jones was going to be the quarterback, then why not go for it at the 3. rather than hoping the Steelers' defense could stop Wilson and then hoping some more that Jones could then move them into "
