   "comment":"Leshoure lost a fumble and Matthew Stafford should have thrown an interception, but rookie safety Harrison Smith dropped the ball. Ser Stafford finished 30-of-51 for 319 yards. As mentioned, drops wiped out a touchdown and an interception. It's worth noting that he was able to get a 56-yard pass-interference flag on an attempt to Johnson.    Megatron totaled just 5 catches for 54 yards, but had that long pass-interference flag, as just mentioned. He also nearly caught a touchdown, but Harrison Smith dislodged the ball with a great hit. Detroit's 2 leading receivers were Pettigrew (7-67) and Joique Bell (6-72). Bell is apparently serving as Detroit's third-down back, as Kevin Smith has completely disappeared into oblivion.    Leshoure had a poor outing. He was questionable all week and probably should have sat out. He rushed for just 26 yards on 13 attempts and was responsible for a fumble.    As for the Vikings' aerial attack, "
