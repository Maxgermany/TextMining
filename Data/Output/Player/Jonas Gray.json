The penalty actually gave New England an opportunity for points, as it set them up with a field goal.    The Bears finished with some pretty offensive stats, but don't be fooled; almost all of it came in garbage time. For instance, Cutler went 20-of-30 for 227 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. However, he was just 7-of-13 for 66 yards, 1 score and the pick by intermission. Cutler had 2 other turnovers negated; an interception was wiped out by an illegal contact and ultimately led to a score to "
