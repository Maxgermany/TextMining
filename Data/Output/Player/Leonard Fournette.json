On the first third down of the game, Allen Robinson made a catch of 17 yards to move the chains, but he came up limping after he was pushed out of bounds. Robinson went into the locker room and didn't return to action. A serious injury to Robinson could be devastating to Jacksonville, plus hurt his fantasy owners. Bortles had another chunk completion this time to Allen Hurns (3-42), and that set up a short field goal for Jacksonville. The Jaguars added a second field goal after using rookie Leonard Fournette to move the ball on the ground and through the air, with Chris Ivory (9-42) chipping in a 17-yard run."
