   "comment":"Easley was sent into the locker room with a hip injury.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, went 26-of-38 for 351 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Those numbers are a bit deceiving, as a big chunk, as well as the score, came in garbage time. However, Big Ben also was betrayed by dumb mistakes, like the Heyward-Bey botched touchdown and some drops. Roethlisberger also had to target Heyward-Bey instead of the suspended Martavis Bryant, while center Maurkice Pouncey was missed.    One other Steeler worth mentioning is "
