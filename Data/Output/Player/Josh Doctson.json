It was a dump-off to Samaje Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score. Cousins finished the day 25-of-37 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick. The interception was his only mistake, as he telegraphed a downfield throw to his receiver. However, Cousins' downfield accuracy improved in the second half, so that was a positive for him.    In terms of his receiving corps, Cousins was able to spread the ball around a lot. In fact, no player had more than 5 targets. The team's leading receiver was Chris Thompson (4-105). Thompson did a lot of his damage out of the backfield and was very elusive in space. He continued his breakout season, and he can be trusted as a FLEX play. As for the receivers, none really stood out. Josh Doctson (1-11) caught a touchdown. "
