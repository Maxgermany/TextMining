   "comment":"Josh Doctson on a post route right in the end zone with a perfect pass. His second was more impressive. It was a dump-off to Samaje Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score. Cousins finished the day 25-of-37 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick. The interception was his only mistake, as he telegraphed a downfield throw to his receiver. However, Cousins' downfield accuracy improved in the second half, so that was a positive for him.    In terms of his receiving corps, Cousins was able to spread the ball around a lot. In fact, no player had more than 5 targets. The team's leading receiver was Chris Thompson (4-105). Thompson did a lot of his damage out of the backfield and was very elusive in space. He continued his breakout season, and he can be trusted as a FLEX play. As for the receivers, none really stood out. Josh Doctson (1-11) caught a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Josh Doctson, who had a step on his man. Doctson rolled to a stop at the 1-yard line. After Rob Kelley punched the ball in on the next play, that was all she wrote. Cousins was able to do this despite having 4 missing offensive line starters. He did this despite the pressure. He really delivered when it mattered. Though his final stat line may look only decent, 21-of-31 for 247 yards, he really helped to carry the Redskins to victory at the end of the day. Cousins deserves a lot of credit for this surprising win.    Cousins' top targets on Sunday were Vernon Davis (6-72) and Josh Doctson (3-59). Davis filled in admirably for Jordan Reed and showed that he still has the athletic ability that once made him a major weapon. As long as Reed is out, Davis can be started as a low-end TE1. If he is available in your league, make sure to pick him up. Meanwhile, Doctson did most of his damage on the 38-yard pass on the final drive of the game, but it's clear that he's becoming a bigger part of the team's offensive system. Doctson can be added, and in certain matchups, he can be used as a FLEX. Elsewhere in the pass game, "
