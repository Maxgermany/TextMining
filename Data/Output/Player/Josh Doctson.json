   "comment":"Josh Doctson, but he still did not have his best throw on that ball either. He did not hit Doctson in stride, and that caused the rookie to slow down. Doctson, who is still recovering from an Achilles injury, was brought down by a defender later on the play, and the gain was a 57 yarder. However, a better throw could have resulted in a touchdown. The worst part is that this play came on the drive where Cousins threw the critical pick. A better throw really could have changed the outlook of the game. Cousins needs to improve in the future, or he may not get as big of a contract as he is hoping to get this offseason.    One bright spot in this game for the Redskins was their run game.
