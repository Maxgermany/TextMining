He had a cool-looking first-down scramble, featuring a juke move, but that was negated by a chop block. However, the first fumble of his came immediately after that. He then overshot Andrew Hawkins, who was wide open in the end zone. As for McCown, he looked much more promising, going 5-of-8 for 49 yards. It seemed like the Browns were going to be much more competitive with him under center. I know McCown isn't very good, but he's light years ahead of Manziel.    Manziel happened to be Cleveland's leading rusher; he scrambled 5 times for 35 rushing yards. More hilariously, McCown was second on the list! He managed 23 yards on 3 scrambles. Duke Johnson (7-22) and Isaiah Crowell (12-20) couldn't find any room against the Jets' stout front. They both should be owned in fantasy, just in case, but you shouldn't start either until further notice.

Hilariously, Fairley ran the wrong direction with the fumble for a loss of 5 yards on his return, but at least, he secured the turnover. The St. Louis offense moved the ball from midfield before Gurley charged through 3 tackles from 16 yards out for the final score of the game. The Rams' defense did the rest. William Hayes beat right tackle Mitchell Schwartz to strip McCown of the ball, and Eugene Sims recovered the fumble. After McCown was pummeled by St. Louis' defense, Johnny Manziel came in for the final drive and moved the Browns about 30 yards before Cleveland stalled out.    Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards on 19 carries with 2 touchdowns. His combination of power and speed is tremendous.    Nick Foles completed 15-of-23 passes for 163 yards, while Tavon Austin led the Rams' receivers with 43 yards on 4 receptions.    Josh McCown completed 26-of-32 pass for 270 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and 2 fumbles. He actually didn't play poorly, but his offensive line was destroyed by the Rams.    St. Louis' run defense has been vulnerable this year, but shut down the Cleveland ground attack. Robert Turbin had 30 yards on 5 carries.    Cleveland was led through the air by tight end Gary Barnidge. He had 6 receptions for 101 yards. Running back Duke Johnson (7-73) and Travis Benjamin (4-47) were the other top targets.

Once Davis had no 1 to throw to, he was even worse than usual. He took a sack on a 4.h-and-11 in the opening half, though I'm not sure why Pettine had his team go for it in the first place. Davis also botched a later 4.h-and-1, though 2 Cleveland players collided with each other. Davis then heaved an interception, targeting no 1 in particular, and he followed that up by completely botching the 2-minute drill. Repeating what he did Monday night, Davis wasted time, prompting the crowd to boo mercilessly. Despite this, Pettine didn't make the change to Johnny Manziel. Davis finished 25-of-38 for 230 yards and the pick. Much of those positive numbers came in garbage time. The Browns didn't seem to show any interest in playing hard for Davis, and it appears as though Pettine has lost the locker room.    With all of the injuries, Brian Hartline led the team with 8 catches for 83 yards. Gary Barnidge (5-59) was next, though it appeared as though he was knocked out when he hobbled off the field early on. Benjamin didn't log a single reception, as Davis got him hurt with a high throw.    Pettine continued his confusing running back rotation. "

Once Davis had no 1 to throw to, he was even worse than usual. He took a sack on a 4.h-and-11 in the opening half, though I'm not sure why Pettine had his team go for it in the first place. Davis also botched a later 4.h-and-1, though 2 Cleveland players collided with each other. Davis then heaved an interception, targeting no 1 in particular, and he followed that up by completely botching the 2-minute drill. Repeating what he did Monday night, Davis wasted time, prompting the crowd to boo mercilessly. Despite this, Pettine didn't make the change to Johnny Manziel. Davis finished 25-of-38 for 230 yards and the pick. Much of those positive numbers came in garbage time. The Browns didn't seem to show any interest in playing hard for Davis, and it appears as though Pettine has lost the locker room.    With all of the injuries, Brian Hartline led the team with 8 catches for 83 yards. Gary Barnidge (5-59) was next, though it appeared as though he was knocked out when he hobbled off the field early on. Benjamin didn't log a single reception, as Davis got him hurt with a high throw.    Pettine continued his confusing running back rotation. "

At that point, it appeared as though Denver would run away with it, but Siemian was finally picked, as he had a tipped pass of his own returned for 6. The Chargers were back in the game, and 1 drive later, they drove down to the 2-yard line, down just 8. With 4 downs, all they had to do was punch it in to give themselves a chance to tie, but they couldn't do it. All of the controversy will be regarding their play calls. Melvin Gordon led the NFL in rushing touchdowns entering this weekend and had 108 yards on the ground at that point in the contest, yet San Diego didn't give him a single attempt. Rivers threw the ball 4 times instead, and he was under such heavy pressure that he had to throw 2 of those passes away. Rivers went to his tight ends after that, but couldn't connect, turning the ball over on downs. The Chargers had 1 more chance after that, but without being able to pound the rock with Gordon as time was running out, they didn't have much of a chance.    Not running with Gordon on a single occasion on the goal-to-go situation was strange. Gordon gained 111 yards on 23 carries, and he had a 20-yard burst on that very drive. He was excellent against the Broncos, who have been weaker versus the rush than the pass. Not giving him 1 opportunity was inexcusable. Gordon, by the way, caught 4 passes for 44 receiving yards.    Rivers, conversely, didn't perform all that well, though it's hard to blame him. He failed to complete half of his passes, going 20-of-47 for 267 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. None of the 3 picks were his fault - 2 were tipped, while the third was the result of a miscommunication with Griff Whalen - but he was just 9-of-23 in the second half. He saw a ton of pressure and had to throw passes away. His tackles didn't have a chance against Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware.    Rivers' 2 touchdowns went to Benjamin (3-44) and Antonio Gates (4-33)."

Winston finished 20-of-30 for 280 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. He shook off the early pick and was able to keep the chains moving despite not being able to throw to Mike Evans all that often. Winston torched beleaguered cornerback Craig Mager repeatedly, as Mager was atrocious in this contest.    Winston couldn't go to Evans that often because of Hayward's excellent coverage. In addition to his interception, Hayward limited Evans to 3 catches for 38 yards. He also drew an offensive pass interference flag on Evans in the red zone. With Evans out of commission, Winston targeted Cameron Brate most often, as the lumbering tight end caught 6 of his 9 targets for 86 yards and a touchdown. Freddie Martino (4-56) also outgained Evans, as he was on the field because Cecil Shorts left the game on a stretcher.    Something strange happened to Tampa's rushing attack late in the game. Doug Martin handled most of the workload throughout the afternoon, tallying 45 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, but he wasn't on the field when the Buccaneers were running out the clock late in the afternoon. Instead, it was Jacquizz Rodgers, who registered 29 yards on 7 attempts. Perhaps Tampa was resting Martin, but given how important those carries were, you'd think they'd have him on the field.    The best rusher in this game was easily Melvin Gordon, who had an amazing performance in the loss. He rushed for 84 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, as he pounded the Tampa front with some extremely powerful runs. He was also a big factor in the passing game with 4 catches for a team-leading 54 receiving yards. Considering that the Chargers led for most of the game, it's irresponsible that he was given just 17 attempts.    Rivers threw 26 passes, 2 of which were picked off. He went 15-of-26 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns in addition to the turnovers. One wasn't his fault, as it was tipped into the air. However, Rivers forced the issue on the second interception. He tried to tie the game on a deep bomb, but Keith Tandy undercut the pass. Rivers didn't have his best game, but he did have an 80-yard touchdown negated by Benjamin's drop.    Rivers' touchdowns went to "

Derby led the Broncos with 6 catches for 66 yards.    Demaryius Thomas made a great catch in this game, hauling in a deep pass despite some good coverage by Casey Hayward. Thomas ran down the field for 81 yards, but it was called back because of offensive pass interference. Thomas caught just 2 balls for 9 yards.    Like Siemian, C.J. Anderson was able to get some garbage yardage. He finished with 44 yards on 10 carries, but he didn't even have double-digit yards in the opening half.    Philip Rivers went 15-of-26 for 183 yards and 2 touchdowns. Rivers had some issues with pass protection, and he didn't have much success offensively either. However, he didn't have to force the issue at all because special teams gave him a lead that he never relinquished.    I mentioned that Benjamin scored on a punt return earlier. He also had an offensive touchdown on his only reception, a 42-yarder. However, this occurred late in the game when it looked like Denver's defense stopped trying. Henry was the only player to record more receiving yardage than Benjamin, hauling in 4 balls for 73 yards. As referenced earlier, he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. "
