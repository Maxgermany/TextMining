   "comment":"Travis Benjamin. He had a 57-yard punt return in the first quarter to set up a field goal. He then took back a punt for a touchdown. The Bills were too terrified to kick it to him after that, so they had some short attempts to give Cleveland good field position. As it turned out, the Browns had more yardage on punt returns in the first half than net yardage on offense.    The Browns weren't the only team to lose their starting quarterback. E.J. Manuel banged his knee while going out of bounds in the third quarter. He walked off on his own power, and it appeared as though he'd be able to reenter the game, but Manuel eventually limped off into the locker room. Manuel finished 11-of-20 for 129 yards. Not included in this was a 29-yard pass interference on the opening drive. Manuel threw well when he had a clean pocket, but his accuracy issues were prevalent when he couldn't set his feet. He's incredibly inconsistent, but at least the talent is there. Rookie "

The third terrific play was an 18-yard completion to Andrew Hawkins in which he scrambled right and impressively connected with his receiver. However, despite the 3 glimpses of greatness, Manziel struggled otherwise. He finished 8-of-15 for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns, but take away those 3 plays, and he was just 5-of-12 for 44 yards. Not good, especially against a defense that isn't very talented. Having said that, I expect Manziel to keep starting until he loses. In other words, it may take Josh McCown a while to get cleared for his concussion.    As for Travis Benjamin, he needs to be ignored in 12-team leagues. Sure, Benjamin accumulated 115 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he was targeted only 4 times, and his quarterbacks still suck. Benjamin is just a situational deep threat, much like Devery Henderson was for the Saints a few years ago. He's not worth owning, and neither are "

   "comment":"Travis Benjamin, and once again, Cleveland punted away after starting a drive well. Foles threw a beautiful 41-yard pass to Kenny Britt to the Browns' 1-yard line. Gurley finished the drive with his first NFL touchdown. In the 4.h quarter, the Rams' defense struck again. T.J. McDonald dislodged the ball from Benjamin, while Nick Fairley recovered the ball. Hilariously, Fairley ran the wrong direction with the fumble for a loss of 5 yards on his return, but at least, he secured the turnover. The St. Louis offense moved the ball from midfield before Gurley charged through 3 tackles from 16 yards out for the final score of the game. The Rams' defense did the rest. William Hayes beat right tackle Mitchell Schwartz to strip McCown of the ball, and Eugene Sims recovered the fumble. After McCown was pummeled by St. Louis' defense, Johnny Manziel came in for the final drive and moved the Browns about 30 yards before Cleveland stalled out.    Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards on 19 carries with 2 touchdowns. His combination of power and speed is tremendous.    Nick Foles completed 15-of-23 passes for 163 yards, while Tavon Austin led the Rams' receivers with 43 yards on 4 receptions.    Josh McCown completed 26-of-32 pass for 270 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and 2 fumbles. He actually didn't play poorly, but his offensive line was destroyed by the Rams.    St. Louis' run defense has been vulnerable this year, but shut down the Cleveland ground attack. Robert Turbin had 30 yards on 5 carries.    Cleveland was led through the air by tight end Gary Barnidge. He had 6 receptions for 101 yards. Running back Duke Johnson (7-73) and Travis Benjamin (4-47) were the other top targets.    The Rams' defensive line was just tremendous. "

   "comment":"Travis Benjamin. Gordon finished the drive by plunging into the end zone from a few yards out. After trading punts, Bortles had a pass deflected by Casey Hayward, and Hayward caught the deflection while lying on his back. That set up the Chargers at the Jaguars' 34. Rivers took advantage with a few completions and a 6-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin. The Jaguars moved the ball into San Diego territory thanks to a completion to Allen Hurns (5-64), but Jason Myers missed a 54-yard field goal. The Chargers got Benjamin matched up on Paul Posluszny, and that led to a 43-yard completion for San Diego. The Jaguars jumped offsides on a 4.h-and-1 at the 4-yard line, and a play, later Rivers hit Antonio Gates (3-15) for a 2-yard score. With San Diego up 21-0, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Bortles with Corey Liuget recovering. The Chargers got close to the end zone, but Mike McCoy made some terrible play calls to pass rather than running Gordon. As a result, Yannick Ngakoue strip-sacked Rivers and Jonathan Cyprien recovered the ball for Jacksonville. Bortles finally got going with T.J. Yeldon (7-28) and Julius Thomas (4-71) ripping off good gains, but then Bortles threw a terrible pass that floated toward Hayward for his second interception of the game. San Diego took a 21-0 lead into the half. Early in the third quarter, Rivers hit Tyrell Williams (3-61) for a 44-yard touchdown reception in part because Jonathan Cyprien went for a knockout blow rather than wrapping up the wideout. Late in the third quarter, Benjamin beat Davon House to make a 45-yard touchdown catch to put the game out of reach.    Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.

   "comment":"Travis Benjamin was guilty of an error later, dropping a crucial third down. The real killers occurred at the end, however.    Rivers had a great game outside of the few blunders, finishing 26-of-39 for 330 yards. He was borderline unstoppable in the second half, going 18-of-23 for 224 yards following the break. Rivers, as mentioned, figured out that the Colts could not stop the slant to Tyrell Williams, who ended up catching 6 balls for 69 yards.    Rivers did manage to spread the ball around, as 3 players in addition to Williams caught at least 4 players. They were Travis Benjamin (4-82), Hunter Henry (5-76) and Melvin Gordon (4-43)."

   "comment":"Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1.yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On 4.h-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2.point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the 4.h quarter. Chargers punter Drew Kaser had a 16-yard shanked punt that set up the Raiders at the San Diego 32-yard line, and the Raiders turned that into a short touchdown run from fullback Jamize Olawale. The Chargers responded by moving the ball down the field, and Rivers hit Gates on a short touchdown pass to close the Raiders' lead to a field goal. San Diego got in position to tie the game with a field goal, but Kaser fumbled the snap to botch the field goal attempt and ensure another Chargers loss.    Philip Rivers completed 20-of-29 passes for 366 yards with 4 touchdowns with 2 interceptions. Tyrell Williams (5-117-1), Travis Benjamin (7-117) and Hunter Henry (3-74) all played well for the Chargers.    Melvin Gordon ran for 69 yards on 16 carries with his 18-yard touchdown reception. He played well with the exception of another critical fumble.    Derek Carr completed 25-of-40 for 317 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He continues to show that he is blooming franchise quarterback and a winner.    "

The ball hit Benjamin right on the hands, and he never had to break stride before heading into the end zone. The throw set the tone for the game, and it seemed like the Chargers would be having a great day on offense. However, that never materialized. The Chargers were only able to put up 9 points after their 91-yard opening drive, and that contributed to their dip in production. Part of the problem was the lack of a running game. With Melvin Gordon out, the Chargers had to rely on undrafted rookie "

Benjamin had an impressive performance on offense, and his explosive play-making ability was on display. His touchdown saw him outrun the Patriots' defense, and he almost had a second touchdown as well, but it was called back by a penalty. He is worth adding as a boom-or-bust type of play-maker. It is worth noting, however, that Benjamin produced 1 of the worst punt returns in NFL history in this contest. He muffed the ball around the 15 before picking it up at the 10. He then proceeded to run backward into the end zone, where he was tackled for a safety. Those 2 points gave the Patriots a lead they never relinquished.    Finally, the running game for the Chargers was a strength. "
