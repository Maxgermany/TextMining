His final numbers don't look that bad - 27-of-56, 222 yards, 1 touchdown - but those stats are strengthened by garbage time. Carr was just 12-of-25 for 81 yards heading into halftime. He was constantly under pressure, but struggled with accuracy while this game was still in doubt. He was extremely lucky to get away with several potential interceptions.    Carr's sole score was thrown to James Jones (8-57) at the very end of the game. "

Perhaps more impressively, he caught 7 balls for 36 receiving yards. He can be targeted for a trade from a fantasy owner who isn't really paying attention very much.    Cooper led Oakland in receiving, but managed 5 catches for just 47 yards. He was guilty of a drop early on, but Carr's inaccuracy and McGloin's incompetence ruined his afternoon. It's going to be a rough rookie campaign for Cooper until Carr gets his act together, perhaps in the second half of the season. Don't trade him yet; he'll get better as the year progresses.    A quick note on McGloin: His numbers don't look awful (23-of-31, 142 yards, 2 touchdowns, interception) because of the dual scores, but those came very late in garbage time. The Bengals were up 33-0 entering the 4.h quarter. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

However, the lanes eventually opened up for the tough back, who ultimately finished with 139 yards and a touchdown on 26 attempts. Murray will be a solid RB2 most weeks.    I'm not exactly revealing anything crazy by saying that the Browns played poorly in this game, but their mental mistakes following a big win over the Titans were alarming. They allowed a 10-point swing to take place in the first half. Cleveland was whistled for a roughing-the-kicker penalty deep in Oakland territory. The Raiders were able to maintain possession and ultimately score a touchdown. A bit later, the Browns were going for it on a 4.h-and-goal on the 1-yard line. A false start ruined their chance, and they had to settle for 3. So, the game went into halftime with a 17-3 score, but it easily could have been just 10-7.    Cleveland's fans did not have a good time in this game, as they constanly booed the offense. They seemed displeased that "

Making matters worse for his fantasy owners, he was benched after he both bobbled a pass that resulted in Carr's pick and dropped a pitch that turned out to be a fumble. Sitting him was not wise despite the 2 errors, as he's the best running back on the roster by a mile.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler put together a great, game-winning drive, but before that, it appeared as though he was trying his best to give this victory away.

Detroit's offense finally started moving again thanks to a shovel pass to Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards. He also ran the ball 6 times for 31 yards and a touchdown.    Calvin Johnson caught 5 passes for 88 yards, and Golden Tate had 8 receptions for 73 yards. Ameer Abdullah had 12 carries for 33 yards. Theo Riddick had 6 carries for 14 yards and 5 receptions for 72 yards.    Carr was 13-of-25 for 169 yards. Surprisingly, Detroit's secondary limited Cooper to only 1 catch for 4 yards. Michael Crabtree led Oakland through the air with 6 receptions for 50 yards.    Latavius Murray totaled just 28 yards on 13 carries with a touchdown.    The Lions' defense got some clutch plays out of Ziggy Ansah and rookie cornerback Quandre Diggs. "

   "comment":"Murray was limited to less than a 3.0 YPC average, mustering just 59 yards on 22 carries.    The Titans couldn't run the ball either, and this includes the quarterback. Well, couldn't is the incorrect word when referring to Mariota, who barely tried to scramble. He scampered just once for 7 yards, which I just don't understand. Marota's best attribute happens to be his legs. Why isn't he running more? It makes no sense to limit his rushing ability. As for his passing, Mariota was an underwhelming 17-of-37 for 218 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Mariota's inability to exploit Oakland's struggling secondary was very discouraging. Both picks were painful, as they came in Oakland territory, ruining scoring opportunities. Mariota read the coverage incorrectly on his first interception. The second just seemed like a miscommunication.    "

   "comment":"Murray returned from injury, and while he didn't run particularly well - he gained 59 yards on 18 carries - he managed to find the end zone twice, rewarding those who were bold enough to start him in fantasy.    As for the Jaguars, I detailed their numerous blunders. Bortles was absolutely awful, and he doesn't seem to be progressing mentally. This was a concern for Bortles coming out of Central Florida, so it's not a surprise that he's regressing like this, despite the great offensive coaching he's been receiving. If Bortles can't ever develop into a consistent passer with Greg Olson aiding him, there might not be any hope. Bortles finished 23-of-43 for 246 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and even those pedestrian numbers were helped by garbage time. Bortles was just 5-of-14 for 57 yards and a pick in the first half. Oakland's pass defense has gotten better in recent weeks, but there's still no excuse for this.    Allen Robinson posted a miserable stat line, catching just 2 of his 8 targets for 9 yards. Robinson wasn't completely to blame for this, as Bortles constantly missed him on numerous basic throws. Robinson, as mentioned, was guilty of 2 drops. "

   "comment":"Murray, but Jadeveon Clowney made an athletic play to snatch the ball. It was horrible awareness by Cook not to recognize that Clowney was even there. This led to a quick touchdown by the Texans on the following play, giving them what would be an insurmountable 10-0 lead. The Raiders had just 1 positive drive after that in meaningful action, thanks to a long Jalen Richard punt return. However, they couldn't sustain anything otherwise. Cook's passes were all over the place. He nearly threw 4 other interceptions in the opening half alone! In fact, 1 near-pick was so poorly thrown that the defender couldn't intercept the pass because Cook overshot his intended target. Andre Hal then dropped an interception right before halftime. The ESPN announcers said Cook didn't see Hal, but I don't know whom he was throwing to anyway because there were no Raiders in the area. I was shocked it wasn't called intentional grounding! Cook finished just 18-of-45 for 161 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Believe it or not, but those numbers were enhanced by garbage time, as the Raiders put together a long touchdown drive in the 4.h quarter because the Texans stopped blitzing and went into a prevent. Cook, at halftime, had completed only 4 of his 14 attempts for only 41 yards. He was absolutely horrible; in addition to his poor passing, he also took some sacks because he held the ball for too long, and he generally had a deer-in-the-headlights look on his face the entire afternoon. It's astonishing that the Cowboys reportedly wanted to select Cook instead of Dak Prescott, but couldn't because the Raiders moved up for Cook. It just proves that the NFL Draft can be a crapshoot.    Cook embarrassed himself, but he wasn't the only 1 to blame on offense. Left tackle Menelik Watson was awful in place of the injured Penn, and the 2 Houston edge rushers had great performances as a result. Meanwhile, Cook was hurt by countless drops. It started when Michael Crabtree was guilty of 1. negating a gain of about 15 yards. I counted 5 drops, but I may have missed 1 or 2. Crabtree was guilty of a couple of those drops. He didn't finish the game because of a concussion, but Oakland was better off without him. Andre Holmes (4-50) was actually superior in relief, and he caught Cook's sole touchdown. Amari Cooper (2-10) was awful as well. He was guilty of a deep drop and ran some half-hearted routes. His lack of effort was disturbing.    Murray scored Oakland's other touchdown, and he finished with 39 yards on 12 carries. He didn't have much running room on most of his attempts; outside of an 18-yard burst, Murray gained 21 yards on 11 tries.    As for the Texans' offense, I'm sure "

The Vikings, who had more third-down success late in the 4.h quarter, were just able to suck the life out of the game by controlling the clock. They took over, up 21-9, with 10 minutes left. By the time they relinquished possession, the score was 24-9 with 3 minutes remaining in regulation. That effectively was the final score, as Joe Flacco's sole touchdown came as time expired.    Case Keenum didn't have the prettiest stats, but he was very efficient when he needed to be. He finished 20-of-31 for 188 yards and an interception at the beginning of the game, which was a downfield touch pass. Because of his meager numbers, no 1 in the Minnesota receiving corps topped 55 receiving yards. Jarius Wright led the way with 3 grabs for 54 yards, which includes an acrobatic, 30-yard reception that he made as the Vikings were eating up the clock in the 4.h quarter. Elsewhere, Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen caught 5 balls each for 43 and 41 yards, respectively. Thielen saw 12 targets, so he could have put together a better performance, but had some bad luck with a couple of inaccurate balls from Keenum.    Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon split touches almost evenly, but despite McKinnon's recent success, Murray was the 1 who had an explosive stat line."
