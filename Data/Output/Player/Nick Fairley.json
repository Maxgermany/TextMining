   "comment":"Nick Fairley, who had 1 of those sacks, was a monster. QBDK took many fierce hits in this contest. I was shocked that he somehow survived the afternoon, as he was slow to get up sometimes. However, there was plenty of bad QBDK. Despite carrying a ball around with him all week, he was guilty of a fumble (his ninth of the year), though he recovered it. Meanwhile, his interceptions were terrible. He overthrew the first 1 and walked off the field to a chorus of boos. The second 1 was badly underthrown.    QBDK can't really be blamed for this loss though, as Philadelphia's defense was pathetic in the 4.h quarter and overtime. Of course, the fact that the Lions stopped making dumb mistakes, including offsides, false-start, personal-foul and helmet-to-helmet hits penalties, contributed to the comeback victory.    Stafford was unstoppable in the final quarter plus, finishing 22-of-45 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and a poor interception forced to "
