   "comment":"Tomlinson and a dropped touchdown by Eric Ebron led to a Detroit field goal. After a Raiders punt, Stafford kept moving the ball using Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with Seth Roberts down the deep middle for a 43-yard gain. The officials blew a penalty that canceled out a Quandre Diggs interception, and Carr used his legs to run ball inside the 5-yard line. To finish the drive, Latavius Murray plunged into the end zone. Carr quickly led 2 field goal drives to take a 13-9 lead with 1 of the 3.pointers being a 56-yarder from Sebastian Janikowski. Detroit's offense finally started moving again thanks to a shovel pass to Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards. He also ran the ball 6 times for 31 yards and a touchdown.    Calvin Johnson caught 5 passes for 88 yards, and Golden Tate had 8 receptions for 73 yards. Ameer Abdullah had 12 carries for 33 yards. Theo Riddick had 6 carries for 14 yards and 5 receptions for 72 yards.    Carr was 13-of-25 for 169 yards. Surprisingly, Detroit's secondary limited Cooper to only 1 catch for 4 yards. Michael Crabtree led Oakland through the air with 6 receptions for 50 yards.    Latavius Murray totaled just 28 yards on 13 carries with a touchdown.    The Lions' defense got some clutch plays out of Ziggy Ansah and rookie cornerback Quandre Diggs. Khalil Mack was very good to lead Oakland's defense with 8 tackles. The Lions' offensive line continued to struggle as they allowed sacks to Ben Heeney, Benson Mayowa and Denico Autry. Detroit rookie first-round guard Laken Tomlinson had a rough game.   "

   "comment":"Tomlinson. Other than that, Stafford threw from a clean pocket all too often. The linebackers were incapable of defending against Detroit's running back duo and the secondary was torched. Indianapolis' defense was horrible in the season opener.    Ameer Abdullah had 63 yards on 12 carries with 5 receptions for 57 yards and a touchdown. Theo Riddick saw 7 carries for 45 yards with 1 touchdown rushing and 5 receptions for 63 yards with 1 touchdown receiving. This duo carved up the Colts' defense.    Andrew Luck was excellent, completing 31-of-47 passes for 385 yards with 4 touchdowns. The Colts' much-maligned offensive line had a rough start to the game, but played well down the stretch and was very good in the second half.    "
