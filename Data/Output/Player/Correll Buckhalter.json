   "comment":"Buckhalter lost a fumble deep in Jacksonville territory, which ended an impressive 9-minute drive that began on the Denver 4-yard line. - The Broncos had just 10 men on the field when David Garrard threw a touchdown to Marcedes Lewis.    Kyle Orton had a decent fantasy day, going 21-of-33 for 295 yards, 1 score and a pick. There was 1 play though that really bothered me. Late in the fourth quarter, the Broncos were in the red zone. Orton scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to pick up the first down. Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on fourth down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 passes for 117 yards. Make sure you pick him up in fantasy; Orton really loves throwing to him. Meanwhile, Eddie Royal had 8 grabs for 98 yards, and Jabar Gaffney caught 3 balls for 34 yards and a score. I'm not too confident in Royal yet; he's worth picking up, but he could easily catch 1 pass next week.    Knowshon Moreno had 60 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. More importantly, he didn't fumble like Correll Buckhalter (6-15).    "
