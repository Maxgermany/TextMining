He was clutch on a long drive in the 4.h quarter. The Chiefs had the ball on their own 5-yard line with 10 minutes remaining, but he took them into field goal range while bleeding 7 minutes off the clock. Smith spent the entire night dumping the ball off to Avery and Jamaal Charles."

To open the third quarter, Locker drooped in a perfect pass to Justin Hunter (3-63) for 39 yards. Locker kept moving the ball down the field before a 6-yard touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (6-46) on third-and-goal. Midway through the same quarter, Smith threw a mirror image of his first interception that was picked off by McCourty again. Locker then moved the ball for a field goal. The Chiefs had 1 drive that ended with Anthony Fasano catching a 5.yard touchdown, but that was all the Kansas City offense could muster. Locker led another field goal drive to ice the win.    Locker completed 22-of-33 passes for 266 yards with 2 touchdowns. Fantasy owners of Bishop Sankey (6-25) have to be worried as the Titans favored Shonn Greene (15-71) and Dexter McCluster (9-29). Perhaps Sankey will get a bigger role as the year wears on, and he flashed in the second half with a 12-yard run. Greene is clearly a limited player.
