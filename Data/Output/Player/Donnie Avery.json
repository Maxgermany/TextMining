The Chiefs would've scored way more than 26 points had they not made errors themselves. They bogged down in the red zone and dropped 4 passes in the first quarter alone. The offensive line was also guilty of several illegal formations. I'm not sure why the Chiefs continuously had issues lining up, but their inability to do so disrupted some of their drives. I don't want to take anything away from Alex Smith though. He once again seldom looked downfield, but he didn't really need to. He went 22-of-35 for 273 yards. He was clutch on a long drive in the 4.h quarter. The Chiefs had the ball on their own 5-yard line with 10 minutes remaining, but he took them into field goal range while bleeding 7 minutes off the clock. Smith spent the entire night dumping the ball off to Avery and Jamaal Charles."

I mentioned that Bowe had a deep drop, but he played well otherwise despite his arrest during the week, as he led the team in receiving with 4 catches for 57 yards and a legitimate touchdown in the second quarter. Charles, however, wasn't a big factor in the passing game, hauling in just 2 balls for a loss of 6 receiving yards. He also notched 78 rushing yards on 16 carries.    Two other notable Chiefs: "

   "comment":"Avery and Junior Hemingway both got hurt, but the major issue following Charles' concussion was Knile Davis' knee. Davis proved to be a solid replacement for Charles, but the Chiefs had nothing behind him. Someone named Cyrus Gray took the field after that and offered Kansas City nothing out of the backfield.    Despite all of these injuries, Alex Smith played to the best of his ability. He went 30-of-46 for 378 yards and 4 touchdowns. He didn't throw an interception either, but he made a couple of mistakes late. It started when he was strip-sacked by Robert Mathis, which set up an Indianapolis touchdown. Smith then missed an open Gray for a touchdown and followed that up with a poor intentional grounding penalty. Smith's touchdowns went to Dwayne Bowe (8-150), Avery (1-79), Davis and Anthony Sherman."

   "comment":"Avery to intercept the pass in Chiefs territory. That led to a Tennessee field goal before the half.    To open the third quarter, Locker drooped in a perfect pass to Justin Hunter (3-63) for 39 yards. Locker kept moving the ball down the field before a 6-yard touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (6-46) on third-and-goal. Midway through the same quarter, Smith threw a mirror image of his first interception that was picked off by McCourty again. Locker then moved the ball for a field goal. The Chiefs had 1 drive that ended with Anthony Fasano catching a 5.yard touchdown, but that was all the Kansas City offense could muster. Locker led another field goal drive to ice the win.    Locker completed 22-of-33 passes for 266 yards with 2 touchdowns. Fantasy owners of Bishop Sankey (6-25) have to be worried as the Titans favored Shonn Greene (15-71) and Dexter McCluster (9-29). Perhaps Sankey will get a bigger role as the year wears on, and he flashed in the second half with a 12-yard run. Greene is clearly a limited player.    Smith completed 19-of-35 passes for 202 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 36 yards on 6 carries, too. The Chiefs' wide receivers predictably struggled, as Donnie Avery (7-84) and tight end Travis Kelce (3-49) led the team."
