   "comment":"Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.    Early in the third quarter, Smith and Gore kept moving the ball against the Buccaneers. Smith threw a nice pass to Vernon Davis, who powered his way into the end zone for a 23-yard touchdown catch. The connection of Smith to Davis torched Tampa Bay for a 14-yard touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Smith threw a perfect fade pass and Davis beat Ronde Barber off the snap to break open.    Raheem Morris hurt his team's efforts on a possession when he was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Tampa Bay was marred by critical penalties and untimely turnovers, such as when wide receiver Mike Williams fumbled the ball away in the second half.    The 49ers dominated the Buccaneers, completely kicking their butt. The Tampa Bay run defense was a disaster, constantly getting blown out of their gaps. Gore ran for 125 yards on 20 carries and Smith finished the game 11-of-19 for 170 yards with 3 touchdowns.    Third-year quarterback Freeman played a terrible game. He failed to move the ball consistently and made a lot of bad decisions, ending up 17-of-33 for 187 yards and 2 interceptions. Blount had no carries in the second half. With 5 catches for 54 yards, Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving. The 49ers' defense saw great performances out of rookie outside linebacker Aldon Smith, defensive end Justin Smith, linebacker Patrick Willis, cornerback Carlos Rogers, and safety Dashon Goldson."
