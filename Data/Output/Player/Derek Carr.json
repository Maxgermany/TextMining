   "comment":"Derek Carr looked so impressive in the preseason finale against Seattle's starting defensive unit that the Raiders didn't waste much time naming him the starter over the banged-up Matt Schaub. It appeared to be the correct decision, but maybe Oakland shouldn't have been as aggressive. Carr had a dreadful performance and didn't appear as though he was ready to start in the NFL. Carr finished 20-of-32 for 151 yards and 2 touchdowns. That stat line doesn't seem too bad, but consider that he was nearly picked off a few times (rookie "

   "comment":"Derek Carr had a record-setting day for a Raider rookie quarterback. No Oakland first-year signal-caller had thrown 4 touchdowns in a single contest, but Carr did exactly that against 1 of the NFL's top defenses, going 18-of-34 for 282 yards and an interception otherwise. The completion percentage doesn't look very good, but Carr was betrayed by countless drops, as Oakland had 5 of them in the first half alone. The team was cleaner following intermission, but Carr ultimately cost his squad with some late mistakes. He panicked under pressure and was flagged for intentional grounding. He then fumbled on a strip-sack, but that was nullified by a face mask. And then it all culminated with a game-ending interception into double coverage. It was a horrible decision, as Carr had plenty of time to move the team into field goal range to force overtime. That should've been the worst-case scenario. Instead, Carr's heave was careless and ruined what could have been Oakland's first victory.    Focusing on the positive, the Raiders finally got "

   "comment":"Derek Carr. Manning made some decent intermediate throws, but he does not look like the same quarterback who used to crush weak competition during the regular season. Manning finished 21-of-37 for 273 yards. He once again failed to throw a touchdown, though he could've had 1 if Demaryius Thomas didn't drop a back-shoulder throw in the end zone. He also was credited with a lost fumble returned for a score, but that was a lateral pass that was tipped by a Raider, recovered and returned for 6.    Thomas couldn't help his fantasy owners by reaching the end zone, but he still had 8 catches for 115 yards. However, Manning targeted Thomas 17 times, so it's troubling that the pair couldn't connect on half of their attempts to each other. Emmanuel Sanders (6-73) was the only other noteworthy receiver, as Julius Thomas was a no-show once more. He played, but couldn't come up with a single catch.    C.J. Anderson was exceptional once again. He scored thrice while rushing for 87 yards on 13 carries. It was curious to see Ronnie Hillman out-touch him (15-56), and that wasn't just a byproduct of garbage-time opportunities; Anderson had just 1 more attempt than Hillman by halftime.    The Raiders were in this game entering the final quarter, but they curiously waved the white flag with a minute remaining in the third frame. THey had a 4.h-and-4 on the Denver 39, down 30-14 - in other words, 2 scores - but Tony Sparano foolishly decided to punt the ball. The Broncos took over deep in their own territory, but were able to drive down the field and add to their point total to go up 3 scores. And just like that, Oakland's hopes evaporated.    This was not a pretty game for Derek Carr. It was ugly early on, as a pass toward "

Instead, the Raiders won by 4 and the total was 70. Defense was not at the forefront in this game as Joe Flacco threw for 384 yards and Derek Carr for 351. Together, these teams put up 941 offensive yards and 55 first downs.    To start the game, Oakland's No. 1 draft pick "

   "comment":"Derek Carrs of the NFL. McCown began poorly; he was very fortunate to have an interception overturned because of a roughing-the-passer penalty that had nothing to do with the throw. He then took a bad sack in the red zone, and he stood at just 165 yards by intermission. Throwing on the Ravens was so much easier for McCown in the second half because of all of those injuries. He consequently finished 36-of-51 for 457 yards and 2 touchdowns. He put together a great game, as he didn't turn the ball over a single time, and he had just 7 incompletions in the second half and overtime. The Browns should still be starting Johnny Manziel, just to see what they have in him, but McCown is definitely the superior player.    "

   "comment":"Derek Carr pick-six iced the victory for Denver. Carr had 2 receivers in the area, but neither inexplicably looked back for the ball. Oakland and Denver had about the same amount of net yardage (the visitor accumulated 9 more), but the mistakes the host made allowed the Broncos to improve to 5-0.    Carr went 26-of-39 for 249 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick-six to go along with a lost fumble. He moved the chains well throughout most of the afternoon, and he launched a deep bomb late that drew a pass interference flag, but he dinked and dunked more than he should have. Perhaps the worst instance of that occurred on a 4.h-and-19 with about 4 minutes remaining. Doing his best impersonation of Alex Smith, Carr inexplicably tossed a checkdown that went nowhere. It's almost as if the Raiders didn't know it was 4.h down. And no, Dilfer, that's not a good play.    With Carr limited, it's no surprise that none of his receivers accumulated more than 54 yards. "

   "comment":"Derek Carr had a strong statistical outing, going 24-of-37 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. This is significant, as he was missing Pro Bowl center Rodney Hudson once again. Hudson was missed on a 4.h-and-2 when the Raiders went for it on the Tennessee 36-yard line. The backup center botched a snap, and Oakland turned the ball over on downs as a result. Carr did a nice job of dissecting Tennessee's poor secondary on several drives considering Hudson's absence. However, the numbers don't tell the entire story, as Carr was very fortunate in this contest. I already discussed the game-winning touchdown that should've never happened. Carr, otherwise, had a sequence in which he should've thrown 2 interceptions right before halftime. It looked like he was going to be picked by "

   "comment":"Derek Carr made a bad mistake, throwing the ball into a crowd of defenders. However, the Chargers gave it right back as Antonio Gates fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Perry Riley with Reggie Nelson recovering for Oakland. The Raiders responded with Carr using Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree to move the ball down the field. Oakland was stopped on the goal line to settle for a short field goal. Promptly, Rivers tossed an underthrown pass that was picked off by Sean Smith and returned into San Diego territory, but Sebastian Janikowski missed the field goal. The Chargers got moving and Rivers hit Tyrell Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1.yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On 4.h-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2.point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the 4.h quarter. Chargers punter Drew Kaser had a 16-yard shanked punt that set up the Raiders at the San Diego 32-yard line, and the Raiders turned that into a short touchdown run from fullback Jamize Olawale. The Chargers responded by moving the ball down the field, and Rivers hit Gates on a short touchdown pass to close the Raiders' lead to a field goal. San Diego got in position to tie the game with a field goal, but Kaser fumbled the snap to botch the field goal attempt and ensure another Chargers loss.    Philip Rivers completed 20-of-29 passes for 366 yards with 4 touchdowns with 2 interceptions. Tyrell Williams (5-117-1), Travis Benjamin (7-117) and Hunter Henry (3-74) all played well for the Chargers.    Melvin Gordon ran for 69 yards on 16 carries with his 18-yard touchdown reception. He played well with the exception of another critical fumble.    Derek Carr completed 25-of-40 for 317 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He continues to show that he is blooming franchise quarterback and a winner.    "

And with that explosion of offense, this game was still in no way an easy win for the Raiders, as they had their quarterback set the team record for the most passing yards in a game, but they also, as a team, set the team record for the most penalties and penalty yards.    Tampa Bay had trouble moving the ball, but the Raiders continued to give the Bucs penalty yards. Just in 1 drive, the Buccaneers were given 4 first downs on Oakland penalties, with 3 of those coming on third downs. The fact, Tampa Bay ended up losing this game is really astonishing considering.    "

The Broncos were flagged for a whopping 4 interference flags in the end zone alone! Carr's only real blemish was a near-interception by "

   "comment":"Derek Carr's finger injury. Carr came back and won, but failed to cover the 3.5-point spread, so it's fair to assume Oakland would've covered had Carr not missed action, given that the Panthers were energized by his absence.    There were some good games this weekend, but I don't think you can find 1 that was more exciting than the Raiders and Panthers (Editor's Note, Again: This was written before the Denver-Kansas City game). You had huge defensive plays, a big comeback, an injured quarterback gutting it out for yet another comeback, and a game that went down to the wire. This high-powered roller coaster of a game started off evenly in the first quarter as Derek Carr tossed a 2-yard touchdown to Seth Roberts and Cam Newton rushed in from 3 yards out on the next drive to tie it 7-7."

   "comment":"Derek Carr's finger injury. Carr came back and won, but failed to cover the 3.5-point spread, so it's fair to assume Oakland would've covered had Carr not missed action, given that the Panthers were energized by his absence.    There were some good games this weekend, but I don't think you can find 1 that was more exciting than the Raiders and Panthers (Editor's Note, Again: This was written before the Denver-Kansas City game). You had huge defensive plays, a big comeback, an injured quarterback gutting it out for yet another comeback, and a game that went down to the wire. This high-powered roller coaster of a game started off evenly in the first quarter as Derek Carr tossed a 2-yard touchdown to Seth Roberts and Cam Newton rushed in from 3 yards out on the next drive to tie it 7-7."

   "comment":"Derek Carr was getting his hand checked out. I would've bet my house, soul and <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> DVD collection that Buffalo would've covered at that point. The Bills did not, as they were outscored 29-0 from that point forward.    What an absolute collapse by the Bills. Just a few plays into the second half, it looked like they were going to run away with the game. After intermission, they jumped out to a 24-9 lead and had all the momentum. Then, the Raiders suddenly made a comeback, scoring 29 unanswered points to take control. The score would hold at 38-24 to give the Raiders their 10th win of the season. For the Raiders, 1 of their best weapons continues to be Derek Carr. One of the frontrunners of the MVP race, Carr put together another solid performance on Sunday. Despite a mediocre performance in the first half, Carr finished the day with a good stat line, going 19-of-35 for 260 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, he was not too strong in the first half, and it looked like his banged-up finger was bothering him. Carr was significantly more accurate after halftime. He was able to toss the 2 touchdowns. One was a laser to "

   "comment":"Derek Carr. Their franchise quarterback suffered an injury in this contest when he was twisted awkwardly. It looked like he took a helmet ot the neck or side, and he was on the ground for several minutes. He walked off gingerly afterward, but didn't see the field again. E.J. Manuel entered the field and didn't seem like he'd give the Raiders much of a chance. Carr struggled against Denver's No Fly Zone, outside of 1 inexplicable 99-yard drive, so how was Manuel going to do anything? Well, to almost quote Chris Berman, that's why they play the entire game. The Raiders couldn't do anything with Manuel at first, but the former first-round pick caught fire and led 2 impressive drives. The first nearly concluded with a touchdown, but "

   "comment":"Derek Carr deserves part of the blame for this loss. He didn't have a strong performance, and it is clear that he is still not 100 percent as he recovers from his back injury. Carr was pedestrian for most of the contest and struggled to get the ball down the field. For most of the game, Carr focused on throwing checkdowns to his running backs and receivers. The team ran a lot of shallow routes and consistently had Carr throwing the ball in under 2 seconds. It seemed as though the coaches were afraid of Carr getting hit, which they were right to be concerned about. At the same time, it clearly impacted the Raiders' offense in a negative way, so you have to wonder why they didn't wait an extra week to start him. Carr's final stat line looked like this: 21-of-30 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions was not his fault, as it glanced off the hands of his receiver. Still, he just didn't look like himself, and the Raiders suffered as a result. Perhaps he will be healthier for Thursday's matchup with the Chiefs, though the short week will make that difficult.    Once again, "

   "comment":"Derek Carr was intercepted on a deep pass that bounced off Johnny Holton's shoulder pad. They were looking to keep up with the Patriots, and it ended up costing them, as they never had the feel of an offense that was comfortable. This was partly on the Patriots defense, but also because they got down quick and turned the ball over just as quickly. Two drives later, Brady hit Brandin Cooks for the first of his 2 big gainers for the day, with a 52-yard bomb. Brady then picked the Raiders apart, as he finished the drive with his arm, connecting on a short touchdown to Danny Amendola. At that point, it was 14-0, and the Raiders knew they had to score or be trounced. Oakland got the ball back, and on 2nd-and-10, Marshawn Lynch busted off a 25-yard run, then Jalen Richard touched the ball on the next 4 plays for 19 yards. Lynch then went back to work for 11 yards on 2 carries. Then, at the Patriots' 15-yard line, Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered."
