The completion percentage doesn't look very good, but Carr was betrayed by countless drops, as Oakland had 5 of them in the first half alone. The team was cleaner following intermission, but Carr ultimately cost his squad with some late mistakes. He panicked under pressure and was flagged for intentional grounding. He then fumbled on a strip-sack, but that was nullified by a face mask. And then it all culminated with a game-ending interception into double coverage. It was a horrible decision, as Carr had plenty of time to move the team into field goal range to force overtime. That should've been the worst-case scenario. Instead, Carr's heave was careless and ruined what could have been Oakland's first victory.    Focusing on the positive, the Raiders finally got "

A few plays later, Darren McFadden (14-48) plunged into the end zone. The Raiders had a chance to tie it up quickly as a few plays after McFadden's score when Cardinals tight end John Carlson deflected an inaccurate Palmer pass up in the air and Charles Woodson picked it off. He returned it 27 yards to the Arizona 13-yard line. That was the first Cardinals interception this season, but Oakland settled for a field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders narrowed the lead to 1 point with a field goal drive, led by runs to McFadden and a few passes. The Cardinals answered with a drive featuring Andre Ellington, and Taylor finished the possession with another short touchdown run. The Raiders had some decent drives that fizzled because of penalties, receivers not getting open and poor execution by the offensive line. Late in the 4.h quarter, Arizona tacked on another field goal to ice the win.    Palmer completed 22-of-31 for 253 yards with 2 scores and an interception. Larry Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for 21 yards.    The workhorse for the Arizona offense was Ellington as he ran for 88 yards on 24 carries with 6 receptions for 72 yards. He is really playing at a high level and allowing Palmer to serve as a game-manager.    Carr completed 16-of-28 passes for 173 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. He had some good plays called back on penalties and was better than the numbers indicate.    "

The Seahawks came back with some runs to Marshawn Lynch. A 36-yard pass interference penalty on D.J. Hayden set up the Seahawks at the Raiders' 6-yard line. Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker Bruce Irvin tipped a pass up in the air. He came down with the ball and sprinted down the field for a 35-yard touchdown. Carr gave the ball right back as Richard Sherman picked off a back-shoulder throw intended for Andre Holmes (2-28)."

Smith was very inconsistent. As mentioned, he was horrible early on. His throws were low and behind his targets, and Kansas City, as a result, averaged a hideous 3.3 yards per play during the first half. Smith, however, finished 20-of-36 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire during a portion of the second half, but his limitations were pretty prevalent on a failed final drive despite that the Raiders began celebrating early, allowing a big return and nearly getting whistled for being way offsides prior to the final play of the game.    Charles didn't have the big game everyone was expecting. He touched the ball only 23 times, which is simply unacceptable. He had 19 carries go for 80 rushing yards, but he at least scored a touchdown as a pass-catcher, logging 4 grabs for 42 receiving yards. Charles also should've drawn a pass interference in the end zone at 1 point during the second quarter, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag.    Yet another week, and yet another game in which no Kansas City wideouts scored a touchdown. Dwayne Bowe (3-42) led the group in yardage. Travis Kelce (4-67) outgained him, while Anthony Fasano (2-30) reeled in Smith's other touchdown.    As for the Raiders, this was a Pyrrhic victory for them. They should have lost, as they have a better strength of schedule than the Jaguars. Many teams will be dying to trade up for Marcus Mariota, and now the Jaguars will be the fortunate franchise to acquire a boatload of picks. Check out my for more.    At least Oakland has its franchise quarterback, right? Jim Nantz exclaimed that the Raiders finally found their guy in Carr once this game was over. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Carr made some very nice throws in this contest, but he could have been picked at least 5 times. The Raiders were very unfortunate that the Chiefs dropped all of those potential interceptions, as a loss would have really helped them. Carr finished 18-of-35 for 174 yards and a touchdown.    Carr's score went to "

   "comment":"Derek Carr. Manning made some decent intermediate throws, but he does not look like the same quarterback who used to crush weak competition during the regular season. Manning finished 21-of-37 for 273 yards. He once again failed to throw a touchdown, though he could've had 1 if Demaryius Thomas didn't drop a back-shoulder throw in the end zone. He also was credited with a lost fumble returned for a score, but that was a lateral pass that was tipped by a Raider, recovered and returned for 6.    Thomas couldn't help his fantasy owners by reaching the end zone, but he still had 8 catches for 115 yards. However, Manning targeted Thomas 17 times, so it's troubling that the pair couldn't connect on half of their attempts to each other. Emmanuel Sanders (6-73) was the only other noteworthy receiver, as Julius Thomas was a no-show once more. He played, but couldn't come up with a single catch.    C.J. Anderson was exceptional once again. He scored thrice while rushing for 87 yards on 13 carries. It was curious to see Ronnie Hillman out-touch him (15-56), and that wasn't just a byproduct of garbage-time opportunities; Anderson had just 1 more attempt than Hillman by halftime.    The Raiders were in this game entering the final quarter, but they curiously waved the white flag with a minute remaining in the third frame. THey had a 4.h-and-4 on the Denver 39, down 30-14 - in other words, 2 scores - but Tony Sparano foolishly decided to punt the ball. The Broncos took over deep in their own territory, but were able to drive down the field and add to their point total to go up 3 scores. And just like that, Oakland's hopes evaporated.

   "comment":"Derek Carrs of the NFL. McCown began poorly; he was very fortunate to have an interception overturned because of a roughing-the-passer penalty that had nothing to do with the throw. He then took a bad sack in the red zone, and he stood at just 165 yards by intermission. Throwing on the Ravens was so much easier for McCown in the second half because of all of those injuries. He consequently finished 36-of-51 for 457 yards and 2 touchdowns. He put together a great game, as he didn't turn the ball over a single time, and he had just 7 incompletions in the second half and overtime. The Browns should still be starting Johnny Manziel, just to see what they have in him, but McCown is definitely the superior player.    Carrs of the NFL.

   "comment":"Derek Carr pick-six iced the victory for Denver. Carr had 2 receivers in the area, but neither inexplicably looked back for the ball. Oakland and Denver had about the same amount of net yardage (the visitor accumulated 9 more), but the mistakes the host made allowed the Broncos to improve to 5-0.    Carr went 26-of-39 for 249 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick-six to go along with a lost fumble. He moved the chains well throughout most of the afternoon, and he launched a deep bomb late that drew a pass interference flag, but he dinked and dunked more than he should have. Perhaps the worst instance of that occurred on a 4.h-and-19 with about 4 minutes remaining. Doing his best impersonation of Alex Smith, Carr inexplicably tossed a checkdown that went nowhere. It's almost as if the Raiders didn't know it was 4.h down. And no, Dilfer, that's not a good play.    With Carr limited, it's no surprise that none of his receivers accumulated more than 54 yards. Carrie. If you can get something decent for him in fantasy, don't hesitate to pull the trigger.    The Raiders, meanwhile, would've had the win if they didn't shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly. It started early when a false start, a Carr sack and a blocked field goal ruined a scoring opportunity. "

He went 23-of-36 for 333 yards and 4 touchdowns, and his numbers could've been even better if it wasn't for some late-game sloppiness when the team was up big. This performance was highly impressive, especially considering the type of defense he was going up against. The Jets missed lots of tackles, but they still have talented personnel that's been capable of shutting down other high-powered scoring attacks.    Despite Carr's great numbers, he and Amari Cooper couldn't hook up very often."

After the opening kickoff, Stafford ripped the ball through the Raiders' secondary with passes to Golden Tate and Lance Moore to move inside the 10-yard line. A holding call on Laken Tomlinson and a dropped touchdown by Eric Ebron led to a Detroit field goal. After a Raiders punt, Stafford kept moving the ball using Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with "

Hudson was missed on a 4.h-and-2 when the Raiders went for it on the Tennessee 36-yard line. The backup center botched a snap, and Oakland turned the ball over on downs as a result. Carr did a nice job of dissecting Tennessee's poor secondary on several drives considering Hudson's absence. However, the numbers don't tell the entire story, as Carr was very fortunate in this contest. I already discussed the game-winning touchdown that should've never happened. Carr, otherwise, had a sequence in which he should've thrown 2 interceptions right before halftime. It looked like he was going to be picked by "

Oakland recovered at the Tennessee 24-yard line, and on the next play, Carr hit Clive Walford (2-27) for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Donald Penn took the score away."

   "comment":"Derek Carr made a bad mistake, throwing the ball into a crowd of defenders. However, the Chargers gave it right back as Antonio Gates fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Perry Riley with Reggie Nelson recovering for Oakland. The Raiders responded with Carr using Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree to move the ball down the field. Oakland was stopped on the goal line to settle for a short field goal. Promptly, Rivers tossed an underthrown pass that was picked off by Sean Smith and returned into San Diego territory, but Sebastian Janikowski missed the field goal. The Chargers got moving and Rivers hit Tyrell Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1.yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On 4.h-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2.point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the 4.h quarter. Chargers punter Drew Kaser had a 16-yard shanked punt that set up the Raiders at the San Diego 32-yard line, and the Raiders turned that into a short touchdown run from fullback Jamize Olawale. The Chargers responded by moving the ball down the field, and Rivers hit Gates on a short touchdown pass to close the Raiders' lead to a field goal. San Diego got in position to tie the game with a field goal, but Kaser fumbled the snap to botch the field goal attempt and ensure another Chargers loss.    Philip Rivers completed 20-of-29 passes for 366 yards with 4 touchdowns with 2 interceptions. Tyrell Williams (5-117-1), Travis Benjamin (7-117) and Hunter Henry (3-74) all played well for the Chargers.    Melvin Gordon ran for 69 yards on 16 carries with his 18-yard touchdown reception. He played well with the exception of another critical fumble.    Derek Carr completed 25-of-40 for 317 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He continues to show that he is blooming franchise quarterback and a winner.    Carr made a bad mistake, throwing the ball into a crowd of defenders. However, the Chargers gave it right back as Antonio Gates fumbled the ball away after getting stripped by Perry Riley with Reggie Nelson recovering for Oakland.

Tampa Bay had trouble moving the ball, but the Raiders continued to give the Bucs penalty yards.

The fact, Tampa Bay ended up losing this game is really astonishing considering.    Jameis Winston came into this game having put up strong numbers against weak defenses, but today he only completed 50 percent of his passes for 180 yards. He did throw for 2 touchdowns, but with so many second chances and the Raiders' secondary allowing the most passing yards coming into the afternoon, it was a disappointing showing.    This contest truly came down to Carr just outplaying everyone, including his own team. Would he have needed 59 pass attempts and 513 yards passing if his team hadn't put them in a hole by 200 yards? They did though, but he put them on his back. There were mistakes, don't get me wrong. When you pass 59 times, you will make mistakes, but going on the road and playing that well while your team sabotages you, that's the sign of a very good quarterback.    "

Carr was pedestrian for most of the contest and struggled to get the ball down the field. For most of the game, Carr focused on throwing checkdowns to his running backs and receivers. The team ran a lot of shallow routes and consistently had Carr throwing the ball in under 2 seconds. It seemed as though the coaches were afraid of Carr getting hit, which they were right to be concerned about. At the same time, it clearly impacted the Raiders' offense in a negative way, so you have to wonder why they didn't wait an extra week to start him. Carr's final stat line looked like this: 21-of-30 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions was not his fault, as it glanced off the hands of his receiver. Still, he just didn't look like himself, and the Raiders suffered as a result. Perhaps he will be healthier for Thursday's matchup with the Chiefs, though the short week will make that difficult.

   "comment":"Derek Carr lofted an underthrown pass that was picked off. And just like that, the Bills were up 20-7 and never looked back.    Despite what I said about the Bills turning the Raiders over numerous times, I don't want to take anything away from Carr lofted an underthrown pass that was picked off. And just like that, the Bills were up 20-7 and never looked back.    Despite what I said about the Bills turning the Raiders over numerous times, I don't want to take anything away from Tyrod Taylor and the rest of the offense, which was extremely efficient in this contest. The Raiders, like the Bills, were missing multiple starters in the secondary, and Taylor took advantage of it. Taylor misfired just 7 times, going 20-of-27 for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The passing yardage number isn't an impressive figure, but because the Bills had the lead for most of the afternoon, Taylor didn't have to force anything downfield. What's important is that any time that Buffalo needed a big play to keep a drive alive, Taylor would deliver.    Of course, Buffalo's best player happened to be LeSean McCoy, who gashed NaVorro Bowman and the Raiders for 151 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He also caught 6 passes for 22 yards. Oakland simply had no answer for McCoy despite Bowman now being in the center of the defense.    Buffalo's leading receiver was Andre Holmes, who got revenge against his former team, catching 3 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown. Jordan Matthews (3-21) had a big gain nullified by penalty. Even Zay Jones got into the mix, snatching 3 receptions for 32 yards. It was a miracle that he didn't have any huge drops.    Meanwhile, Carr posted some misleading stats. He finished 31-of-49 for 313 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. A bulk of Carr's yardage came on a meaningless drive in the 4.h quarter. He didn't look like himself, and it didn't appear as though the Raiders were willing to trust him in the early going, as they called for a run on a third-and-2 play. Carr spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, so it's fair to wonder when he'll be 100 percent.    While Carr regressed, the same could be said for "

They were looking to keep up with the Patriots, and it ended up costing them, as they never had the feel of an offense that was comfortable. This was partly on the Patriots defense, but also because they got down quick and turned the ball over just as quickly. Two drives later, Brady hit Brandin Cooks for the first of his 2 big gainers for the day, with a 52-yard bomb. Brady then picked the Raiders apart, as he finished the drive with his arm, connecting on a short touchdown to Danny Amendola. At that point, it was 14-0, and the Raiders knew they had to score or be trounced. Oakland got the ball back, and on 2nd-and-10, Marshawn Lynch busted off a 25-yard run, then Jalen Richard touched the ball on the next 4 plays for 19 yards. Lynch then went back to work for 11 yards on 2 carries. Then, at the Patriots' 15-yard line, Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered.Carr was intercepted on a deep pass that bounced off Johnny Holton's shoulder pad.
