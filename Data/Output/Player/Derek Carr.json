Carr finished 20-of-32 for 151 yards and 2 touchdowns. That stat line doesn't seem too bad, but consider that he was nearly picked off a few times (rookie "

The completion percentage doesn't look very good, but Carr was betrayed by countless drops, as Oakland had 5 of them in the first half alone. The team was cleaner following intermission, but Carr ultimately cost his squad with some late mistakes. He panicked under pressure and was flagged for intentional grounding. He then fumbled on a strip-sack, but that was nullified by a face mask. And then it all culminated with a game-ending interception into double coverage. It was a horrible decision, as Carr had plenty of time to move the team into field goal range to force overtime. That should've been the worst-case scenario. Instead, Carr's heave was careless and ruined what could have been Oakland's first victory.    Focusing on the positive, the Raiders finally got "

   "comment":"Carr hit Brice Butler for a 55-yard reception inside Arizona's 10-yard line. A few plays later, Darren McFadden (14-48) plunged into the end zone. The Raiders had a chance to tie it up quickly as a few plays after McFadden's score when Cardinals tight end John Carlson deflected an inaccurate Palmer pass up in the air and Charles Woodson picked it off. He returned it 27 yards to the Arizona 13-yard line. That was the first Cardinals interception this season, but Oakland settled for a field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders narrowed the lead to 1 point with a field goal drive, led by runs to McFadden and a few passes. The Cardinals answered with a drive featuring Andre Ellington, and Taylor finished the possession with another short touchdown run. The Raiders had some decent drives that fizzled because of penalties, receivers not getting open and poor execution by the offensive line. Late in the 4.h quarter, Arizona tacked on another field goal to ice the win.    Palmer completed 22-of-31 for 253 yards with 2 scores and an interception. Larry Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for 21 yards.    The workhorse for the Arizona offense was Ellington as he ran for 88 yards on 24 carries with 6 receptions for 72 yards. He is really playing at a high level and allowing Palmer to serve as a game-manager.    Carr completed 16-of-28 passes for 173 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. He had some good plays called back on penalties and was better than the numbers indicate.    "

   "comment":"Carr split out wide and Matt Schaub dropped an errant snap. After recovering the ball, the veteran threw 1 of his telegraphed passes for an interception to Tashaun Gipson. Gipson returned the ball to midfield, and the Browns turned the big play into a field goal. Cleveland added 2 more field goal drives in the first half, but paid the price after tight end Jordan Cameron took a hard hit to the head and went into the locker room with the training staff. He didn't return to the game, and his status going forward looks questionable. The Raiders got a drive going with a beautiful 21-yard, 1.handed reception by Mychal Rivera (7-83) to set up a Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Carr moved the ball again for 3 with a perfect strike for a 30-yard gain to Andre Holmes, who got open against Justin Gilbert."

A 36-yard pass interference penalty on D.J. Hayden set up the Seahawks at the Raiders' 6-yard line. Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker Bruce Irvin tipped a pass up in the air. He came down with the ball and sprinted down the field for a 35-yard touchdown.

Smith was very inconsistent. As mentioned, he was horrible early on. His throws were low and behind his targets, and Kansas City, as a result, averaged a hideous 3.3 yards per play during the first half. Smith, however, finished 20-of-36 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire during a portion of the second half, but his limitations were pretty prevalent on a failed final drive despite that the Raiders began celebrating early, allowing a big return and nearly getting whistled for being way offsides prior to the final play of the game.    Charles didn't have the big game everyone was expecting. He touched the ball only 23 times, which is simply unacceptable. He had 19 carries go for 80 rushing yards, but he at least scored a touchdown as a pass-catcher, logging 4 grabs for 42 receiving yards. Charles also should've drawn a pass interference in the end zone at 1 point during the second quarter, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag.    Yet another week, and yet another game in which no Kansas City wideouts scored a touchdown. Dwayne Bowe (3-42) led the group in yardage. Travis Kelce (4-67) outgained him, while Anthony Fasano (2-30) reeled in Smith's other touchdown.    As for the Raiders, this was a Pyrrhic victory for them. They should have lost, as they have a better strength of schedule than the Jaguars. Many teams will be dying to trade up for Marcus Mariota, and now the Jaguars will be the fortunate franchise to acquire a boatload of picks. Check out my for more.    At least Oakland has its franchise quarterback, right? Jim Nantz exclaimed that the Raiders finally found their guy in Carr once this game was over. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Carr made some very nice throws in this contest, but he could have been picked at least 5 times. The Raiders were very unfortunate that the Chiefs dropped all of those potential interceptions, as a loss would have really helped them. Carr finished 18-of-35 for 174 yards and a touchdown.    Carr's score went to "

   "comment":"Carr. Manning made some decent intermediate throws, but he does not look like the same quarterback who used to crush weak competition during the regular season. Manning finished 21-of-37 for 273 yards. He once again failed to throw a touchdown, though he could've had 1 if Demaryius Thomas didn't drop a back-shoulder throw in the end zone. He also was credited with a lost fumble returned for a score, but that was a lateral pass that was tipped by a Raider, recovered and returned for 6.    Thomas couldn't help his fantasy owners by reaching the end zone, but he still had 8 catches for 115 yards. However, Manning targeted Thomas 17 times, so it's troubling that the pair couldn't connect on half of their attempts to each other. Emmanuel Sanders (6-73) was the only other noteworthy receiver, as Julius Thomas was a no-show once more. He played, but couldn't come up with a single catch.    C.J. Anderson was exceptional once again. He scored thrice while rushing for 87 yards on 13 carries. It was curious to see Ronnie Hillman out-touch him (15-56), and that wasn't just a byproduct of garbage-time opportunities; Anderson had just 1 more attempt than Hillman by halftime.    The Raiders were in this game entering the final quarter, but they curiously waved the white flag with a minute remaining in the third frame. THey had a 4.h-and-4 on the Denver 39, down 30-14 - in other words, 2 scores - but Tony Sparano foolishly decided to punt the ball. The Broncos took over deep in their own territory, but were able to drive down the field and add to their point total to go up 3 scores. And just like that, Oakland's hopes evaporated.    This was not a pretty game for Derek Carr. It was ugly early on, as a pass toward "

He then took a bad sack in the red zone, and he stood at just 165 yards by intermission. Throwing on the Ravens was so much easier for McCown in the second half because of all of those injuries. He consequently finished 36-of-51 for 457 yards and 2 touchdowns. He put together a great game, as he didn't turn the ball over a single time, and he had just 7 incompletions in the second half and overtime. The Browns should still be starting Johnny Manziel, just to see what they have in him, but McCown is definitely the superior player.    "

He went 23-of-36 for 333 yards and 4 touchdowns, and his numbers could've been even better if it wasn't for some late-game sloppiness when the team was up big. This performance was highly impressive, especially considering the type of defense he was going up against.

After the opening kickoff, Stafford ripped the ball through the Raiders' secondary with passes to Golden Tate and Lance Moore to move inside the 10-yard line. A holding call on Laken Tomlinson and a dropped touchdown by Eric Ebron led to a Detroit field goal. After a Raiders punt, Stafford kept moving the ball using Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with "

Hudson was missed on a 4.h-and-2 when the Raiders went for it on the Tennessee 36-yard line. The backup center botched a snap, and Oakland turned the ball over on downs as a result. Carr did a nice job of dissecting Tennessee's poor secondary on several drives considering Hudson's absence. However, the numbers don't tell the entire story, as Carr was very fortunate in this contest. I already discussed the game-winning touchdown that should've never happened. Carr, otherwise, had a sequence in which he should've thrown 2 interceptions right before halftime. It looked like he was going to be picked by "

Oakland had better success after intermission, as the line began giving Carr more time. Carr ultimately finished 12-of-29 for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns. He still had some blunders, including taking a sack to move the team out of field-goal range, but he was definitely sharper after halftime, so Jack Del Rio and his staff needs to be given credit for making the proper adjustments.

   "comment":"Carr, who threw the ball an amazing 59 times, completing 40 of those to 9 players for 513 yards and 4 touchdowns. And with that explosion of offense, this game was still in no way an easy win for the Raiders, as they had their quarterback set the team record for the most passing yards in a game, but they also, as a team, set the team record for the most penalties and penalty yards.    Tampa Bay had trouble moving the ball, but the Raiders continued to give the Bucs penalty yards. Just in 1 drive, the Buccaneers were given 4 first downs on Oakland penalties, with 3 of those coming on third downs. The fact, Tampa Bay ended up losing this game is really astonishing considering.    Jameis Winston came into this game having put up strong numbers against weak defenses, but today he only completed 50 percent of his passes for 180 yards. He did throw for 2 touchdowns, but with so many second chances and the Raiders' secondary allowing the most passing yards coming into the afternoon, it was a disappointing showing.    This contest truly came down to Carr just outplaying everyone, including his own team. Would he have needed 59 pass attempts and 513 yards passing if his team hadn't put them in a hole by 200 yards? They did though, but he put them on his back. There were mistakes, don't get me wrong. When you pass 59 times, you will make mistakes, but going on the road and playing that well while your team sabotages you, that's the sign of a very good quarterback.    "

   "comment":"Carr was getting his hand checked out. I would've bet my house, soul and <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> DVD collection that Buffalo would've covered at that point. The Bills did not, as they were outscored 29-0 from that point forward.    What an absolute collapse by the Bills. Just a few plays into the second half, it looked like they were going to run away with the game. After intermission, they jumped out to a 24-9 lead and had all the momentum. Then, the Raiders suddenly made a comeback, scoring 29 unanswered points to take control. The score would hold at 38-24 to give the Raiders their 10th win of the season. For the Raiders, 1 of their best weapons continues to be Derek Carr. One of the frontrunners of the MVP race, Carr put together another solid performance on Sunday. Despite a mediocre performance in the first half, Carr finished the day with a good stat line, going 19-of-35 for 260 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, he was not too strong in the first half, and it looked like his banged-up finger was bothering him. Carr was significantly more accurate after halftime. He was able to toss the 2 touchdowns. One was a laser to "

He was given a short field on his initial drive because of a failed Tennessee onside kick attempt, and he ultimately found Amari Cooper in the end zone. Agent Cooper muscled in for 6. as Adoree Jackson whiffed on a tackle. Jackson also helped set up Oakland's next scoring drive with a 24-yard defensive pass interference on Michael Crabtree. Jackson came back to break up a touchdown fired in Cooper's direction, but the Raiders should've scored. Cooper dropped a touchdown later on the drive. Tennessee tried to make improvements to its defense this offseason, but it appears to not have worked. It's still way too early in the season to make final judgments, but the early returns are not looking good.    Conversely, Marshawn Lynch had a strong debut. The numbers don't pop out - he gained 76 yards on 18 carries - but he had some powerful runs. On 1 occasion, he appeared to be stopped on short yardage, but he muscled through the defender to pick up the first down.    Cooper may have scored the first touchdown, but he converted on just 5 of his 13 targets. He logged 62 yards, but should've scored on 2 other occasions if it weren't for a couple of drops. Crabtree led the Raiders in receiving with 6 grabs for 83 yards, 1 of which was a great, diving catch that he made as he was getting hit. Seth Roberts reeled in Carr's other touchdown.    Sebastian Janikowski missed his first game since 2001, but the Raiders did just fine without him. Some guy named "

   "comment":"Carr deserves part of the blame for this loss. He didn't have a strong performance, and it is clear that he is still not 100 percent as he recovers from his back injury. Carr was pedestrian for most of the contest and struggled to get the ball down the field. For most of the game, Carr focused on throwing checkdowns to his running backs and receivers. The team ran a lot of shallow routes and consistently had Carr throwing the ball in under 2 seconds. It seemed as though the coaches were afraid of Carr getting hit, which they were right to be concerned about. At the same time, it clearly impacted the Raiders' offense in a negative way, so you have to wonder why they didn't wait an extra week to start him. Carr's final stat line looked like this: 21-of-30 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions was not his fault, as it glanced off the hands of his receiver. Still, he just didn't look like himself, and the Raiders suffered as a result. Perhaps he will be healthier for Thursday's matchup with the Chiefs, though the short week will make that difficult.    Once again, "

   "comment":"Carr lofted an underthrown pass that was picked off. And just like that, the Bills were up 20-7 and never looked back.    Despite what I said about the Bills turning the Raiders over numerous times, I don't want to take anything away from Tyrod Taylor and the rest of the offense, which was extremely efficient in this contest. The Raiders, like the Bills, were missing multiple starters in the secondary, and Taylor took advantage of it. Taylor misfired just 7 times, going 20-of-27 for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The passing yardage number isn't an impressive figure, but because the Bills had the lead for most of the afternoon, Taylor didn't have to force anything downfield. What's important is that any time that Buffalo needed a big play to keep a drive alive, Taylor would deliver.    Of course, Buffalo's best player happened to be LeSean McCoy, who gashed NaVorro Bowman and the Raiders for 151 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He also caught 6 passes for 22 yards. Oakland simply had no answer for McCoy despite Bowman now being in the center of the defense.    Buffalo's leading receiver was Andre Holmes, who got revenge against his former team, catching 3 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown. Jordan Matthews (3-21) had a big gain nullified by penalty. Even Zay Jones got into the mix, snatching 3 receptions for 32 yards. It was a miracle that he didn't have any huge drops.    Meanwhile, Carr posted some misleading stats. He finished 31-of-49 for 313 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. A bulk of Carr's yardage came on a meaningless drive in the 4.h quarter. He didn't look like himself, and it didn't appear as though the Raiders were willing to trust him in the early going, as they called for a run on a third-and-2 play. Carr spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, so it's fair to wonder when he'll be 100 percent.    While Carr regressed, the same could be said for "

They were looking to keep up with the Patriots, and it ended up costing them, as they never had the feel of an offense that was comfortable. This was partly on the Patriots defense, but also because they got down quick and turned the ball over just as quickly. Two drives later, Brady hit Brandin Cooks for the first of his 2 big gainers for the day, with a 52-yard bomb. Brady then picked the Raiders apart, as he finished the drive with his arm, connecting on a short touchdown to Danny Amendola. At that point, it was 14-0, and the Raiders knew they had to score or be trounced. Oakland got the ball back, and on 2nd-and-10, Marshawn Lynch busted off a 25-yard run, then Jalen Richard touched the ball on the next 4 plays for 19 yards. Lynch then went back to work for 11 yards on 2 carries. Then, at the Patriots' 15-yard line, Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered."
