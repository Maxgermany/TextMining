   "comment":"Derek Carr looked so impressive in the preseason finale against Seattle's starting defensive unit that the Raiders didn't waste much time naming him the starter over the banged-up Matt Schaub. It appeared to be the correct decision, but maybe Oakland shouldn't have been as aggressive. Carr had a dreadful performance and didn't appear as though he was ready to start in the NFL. Carr finished 20-of-32 for 151 yards and 2 touchdowns. That stat line doesn't seem too bad, but consider that he was nearly picked off a few times (rookie "

   "comment":"Derek Carr had a record-setting day for a Raider rookie quarterback. No Oakland first-year signal-caller had thrown 4 touchdowns in a single contest, but Carr did exactly that against 1 of the NFL's top defenses, going 18-of-34 for 282 yards and an interception otherwise. The completion percentage doesn't look very good, but Carr was betrayed by countless drops, as Oakland had 5 of them in the first half alone. The team was cleaner following intermission, but Carr ultimately cost his squad with some late mistakes. He panicked under pressure and was flagged for intentional grounding. He then fumbled on a strip-sack, but that was nullified by a face mask. And then it all culminated with a game-ending interception into double coverage. It was a horrible decision, as Carr had plenty of time to move the team into field goal range to force overtime. That should've been the worst-case scenario. Instead, Carr's heave was careless and ruined what could have been Oakland's first victory.    Focusing on the positive, the Raiders finally got "

With the promising Carr, we could see the return of the Silver and Black as a relevant team in the NFL.

   "comment":"Derek Carr. Manning made some decent intermediate throws, but he does not look like the same quarterback who used to crush weak competition during the regular season. Manning finished 21-of-37 for 273 yards. He once again failed to throw a touchdown, though he could've had 1 if Demaryius Thomas didn't drop a back-shoulder throw in the end zone. He also was credited with a lost fumble returned for a score, but that was a lateral pass that was tipped by a Raider, recovered and returned for 6.    Thomas couldn't help his fantasy owners by reaching the end zone, but he still had 8 catches for 115 yards. However, Manning targeted Thomas 17 times, so it's troubling that the pair couldn't connect on half of their attempts to each other. Emmanuel Sanders (6-73) was the only other noteworthy receiver, as Julius Thomas was a no-show once more. He played, but couldn't come up with a single catch.    C.J. Anderson was exceptional once again. He scored thrice while rushing for 87 yards on 13 carries. It was curious to see Ronnie Hillman out-touch him (15-56), and that wasn't just a byproduct of garbage-time opportunities; Anderson had just 1 more attempt than Hillman by halftime.    The Raiders were in this game entering the final quarter, but they curiously waved the white flag with a minute remaining in the third frame. THey had a 4.h-and-4 on the Denver 39, down 30-14 - in other words, 2 scores - but Tony Sparano foolishly decided to punt the ball. The Broncos took over deep in their own territory, but were able to drive down the field and add to their point total to go up 3 scores. And just like that, Oakland's hopes evaporated.    This was not a pretty game for Derek Carr. It was ugly early on, as a pass toward "

   "comment":"Derek Carrs of the NFL. McCown began poorly; he was very fortunate to have an interception overturned because of a roughing-the-passer penalty that had nothing to do with the throw. He then took a bad sack in the red zone, and he stood at just 165 yards by intermission. Throwing on the Ravens was so much easier for McCown in the second half because of all of those injuries. He consequently finished 36-of-51 for 457 yards and 2 touchdowns. He put together a great game, as he didn't turn the ball over a single time, and he had just 7 incompletions in the second half and overtime. The Browns should still be starting Johnny Manziel, just to see what they have in him, but McCown is definitely the superior player.    "

   "comment":"Derek Carr pick-six iced the victory for Denver. Carr had 2 receivers in the area, but neither inexplicably looked back for the ball. Oakland and Denver had about the same amount of net yardage (the visitor accumulated 9 more), but the mistakes the host made allowed the Broncos to improve to 5-0.    Carr went 26-of-39 for 249 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick-six to go along with a lost fumble. He moved the chains well throughout most of the afternoon, and he launched a deep bomb late that drew a pass interference flag, but he dinked and dunked more than he should have. Perhaps the worst instance of that occurred on a 4.h-and-19 with about 4 minutes remaining. Doing his best impersonation of Alex Smith, Carr inexplicably tossed a checkdown that went nowhere. It's almost as if the Raiders didn't know it was 4.h down. And no, Dilfer, that's not a good play.    With Carr limited, it's no surprise that none of his receivers accumulated more than 54 yards. "

Hudson was missed on a 4.h-and-2 when the Raiders went for it on the Tennessee 36-yard line. The backup center botched a snap, and Oakland turned the ball over on downs as a result. Carr did a nice job of dissecting Tennessee's poor secondary on several drives considering Hudson's absence. However, the numbers don't tell the entire story, as Carr was very fortunate in this contest. I already discussed the game-winning touchdown that should've never happened. Carr, otherwise, had a sequence in which he should've thrown 2 interceptions right before halftime. It looked like he was going to be picked by "

Carr's great pass protection on that particular play was a rare instance, however, as the Chiefs constantly swarmed him. He just didn't have much of a chance, but it's worth noting that his mechanics have declined as the season has progressed. "

Tampa Bay had trouble moving the ball, but the Raiders continued to give the Bucs penalty yards. Just in 1 drive, the Buccaneers were given 4 first downs on Oakland penalties, with 3 of those coming on third downs.

The Bills did not, as they were outscored 29-0 from that point forward.    What an absolute collapse by the Bills. Just a few plays into the second half, it looked like they were going to run away with the game. After intermission, they jumped out to a 24-9 lead and had all the momentum. Then, the Raiders suddenly made a comeback, scoring 29 unanswered points to take control. The score would hold at 38-24 to give the Raiders their 10th win of the season. For the Raiders, 1 of their best weapons continues to be Derek Carr. One of the frontrunners of the MVP race, Carr put together another solid performance on Sunday. Despite a mediocre performance in the first half, Carr finished the day with a good stat line, going 19-of-35 for 260 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, he was not too strong in the first half, and it looked like his banged-up finger was bothering him. Carr was significantly more accurate after halftime. He was able to toss the 2 touchdowns. One was a laser to "

Actually, with the Chargers, Colts and Broncos on the horizon, they may not win another contest this season. Carr was that bad in this game. He had major issues connecting with his targets. He constantly was way off the mark on his throws, even failing to hit players just 3 yards in front of him. Some might blame the weather, but Carr was seen wincing on a number of his passes, particularly on 1 in which he had "

Manuel entered the field and didn't seem like he'd give the Raiders much of a chance. Carr struggled against Denver's No Fly Zone, outside of 1 inexplicable 99-yard drive, so how was Manuel going to do anything? Well, to almost quote Chris Berman, that's why they play the entire game. The Raiders couldn't do anything with Manuel at first, but the former first-round pick caught fire and led 2 impressive drives. The first nearly concluded with a touchdown, but "

The team ran a lot of shallow routes and consistently had Carr throwing the ball in under 2 seconds. It seemed as though the coaches were afraid of Carr getting hit, which they were right to be concerned about. At the same time, it clearly impacted the Raiders' offense in a negative way, so you have to wonder why they didn't wait an extra week to start him. Carr's final stat line looked like this: 21-of-30 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions was not his fault, as it glanced off the hands of his receiver. Still, he just didn't look like himself, and the Raiders suffered as a result. Perhaps he will be healthier for Thursday's matchup with the Chiefs, though the short week will make that difficult.    Once again, "

   "comment":"Derek Carr was intercepted on a deep pass that bounced off Johnny Holton's shoulder pad. They were looking to keep up with the Patriots, and it ended up costing them, as they never had the feel of an offense that was comfortable. This was partly on the Patriots defense, but also because they got down quick and turned the ball over just as quickly. Two drives later, Brady hit Brandin Cooks for the first of his 2 big gainers for the day, with a 52-yard bomb. Brady then picked the Raiders apart, as he finished the drive with his arm, connecting on a short touchdown to Danny Amendola. At that point, it was 14-0, and the Raiders knew they had to score or be trounced. Oakland got the ball back, and on 2nd-and-10, Marshawn Lynch busted off a 25-yard run, then Jalen Richard touched the ball on the next 4 plays for 19 yards. Lynch then went back to work for 11 yards on 2 carries. Then, at the Patriots' 15-yard line, Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered."
