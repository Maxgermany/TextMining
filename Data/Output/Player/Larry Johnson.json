   "comment":"Johnson continued to struggle, gaining just 22 yards on 12 carries and fumbling once versus a Raiders defense that couldn't stop the Broncos last week. There's a reason I declared I wouldn't take Johnson until the fourth round of any fantasy draft. His offensive line sucks, and he could pretty much be done, as Herm Edwards ruined his career by giving him 416 carries in 2006.    Huard left the game with what the Chiefs called mild head trauma. Translated out of football terms, this means quarterback suckiness.   "

I say this every week, but there is no reason that the archaic Johnson should be getting more touches than Charles.    Norv Turner had 1 of the dumbest challenges ever in this game. In the first quarter, Gates dropped a touchdown that bobbled out of his hands. The thought of challenging didn't even enter my mind. When Norv threw the red flag, CBS announcer Dick Enberg laughed and said, I don't think this has a chance. When a nice guy like Enberg makes fun of you, you know you've epically failed.   "

Correll Buckhalter (6-18) didn't contribute much.    But compared to Jamaal Charles, both Moreno nor Buckhalter were non-factors. Charles carried the ball 25 times for 259 yards and 2 scores. I've talked about this before; Charles has to be in the mix as a first-round fantasy running back next summer. He's incredibly talented, and it's a disgrace that Todd Haley waited until Larry Johnson berated motorcycle riders to utilize him.    Save for 1 horrific interception, "

Jabar Gaffney played the role of Marshall, catching 14 balls for 213 yards.    Knowshon Moreno had a great performance to close out the season, rushing for 50 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 14 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 48 more yards. Correll Buckhalter (6-18) didn't contribute much.    But compared to Jamaal Charles, both Moreno nor Buckhalter were non-factors. Charles carried the ball 25 times for 259 yards and 2 scores. I've talked about this before; Charles has to be in the mix as a first-round fantasy running back next summer. He's incredibly talented, and it's a disgrace that Todd Haley waited until Larry Johnson berated motorcycle riders to utilize him.    Save for 1 horrific interception, "
