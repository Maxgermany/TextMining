   "comment":"Larry Johnson continued to struggle, gaining just 22 yards on 12 carries and fumbling once versus a Raiders defense that couldn't stop the Broncos last week. There's a reason I declared I wouldn't take Johnson until the 4.h round of any fantasy draft. His offensive line sucks, and he could pretty much be done, as Herm Edwards ruined his career by giving him 416 carries in 2006.    Huard left the game with what the Chiefs called mild head trauma. Translated out of football terms, this means quarterback suckiness.   "
