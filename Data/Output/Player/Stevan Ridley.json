The Bills out-executed the Patriots into the third quarter. New England missed 2 field goals; Welker fumbled the ball away; Gronkowski also coughed the ball up and let go of a potential touchdown. Once the Patriots put their foot on the gas, Buffalo had become a turnover machine and Ryan Fitzpatrick was throwing frequent interceptions.    New England stayed in the game because its front 7 was awesome. Vince Wilfork tipped a pass up and Jerod Mayo came down with the interception. C.J. Spiller (8-33) fumbled the ball inside the Patriots' 5.yard line after a massive hit from Brandon Spikes. Spikes forced another fumble in the second half. Fitzpatrick had T.J. Graham running deep with a step on Devin McCourty, but the pass was underthrown and fell into McCourty. McCourty had his second pick on another under thrown pass.    It was a mixed day for Gronkowski (5-104). He had a 41-yard catch that led to a short Ridley touchdown. He also was stripped of the ball by safety Jarius Byrd. A play after Gronkowksi's fumble, Fitzpatrick lofted in a touchdown pass to Chandler (4-62) over Chung.    Bills' corner "

Shane Vereen also coughed the ball up for New England. The 49ers, meanwhile, had issues with the snap. Colin Kaepernick bobbled the ball on an attempted 4.h-down sneak - 1 of his 4 botched snaps. The difference between the 2 squads was the quarterback play. Save for 1 interception, Kaepernick was on fire, connecting on multiple downfield strikes. He completed 5 passes of 24 yards or longer. Tom Brady, meanwhile, was a mess early on. He was just 10-of-19 for 76 yards and an interception that was his fault at halftime. He tossed a second pick in the third quarter, but that was on Aaron Hernandez, whose alligator arms allowed the 49ers tip the pass and intercept it. The Patriots had just 6 first downs at intermission, but moved the chains a whopping 26 times afterward. Brady ultimately finished 36-of-65 for 443 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 picks. He nearly led an amazing comeback from down 31-3, but fell just a bit short. Brady was magnificent for the most part in the second half, but uncharacteristically missed some manageable throws. He threw way high on a key 4th-and-2 inside his own 20, which gave the 49ers a chip-shot field goal that put this contest out of reach. Brady did lead the team completely back though - he tied the game at 31 in the middle of the 4.h quarter, but following a great return, Kaepernick hit Michael Crabtree for a 38-yard touchdown which ended up being the decisive score. Kaepernick finished 14-of-25 for 216 yards, a whopping 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He also rushed 7 times for 28 yards.    Two of Kaepernick's scores went to Crabtree (7-102), who now has 23 catches for 301 yards and the 2 touchdowns in the past 3 weeks. Kaepernick also found Randy Moss (2-36) and Delanie Walker in the end zone. Vernon Davis hauled in 1 reception for 10 yards. Kaepernick actually had him for a potential score, but overshot him during 1 of his rare poor attempts.    The 49ers ran the ball extremely well. In addition to Kaepernick, 2 other 49ers averaged about 4 yards per carry: Frank Gore (21-83) and LaMichael James (7-28).    As for New England's ground attack, Belichick benched both Ridley and Vereen because of their fumbles. He turned to the reliable "

With Dobson and Thompkins playing so poorly, Brady seemed so out of sync. He spent the entire first half yelling at his teammates, but he just seemed defeated after intermission. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes for the first time in a game since Week 15, 2009, going 19-of-39 for 185 yards and a touchdown. The score came on the first drive of the contest - an 81-yard possession. The Patriots mustered just 151 yards the rest of the way, compared to 318 for the Jets. They were just 4-of-18 on third down and managed just moved the chains 9 times in this entire contest. The Patriots will be better eventually, but they'll need Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola back. And who knows when they'll be available? In the meantime, all Brady will have to work with is Edelman (13-78), who was the lone bright spot for New England's offense - and even he wasn't flawless; he appeared to lose a fumble, but the call was reversed.

Gronkowski led the way with 9 grabs for 143 yards and a score (as mentioned, he nearly had 2). Danny Amendola (4-122, TD) was brilliant for the first time all year, while Aaron Dobson (5-130) found the end zone twice. Dobson was targeted 11 times if penalties are included. This includes 1 sequence in which Brady fired 5 consecutive passes to him. Kenbrell Thompkins, by the way, was a healthy scratch.    The Patriots also ran the ball extremely well. Ridley gained 115 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. The biggest take-away here is that Ridley continued to handle the workload despite losing a fumble.
