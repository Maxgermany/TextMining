   "comment":"Muhammad Wilkerson's ejection for throwing 2 punches. Meanwhile, Smith got away with a couple of turnovers after intermission. Smith nearly threw an interception, and he also appeared to heave a backward pass that was inexplicably ruled an incompletion. The reversal even had CBS ref Mike Carey perplexed.    Smith missed Decker, who snagged a team-high 4 balls for 63 yards and Smith's lone aerial touchdown. When Decker left the game, Smith had to focus on Kerley and his mediocre tight ends. It's no surprise that New York's offense was stymied against a porous defense in the second half.    "
