   "comment":"Damarious Randall was also knocked out, further thinning Green Bay's injury-ravaged secondary.   Randall Cobb in the end zone and also missed him for a deep gain down the sideline. He whiffed on several other throws. Rodgers, for whatever reason, doesn't look like himself.    With Jordy Nelson covered by Claiborne for about a half, Rodgers spent a ton of time throwing to Ty Montgomery, who caught 10 balls for 98 yards. Nelson ultimately finished with 3 grabs for 68 yards, though he lost a fumble early in the game. Cobb hauled in Rodgers' sole touchdown, but as mentioned, he could've had another. Cobb finished with 7 receptions for 53 yards.    Eddie Lacy continues to look way more spry than last year; he tallied 65 yards on 17 carries. He successfully hurdled numerous defenders in this contest, but he once again failed to reach the end zone.    The Packers sustained 2 injuries. One was to Davante Adams (2-34), who was down for a while, but walked off with an apparent concussion. Damarious Randall was also knocked out, further thinning Green Bay's injury-ravaged secondary.
