   "comment":"Colombo, though 1 of Romo's sack-turnovers was the result of his failure to read a corner blitz by the Packers.    Romo finished 24-of-39 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 pick and 2 fumbles. Romo was victimized by some drops, but he was pretty much ineffective for most of the game. A good amount of his yardage came in junk time.    Roy Williams actually caught 5 balls for 105 yards and a touchdown, though he had the aforementioned fumble. "
