Arizona hasn't been able to cover tight ends all year, and Willson exposed that, leading the Seahawks with 139 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns on just 3 receptions, torching the anemic Larry Foote each time. Doug Baldwin (7-113) also had a big game, while rookie Paul Richardson (7-52) also contributed. Richardson saw more targets than usual because Jermaine Kearse was knocked out with a hamstring in the second quarter.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals are barely worth mentioning. Everything they've worked for this whole season is for naught because of injuries to the quarterback position. They did keep this game close for a while - it was 14-6 entering the 4.h quarter - but missed out on numerous opportunities. Ryan Lindley couldn't get the ball to an open John Brown on a third down. Michael Floyd dropped a deep pass. Lindley underthrew Brown a bit in the end zone. Peterson dropped an interception which would've given Arizona the ball in the red zone. Floyd tipped a pass away from Larry Fitzgerald for a first-down conversion on a miscue. Cromartie fell down on a long Baldwin reception. The Cardinals needed things to go their way considering their quarterback situation; instead, they just couldn't get any breaks beyond Hauschka's missed field goals.    Arizona's defense sucked, but Lindley was even worse. His overall numbers say it all, as he went 14-of-35 for 178 yards and an interception. He had some nice throws, including a nice rainbow to Floyd, who caught the pass over "

   "comment":"Christine Michael looked pretty solid, as he gained 70 yards on 21 carries. Had the Seahawks lost, it wouldn't have been because of Marshawn Lynch's absence. It appears as though Michael is finally living up to his ability.    One final note: It's an absolute embarrassment that Coleman was officiating this game. Not only did he miss the obvious intentional grounding, he also failed to overturn an easy call when replay showed that a Seattle player was short of the first-down marker early on. Only the top officials are supposed to be on the field during the playoffs, so that begs the question why the senile Coleman was allowed to officiate a postseason contest. Coleman is 1 of the most incompetent, corrupt refs in the NFL, so whoever made the decision to assign him to this game should be fired immediately. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Christine Michael (5-22) and was robbed of a touchdown in the 4.h quarter when the officials made an incorrect call and a terrible ruling on a replay review. Thomas Rawls will be returning soon, but it's hard to imagine the Seahawks shying away from Prosise, who was absolutely terrific.    Before moving on to the Patriots, Pete Carroll's decision at the end of the game needs to be discussed. Following a touchdown, the Seahawks were up 31-24, with an extra point pending. Carroll went for 2. The announcers criticized this move, but I didn't mind it. Converting would've meant a 2.possession game, so the game would've effectively been over. Essentially, it came down to Carroll trusting his offense's chances of getting 2 yards than his defense's ability to stop Tom Brady from getting 2 yards. Ironically, New England was stopped at the goal line at he very end.    Brady had another strong performance against a Seattle defense that welcomed back Chancellor. He finished 23-of-32 for 316 yards, but had some blemishes, including an interception into double coverage. The ball just died on him. It was the first pick thrown by a New England quarterback all year.

   "comment":"Christine Michael. Instead, Rawls put together another unimpressive performance, carrying the ball 8 times for 8 yards and dropping a pass. He never saw the field in the second half due to a shoulder injury. Moving forward, it would behoove the Seahawks to use Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the 4.h quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him.

One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback Russell Wilson. Wilson put together a stellar stat line for the Seahawks, and his play reflected that. Wilson went 29-of-45 for 350 yards and 4 touchdowns. He not only led the team in passing yards, but he was their leading rusher as well - 10 carries for 36 yards.

He was able to isolate the matchups that he wanted to target, all while avoiding targeting Patrick Peterson too much. Any other week, this type of performance would have won Wilson the game. This week, it did not. Still, if he plays like this in the playoffs, the team will be in excellent shape.    That said, Seattle's running attack will not be in good shape. Thomas Rawls was supposed to lead the way for the team. That is why they waived Christine Michael. Instead, Rawls put together another unimpressive performance, carrying the ball 8 times for 8 yards and dropping a pass. He never saw the field in the second half due to a shoulder injury.
