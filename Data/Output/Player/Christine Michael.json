   "comment":"Michael (6-26) were able to split the workload.    Arizona hasn't been able to cover tight ends all year, and Willson exposed that, leading the Seahawks with 139 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns on just 3 receptions, torching the anemic Larry Foote each time. Doug Baldwin (7-113) also had a big game, while rookie Paul Richardson (7-52) also contributed. Richardson saw more targets than usual because Jermaine Kearse was knocked out with a hamstring in the second quarter.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals are barely worth mentioning. Everything they've worked for this whole season is for naught because of injuries to the quarterback position. They did keep this game close for a while - it was 14-6 entering the fourth quarter - but missed out on numerous opportunities. Ryan Lindley couldn't get the ball to an open John Brown on a third down. Michael Floyd dropped a deep pass. Lindley underthrew Brown a bit in the end zone. Peterson dropped an interception which would've given Arizona the ball in the red zone. Floyd tipped a pass away from Larry Fitzgerald for a first-down conversion on a miscue. Cromartie fell down on a long Baldwin reception. The Cardinals needed things to go their way considering their quarterback situation; instead, they just couldn't get any breaks beyond Hauschka's missed field goals.    Arizona's defense sucked, but Lindley was even worse. His overall numbers say it all, as he went 14-of-35 for 178 yards and an interception. He had some nice throws, including a nice rainbow to Floyd, who caught the pass over "

After trading some punts, Wilson struck again with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett. Johnson soon moved the ball for the Browns with a 39-yard run. That led to a Cleveland field goal.

   "comment":"Michael's arms. Later on the drive, fullback Will Tukuafu lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Later in the opening half, Russell Wilson threw a 48-yard pass that was wiped out because he was barely over the line of scrimmage when he released the ball, and then he hurled a careless, punt-like interception. Despite all of this, the Seahawks still had a chance to win at the end. However, Wilson lost a fumble in the red zone after picking up a first down on a second-and-13. It looked like a great play at first to give Seattle a first-and-10 in the red zone, but replay review caught Wilson losing control of the ball mere nanoseconds prior to his knee hitting the ground.    Wilson finished 25-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns, an interception and a lost fumble. Wilson's stat line looks fine, but both of his touchdowns came late, so garbage time definitely enhanced his numbers; Wilson was just 10-of-18 for 92 yards and a pick by halftime. Wilson had been on fire entering this contest, but it looked like he reverted to early-season form. It wasn't really much of his fault though, as the offensive line struggled to handle Aaron Donald and the other St. Louis pass-rushers. Wilson was constantly running for his life, and if he weren't so elusive, he would've absorbed way more than 4 sacks.    Wilson actually led Seattle in rushing, picking up 39 yards on 6 scrambles. The Seahawks struggled to run the ball, as neither Bryce Brown (7-9) nor Christine Michael (6-6) found much room versus St. Louis' stout front. "

It appears as though Michael is finally living up to his ability.    One final note: It's an absolute embarrassment that Coleman was officiating this game. Not only did he miss the obvious intentional grounding, he also failed to overturn an easy call when replay showed that a Seattle player was short of the first-down marker early on. Only the top officials are supposed to be on the field during the playoffs, so that begs the question why the senile Coleman was allowed to officiate a postseason contest. Coleman is 1 of the most incompetent, corrupt refs in the NFL, so whoever made the decision to assign him to this game should be fired immediately.   "

   "comment":"Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the fourth quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback Russell Wilson. Wilson put together a stellar stat line for the Seahawks, and his play reflected that. Wilson went 29-of-45 for 350 yards and 4 touchdowns. He not only led the team in passing yards, but he was their leading rusher as well - 10 carries for 36 yards. On the game-tying drive, Wilson orchestrated an excellent offensive sequence that featured him entirely. Wilson was able to move around the pocket and correctly diagnose all of his reads. He was able to isolate the matchups that he wanted to target, all while avoiding targeting Patrick Peterson too much. Any other week, this type of performance would have won Wilson the game. This week, it did not. Still, if he plays like this in the playoffs, the team will be in excellent shape.    That said, Seattle's running attack will not be in good shape. Thomas Rawls was supposed to lead the way for the team. That is why they waived Christine Michael. Instead, Rawls put together another unimpressive performance, carrying the ball 8 times for 8 yards and dropping a pass. He never saw the field in the second half due to a shoulder injury. Moving forward, it would behoove the Seahawks to use "

   "comment":"Michael (10-47) performing better, just seemed pretty foolish. The Giants capitalized with their only touchdown of the game, but it obviously didn't end up hurting the Packers.    Green Bay will move on to the divisional round of the playoffs, where it will battle the No. 1 seed Cowboys. Dallas defeated the Packers in Lambeau, 30-16, back in Week 6, but Green Bay had a Thursday night game coming up, and this Packer squad is much better than it was back in October.    The Giants couldn't really do much on offense, thanks in part to numerous drops. "

   "comment":"Michael (6-11) and Ripkowski (3-11). Montgomery also got hurt, while Ripkowski was guilty of a second uncalled fumble, but coughed up the rock late when the game was out of hand. Dan Quinn, however, did the honorable thing and opted not to challenge.    Green Bay going on a great run to close out the year saved Mike McCarthy's job, so he won't be fired for this defeat. However, his poor coaching was on display in this contest. McCarthy failed to make any sort of appropriate adjustments, and his team simply didn't look prepared to play. Perhaps that was because several of their players were stricken with the flu this past week, but that doesn't excuse Green Bay's delay-of-game penalty on a kickoff. Let me repeat that. They had a delay of game on a kickoff. The only time I've ever seen that was in a Madden game.   "
