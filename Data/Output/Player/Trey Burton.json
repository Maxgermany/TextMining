   "comment":"Burton (7-65) looked like another good intermediate weapon, while Darren Sproles caught the only touchdown for Wentz.    The Eagles were happy to welcome back Ryan Mathews to their back-by-committee system today. Mathews saw 15 carries for 60 yards, but was mostly bottled up in the second half. Mathews is only a mediocre runner, and he is not a recommended start in most fantasy formats. If you are desperate, use him as a FLEX. Normally, I would prefer Darren Sproles, who saw 5 carries for 27 yards and caught a touchdown, but he got knocked out in the second half by a pretty dirty Deshazor Everett hit. Sproles was getting ready to return a punt when Everett put a massive blow on him. He got there a split second before the ball and gave Sproles a knock to the head.    There was actually some long snapper drama in this game for the Eagles. Their long snapper, Jon Dorenbos, who had played in 162 consecutive contests, left with a wrist injury. This forced tight end Brent Celek to operate as the long snapper for a field goal. Celek had a poor snap on what was a missed field goal, and then was injured on a punt. After that, another tight end, Trey Burton, played the position. He executed on the 1 field goal he snapped for. It was a pretty interesting storyline from what was an exciting NFC East battle.    Final Note: The Redskins may have lost 2 of their top middle linebackers this week. "

   "comment":"Burton for no gain. The end result isn't impressive, but Wentz avoided a big loss in the red zone, gave his teammate a chance to score, and set up a manageable third-down situation on the following play. Wentz later had a nifty scramble to move the chains in the red zone, setting up a touchdown to Zach Ertz.    Speaking of Ertz, the talented tight end had a big game, snatching 13 of his 16 targets for a whopping 139 yards and 2 touchdowns. He handed 1 of the touchdown footballs to some baseball player named Mike Trout, who apparently gave every single Eagle a pair of shoes this week. I don't know why any of this matters, but the baseball-obsessed FOX broadcast made a big deal about it.    Elsewhere in the receiving corps, the other tight end, Burton, was next with 5 catches for 39 yards. Jordan Matthews was out, so the wide receiver who posted the best stats was "
