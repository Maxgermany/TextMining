   "comment":"McCluster for a 38-yard Hail Mary score just prior to halftime. Brian Urlacher had an opportunity at an interception, but batted the ball down. Perhaps teams need to rethink this strategy, since we're about a year removed from that infamous Gus Johnson call on the David Garrard-Mike Thomas Hail Mary. It's only fitting that Kansas City would finally score this way. Despite the addition of Kyle Orton, Todd Haley stubbornly named Palko the starter, but benched him early on. Orton's first pass was an underthrown flea flicker, and he injured his finger when he banged it on a Chicago Bear player's helmet. Palko would finish a nondescript 17-of-30 for 157 yards and that score.    Of course, the big injury was to Matt Forte, who was knocked out when Derrick Johnson's shoulder pad collided with his knee. If Forte's is out for more than 2 weeks, Chicago's chances of going to the playoffs are severely diminished. Forte was the team's entire offense, and Chicago was completely lost when he left the game. Marion Barber rushed for 44 yards on 14 carries in relief. He's a nice, short-yardage battering ram, but he's incapable of shouldering a full workload at this stage of his career.    Caleb Hanie was awful again. He went 11-of-24 for 133 yards and 3 interceptions, 1 of which was on a desperation Hail Mary at the very end, so that shouldn't really count. However, his first pick was severely underthrown in the third quarter. He also missed a wide-open Earl Bennett for a touchdown just prior to halftime. Hanie should have thrown a score to Barber in the second quarter, but the touchdown was nullified by stupidity. Barber lined up incorrectly on a trick play.    It's hard to just blame Hanie though because Mike Martz's play-calling was completely idiotic. I have no idea why the hell he continuously asked Hanie to take 7.step drops in long-yardage situations. The easy answer is, It's Mike Martz, but he was better with this when Jay Cutler was still the quarterback earlier in the year. It's almost like Martz has checked out because he knows he'll be coaching in college next year.    Random stats: Hanie once again targeted Johnny Knox more than any other receiver. Knox caught 5 balls for 53 yards. As for the Chiefs, Dexter McCluster accounted for nearly half of the team's yardage; he had 61 rushing yards on 9 carries and 46 receiving yards with the aforementioned touchdown off 4 receptions. "

Cassel finished 24-of-42 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Cassel's yardage numbers are bogus; he was able to compile them when the Chargers were playing prevent in the second half. Kansas City needs to move on from Cassel after this season. The team cannot bench him now, unfortunately, because it doesn't have anyone behind him.    Jamaal Charles had a nice fantasy day, rushing for 92 yards on just 17 carries, catching 3 balls for 23 more yards and scoring a pair of touchdowns. Unfortunately, those 2 aforementioned fumbles really cost his team.    Dwayne Bowe caught 7 balls for 108 yards. He was the only Chief with more than 4 receptions and 50 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Chargers surprised many by giving "

Chris Ivory took off on runs of 32 and 11 yards on the Jets' next possession. This time, the drive was completed with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Bilal Powell on a checkdown. Late in the second quarter, the Titans weren't set and Fitzpatrick quickly snapped the ball to flip it to Marshall all alone along the sideline. He took off down the field for a 69-yard score. The Jets had a 27-0 lead at the half and the game was over.    Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-36 pass for 263 yards with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Marshall had 6 receptions for 125 yards with 1 score, and Decker totaled 7 catches for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Ivory ran for 101 yards on 22 carries, while Powell had 36 yards on 3 carries and 5 receptions for 46 yards with a score.    Mariota completed 21-of-39 for 274 yards with no touchdowns and 1 interception. Delanie Walker led Tennessee in receiving with 71 yards on 7 receptions. Harry Douglas (3-65) and Dorial Green-Beckham (3-53) contributed, but the biggest play through the air was Mariota's 41-yard touchdown catch.    The Titans had zero running game, as Dexter McCluster led them with a putrid 12 yards on 4 carries.    The engine of the Jets' win was their dominant defensive line overwhelming the Titans at the point of attack. Mariota was getting hit constantly, and Tennessee was completely incapable of running the ball. Muhammed Wilkerson had 3 sacks and 10 tackles. He dominated the Titans. "
