He took some shots downfield instead of repeatedly checking it down, as many other backup quarterbacks would've done. Tolzien had some nice completions - he went 24-of-34 for 339 yards, after all - but he was guilty of several poor throws, hence the turnovers. One of the give-aways, a pick-six by "

   "comment":"Scott Tolzien, gave the Steelers a victory, allowing them to improve to 6-5.    Ben Roethlisberger threw just 20 times, but he was unstoppable for the most part, completing 14 of the attempts for 221 yards and 3 touchdowns. Roethlisberger aired out numerous impressive deep shots against an injury-ravaged Indianapolis secondary featuring a hobbled Vontae Davis and a sidelined Clayton Geathers. Roethlisberger could've posted a better stat line, but there were a couple of drops, 1 by Sammie Coates that would've moved the chains on a third-and-12.    All of Roethlisberer's touchdowns were hauled in by Antonio Brown, who made Davis look completely incompetent. It's a shame for Davis, as he's clearly not 100 percent. Thus, it was impossible for him to keep up with the best receiver in football. Brown caught 5 passes for 91 yards. Roethlisberger spent most of the evening targeting Brown, as only 3 other Steelers caught multiple passes, and only 1 other logged more than 2 catches. Ladarius Green (2-67), Eli Rogers (2-67) and Le'Veon Bell (4-22) were next on the stat sheet.    Speaking of Bell, he was terrific, gashing the Colts with his trademark great patience. Bell gained 120 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries in addition to his receiving numbers. He had a long run negated by a penalty.    The Colts came into this game without Luck, and they sustained more injuries, as 2 linemen went down early. Ryan Kelly was knocked out of the game with a shoulder on the first drive, while guard Denzelle Good got hurt on the very next possession. With 2 linemen down, Scott Tolzien took plenty of big hits throughout the evening, and this pressure forced some late turnovers that allowed the Steelers to seal the victory. Tolzien got off to a poor start. His first possession featured a sack-fumble, an overthrow and a loss of 5 yards. The Colts couldn't really do anything on offense until punter "
