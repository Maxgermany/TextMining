   "comment":"Dri Archer split the workload once Bell was knocked out. Harris, a big back, had a 59-yard gain called back because of a ticky-tack hold. He managed just 7 yards on 5 attempts otherwise. Archer served as a pass-catcher. Green, meanwhile, was the team's leading receiver despite missing the very end. He caught 8 of the 13 balls thrown to him for 82 yards. "
