   "comment":"Williams. The Ravens later went for it on a 4.h-and-1 inside the red zone, but failed to convert. They were down 20-3 and needed 2 touchdowns and a field goal, so kicking would've made the most sense. This was evident when the Ravens had possession, down 20-10, with 5:40 remaining. Had they opted for the field goal, they would've been down just 1 score with the ball. John Harbaugh's brain fart was inexplicable.    As for the man of the hour, Smith had a pretty nondescript game. He caught 3 passes for 34 yards, and in typical Smith fashion, he got into a scuffle with a Cincinnati defender following a catch and a subsequent late push by Shawn Williams out of bounds. Congratulations to Smith on what has been a terrific career. He has finished 7.h all time in receiving yards.    Flacco did at least play well in between the 20s. He finished 32-of-49 for 267 yards and an interception. However, this wasn't the first time he was guilty of red-zone blunders this year. This has been a constant problem for him, and it's something the Ravens need to address this offseason. Perhaps Flacco will be better in his second year back from hs ACL tear.    "
