   "comment":"Amari Cooper dropped 2 passes, but the disappointment over those drops was quickly erased as he went right by cornerback Jimmy Smith and Carr put a post pattern right on the money for Cooper to waltz in for a 68-yard touchdown. That set the tone for an effective pass-first attack for the rest of the game.    Joe Flacco responded at the end of the first quarter with a touchdown pass to second-year tight end Crockett Gilmore, who went on to catch another touchdown, i.e. the Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert last week against the Raiders. That's 4 touchdowns given up by the Raiders' defense in just 2 games.    This back-and-forth scoring continued in the second half as Raiders running back Latavius Murray scored from 1 yard out and then Flacco and Gilmore responded quickly with a 9-yard touchdown pass. Add in a couple of field goals, and the score before halftime was knotted up at 20.    After halftime, the Raiders came out strong again with another field goal and a 26-yard touch strike to Michael Crabtree, who had his Raiders' breakout game with 9 receptions on 16 targets for 111 and a touchdown. He's no Amari Cooper in his skill level, but Crabtree made a lot of nice plays running the ball after the catch. It was a good sign that someone other than Cooper can put up big numbers in the receiving game.    After Crabtree's touchdown put the Raiders up by 10, the Ravens went to work scoring 13 unanswered points, with 2 field goals and a 7-yard touchdown run by Lorenzon Taliaferro. He is the no-doubt goal-line back now that he has returned from injury, but "

San Diego had been holding No. 1 receivers down for just 50 receiving yards a game coming into Sunday, but Cooper ended up with 5 receptions on 6 targets for 133 yards and that touchdown. He hadn't topped 49 yards receiving in his last 2 games, so it was nice to see him take a good pass defense to school this week.    "

As a result, the Raiders were able to kick a field goal - which ultimately was the margin of victory. Carr was later strip-sacked, though the heavy rainfall might have had something to do with that. Carr's gaffe led to a Tennessee touchdown, which would have been the game-winning score had Triplette not been ordered to fix this result.

   "comment":"Amari Cooper because he felt like he had to rush the throw. By halftime, Carr was just 2-of-8 for 7 yards. Yeah, it was that bad. Oakland had better success after intermission, as the line began giving Carr more time. Carr ultimately finished 12-of-29 for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns. He still had some blunders, including taking a sack to move the team out of field-goal range, but he was definitely sharper after halftime, so Jack Del Rio and his staff needs to be given credit for making the proper adjustments.    Amari Cooper had a disappointing performance. He was targeted 8 times, but didn't catch a single pass, thanks to "

   "comment":"Amari Cooper. Carr moved the chains on third-and-10 with a 13-yard pass to Jalen Richard (6-28 rushing), and then Latavius Murray (10-37) went untouched on a 22-yard touchdown run straight up the middle. After trading a few punts, Mariota took off on a run and ended up fumbling the ball away after getting hit by Bruce Irvin. Oakland recovered at the Tennessee 24-yard line, and on the next play, Carr hit Clive Walford (2-27) for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Donald Penn took the score away. The Raiders settled for a 52-yard field goal from Sebastian Janikowski. That play rewrote NFL record books, as Janikowski became the kicker with the most field goals of 50-plus yards in NFL history, breaking the record held by former Lion Jason Hansen. The Raiders got moving again with a pass to Cooper, while DeAndre Washington (6-57) exploded downfield on runs of 30 and 14 yards. Carr finished the drive by throwing a quick out to Seth Roberts (2-27), and Brice McCain took a terrible angle to let Roberts get the sideline as he darted down the field for a 19-yard touchdown. With only seconds remaining before the half, Mariota forced a pass to a covered receiver, and it was deflected to Reggie Nelson for an interception. Luckily for the Titans, the clock ran out and the Raiders couldn't kick another field goal as they were in Janikowski's range. Oakland took a 17-3 lead into the half. The Titans' offense finally started moving in the third quarter thanks to DeMarco Murray ripping off a run of 36 yards. Mariota then got away with a dangerous pass to Amaro for 26 yards. Murray ran the ball in from 5 yards out to cut the Raiders lead to 17-10. Early in the 4.h quarter, Sean Smith picked off Mariota at midfield, but Oakland gave it right back when a deflected pass was picked off by Avery Williamson. Both teams had drives stall. With less than 2 minutes remaining, Mariota made a great throw to Harry Douglas (2-20) for 25 yards. He then hit Tajae Sharpe (3-48) for gains of 23 and 19 yards to get inside Oakland's 5.yard line. A personal foul penalty on Taylor Lewan pushed the ball back. Mariota then connected with Andre Johnson for a touchdown, but Johnson was called for pushing off the corner. On 4.h down, Mariota threw incomplete for the end zone to Douglas, and the Raiders were fortunate they weren't called for pass interference.    Derek Carr completed 21-of-35 passes for 249 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Amari Cooper had 4 receptions for 62 yards, while Michael Crabtree had 8 catches for 102 yards."

   "comment":"Amari Cooper saw 8 targets, but only grabbed 5 of them for 28 yards. It's unclear why Cooper is struggling so much. He was supposed to be the team's top target, but he hasn't developed any chemistry with Carr. Cooper may need a change of scenery, and if the Raiders lose to the Chiefs, they may want to consider moving him for a draft pick. Perhaps the receiver-less Giants would demonstrate interest in him.    The Raiders had a couple of players do well in the running game. "

   "comment":"Amari Cooper broke out of a slump to have a huge outing. Cooper, unlike Carr, wasn't injured, but he was dropping everything in sight prior to Thursday night. Cooper had 2 drops versus the Chiefs, but he snatched 11 of his 19 targets for a ridiculous 210 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also drew a deep pass interference. It was clear it was going to be Cooper's night when he hauled in a 45-yard touchdown bomb in the first quarter, pushing off the Kansas City defender in the process. It was an obvious pass interference call, and the officials even through a yellow flag, but they picked it up and mysteriously said there was no penalty even though there was an obvious infraction.    Cooper wasn't the only Raider in triple figures. Cook got there as well, catching 6 passes for 107 yards. Crabtree's yardage was meager - 3 receptions, 24 yards - but he had the most important catch of the night.    "
