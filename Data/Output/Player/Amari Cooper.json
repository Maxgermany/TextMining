A bit later, Cooper's head onto his own helmet, which fell off. Jones was flagged for a personal foul, but he should have been ejected. A bit later, George Iloka was whistled for taunting unnecessarily. The Bengals, perhaps well aware that they won't be able to celebrate much in the playoffs, seemed to be getting it out of their system against a hapless opponent.    Of course, things got worse for the Raiders once Derek Carr left the game with a hand injury. Carr wasn't really doing anything - he went 7-of-12 for 61 yards - as many of his passes were way off the mark. He suffered through 2 drops, including 1 from Cooper, but Carr was wildly inaccurate before leaving for the afternoon. It's hardly a surprise that Carr struggled, given that the Raiders foolishly changed his offensive system. Once "

Joe Flacco responded at the end of the first quarter with a touchdown pass to second-year tight end Crockett Gilmore, who went on to catch another touchdown, i.e. the Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert last week against the Raiders. That's 4 touchdowns given up by the Raiders' defense in just 2 games.    This back-and-forth scoring continued in the second half as Raiders running back Latavius Murray scored from 1 yard out and then Flacco and Gilmore responded quickly with a 9-yard touchdown pass. Add in a couple of field goals, and the score before halftime was knotted up at 20.    After halftime, the Raiders came out strong again with another field goal and a 26-yard touch strike to Michael Crabtree, who had his Raiders' breakout game with 9 receptions on 16 targets for 111 and a touchdown. He's no Amari Cooper in his skill level, but Crabtree made a lot of nice plays running the ball after the catch. It was a good sign that someone other than Cooper can put up big numbers in the receiving game.    After Crabtree's touchdown put the Raiders up by 10, the Ravens went to work scoring 13 unanswered points, with 2 field goals and a 7-yard touchdown run by Lorenzon Taliaferro.

After the opening kickoff, Stafford ripped the ball through the Raiders' secondary with passes to Golden Tate and Lance Moore to move inside the 10-yard line. A holding call on Laken Tomlinson and a dropped touchdown by Eric Ebron led to a Detroit field goal. After a Raiders punt, Stafford kept moving the ball using Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with "

With a 2.point conversion, the Chiefs were able to go up a couple of touchdowns.    The Chiefs were outgained, 361-232 and had 12 fewer first downs. Credit them for taking advantage of their opportunities, but they easily could've lost this game had the Raiders not shot themselves in the foot repeatedly. Alex Smith was his usual, mediocre self, going 16-of-22 for only 162 yards and 2 touchdowns, though he did scramble 5 times for 23 rushing yards and a third score. Smith had an opportunity for another aerial touchdown, but badly overthrew Albert Wilson.    Both of Smith's touchdowns went to Jeremy Maclin, who reeled in 9 of his 10 targets for 95 yards and 2 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a lost fumble in the first half. Travis Kelce (2-42) also coughed up the ball.    The Chiefs indicated that they might split carries between Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware, and sure enough, that's exactly what they did. West gained 35 yards on 9 carries, while Ware tallied 26 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries. Ware nearly scored again, but was stuffed on a goal-line carry.    Going back to the Raiders, Carr looked great at times, finishing 31-of-48 for 283 yards and 2 touchdowns. He endured some drops as well, so he could've had a much better performance. However, those 3 interceptions were absolute killers and single-handedly (triple-handedly?) swung the game in Kansas City's favor.    Both Cooper and Crabtree had games to forget. Cooper, who caught 4 passes for 69 yards, dropped a 4.h-down reception early on and then was responsible for Carr's pick-six. Crabtree, on the other hand, logged 5 catches for 45 yards and a touchdown, but was guilty of several drops.    "

That would've been Cooper touchdown because the second-year receiver stepped out of bounds and was the first player to touch it. That would've been Derek Carr's 4.h score, but he still posted strong numbers, going 34-of-45 for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns. One of those scores was on a 4.h-and-2 from Atlanta's 2-yard line, and it was once again to Michael Crabtree. CBS analyst Rich Gannon actually pleaded for Oakland not to go for it, but Black Jack Del Rio didn't hesitate. However, Del Rio's gutsy attitude backfired later on when the Raiders failed to convert a 4.h-and-2 near midfield.    Cooper's overturned touchdown ruined his stat line, as he caught 5 balls for 71 yards otherwise. Crabtree (4-31) didn't accumulate too much yardage, but he did catch that aforementioned touchdown. "

After trading a few punts, Mariota took off on a run and ended up fumbling the ball away after getting hit by Bruce Irvin. Oakland recovered at the Tennessee 24-yard line, and on the next play, Carr hit Clive Walford (2-27) for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Donald Penn took the score away. The Raiders settled for a 52-yard field goal from Sebastian Janikowski. That play rewrote NFL record books, as Janikowski became the kicker with the most field goals of 50-plus yards in NFL history, breaking the record held by former Lion Jason Hansen. The Raiders got moving again with a pass to Cooper, while DeAndre Washington (6-57) exploded downfield on runs of 30 and 14 yards. Carr finished the drive by throwing a quick out to Seth Roberts (2-27), and Brice McCain took a terrible angle to let Roberts get the sideline as he darted down the field for a 19-yard touchdown. With only seconds remaining before the half, Mariota forced a pass to a covered receiver, and it was deflected to Reggie Nelson for an interception. Luckily for the Titans, the clock ran out and the Raiders couldn't kick another field goal as they were in Janikowski's range. Oakland took a 17-3 lead into the half. The Titans' offense finally started moving in the third quarter thanks to DeMarco Murray ripping off a run of 36 yards. Mariota then got away with a dangerous pass to Amaro for 26 yards. Murray ran the ball in from 5 yards out to cut the Raiders lead to 17-10. Early in the 4.h quarter, Sean Smith picked off Mariota at midfield, but Oakland gave it right back when a deflected pass was picked off by Avery Williamson. Both teams had drives stall. With less than 2 minutes remaining, Mariota made a great throw to Harry Douglas (2-20) for 25 yards. He then hit Tajae Sharpe (3-48) for gains of 23 and 19 yards to get inside Oakland's 5.yard line. A personal foul penalty on Taylor Lewan pushed the ball back. Mariota then connected with Andre Johnson for a touchdown, but Johnson was called for pushing off the corner. On 4.h down, Mariota threw incomplete for the end zone to Douglas, and the Raiders were fortunate they weren't called for pass interference.

   "comment":"Amari Cooper wide open downfield for a touchdown. Carr completely missed him, and the same thing happened earlier in the game when Carr whiffed on a pass to a wide-open Cooper wide open downfield for a touchdown. Carr completely missed him, and the same thing happened earlier in the game when Carr whiffed on a pass to a wide-open Jalen Richard, who was standing in the end zone by himself. It was pretty clear that the Raiders didn't have a chance when their defense produced 2 turnovers in the third quarter, setting up the offense near the red zone on 2 occasions. Oakland managed just 3 points on the 2 possessions. Seth Roberts was guilty of dropping a touchdown on the first drive, and there was a holding penalty involved, but Carr was almost picked off on another throw. Marquette King fumbled a hold on 1 of Sebastian Janikowski's attempts, but in the end, it didn't really matter. Carr finished with absolutely dreadful numbers. He was 17-of-41 for only 117 yards. He was victimized by numerous drops, but he looked like a shell of his former self because of his injury, and once again, if things don't get better in that regard, the Raiders could lose their next 4 games. They're known for their dynamic offense, so it's going to be difficult for them to have any success averaging just 3.3 yards per play like they did in this divisional affair.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, have moved into first place of the AFC West in the wake of this victory, thanks to their season-sweep tie-breaker over the Raiders. However, they can't be feeling too good right now because of Derrick Johnson's injury. Johnson went down on no contact toward the end of the second quarter and had to be helped off the field. It was ruled that he he ruptured his problematic Achilles and will be out for the year and possibly a portion of 2017. It's a huge blow, as Johnson is the heart and soul of Kansas City's defense.    Alex Smith was terrific in the first half, as he looked like the quarterback in the running for the MVP. Smith was 11-of-16 for 202 yards and a touchdown in the opening half alone. He converted on an early third-and-10, as Chris Conley beat David Amerson. He then hit Travis Kelce for a gain of 28 yards from deep in his own territory, and followed that up with a nifty play in which he danced around the pocket and connected to Conley for a 31-yarder, as Conley beat Amerson again. Smith came back down to Earth after halftime, as he was just 6-of-10 for 62 yards, a telegraphed interception and a lost fumble (Khalil Mack strip-sack) following intermission. A regression to the mean was bound to happen for Smith, though in fairness, Andy Reid didn't seem interested in passing whatsoever, opting to just feed Spencer Ware instead. Overall, Smith finished 17-of-26 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and the lost fumble.    The Raiders came into this game struggling against tight ends, so it's no wonder that Kelce went off. Kelce caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 1.handed grab thrown behind him for a gain of 34. Meanwhile, Tyreek Hill (6-66) scored twice; once on offense when he beat Amerson (notice a theme here?), and once via a punt return. Jeremy Maclin (1-16) was barely heard from upon his return. He was targeted on Smith's interception.    Ware had a disappointing evening. He was limited to just 56 yards on 20 carries, and he was vultured in the second quarter by Charcandrick West, who found the end zone on 1 of his only 2 attempts.    Moving back to the Raiders, there might be another hand injury that they have to worry about. That's what Michael Crabtree hurt during 1 of his drops in the 4.h quarter. Crabtree caught 4 passes for 21 yards, and the only positive thing he did was draw a pass-interference flag. Sadly, Crabtree trailed the Raider leader in receiving yardage by only 8 yards, as Cooper snatched 5 of his 10 targets for just 29 yards. Cooper should've had more, but as mentioned, Carr couldn't hit an open Cooper for a long touchdown.    Seth Roberts needs to be brought up again. He dropped 3 passes, including 1 in the end zone. Though he converted a 4.h-and-4, Roberts is 1 of the worst receivers in the NFL.    As for the running game, Cris Collinsworth kept harping about how much more effective Oakland's rushing attack would've been had Kelechi Osemele not been a late scratch. Osemele is 1 of the top guards in the NFL, and his unexpected absence certainly had a big impact. Even with him gone, "

Carr soon finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Richard. The Raiders took a 19-7 lead into halftime. To start the third quarter, the Raiders' offensive line dominated the Colts' front 7 to open huge rushing lanes. That led to DeAndre Washington ripping off a 22-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing Colts possession, Malcolm Smith forced a fumble from Frank Gore (13-73), and the Raiders recovered it at the Indianapolis 38-yard line. A few plays later, Washington bolted for another 22-yard scoring run as he was untouched. That pushed the Raiders' lead to 33-7. The Colts finnaly got going again with a pass to T.Y. Hilton going for 39 yards to the 5-yard line. That set up a short touchdown pass from Luck to Robert Turbin. Early in the 4.h quarter, Carr suffered his injury, leaving his team visibly crushed. Luck then moved the ball down the field before running a short touchdown into the end zone and converting a 2.point conversion to Hilton. At 33-22, the Colts got the ball back and promptly Luck hit Hilton on the run for 39 yards. The Colts settled for a field goal to make it 33-25 with 2:30 remaining. McGloin made a great throw to Cooper to get a first down on a third-and-long conversion just before the 2-minute warning. That allowed the Raiders to run out the clock on the Colts.    Carr was 20-of-30 for 228 yards with 3 touchdowns prior to the injury. Cooper had 4 catches for 72 yards.    DeAndre Washington was excellent for the Raiders with 12 carries for 99 yards with 2 scores and an 18-yard reception. Jalen Richard had 66 yards on 6 carries with 3 receptions for 13 yards and a touchdown.    Luck was 19-of-29 for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.

Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Cooper drop passes, with the instances sandwiching a holding penalty that negated a first down. Prior to halftime, Carr was intercepted on a horrible throw into double coverage, setting up a Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a "

Kupp had to dive for the pass, and it would have been an incredible catch. Kupp couldn't secure it, however, and the Rams couldn't punch the ball in. That essentially ended the game. Despite the positive final drive, Goff had his share of struggles against the Seahawks, and they were prevalent in the 4.h quarter. Before the final drive, Goff made a few bad mistakes. He threw an awful interception that can only be described as a dying quail. It fluttered over the middle of the field and wobbled like crazy before Earl Thomas came away with it. Later in the quarter, Goff would hold onto the ball too long and get strip sacked from behind. He had trouble feeling the strong Seattle rush, and that cost him a bit. Overall, Goff went 22-of-47 for 288 yards and 2 picks. This was not an entirely negative performance for Goff. He had his share of nice throws that were accurate and well-thrown. And of course, he had a chance to get the Rams a win late. Goff is still a work in progress, so there will be more games like this for him as he battles tough defenses.    Goff's top targets were Tyler Higbee (4-98), Cooper Kupp (3-44) and Robert Woods (5-66). Goff 10.s to prefer to throw to good route runners, which explains why these 3 were his top targets. "
