   "comment":"Mike Adams. Henne completed 19-of-29 passes for 255 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was an incomplete game from Henne, but not a horrible performance especially when you consider the Dolphins struggles in pass protection.    Miami got a good game out of Thomas as he ran for 95 yards on 23 carries. Thomas also caught 3 passes for 27 yards. Even though he wasn't shorted carries, Miami probably should have gotten the ball to Thomas more as he was running well in the second half. Bush ran for 24 yards on 11 carries and was ineffective. He caught 1 pass for 12 yards.    Hartline led Miami in receiving with 4 catches for 87 yards. "

   "comment":"Mike Adams strip-sacked Bortles to set up the Colts at the Jaguars' 35-yard line after the return. But on the next play, Andre Branch stripped Hasselbeck of the ball and scooped it up before returning it 49 yards for a touchdown. Unsurprisingly, Myers missed the extra point, so the Colts had a 13-9 lead at the half. The Jaguars' offense came alive on their first play of the third quarter as Bortles threw a bullet between 2 defenders to Allen Hurns. Hurns bounced off safety Dwight Lowery and took off down the field for an 80-yard touchdown. Jacksonville's defense quickly forced a punt, which Rashad Greene returned, untouched, for a 73-yard touchdown. With the Jaguars up 23-13, Hasselbeck hit Donte Moncrief on a short pass that he broke downfield for a gain of 33 yards. A few plays later, Hasselbeck connected with Hilton for 20 yards, and that set up another field goal for Indianapolis. From there it was all the Jaguars. Jacksonville's offense kept moving the ball, assisted by a 34-yard pass interference call on Jalil Brown that moved the ball to the Colts' 16-yard line. Denard Robinson ran the ball 12 yards before Bortles threw a dart to Allen Robinson for a short touchdown. That expanded the Jaguars' lead to 30-16. Denard Robinson soon ripped the Colts on a 31-yard run thanks to a great block from A.J. Cann. Two passes to Julius Thomas then moved the ball inside the 5 before Bortles hit Thomas for a short score. That gave Jacksonville a 37-16 lead. The pummeling for Hasselbeck continued when he got shoved hard out of bounds by Telvin Smith. Charlie Whitehurst had to enter the game for a second time after Hasselbeck left the game with a rib injury. Whitehurst couldn't move the ball and overthrew on a 4.h-and-10 to give the Jaguars the ball near midfield. They moved the ball to the 2-yard line, from where Denard Robinson scored. Jonathan Cyprien went on to intercept Whitehurst around midfield and return it to the 1-yard line. Bortles leapt over the goal line on 4.h-and-goal to hang the Jaguars' 50th point on the Colts.    Bortles completed 16-of-30 for 250 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 17 yards on 4 carries with a score. Hurns led the Jaguars through the air with 105 yards on 3 receptions and a score. Julius Thomas had 54 yards on give catches with a score. Allen Robinson made only 1 catch, but it was a 4-yard touchdown.    Yeldon ran well with 62 yards on 11 carries, but was banged up with an knee injury. Denard Robinson was very impressive to close out the game with 75 yards on 14 carries and a score.    Hasselbeck was 18-of-35 for 252 yards. Whitehurst was only 2-of-8 for 8 yards an an interception.    Frank Gore had 60 yards on 16 carries to lead the Colts.    Hilton logged 132 yards on 4 receptions. Moncrief had 3 receptions for 52 yards.    Defensively, the Jaguars got good games from Telvin Smith (9 tackles) and Davon House. Branch recorded 2 sacks and 4 tackles, but his strip-sack returned for a touchdown was the momentum-changer that started the Jaguars' blowout of the Colts. For Indianapolis, D'Qwell Jackson (7 tackles, 1 sack) and Mike Adams (4 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble) played well.   "
