   "comment":"Fleener, who logged 4 receptions for 55 yards and a garbage-time touchdown. Luck finished 20-of-39 for 163 yards, the score to Fleener and a pick-6 that occurred because he was hit as he threw. Much of Luck's stats came in junk time; he was 6-of-15 for 42 yards and that interception in the first half. Facing the combination of Bruce Arians and 1 of the top defenses in the NFL, Luck simply had no chance.    Defensively, the Colts can't stop the run or the pass. "

He hauled in a receiving touchdown to go along with 4 catches for 38 yards through the air. He also rushed for 64 yards on 19 carries with some short-yardage conversions in the first half. It actually didn't look like Richardson converted those attempts, but the officials moved the chains on both occasions. However, Richardson was held to minimal gains on way too many occasions, and he was only in the game so much because "

That's right - Indianapolis had Cincinnati outgained by 401 net yards!    Despite some of the mistakes, Luck had a strong showing. He went 27-of-42 for 344 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had issues generating first downs early - especially on third down, where both teams were a combined 0-of-14 in the opening half - but Luck eventually got into a groove and finished on a strong note. He was 13-of-17 for 152 yards and 2 scores following intermission.    Luck's leading receiver was "

The Bengals simply didn't have an answer for him, as they couldn't generate any sort of pass rush. They sacked him just once. Cincinnati really missed Michael Johnson this year, so the team is expected to select pass-rushers early and often this April, which is what I have happening in my 2015 NFL Mock Draft.    As for Hilton, he still managed to accumulate 103 receiving yards, but reeled in just 6 of his 14 targets. He would've hurt his team with his mistakes had the Bengals been remotely competitive on offense. Elsewhere, "

Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting "

Hasselbeck later took a bad sack on a third-and-1 when he had enough space to step up into the pocket and scramble for the first down. In the third quarter, an awful hands-to-the-face ticky-tack penalty, which had nothing to do with the play, gave the Falcons a first down when they would've been forced into a field goal. A few plays later, Matt Ryan found Leonard Hankerson in the end zone to go up 2 touchdowns. Hasselbeck followed that up with a horrible pick into double coverage. And yeah, the Colts somehow won! It was a combination of factors that did the Falcons in, beginning with Matt Ryan. Atlanta's signal-caller was guilty of 3 interceptions himself. The first wasn't really his fault, as it was a tipped pass that appeared to hit the ground. Mike Carey said that it should've been ruled incomplete. Ryan's third pick was on a Hail Mary attempt that was actually snatched by Coby Fleener. The middle interception was the horrible 1, as the Falcons were backed up on their own 1-yard line.

As for the Dolphins, box-score observers will see that Tannehill went 26-of-38 for 329 yards and an interception. Solid numbers, right? Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean that Tannehill played well. He took a safety at the beginning of the game because he held on to the ball for an eternity. He then threw an awful interception and ultimately took a bad sack for the Colts to the ice the victory.

   "comment":"Fleener, but struggled after that. He was benched for a while in favor of Ryan Lindley, who proceeded to pick apart the Titans. Lindley ultimately threw a score to Andre Johnson, who impressively caught the ball while falling out of bounds, yet he was able to reach it across the goal line for the touchdown. Despite this, Freeman was inserted back into the game after that, which was puzzling. Freeman went 15-of-28 for 149 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception, while Lindley finished 6-of-10 for 58 yards and a score. Freeman did some damage on the ground, picking up 24 rushing yards on 8 scrambles.    Only 4 Colts players had more than 3 receiving yards: Fleener (7-88), Johnson (4-46), T."

   "comment":"Fleener on a fourth-and-1 on the second possession. However, the drive couldn't end in a touchdown because Fleener failed to hold on to the ball while falling out of bounds. The play was initially ruled a score, but replay review reversed the call. Brees was on fire in garbage time, allowing to finish with the following stat line: 29-of-50, 350 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which was his only blemish in the final quarter. Brees forced a pass into the end zone. It was only first-and-goal, so Brees didn't have to be so careless. The pick would end up costing the Saints the game.    "
