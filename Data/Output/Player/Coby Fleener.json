Hasselbeck later took a bad sack on a third-and-1 when he had enough space to step up into the pocket and scramble for the first down. In the third quarter, an awful hands-to-the-face ticky-tack penalty, which had nothing to do with the play, gave the Falcons a first down when they would've been forced into a field goal. A few plays later, Matt Ryan found Leonard Hankerson in the end zone to go up 2 touchdowns. Hasselbeck followed that up with a horrible pick into double coverage. And yeah, the Colts somehow won! It was a combination of factors that did the Falcons in, beginning with Matt Ryan. Atlanta's signal-caller was guilty of 3 interceptions himself. The first wasn't really his fault, as it was a tipped pass that appeared to hit the ground. Mike Carey said that it should've been ruled incomplete. Ryan's third pick was on a Hail Mary attempt that was actually snatched by Coby Fleener. The middle interception was the horrible 1. as the Falcons were backed up on their own 1-yard line.

A quick note on Adam Vintarieri, who drilled his 500th field goal of his Hall of Fame career. He became the third kicker ever to reach that mark.    As for the Dolphins, box-score observers will see that Tannehill went 26-of-38 for 329 yards and an interception. Solid numbers, right? Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean that Tannehill played well. He took a safety at the beginning of the game because he held on to the ball for an eternity. He then threw an awful interception and ultimately took a bad sack for the Colts to the ice the victory. Tannehill did well in between the 20s at times, and he actually had a touchdown to "
