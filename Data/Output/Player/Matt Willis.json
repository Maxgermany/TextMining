   "comment":"Willis, who dropped a long completion on the final drive of this contest. But it all doesn't matter because the Raiders lost and the Broncos still were able to win the division.    I can't imagine this is how the Broncos wanted to clinch playoff berth. Their offense couldn't do anything aerially in this contest. Tim Tebow was an abysmal 6-of-22 for 60 yards and an interception. The pass protection once again was atrocious, but Tebow held on to the ball too long on way too many occasions. He also lost a fumble in the red zone, which was huge in such a low-scoring struggle.    As mentioned earlier, the receivers sucked. You're not going to advance deep into the playoffs with bums like Willis, Daniel Fells, Spencer Larsen and Eric Decker catching passes."
