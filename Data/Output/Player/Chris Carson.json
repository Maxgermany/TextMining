   "comment":"Chris Carson. The 7.h-round pick out of Oklahoma State put together a very strong performance for the team. He ended up getting 6 carries for 39 yards and had a nice combination of burst and physicality. On 1 play in particular, Carson was able to run all the way to the left side and then reverse field all the way to the right to get 3 yards. He was only able to do this because of his great vision and his ability to make men miss. He is worth monitoring as potential running back depth, but once Thomas Rawls comes back, the backfield will be more crowded. Elsewhere, "
