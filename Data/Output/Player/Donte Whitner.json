   "comment":"Whitner. Joe Haden caught the fumble in the air and returned it to midfield. On the next play, Brian Hoyer hit a 32-yard pass to Andrew Hawkins. Hoyer then hit tight end Jim Dray for 16 yards to the 5. Hoyer finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Hawkins (7-88). To clinch the win, Austin Howard was knocked back into Carr, who fumbled the ball away. Barkevious Mingo recovered at Oakland's 9-yard line. Ben Tate (15-26) scored to put the game on ice for Cleveland. In the final seconds of the game, Carr threw a short touchdown pass to Holmes (5-69), as he powered through Gilbert for 6.    Hoyer finished 19-of-28 for 275 yards with a touchdown. The Browns really never got into a groove offensively, as they had only 39 yards rushing.    The Browns' defense was the real star of the game. Haden has been criticized for his play this season, but he had a bounce-back performance against Oakland. Haden had 2 impressive pass breakups in the 4.h quarter. He led Cleveland with 9 tackles. Paul Kruger had his best game as a Brown with 3 sacks and a forced fumble. Whitner (8 tackles), Dansby (8 tackles) and Gipson all played well for the Browns.    Carr completed 34-of-54 for 328 yards with a touchdown. He made some nice passes, but his fumble, McFadden's turnover and Schaub's interception killed the Raiders' offense.    Oakland's defense actually played well for a change, but the turnovers put the stop unit in impossible situations. "

Glennon also had a lost fumble that was nullified by a penalty, and he also held the ball too long on some occasions, taking sacks as a consequence. Despite Glennon's accuracy and pocket-presence issues, he had the team in position to potentially win the game at the end. He found "
