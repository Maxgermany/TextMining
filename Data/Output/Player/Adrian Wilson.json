   "comment":"Wilson, who has been with the Cardinals for his entire 8-year career. Amazing... said a speechless, tearful Wilson. We worked so hard... God is good... Like the Pro Bowl safety, I also had tears in my eyes. I had the Cardinals for 5 units, and I knew I'd get major flak from all the Eagles fans around Philly if I didn't get this game right. During the week, when I told everyone I had the Cardinals, people looked at me as if I were crazy. No 1 - whether you're talking about casual fans or media members - gave Arizona much of a chance. In fact, ESPN.com ran a story a week ago by Gene Wojciechowski, who wrote, But the Arizona Cardinals over the Philadelphia Eagles in next Sunday's NFC Championship Game? Put it this way: Tim Tebow and the Philippians have a better chance of strip clubbing with Pacman Jones. Well, congratulations to all the underrated players, Ken Whisenhunt and his coaching staff, owner Bill The Bow Tie Bidwill and a franchise that will be making its first Super Bowl appearance ever.    Unless you want to count public and media perception, the first bad omen for the Eagles occurred a few seconds prior to kickoff, when the ball fell off the tee just as "

   "comment":"Wilson. Tannehill also took a terrible sack in the red zone in the first half on what was a loss of 14 yards.    Hartline was awesome. He caught 12 balls for the 253 yards I mentioned. The bulk of it came on an 80-yard touchdown bomb in the 4.h quarter when it appeared as though Arizona established control of the game. "
