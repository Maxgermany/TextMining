The 49ers actually did a good job of containing him, and yet he still accumulated 133 yards and a touchdown on just 20 carries, most of which came on a 71-yard scoring burst in the second quarter. In doing so, Gurley became the first rookie to ever open up his career with 4 consecutive 100-yard performances. An NFL team told us prior to the 2015 NFL Draft that they considered Gurley to be the next Jim Brown, and he certainly looks like he's the best running back in the NFL right now. He has fundamentally changed this St. Louis team, which wouldn't have crawled back to above .500 without him. Gurley is so dynamic that Jeff Fisher opted to run with him on obvious passing situations during the 2-minute drill prior to halftime. Thirty-1 of 32 teams would've passed in those situations, yet Fisher called for Gurley rushes because that happened to be his best option. Of course, it says something that Fisher didn't trust "

   "comment":"Gurley or Jameis Winston. It was Case Keenum, who played the game of his life. Keenum was extremely precise on almost every throw, going 14-of-17 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He began the contest by dinking and dunking, but he made some special passes as the evening progressed. Keenum hit Kenny Britt in stride with a 60-yard bomb in the first quarter. He later showed great touch when lofting a pass over a defender's head to Jared Cook for a 17-yard gain. He then managed to complete another deep pass by threading the needle in between 2 defenders. Keenum made just 2 errors in this contest, both of which occurred on the final drive of the opening half. He had a pass that was dropped by a Tampa defender, and then he took a horrible sack to give his team no chance on a third down. However, those were his only blemishes. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the next couple of games. If Keenum puts together a pair of quality performances, the Rams may eschew taking a quarterback in the first round, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    As for Gurley, he had trouble finding room against a tough Tampa Bay run defense. He still performed well for his owners, however, as he generated 48 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He was in position for a second score following a "

   "comment":"Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, "

He was restricted to just 33 yards on 19 carries, but managed to make up for it as a receiver out of the backfield; he caught 5 passes for 49 receiving yards.    Case Keenum has come a long way since his dreadful debut. He opened the game with some shaky throws, including 1 where he fired way behind Tavon Austin for what would've been a big gain, but he improved as the afternoon progressed. He did lose a fumble on a strip-sack in the third quarter, but did a good job of moving the chains and giving his defense rest. Keenum finished 18-of-30 for 266 yards and 2 touchdowns, and his numbers would've been even better had his receivers not dropped a pair of long passes.    Keenum's primary targets were Gurley and Lance Kendricks, who caught all 5 of his targets for 52 yards."

He only turned those carries into 72 yards. That 3.1 yards-per-carry rate is not what Rams fans want to see from Gurley. Unfortunately, he is just not getting enough help from his offensive line. The blocking needs to improve in order for Gurley to do well. He is frequently getting stacked up at or behind the line of scrimmage, and that was again the case against the Bills. If you are thinking of trying to acquire Gurley in fantasy, definitely try to buy low on him. He will only be as good as the players around him.

   "comment":"Gurley and a strong defense, I never would've imagined that they would lose a game in which Case Keenum misfired only 5 times on 32 attempts - including 20 consecutive completions - yet that's exactly what happened in this contest. It appears as though this crazy 2016 campaign just keeps getting more insane. However, what should be recognized is that the Rams are now undermanned. Robert Quinn and Trumaine Johnson were both ruled inactive prior to kickoff, marking the second-straight game the former has been absent. Michael Brockers, who was questionable coming into this contest, was able to suit up, but he left the game early when he aggravated his hip injury. With 3 key defenders out of the lineup, the Rams' stop unit clearly wasn't the same. Matthew Stafford was able to take advantage of this, torching the Rams by going 23-of-31 for 270 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was every bit as spectacular as those numbers indicate, though it helped that he didn't have to deal with any sort of pass rush. He was sacked only once, as his rookie tackle Taylor Decker put together an exceptional performance, albeit against a reserve.    Stafford's touchdowns went to Golden Tate (8-165), Anquan Boldin (8-60), Andre Roberts (2-13) and Marvin Jones (2-10). Tate actually nearly scored twice, but replay review overturned the call. This was shocking to say the least, as Tate was benched 2 weeks ago. I wouldn't expect him to maintain this sort of performance, though it's at least clear that he's not a lost cause. As for Jones, he also almost scored twice, but a miscommunication ruined the potential second touchdown.    With Theo Riddick and Dwayne Washington out, the Lions had Zach Zenner and Justin Forsett as their 2 primary running backs. Zenner (14-58) outgained Forsett (5-5) by a wide margin, and he also caught more passes (2) than Forsett (1) did. Forsett may not be on the roster very long.    Speaking of running backs, Todd Gurley didn't have the sort of performance that his owners were expecting prior to this matchup. Gurley gained just 58 yards on 14 carries, though he did catch 4 balls for 39 yards. Gurley was blown up in the backfield on a fourth-and-1 try in the second quarter. Gurley's low workload may have been a byproduct of him walking off the field gingerly at 1 point in the opening half. He missed some action, but managed to return to the field. It's unclear if he was 100 percent.    I mentioned that Keenum missed on just 5 throws earlier. Take a look at his stat line: 27-of-32, 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, which was a horrible throw at the end to ruin the Rams' chances. But how does an overall stat line like that even happen? Detroit's banged-up defense got Ziggy Ansah back this week, and he managed to draw a false start at 1 point, but the back 7 continued to be brutal. DeAndre Levy needs to return for the Lions to play well defensively.    "

   "comment":"Gurley Wildcat play, ruining all momentum the Rams had on a second-quarter drive. Following halftime, Keenum threw an interception, which was a ridiculously underthrown ball that sailed right to Thomas Davis. The ball was so underthrown, it was almost as if Keenum threw a brick. Keenum finished 27-of-46 for 296 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception. He wasn't completely to blame for the offense's ineptitude, as the team was guilty of 5 drops, including 1 where Lance Kendricks had the ball hit him right in the numbers as he was standing in the end zone. Still, Keenum was horrible enough that any competent coach would've made a change, yet Fisher stuck with the ineffective veteran.    As for the Panthers, they continue to win following their 1-5 start. They're now 3-5, though there are still some concerns. Their secondary would've given up some big gains if the Rams had a competent quarterback. The offensive line, meanwhile, was getting pushed round by Los Angeles' stalwart front. The Panthers gained just 244 net yards and averaged a putrid 3.9 yards per play.    Cam Newton finished 20-of-32 for 225 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 7 times, but the Rams were prepared for his scrambles, as he was limited to just 16 yards on the ground. Newton made a big stink about not getting any personal-foul calls, and that continued to be the case. The whistles were silent even though there appeared to be 1 occasion in which he should've drawn a flag, as Mark Barron smashed into him with a helmet-to-helmet hit.    Only 3 Panthers caught more than 2 passes. Kelvin Benjamin led the way with 5 grabs for 76 yards. Greg Olsen (5-52) found the end zone, while Ted Ginn reeled in 5 passes for 40 yards. Ed Dickson (2-17) dropped a pass.    The Panthers couldn't find any running room for Jonathan Stewart, who was limited to 42 yards on 15 carries. Carolina simply couldn't push around Aaron Donald and the Rams' great defensive line.    Moving back to the Rams, they also struggled to run the ball, as Todd Gurley managed only 48 yards on 12 attempts, most of which came on an 18-yard burst. Gurley continued to be a factor in the passing game; he caught 4 passes for 26 receiving yards.    Despite his horrible drop, Kendricks paced the Rams with 7 catches for 90 yards. "

   "comment":"Gurley, who was double covered, and then missed Lance Kendricks on a low throw. At the very end of the game, Goff showed absolutely no urgency. Starting around his own 40-yard line, Goff threw just a 7-yard pass in the middle of the field and then walked to the line of scrimmage despite there being about just 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Jeff Fisher had to bail out his rookie quarterback with a timeout. After 2 incompletions that weren't even close, Goff attempted a Hail Mary on the final snap, but threw the ball into the end zone before any of his teammates could get there. Goff finished 17-of-31 for only 134 yards. I'd give him a C for this performance. He did some good things, and the heavy rain prevented him from completing anything downfield. However, he had accuracy issues at times, and the lack of both awareness and urgency was alarming. I don't understand how any NFL quarterback can throw a short pass over the middle and then walk to the line of scrimmage when there's less than half a minute remaining in regulation.    As for the Dolphins, I still have no idea how they won this game. They literally did nothing all afternoon. Of their first 11 offensive drives, 10 resulted in a punt, while the other finished with a Ryan Tannehill interception. However, following a Greg Zuelein missed field goal without 5 minutes remaining, the Dolphins inexplicably caught fire. Ryan Tannehill led 2 touchdown drives with the help of some horrible Los Angeles penalties, including a ridiculous Aaron Donald helmet-to-helmet cheap shot. Tannehill's second score was to DeVante Parker, which was the decisive touchdown. Tannehill finished 24-of-34 or 172 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which was a deep shot into the end zone from midfield. Tannehill, despite the 10 incompletions, had a very rough afternoon. He threw some ugly passes and easily could've been picked off 3 times. Unfortunately for the Rams, T.J. McDonald and Mark Barron were guilty of drops. McDonald's bobble ruined what would've been the easiest interception of his career, as the pass sailed right to him. Tannehill also took 4 sacks, but was hit hard on so many occasions that it's a minor miracle that he survived the game without sustaining an injury.    Tannehill's touchdowns went to Parker (8-79) and Jarvis Landry (5-28). Parker was a monster down the stretch, while Landry suffered an injury on the final drive.    Jay Ajayi posted 77 yards on 16 carries despite missing 2 of his best offensive linemen. However, that's misleading because most of Ajayi's yardage came on 1 36-yard burst. Ajayi couldn't find any room otherwise against Los Angeles' stout front.    Ajayi just barely outgained Todd Gurley, who tallied 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. As with Ajayi, a big chunk of Gurley's yardage came on 1 attempt, a 24-yarder that happened to be a first-quarter touchdown. The Dolphins stacked the line of scrimmage, much like every other team this year, daring the Los Angeles quarterback to beat them. Goff, like Case Keenum, couldn't get the job done to open up some running room for his stud running back.    No Ram accumulated more than 50 receiving yards. Britt led the way with 5 grabs for 43 yards, though he did draw a pass-interference flag on third down near midfield. Kendricks was next (4-38), but he lost a fumble in his own territory when "

   "comment":"Gurley plunged into the end zone. Matt Schaub took over at quarterback for Ryan in the fourth quarter. Goff laid out a 50-yard touchdown pass to Brian Quick, but that was called back by a very questionable pass interference. Still, it was a nice throw from the rookie signal-caller. Goff ended up having a short touchdown run with under 3 minutes remaining.    Ryan finished the game having completed 18-of-28 for 237 yards with 3 touchdowns with just 3 quarters of action. Gabriel led the Falcons in receiving with 3 receptions for 82 yards and a touchdown.    Coleman ran for 36 yards on 8 carries for a touchdown on the ground with 2 receptions for 19 yards and a score through the air. Devonta Freeman (6-6 rushing, 2-12 receiving) was held in check.    Goff ended up 24-of-41 for 235 yards, 2 interceptions and a rushing touchdown. He made some nice passes, but had a lot of problems with holding onto the ball too long as he took some terrible sacks. His offensive line struggled as well, especially Havenstein. Goff needs to make the process much faster and work off his primary read. The rest of the 2016 season will be all about Goff learning, but he been very unimpressive thus far.    Gurley compiled 61 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Gurley score, but the negatives far outweighted the positives. Goff's 2 interceptions were both ugly. The first occurred at the beginning of the afternoon, when he threw a ball right to Tramaine Brock. I can't explain the throw any better. Goff hurled it right to the San Francisco corner. Goff's second pick ended the game. The Rams had great field position after squandering their lead, but Goff ruined it by telegraphing a bad throw. Goff could've been intercepted on some other occasions as well; right before halftime, he was nearly pick-sixed on a bad throw on a third-and-5 to Tavon Austin. Brock nearly had another 1, but didn't see the ball. Goff is horrible so far, and if he doesn't progress at all next year, the Rams will have to declare him a sunk cost and just give up on him. That may seem like it's too soon, but Goff doesn't appear to have the stuff of an NFL quarterback. He might just be the worst quarterback in the entire NFL right now.    Despite the miserable quarterbacking, Kenny Britt managed to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards on the season, becoming the first Ram to do so since Torry Holt in 2007. Britt, however, didn't do much, catching just 1 pass for 15 yards. He was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a shoulder injury. As a result, Lance Kendricks led the Rams in receiving with a meager 36 yards.    Todd Gurley was expected to have a huge game versus the 49ers' horrible rush defense, but that never materialized. Gurley finished with just 67 yards on 23 carries. Gurley did manage to score, but he didn't have much blocking, and even when he did, he failed to show the same burst he possessed as a rookie. The FOX announcers commented about this as well. Gurley's inability to pick up chunks of yardage is 1 of the reasons why the Rams failed to hold on to their lead.    The other primary reason for this was that the Rams had yet another epic collapse. We've seen this before, as this contest mirrored the Rams-Dolphins affair from back in Week 11. The Rams led the entire game, and Miami had been doing nothing, but the defense had a meltdown, surrendering 2 touchdowns in a matter of minutes. That's exactly what happened in this game, as the 49ers roared back from down 21-7 to take a lead following a 2-point conversion. Colin Kaepernick was brilliant on the final 2 possessions, but I have to think that it had more to do with the Rams collapsing because Kaepernick really struggled for most of the afternoon. Some of that was his offensive line's inability to block, but Kaepernick also had some pretty poor moments. He floated an interception on a high throw in the early going, leading to a Rams touchdown on a Tavon Austin run. Kaepernick then had his tight end open for a sizable gain, but didn't pull the trigger for some reason. Later, he overthrew "

   "comment":"Gurley scored a touchdown on the very next play. Just like that, the Rams were up by 7 with 12 seconds later. The 49ers continued to struggle throughout the opening half, scoring their only touchdown as a result of the Rams being offside on a punt that gave the 49ers a first down. The primary problem for San Francisco was that it made lots of mistakes prior to intermission. A holding penalty negated a Jared Goff sack, setting up another Gurley touchdown.

   "comment":"Gurley being the backbone of the offense. Six games into the season, Los Angeles is in great position to challenge for the playoffs this year. Jacksonville, meanwhile, continued its season of up-and-down play, dropping a game at home with some terrible special teams play and the limitations of Blake Bortles being visible again. The Jaguars' defense played well again, but they were unable to bail out their special teams units and quarterback.    Right out of the gate, Rams wideout Pharaoh Cooper returned the opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown. He made a great spin move away from a scrum to escape to the sideline, where he found open field to run away from the Jacksonville coverage unit. On the Jaguars' first play from scrimmage, Fournette ran untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. At just 15 seconds into the game, the score was tied at 7. The Rams produced a field goal drive with Greg the Leg Zuerlein drilling a 56-yarder. The Jaguars answered with a drive that produced a 22-yard touchdown with a screen pass to Chris Ivory (9-74). The Rams took the lead with a drive that saw them moved down the field with Goff completing passes to Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp. Near the end zone, Goff connected with Gerald Everett on a shovel pass for a 4-yard touchdown. Late in the second quarter, the Jaguars had a punt blocked by Corey Littleton with Malcolm Brown recovering the ball and charging into the end zone from a few yards out to give Los Angeles a 24-14 lead. Jaguars kicker Jason Myers then missed a 54-yard field goal on the final play of the first half. Woods (5-70) fumbled the ball at midfield in the third quarter after getting stripped by Telvin Smith, and the Jaguars recovered. Jacksonville got 3 out of the turnover to make it 24-17. The Jaguars got the ball back and started moving well with Bortles, hitting Allen Hurns (3-37) for 14 yards and Marqise Lee for 20 yards. However, the drive ended when Bortles had an inaccurate throw tipped in the air and Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman picked it off with a return to midfield. That turnover ended the last promising drive for Jacksonville.    Goff completed 11-of-21 passes for 124 yards with a touchdown. Watkins (1-11) didn't do much, although he did have A.J. Bouye beaten for a long would-be completion that saw the throw be a touch too long.    Gurley continued his excellent season with 23 carries for 116 yards.    Bortles was 23-of-35 for 241 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Lee (5-83) led the Jaguars through the air.    Fournette totaled 130 yards on 21 carries with a touchdown. He injured his ankle, but was cleared to returrn minutes later.    "

   "comment":"Gurley scored on the next play, but adding injury to insult, Palmer left the game with a broken arm and was replaced by Drew Stanton. The backup signal-caller was responsible for an interception on a miscommunication with John Brown to set up another Los Angeles score, and just like that, the Rams were up 23-0 at halftime.    Jared Goff made a couple of mistakes in this game, but played pretty well overall. He went 22-of-37 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was an inaccurate ball late in the afternoon when the Rams didn't have to throw the ball at all. Goff nearly had another pick early in the contest, but it was dropped. However, Goff had way more positives than negatives, as he made some nice conversions on third downs. He also had a second potential score that was dropped in the end zone, and he managed to rush for a touchdown in the second quarter.    Sammy Watkins, on the other hand, had yet another disappointing performance. He caught just 3 passes for 42 yards. It looked like he was interfered with on a deep shot in the second half, but no flag was thrown. Still, Watkins' lack of production was understandable in this contest, as he was matched up against Patrick Peterson. Watkins' catches actually happened on the few instances in which Peterson wasn't covering him. Both Robert Woods (5-59) and Cooper Kupp (4-51) outgained Watkins. Kupp was the best fantasy producer of the duo, as he managed to score a touchdown. However, Kupp didn't have his best showing, as he dropped a couple of passes.    Todd Gurley dominated once again. Gurley gashed the Cardinals for 106 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, and he also reeled in 4 receptions for 48 receiving yards.    As for the Cardinals, they had an ugly offensive showing, which I'm sure you could tell by the final score. Stanton did not look like a functional quarterback, going 5-of-14 for 62 yards and the aforementioned interception. Bruce Arians had an opportunity to upgrade Stanton the past couple of years, but chose not to for some reason. The Cardinals had no chance with Stanton as a replacement for Palmer, who finished 10-of-18 for 122 yards and his pick, which was accomplished in nearly a half of work. Palmer will be out for at least 8 weeks, so Arizona's playoff dreams are effectively eliminated.    Peterson also took a big step backward compared to last week. He looked great on a 6-yard run in the first half, but he couldn't find any running room otherwise, as the Rams limited him to just 21 yards on 11 carries.    Things weren't much better for Fitzgerald, who was restricted to just 3 catches for 29 yards. "
