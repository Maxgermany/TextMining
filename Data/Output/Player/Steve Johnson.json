Four of those receptions came in the opening half, so it's not like Johnson compiled those numbers in meaningless action.    One last thing worth noting is that the Seahawks converted a fake punt when they were up 47-17. That's kind of ridiculous that Pete Carroll would attempt that. Calling for a pass with a backup quarterback to give him reps is 1 thing, but running something like that is just something a douche bag would do.   "
