   "comment":"Johnson combined for just 5 catches.    Fred Jackson did it all. It seemed like every 5 minutes, NFL.com would have a Big Play Alert highlighting a long Jackson gain. Jackson rushed for 133 yards on 25 carries, and also caught 6 balls for 37 receiving yards. He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon. He had some passes dropped, but should have also tossed a couple more picks.    Calvin Johnson had 10 grabs for 128 yards and a score. "

Meanwhile, Facebook friend Todd K. posted the following: <i> Do you want to apologize to Ryan Fitzpatrick now? I don't think you understand the irascible intangibles of Paddy Power. If Andrew Luck was playing he would be thinking about his cold toes, down 28-7. Anyway, Ryan and I are waiting. He likes fruit baskets. </i> Fitzpatrick was amazing in the second half, going 21-of-34 for 316 yards, 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned dual interceptions. However, he still has major physical limitations, and it's highly doubtful that he would have been able to accomplish this against a defense that wasn't horrible and hadn't quit.    Three of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns went to Steve Johnson (8-137). "

   "comment":"Johnson's touchdown celebration. If you missed it, he danced around and pretended that he shot himself in the leg, a la Plaxico Burress 3 years ago. I thought it was funny. It's not like Burress shot anyone else. If you shoot yourself in the leg, you deserve to be made fun of. Nice job, Stevie - except for all of your terrible drops at the very end, that is.)    The cliche must-win probably fit for both teams here. The difference between 6-5 and 5-6 is pretty big in the competitive AFC wild card chase. It was tight to start, with the teams quickly exchanging punts. After another punt from the Jets, the visiting Bills went on an epic march spanning 13 plays and covering 90 yards for the opening touchdown of the game. C.J. Spiller, thrust into a featured role now that star Fred Jackson is on injured reserve, immediately became a factor. He had the ball in his hands 7 times on the drive and was bottled up other than a 13-yard reception. His biggest impact was when Brodney Pool grabbed his face mask for a 15-yard penalty early in the possession. Ryan Fitzpatrick hit David Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays."

In his previous 2 meetings against Buffalo, CJ2.5K - a compromise - rushed for 285 yards and 4 touchdowns on 49 attempts. He had his best performance yet versus the beleaguered Bills in this contest, gashing them for 195 yards and a pair of scores on 18 attempts. Don't think that Johnson is back to CJ2K form though; he did plenty of needless dancing at the line of scrimmage. What sparked his 195-yard output was his offensive line's great blocking. His 83-yard score was the product of a massive hole that Johnson just burst through easily.    The bigger surprise in this game was "
