   "comment":"Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.
