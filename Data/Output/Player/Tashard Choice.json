   "comment":"Choice failed to even match Miller's yardage total. Jackson, who had 36 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries and 4 catches for 49 receiving yards, had a scary moment in which he grabbed his ankle following a 21-yard screen pass. Fortunately, he would end up being OK. As for Spiller, he mustered only 11 yards on 6 tries as his epic failure of a 2013 campaign continues.    Lewis went 21-of-32 for 202 yards. He did turn the ball over on an interception, but his arm was hit as he threw, so it wasn't all on him. He also scrambled 5 times for 13 yards. Lewis completed mostly short stuff that his targets were able to turn into larger gains, thanks to inept play by the Miami linebacking corps.    Stevie Johnson led all Buffalo wideouts with 6 catches for 61 yards. "
