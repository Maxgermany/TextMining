Just before the half, Andre Hal intercepted Blake Bortles with a great diving catch, and that set up a 51-yard field goal from Nick Novak and the Texans took a 20-3 lead into the half. Late in the third quarter, Hoyer had a bad pass off the mark that was deflected to Davon House for an interception. That set up the Jaguars inside the Texans' 20-yard line. On third down though, Watt beat Joeckel for a sack to force Jacksonville's other field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Jaguars tight end Marcedes Lewis took a screen pass for 45 yards to get into Houston territory. However, Watt beat Joeckel for a strip-sack and Mercilus caught the fumble in air to keep the Jaguars from getting back into the game. Alfred Blue ran the ball well to set up another Novak field goal from 50 yards out. Kareem Jackson then jumped a route to get a 27-yard pick-six to pad Houston's victory.    Brian Hoyer returned to the field after missing 2 games with a concussion and completed 25-of-40 passes for 249 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He had a decent outing.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 89 yards. Strong (6-56) is showing progress for the Texans.    Blue rushed for 102 yards on 21 carries. He had a run of 65 yards called back by a holding. Akeem Hunt looked good for the Texans with 3 carries for 28 yards and a catch for 27 yards. Hunt also had a 50-yard pass reception taken back by an incorrectly called penalty.    Bortles completed 17-of-32 for for 239 yards with 2 interceptions. He had no chance with the awful performance of his offensive line. The Jaguars had zero running game as "
