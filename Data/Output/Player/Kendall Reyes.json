   "comment":"Reyes. McElroy is what he is - a game-manager who could at the very best Dilfer a team to a Super Bowl if the NFL still had the same passing rules of 10 years ago. But that's no longer the case, though I don't think Rex Ryan seems to realize that. Ryan, by the way, announced that McElroy will be the starter next week. That's because he doesn't have a quarterback who can win games on his roster.    The Jets were able to establish a 14-7 lead thanks to some gimmick plays, including a 42-yard "
