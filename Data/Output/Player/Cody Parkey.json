   "comment":"Parkey whiffed on a 34-yard field goal. A third-down stop on Washington's ensuing possession was nullified by a Brandon Graham unnecessary roughness penalty, which was a bogus call. Following a Washington touchdown, LeSean McCoy dropped a pass, and then Parkey missed badly from 46 yards. After some defensive breakdowns - more on that later - "

   "comment":"Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards. He was an absolute monster, and it makes me wonder what Oakland's offense would look like if it had Pryor in addition to "

   "comment":"Parkey. A nice punt return by Travis Benjamin set up Los Angeles to get a field goal early in the second quarter. Branden Oliver ripped off a 26-yard run, and then Rivers hit Keenan Allen up the seam for 24 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Melvin Gordon pounded the ball in to give the Chargers a 10-3 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Cutler and Jay Ajayi started moving the ball on the Chargers' defense. Cutler rolled out to hit Kenny Stills (2-37-1) for a 29-yard touchdown and tie the game at 10. Rivers promptly responded by connecting on a few completions, including a 21-yarder to Allen, a 10-yarder to Hunter Henry, and then a 7-yard touchdown to Antonio Gates (2-11-1). That set the NFL record for touchdown catches by a tight end with 112. Huge congratulations to Gates on making NFL history. Ajayi had some nifty runs to get the Dolphins in Los Angeles territory, and then DeVante Parker made a great leaping 31-yard reception to get inside the 10-yard line. Melvin Ingram used a speed rush to get by Laremy Tunsil for a sack to force a field gold for Miami. Cutler came back to make a money throw to Parker for a 31-yard gain inside Los Angeles' 25-yard line. Cutler then had a clutch third-down conversion to Jarvis Landry (13-78), and that set up another short field goal to cut the Chargers' lead to 17-16 with only 7 minutes remaining. The Dolphins' defense and special teams gave Cutler the ball back near the 50-yard line with just over 3 minutes remaining. Ajayi ran the ball about 15 yards, and that set up Parkey, who was good on a 54-yard field goal to give the Dolphins a 19-17 lead. Rivers got the ball at his own 20 with a 61 seconds and 2 timeouts. Rivers proceeded to hit Allen and Henry (7-80) on 2 passes to get the ball to midfield in only 11 seconds. A 10-yard pass to Gordon and a penalty on Miami moved it to the 35. With 10 seconds left though, Koo missed a 44-yard field goal wide right. It was Koo's second miss of the game on a makeable field goal.    Rivers was 31-of-39 for 331 yards with 1 touchdown. Overall, the Chargers' revamped offensive line played well as Miami had only 1 sack in the game. Rivers had a consistently clean pocket to pass from.    Gordon had only 9 carries for 13 yards and a touchdown, but he did have 7 receptions for 65 yards. Allen led the Chargers in receiving with 9 catches for 100 yards.    Cutler was 24-of-33 for 230 yards with 1 touchdown, while Ajayi tallied 122 yards on 28 carries. Parker led the Dolphins in receiving with 4 receptions for 85 yards.   "
