   "comment":"Cody Parkey whiffed on a 46-yarder, however - the third time he missed on the afternoon - and the Dolphins ultimately prevailed in overtime.    I wasn't expecting much from Cody Kessler, whom many teams gave a 7.h-round or UDFA grade to prior to the draft. However, Kessler was poised in the pocket and showed a tremendous amount of toughness while dealing with Miami's merciless defensive line. Following the early gaffes, Kessler did a solid job of moving the chains despite having a depleted receiving corps. He went 21-of-33 for 244 yards and would have achieved the victory had Parkey not whiffed from 41, 42 and 46.    Pryor, as mentioned, was huge. He did everything. He threw 5 passes, completing 3 of them for 35 yards. He rushed 4 times, gaining 21 yards and a touchdown. He also caught all 8 of his targets for 144 yards. He was an absolute monster, and it makes me wonder what Oakland's offense would look like if it had Pryor in addition to "
