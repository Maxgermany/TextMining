   "comment":"T.J. Ward to set up the Broncos inside the Raiders' 15. Denver ran up the score with Manning throwing another touchdown to Sanders. In garbage time, Carr threw a touchdown pass to tight end Mychal Rivera (6-64), who quietly has emerged this season as a quality receiving tight end.    Manning finished completing 31-of-44 for 340 yards with 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Anderson had a huge game for Denver, as he ran the ball 13 times for 90 yards with 4 receptions for 73 yards. Demaryius Thomas (11-108) moved the chains, while Wes Welker (4-24) didn't do much.    Carr completed 30-of-47 passes for 192 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His offensive line was overwhelmed, and his receivers weren't getting separation. Oakland couldn't get the ground game going with Darren McFadden (7-14 rushing, 4-22 receiving).    Defensively, the Broncos got good games from Brandon Marshall (13 tackles), T.J. Ward (7 tackles, 1 INT) and Bradley Roby (4 tackles, 1 INT). <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
