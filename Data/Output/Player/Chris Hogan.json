   "comment":"Chris Hogan lost a fumble, negating at least 3 points. Robert Woods also lost a fumble later in the firt half. This turnover occurred in his own territory, and it helped set up a Minnesota field goal. Another Viking 3.pointer came via a Kyle Orton interception that was overthrown. All of this happened in the first half alone. The errors continued following intermission. Orton lost a fumble because he was careless with the football. Everson Griffen, who had a huge outing with 3 sacks, managed to strip it. Orton then took a bad sack on a third down, as Buffalo's predictable run-run-pass play-calling didn't have the Vikings fooled at all. Meanwhile, some injuries didn't help. Fred Jackson (3-12) left early with a groin injury. I thought this might be a blessing in disguise because it would force Buffalo's coaching staff to utilize C.J. Spiller much more. Sure enough, Spiller burst for a 53-yard gain on his first carry, but had to be carted off after the play. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with a broken collarbone. This forced Anthony Dixon to rush the ball exclusively, as the Bills didn't have any other active halfbacks on the roster. Dixon responded by gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts.    Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point. However, Orton converted the former situation with a 24-yard completion to Scott Chandler. Orton then launched a 29-yard bomb to Chris Hogan, who was tackled at the 1-yard line with just 5 seconds remaining. He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, Hogan lost a fumble, negating at least 3 points. Robert Woods also lost a fumble later in the firt half.

Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front 4 that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered 5 sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone. Landry converted all 5 of his targets, but lost a fumble on the free kick following the poor Orton safety call. Fortunately for Landry, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a 47-yard field goal on the ensuing drive, setting up Miami with a short field, which eventually led to Landry's touchdown.    Sammy Watkins, like Wallace, was also missed deep, as Orton overthrew him. Watkins had a horrific fantasy outing, snagging just 3 of his 7 targets for 32 yards. Hogan was the hero for the Bills early on with 7 grabs for 74 yards, while Bryce Brown tied Hogan with 7 catches for 57 receiving yards, saving those who started him in PPR leagues. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Hogan in the final frame. Taylor is a high-end backup on most teams, but he can be started against non-elite defenses.    Two Buffalo players sustained injuries in this contest. LeSean McCoy rushed for just 16 yards on 11 carries, spending most of his time on a bike. Fortunately, he helped out his owners with a 10-yard receiving touchdown. Sammy Watkins' owners weren't as lucky. All Watkins was able to do was catch a 39-yard pass before leaving with a calf injury. It's unclear if either will be available for next week's game. With McCoy sidelined for portions of this game, Karlos Williams had the most carries, gaining 110 yards and a touchdown on 12 attempts. Williams showed that he can be started if McCoy ever happened to miss a game.    Taylor's touchdowns were thrown to Charles Clay (5-82), Hogan (3-42) and McCoy. Clay is a borderline TE1, whose production might have been possible because of Watkins' injury. Hogan is not a fantasy option.    "

   "comment":"Chris Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of Tyrod Taylor's worst performances of the year. The starting quarterback went 19-of-38 for 183 yards during the contest. He simply did not look very good, especially on his deep passes. Taylor continuously lofted the ball down the field and overthrew his intended receiver by a couple of steps on seemingly every attempt. Taylor did complete some nice passes midway down the field, but his deep accuracy is a major weakness. Taylor has to work to improve that, or he may further regress. On the bright side, Taylor was solid on the ground. He took 5 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown. Taylor had 2 great scrambles that really showcased his mobility. The first came on a 4.h-and-3 near the Patriots' red zone. The Bills called a draw, and Taylor had an open lane up the middle. He used his speed to break through and get a 26-yard touchdown run. On the other scramble, Taylor escaped a Patrick Chung tackle in the backfield and impressively ran for a first down. Taylor needs to keep running to help the Bills out.    Buffalo's running backs in this game played decently with limited opportunities. Mike Gillislee was the lead back, and he looked good in place of the injured LeSean McCoy. Gillislee carried the ball 12 times, totaling 85 yards and a touchdown. He opened the game with a 28-yard burst where he outran some of New England's defenders. He was smooth, working at in an out of cuts, and he definitely has some explosive ability. Gillislee will be a good FLEX play as long as McCoy is out.    The Bills' receivers struggled for the most part on Sunday. Walter Powell (3-59) and Robert Woods (4-50) led the way in terms of yardage. Charles Clay (2-6) was a huge disappointment. None of Buffalo's receivers is worth starting in fantasy as long as Taylor continues to have problems.    For the Patriots, this game was a huge revenge win. The Bills had shut them out in Week 4, and the Patriots had to be licking their chops before this matchup. After all, Tom Brady was back, so this was always supposed to be an easy win. In short, it was, and that was largely due to the play of Brady. Brady was absolutely phenomenal. He took advantage of the Bills' porous secondary, going 22-of-33 for 315 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. He looked sharp and is definitely hitting his stride. Brady made many perfect throws, including the long touchdowns to Hogan and Gronkowski. Brady's play is going to make the Patriots the favorites in the AFC, given the issues with other teams in the conference.    Thanks to Brady's superb play, his receivers had fantastic performances. Rob Gronkowski (5-109) paced the team in terms of yardage and also caught a touchdown. Three other receivers found the end zone, including Chris Hogan (4-91), Julian Edelman (4-37) and Danny Amendola (3-29). Hogan was particularly impressive going against his former team. He is no more than a WR3 most weeks in fantasy, but feel free to fire him up in weaker matchups.    Hogan. Gilmore was beaten by 2 steps on the play, and Hogan does not have great speed. Perhaps Gilmore is hiding an injury.    On offense, the Bills were only marginally better. This game was probably 1 of "
