Kupp had to dive for the pass, and it would have been an incredible catch. Kupp couldn't secure it, however, and the Rams couldn't punch the ball in. That essentially ended the game. Despite the positive final drive, Goff had his share of struggles against the Seahawks, and they were prevalent in the 4.h quarter. Before the final drive, Goff made a few bad mistakes. He threw an awful interception that can only be described as a dying quail. It fluttered over the middle of the field and wobbled like crazy before "

However, Kupp didn't have his best showing, as he dropped a couple of passes.    Todd Gurley dominated once again. Gurley gashed the Cardinals for 106 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, and he also reeled in 4 receptions for 48 receiving yards.    As for the Cardinals, they had an ugly offensive showing, which I'm sure you could tell by the final score. Stanton did not look like a functional quarterback, going 5-of-14 for 62 yards and the aforementioned interception. Bruce Arians had an opportunity to upgrade Stanton the past couple of years, but chose not to for some reason. The Cardinals had no chance with Stanton as a replacement for Palmer, who finished 10-of-18 for 122 yards and his pick, which was accomplished in nearly a half of work. Palmer will be out for at least 8 weeks, so Arizona's playoff dreams are effectively eliminated.    Peterson also took a big step backward compared to last week. He looked great on a 6-yard run in the first half, but he couldn't find any running room otherwise, as the Rams limited him to just 21 yards on 11 carries.    Things weren't much better for Fitzgerald, who was restricted to just 3 catches for 29 yards. "

   "comment":"Kupp, meanwhile, fumbled the ball at the Minnesota 1-yard line in the second quarter. Late in the afternoon, Kupp dropped a ball on third down. The Rams are a young team, and their inexperience really showed in this contest. Goff finished 23-of-37 for 225 yards. He had a few impressive throws against a terrific defense, so he's way down in the pecking order for people responsible for this ugly loss. Goff didn't turn the ball over, which is a plus.    "
