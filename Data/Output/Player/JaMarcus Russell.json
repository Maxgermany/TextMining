Instead of a punt, New York was awarded a new set of downs, prompting an enraged Randy Cross to yell, Don't stop yourself! You tell em, Randy!    Oh, but that wasn't the only way the Raiders killed themselves. They dropped countless passes, especially in overtime. Tom Cable iced Jets kicker Jay Feeley on a potential game-winner, which didn't work - Feeley missed before the timeout and made the attempt afterward. Meanwhile, Sebastian Janikowski missed a 40-yard field goal. Good thing the Raiders didn't spend an early draft pick on him!    I'd love to continue to bash these 2 teams, but I'll have Carpal Tunnel before I'm finished. So, let's move on to the stats: Brett Favre really struggled for the Jets, going 21-of-38, 197 yards, 2 interceptions and 3 fumbles. Favre also had a number of passes that were dropped by Oakland's defensive backs. Laveranues Coles and Jerricho Cotchery consequently did nothing; Coles had 4 grabs for 51 yards, while Cotchery had 1 reception for no yardage.    Thomas Jones did the most damage for New York, inexplicably compiling 159 yards on 24 carries.    Justin Fargas didn't run as well, gaining just 74 yards on 28 carries. Darren McFadden rushed the ball only 8 times, but collected 50 receiving yards on 3 receptions.    JaMarcus Russell looked really good. His numbers weren't amazing - 17-of-30, 203 yards and a touchdown - but he was decisive in the pocket and move the chains efficiently. Russell went to Russell-to-Zach Miller touchdown.

Two possessions later, Russell tossed a softly thrown pick to a Jets defender which set up New York with another quick touchdown. How quick were these scores? The Jets' 2 touchdown drives were for a combined 8 yards. Once it was 14-0, New York was able to just run the ball out. Russell was mercifully benched in the middle of the second quarter. He finished 6-of-11 for 61 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. He nearly had another interception when he threw the ball across his body over the middle of the field. "

   "comment":"JaMarcus Russell would have to play the duration of the game, there's no way I would have recommended anything more than 0.000000000001 units on Oakland. Russell was terrible. His stats don't look so bad (10-of-16, 74 yards, 1 INT), but he took multiple sacks because he couldn't read the defense or identify Washington's blitz package (shocker). The team as a whole looked really unmotivated when Russell stepped in. The score at 1 point was 17-13, but once Russell started taking sacks and doing stupid things, the Raiders looked like they gave up.    Gradkowski was a more effective 10-of-18 for 153 yards. His knee appeared to get twisted on a tackle, but he was standing up and laughing on the sidelines, so it didn't appear to be serious. Unfortunately, it was later revealed that he has a partially torn MCL and will be shut down for the year.    Zach Miller was the only Raider who had more than 3 catches. Miller had 7 grabs for 46 yards. Darren McFadden led the squad in receiving yardage with 84 on 3 catches.    McFadden couldn't get much on the ground, however; he had just 21 yards on 8 carries. Justin Fargas had the same amount of yardage on 9 attempts, but managed to score a touchdown.    As for the Redskins, Quinton Ganther rushed for only 50 yards on 14 carries, but also had 3 catches for 43 more yards and 2 touchdowns. Ganther looked great; he doesn't have much physical talent, but he ran tough and continuously broke Oakland tackles, especially later in the game when the Raiders didn't look interested anymore.    Jason Campbell was also very good, going 16-of-28 for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns. This was yet another solid performance for Campbell, who has looked like a completely different quarterback ever since Daniel Snyder hired a Bingo announcer to be his offensive coordinator. If I were the dark-hearted Snyder, I'd slap a high 10.er on Campbell this offseason.    Despite Campbell's numbers, no Redskin wide receiver did much; Santana Moss paced the team with 4 receptions and 58 yards. Tight end Fred Davis had 3 grabs for 50 yards and 2 touchdowns. After his first score, it appeared as though Davis gave the crowd the middle finger, which drew a 15-yard penalty.    Making a late push for Defensive Rookie of the Year, Brian Orakpo had 4 sacks and a forced fumble in this contest. Of course, that wasn't much of a challenge against JaMarcus Russell. Orakpo has 11 sacks on the season.   Russell would have to play the duration of the game, there's no way I would have recommended anything more than 0.000000000001 units on Oakland. Russell was terrible. His stats don't look so bad (10-of-16, 74 yards, 1 INT), but he took multiple sacks because he couldn't read the defense or identify Washington's blitz package (shocker).
