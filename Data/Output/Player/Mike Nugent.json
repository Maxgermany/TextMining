He had a number of passes off the mark and made the Dolphins' defense look like 1 of the league's better stop units. The signal-caller pulled a Mark Sanchez and threw an interception to Miami defensive tackle Randy Starks. It was a great play by Starks to make a leaping catch. The Dolphins scored a short touchdown off of that with Reggie Bush (19-48). Andrew Hawkins (5-47) made a highlight-reel, leaping, 1.handed 24-yard catch in the middle of the field, but Nugent missed a 41-yard field goal with 3 minutes remaining. The game ended after Dalton tried to fit a pass into a tight window, but the ball was overthrown and fell to safety "
