   "comment":"Cecil Shorts - but the defense was very anemic. Kansas City outgained the Jaguars, 170-56 by halftime, as Alex Smith and Jamaal Charles did whatever they pleased.    Charles rushed for 77 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 23 yards. He could've enjoyed a much brighter afternoon, but he left the game in the third quarter with a quad injury. Charles did return to rush the ball once in the 4.h quarter, but Kansas City didn't need him on the field because this game was such a blowout. Still, it's highly encouraging that Charles was able to take the field after getting dinged.    Smith, meanwhile, went 21-of-34 for 173 yards and a pair of scores. Smith obviously didn't trail by more than 2 throughout the afternoon, so he was able to do what he does best - check the ball down to his targets. Smith will have much greater issues when facing large deficits and tougher defenses, but he lives for games like this.    The 1 player hurt by Smith's constant checkdowns is Dwayne Bowe, who caught just 4 balls for 30 yards. If you're a Bowe fantasy owner, get used to performances like this. Bowe will have the occasional big game, but he'll have pedestrian numbers for a No. 1 wideout by the end of the season.    Let's get through the Jaguars quickly. Gabbert is terrible. He went 16-of-35 for 121 yards and 2 picks. The first interception, the aforementioned miscommunication, was not really his fault. The second 1 was, as he tossed the ball right to Tamba Hali, who took the pick back for 6. Gabbert managed to injure his thumb in this contest, but it's not like it matters. It's clear that he's the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. Jacksonville will have to take Teddy Bridgewater or Tajh Boyd next April (click here for my ). It should be noted that Gabbert wasn't completely at fault. The offensive line was terrible, which is puzzling, given that Jacksonville used its first-round pick on right tackle Luke Joeckel. Gabbert took 6 sacks. Justin Houston had 3 of them.    Maurice Jones-Drew (15-45) and Cecil Shorts (3-40) had poor fantasy outings because of Gabbert's ineptitude. There will be better days against softer defenses, so don't panic if you own 1 of them. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Shorts - but the defense was very anemic.

The Texans, meanwhile, may have lost on the scoreboard, but they were the real winners Thursday night because they inched closer to landing Teddy Bridgewater, all while ensuing that 1 of their divisional rivals will be awful for years to come. Houston didn't even try early on; the team was whistled for 10 penalties in the opening half, including some dumb infractions like false starts, a DeAndre Hopkins punch personal foul, a kick-catch interference, an unsportsmanlike flag for a D.J. Swearinger taunt, and so on. However, Gary Kubiak did something incredibly stupid late in the game when he benched Case Keenum (16-of-29, 159 yards, TD, INT) in favor of Matt Schaub. The latter came in and nearly led the team to victory, which would've been disastrous. As my Las Vegas Hilton partner Matvei wrote in a text to me, After ruining the season, Matt Schaub is now making a bid to ruin the Texans draft pick. Keenum struggled with his accuracy throughout, but the Texans should have kept him in the game, not only to ensure defeat; but to also make sure that they know what they have in Keenum going forward. Playing Schaub was very pointless and almost extremely harmful. Schaub went 17-of-29 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad pick at the very end.    Some players stood out: - Andre Johnson had a big second half. Of his 13 catches, 11 came after intermission. He finished with 154 yards. - Both starting tight ends scored once. Garrett Graham hauled in 8 passes for 73 yards. Marcedes Lewis had 2 grabs for 42 yards. - Maurice Jones-Drew, tallying 103 yards on 14 carries, suffered a hamstring injury in the 4.h quarter. He told the NFL Network crew that he'd be ready for Buffalo in Week 15, but that could've been just standard player arrogance. - Ace Sanders threw a 21-yard touchdown to Jordan Todman, who also went down in the final period. He hurt his leg. - Cecil Shorts had just 2 catches for 13 yards, but he scored a touchdown. He also drew a long pass-interference flag and just missed out on a 50-yard touchdown because Henne overthrew him by a few inches.    I've made fun of Brad Nessler countless times.

Allen Robinson led the team with 5 catches for 82 yards and a touchdown. Allen Hurns (3-49) and Shorts (3-41) weren't big factors.    The Jaguar defense did a great job of getting pressure early on Tannehill. They sacked him just 3 times, but brought plenty of heat while this game was competitive. Tannehill, as a result, went just 16-of-29 for 196 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception on a tipped pass. He was hurt early by countless "

Jacksonville's defense came up with a stop, but Ace Sanders muffed the punt inside their 5-yard line, and the Cowboys recovered. A few plays later, Romo rolled out and threw a dart to Witten for a touchdown. Romo opened up the lead by hitting Dez Bryant on a short crossing route. Bryant then turned downfield and ran through a few arm tackles before powering his way into the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. Jacksonville responded to set up a scoring opportunity on apass to Shorts.

It started when Manning was sacked by Shorts, so the Jaguars settled for a field goal before intermission.    The Giants melted down in the second half. It started when Manning was sacked by Geno Hayes. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Jennings tried to get up and run with the ball around the leg of a teammate, but J.T. Thomas was able to dive on the ball for a touchdown. Jennings should have just accepted a safety. New York moved the ball into Jacksonville territory before Josh Brown had a costly missed a field goal. The Jaguars took advantage with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Marqise Lee (6-75). It was a pretty pass by Bortles to pull Jacksonville within 5 points (the 2.point conversion attempt was batted by Jason Pierre-Paul). Early in the 4.h quarter, Donnell caught a pass in the flat, but fumbled the ball on a hard hit by Dwayne Gratz. Aaron Colvin picked up the ball and raced down the sideline for a 41-yard touchdown for Jacksonville. With about 6 minutes remaining, Manning hit Beckham (7-90) for 23 yards and Reuben Randle (3-52) for 17 yards. The Jaguars buckled down to force the Giants into a field goal. Down 24-22, Bortles put together the game-winning drive. He threw a short slant to Lee and he ran for 22 yards to get it started. A 10-yard pass to Shorts and zone-read runs of 11 and 20 yards by Bortles got the ball in field goal range for Josh Scobee to hit a game-winning 43-yarder with 28 seconds left."
