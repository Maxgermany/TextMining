   "comment":"Justin Houston and Alvin Bailey with pressures from Dontari Poe. Phil Dawson nailed a 52-yard field goal. San Francisco went to a fake punt early in the 4.h quarter close to midfield. Lloyd and Kaepernick took advantage of the opportunity, as Lloyd made a great catch for a gain of 29 yards. That led to another Dawson field goal to take the lead 19-17. The 49ers drained the clock with another drive to set up Dawson again. The Chiefs' comeback attempt ended quickly, as Smith sailed a pass down the middle of the field that was intercepted by Perrish Cox.    Smith completed 17-of-31 passes for 175 yards with 2 scores and the interception. Once again, Andy Reid screwed up by not running Charles enough, as he had only 15 carries, yet produced 80 yards. Charles didn't get enough use in the passing game either, as he had 1 reception for 4 yards.    Kaepernick was 14-of-26 for 201 yards with a touchdown. Michael Crabtree had only 1 reception for 16 yards, and the 49ers obviously missed Vernon Davis. They moved the ball well, but struggled once they crossed the Chiefs' 30.    San Francisco's offensive line really missed right tackle Anthony Davis. Jonathan Martin was beaten by Justin Houston for a sack and other pressures. Dontari Poe was destroying guard "

   "comment":"Justin Houston, who was just 1 sack short of breaking Michael Strahan's single-season record. Unfortunately for Houston, he didn't have Brett Favre on the other side to take a fraudulent sack. Rivers finished 20-of-34 for 291 yards and 2 interceptions. Only 1 pick was his fault, as he foolishly threw into double coverage. The second interception came on a desperation heave on the final play of the game. Rivers' protection really needs to improve this offseason, so an early-round pick should be used on an offensive lineman.    It didn't help Rivers that he was missing his top wideout in Keenan Allen. With Allen out, "

   "comment":"Justin Houston then strip-sacked Hoyer with the ball recovered by the Chiefs. For the very next play, Smith threw a 7.yard touchdown pass to Charles. Before the half, the Texans tacked on a field goal to make it 27-9 at intermission, but the Houston defense had allowed 221 yards across the first 2 quarters. In the third quarter, Washington (6-105) beat Peters for a 32-yard reception, but the drive stalled at the 10-yard line when Dontari Poe blew up a 4.h-and-1 for no gain. Both offenses struggled in the second half until Mallett came in. Mallett quickly drove the ball down the field, firing some lasers to Hopkins, including a touchdown pass and 2.point conversion to his stud receiver. Mallett moved the ball for another field goal drive, but Maclin recovered an onside-kick attempt to clinch the win for Kansas City.    Smith completed 22-of-33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Charles had 57 yards rushing on 16 carries with 46 yards receiving and a touchdown on 5 receptions. Kelce (6-106) and Maclin (5-52) led the Chiefs through the air. The Texans had no answer for Kelce, and he looks poised for a huge year.    Hoyer was 18-of-34 for 236 yards with 1 score and a pick. He struggled to see the field and was inept overall. Mallett should definitely be the starter in Week 2 at Carolina. He was 8-of-13 for 98 yards with a score on 2 drives. Hopkins (9-98) was awesome and would have produced even more if the Texans had gone with Mallett earlier or all game. He'll continue to produce massive numbers each week because the Texan quarterbacks don't have anyone else to target.    Alfred Blue gained 42 yards, but was given just 9 carries. Brent Grimes was mixed in too much, making Blue an underwhelming fantasy option. Arian Foster will be back soon anyway.    The Chiefs' front 7 really played well. Allen Bailey notched a pair of sacks, with Derrick Johnson and Jaye Howard each contributing 1 for Kansas City. Of course, Justin Houston made big plays as well. The Chiefs' corners were vulnerable. Peters had some coverage issues aside from his pick. "

   "comment":"Justin Houston also hobbled off in the opening half, so it's pretty remarkable that Buffalo managed just 6 points after halftime. At any rate, Watkins finished with 6 grabs for 158 yards and 2 touchdowns. Again, those were his halftime numbers, so he was on pace for a 12-316-4 line, which would have been amazing to see.    As for Taylor, he began the game hot, going 14-of-26 for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half. He was precise on most of his throws, and he made several downfield connections that were very impressive. However, things fell apart for him as the game progressed, and he was just 7-of-12 for 55 yards and a score following intermission. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack. Taylor's final numbers were 21-of-38 for 291 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 46 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. Despite the second-half collapse, this was an encouraging performance for Taylor. Not only was he battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL, but he was also hurt going into this game.    "
