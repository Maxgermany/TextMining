Ingram is an RB1 for the rest of the year, though the timeshare with Kamara, who got 42 yards on 8 carries, could frustrate some owners.    As for the Redskins, this loss was humiliating. They had a huge lead with just half of the 4.h quarter to play. They blew it, and now they are extremely unlikely to make the playoffs.
