   "comment":"Jalin Marshall fumble for a score in the third quarter. Erase those 3 semi-fluky instances, and the Bills would've gotten crushed. Buffalo has many issues. The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front 7. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. "
