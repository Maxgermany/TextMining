The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front 7. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. Marshall fumble for a score in the third quarter. Erase those 3 semi-fluky instances, and the Bills would've gotten crushed. Buffalo has many issues. The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front 7. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby, both of whom are very talented, were torched mercilessly. Ryan Fitzpatrick was mostly unstoppable. If the Bills couldn't contain such a pedestrian quarterback, how are they going to deal with some of the better signal-callers in the NFL? Fitzpatrick finished 24-of-34 for 374 yards and a touchdown. This was 1 of the best performances of his career. He was so incredibly accurate, especially on third down. The Jets were 8-of-13 in those situations. Fitzpatrick is going to wilt when the weather gets cold, like he usually does, but he at least proved that he has mentally recovered from his horrific Week 17 showing from last year.    All 3 of Fitzpatrick's primary receivers caught 6 passes. Brandon Marshall led the way with 101 yards, though there was a scary instance in which he was tackled awkwardly and was taken into the locker room. He didn't miss much time, however. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Jalin Marshall fumbled a kickoff with the Chiefs leading 10-0. Marshall (3-27) could not do much because of his banged-up knee, while Eric Decker (1-31) disappointed during the game.    Matt Forte continues to be a solid back for the Jets. The ageless wonder once again was good for the team, and he carried the ball 15 times for 65 yards. He was able to rip off a few big plays, and he would have done better if the Jets were not trailing. Forte looks good now, but the Jets need to make sure that they do not overwork him early in the season. They need to have him healthy down the stretch if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs.    For the Chiefs, this was a huge win. The way they approached the game was quintessential Alex Smith. The team played in an efficient manner, and they were led by their veteran quarterback. Smith had a solid performance 1 the day for Kansas City. He went 25-for-33 during the contest for 237 yards and 1 touchdown. Smith made very few mistakes, and most of his throws were accurate. It was a perfect game for the game manager, and though he struggles against tougher competition, he really helps to dominate weaker opponents.    It is no surprise that Travis Kelce was the top target for Smith during the game. Kelce caught 6 of his 7 targets for 89 yards and a touchdown. At 1 point, he snagged a long pass that moved the Chiefs into the red zone. He used his athleticism to beat the coverage and then used his speed to motor into the red zone. The possession resulted in an important field goal, and the Chiefs can thank Kelce for helping them to get there.    Elsewhere, Jeremy Maclin was decent, catching 4-of-7 targets for 35 yards. Maclin struggled to get open against New York's secondary, but he still remains 1 of Smith's favorite targets. Rookie Tyreek Hill saw some action today as well, catching 3 passes for 26 yards. He also was active on returns, and it looks like Andy Reid wants to get him involved on offense in the future.    The running game for the Chiefs was once again very strong as Spencer Ware led the way. Ware received 20 carries for 75 yards during the contest. Though he lost a fumble, Ware was able to rip off chunks of yards at various points. He showed excellent burst and strength, and he may have done better against a weaker defense. Ware has made a case to keep the starting job even when Jamaal Charles returns, and he will continue to be a threat in fantasy as a result.    The Chiefs played some terrific defense during the game and really racked up some serious numbers during the game. One of the best stat lines came from the aforementioned Derrick Johnson. Johnson led the team in tackles with 11. In pass defense, he was great as well, recording 2 passes defensed and an interception. Johnson also scored a touchdown and caused another pick off of 1 of his pass defenses. He looked explosive and still has elite instincts. The 33-year-old is showing no signs of dropping off. Marcus Peters also was great for the Chiefs. He grabbed 2 more interceptions to move his season total to 4. Through 18 career games, Peters has 12 interceptions. He is definitely developing into 1 of the best young cornerbacks in the league and should be a force for the Chiefs in years to come.    One of the strangest plays of the day came on a kickoff return. Rookie Jalin Marshall fumbled a kickoff with the Chiefs leading 10-0. "

   "comment":"Jalin Marshall caught 3 passes for 59 yards and what appeared to be a game-winning touchdown. Brandon Marshall, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 45 yards, which included an amazing, 1.handed grab for 13 yards. The veteran Marshall, as mentioned, should've scored, but Fitzpatrick missed him. Marshall had an ugly afternoon, yelling at Fitzpatrick on the sideline, and he was heard shouting, Get me the f***ing ball! It's easy to see why Marshall has never been on a team that has reached the playoffs.    Marshall for a touchdown on a slant on the first possession. He was later strip-sacked deep in his own territory, but was lucky that a teammate was in the area to recover the potential turnover. Fitzpatrick at least didn't throw an interception in the opening half, but was guilty of 2 following intermission. The first occurred when he didn't see Jordan Phillips dropping into coverage. The second was more egregious. Fitzpatrick lofted a pass into the end zone despite there being nothing but multiple Dolphins in the area. It was so utterly careless that if you didn't know any better, you'd think Fitzpatrick had an IQ of zero. He made up for it with the aforementioned touchdown, but his mistakes were definitely 1 of the reasons the Jets lost yet again. Fitzpatrick finished 17-of-28 for 193 yards, 1 score and the 2 picks. He missed 1 drive with an apparent concussion, but was cleared rather quickly. Bryce Petty threw 2 passes in his absence, completing both short tosses to his running backs for 19 yards.    Fitzpatrick's leading receiver wasn't Brandon Marshall; Jalin Marshall caught 3 passes for 59 yards and what appeared to be a game-winning touchdown."

The Jets went up 6-3 - the extra point was missed - and that was all they did during the afternoon. The Jets mustered just 197 total yards outside of that possession. Petty finished 19-of-32 for 163 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception late in the game on an inaccurate throw. Petty had that bomb to Anderson, but spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking. He looked like a poor-man's Ryan Fitzpatrick, which is just sad. Granted, he didn't have Nick Mangold blocking for him against the Rams' ferocious defensive front, but he appears to be just a backup at best in this league.    Matt Forte and Powell were the only productive players for the Jets. Forte gained 98 yards on 20 carries, while Powell caught 7 balls for 52 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.    Hindered by a weak arm, Petty couldn't get the ball to Brandon Marshall very often. Marshall saw just 6 targets, catching 4 of them for only 15 yards.   "
