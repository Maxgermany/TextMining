The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front 7. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. "

Brandon Marshall, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 45 yards, which included an amazing, 1.handed grab for 13 yards. The veteran Marshall, as mentioned, should've scored, but Fitzpatrick missed him. Marshall had an ugly afternoon, yelling at Fitzpatrick on the sideline, and he was heard shouting, Get me the f***ing ball! It's easy to see why Marshall has never been on a team that has reached the playoffs.    "
