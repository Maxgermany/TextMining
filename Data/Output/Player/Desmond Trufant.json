On 1 instance, Graham actually had to break up a potential interception on a high throw. Graham, who had no catches in the first half, was at fault on other plays, however. He dropped a pass and then lost a fumble just inches short of the goal line, though it appeared as though he crossed into the end zone. The call was reviewed, but the officials let the play stand.    Brees and Graham didn't disappoint their fantasy owners as much as their fans. The former threw for 313 yards on 30-of-47 passes, but had 2 interceptions compared to only 1 touchdown, which came with 5:46 remaining in regulation. He also was strip-sacked for a touchdown on the final play of the game. The score was thrown to Graham, who snagged 6 balls for 53 yards, all of which came in the second half.    Ingram, as mentioned, found the end zone early on. He didn't have much success overall though, tallying 38 yards on 13 carries.    As for the Falcons, this victory will allow them to win the division with a win over Carolina next week. With "

Following the challenge, they inexplicably allowed the call to stand even though it was clearly the wrong 1.

In addition to all the injuries, 2 big Cobb plays were negated by offensive pass interference. Mike McCarthy was so furious about the first that he was flagged for an unsportsmanlike penalty. As mentioned, Cobb (6-60) was knocked out with a shoulder injury, joining Nelson on the sidelines. Meanwhile, "
