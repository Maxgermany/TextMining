   "comment":"Ifedi, stepped on Russell Wilson's foot, resulting in a safety. The Falcons then took the lead with a field goal on the ensuing possession, and they never looked back. The end result of this game was definitely misleading, but what's not is Atlanta's yardage total. The Falcons accumulated 422 net yards of offense, as the Seahawks had absolutely no answer for anything Atlanta was doing. Earl Thomas was clearly missed, and it didn't help that No. 2 cornerback Deshawn Shead was knocked out of the game when his knee buckled while trying to cover Taylor Gabriel. The Atlanta receiver actually pushed off, and Shead went down instantly. It's unclear why offensive pass interference wasn't called. The Falcons were flagged just twice all game. Hopefully official Gene Steratore makes great use of his new yacht. With Seattle's defense struggling big time, Matt Ryan torched the formerly dominant Legion of Boom with ease. Ryan went 26-of-37 for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. He validated his possible MVP status, as the Seahawks couldn't do anything to slow him down. They didn't put much pressure on him, and even when they did, he still found open receivers, punishing them for blitzing him. Even when Julio Jones was knocked out, Ryan still torched Seattle's secondary mercilessly. Atlanta punted just once in meaningful action.    Speaking of Jones, he left the game temporarily on the opening drive of the third quarter with a toe injury, as he was hobbling around on the sideline. Jones reentered the game, but left prior to the end of regulation. I imagine he still would've played had the contest not gotten out of hand, but it still has to be disconcerting for the Falcons. They'll obviously need Jones to beat a tougher opponent in the NFC Championship. Jones caught 6 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. He also dropped a pass. His score, the first of the game for the Falcons, was an obvious pass interference call - blocking downfield prior to the ball being released - that Steratore didn't call for some reason. The FOX announcers, including Mike Pereira, were befuddled as to why no flagged was tossed.    If Jones is hobbled next week, the other receivers will obviously have to pick up the slack. Gabriel (4-71) was top wideout producer as far as yardage is concerned, while Mohamed Sanu (4-44) found the end zone. Running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were big factors as receivers as well. Freeman hauled in 4 balls for 80 yards, while Coleman snatched 3 passes for 22 yards and a touchdown. Speaking of Freeman and Coleman, they ran well versus the Seahawks, which was surprising. Freeman (14-45, TD) and Coleman (11-57) combined to eclipse the century mark.    Atlanta moves on to the NFC Championship. It'll either host the Packers or travel to Dallas. If the Cowboys beat Green Bay, this will have been the final game in the Georgia Dome.    As for the Seahwks, they were hot offensively early on, as they engineered a 14-play touchdown drive to start the game. The possession lasted 8:34. There were some great runs, while Russell Wilson was precise. However, bad luck ensued; the Ifedi injury, the aforementioned penalty on the Hester return, and Wilson falling down all hurt. Then, Atlanta held the ball forever, and Seattle's offensive chances were limited as a result. The Seahawks' decision to punt on 1 occasion on a 4.h-and-1 from around their own 40-yard line also hurt. They pinned the Falcons down at the 1-yard line, but Ryan put together a 99-yard touchdown drive. Wilson went 17-of-30 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions in garbage time, 1 of which should've been called a reception down by contact. Wilson played well, but once again had issues on the offensive line. He constantly had to run out of the pocket, and many of his incompletions were thrown away.    If there's a silver lining for the Seahawks, it's that they may have found something in "
