   "comment":"Mohamed Sanu beat them. That's how bad things are for their secondary. Sanu shouldn't beat a powderpuff football team; let alone an NFL playoff contender.    This may have been 1 of the best games of the entire season. Both pass offenses were operating at full force, and neither team was ever out of the game. There were a couple of late lead changes, but at the end of the day, the Falcons came out on top. Still, the Packers have to be happy with how their offense played today. The most impressive part of this game was the fact that the Packers ran a completely 1.dimensional offense and were still able to put up 32 points. The team really did not have a rush offense. Ty Montgomery was surprisingly inactive due to an illness, so the team did not have much in the backfield. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski led the way with 6 carries and 34 yards. Aside from him, the team did not have much, especially if you exclude the 6 carries by Aaron Rodgers. This will continue to be the case until either Montgomery or James Starks returns to the lineup.    With that said, the passing game was simply terrific. Aaron Rodgers had what was by far the best performance of the season. There had been some questions about the veteran quarterback, as he had struggled at times during the 2016 season. Some were wondering if he was starting to decline as he got older. Rodgers was able to silence those critics with his play today. Rodgers went 28-of-38 on the day, throwing for 246 yards, and running for 60 as well. He tossed 4 touchdown passes and single-handedly carried the Packers' offense to victory. Rodgers made numerous sharp throws and finally looked comfortable in the pocket. His offensive line gave him ample time to complete his passes, and it really showed. On all of Rodgers' touchdowns, he threw the ball to the perfect location. One of his best passes came on his touchdown to Trevor Davis (3-24). Davis was at the front right pylon, and Rodgers threw it to where only Davis could reach it. On his first touchdown, Rodgers waited for Jordy Nelson to get open and fit it into the window where Nelson was. Rodgers was simply able to pick apart the Falcons' defense, and he may be able to build on this performance in the future - especially when he gets some of his offensive weapons back.    Without the talents of the injured Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson (4-94) and Davante Adams (12-74) led the way for the team. Nelson finally appears to have come on after a slow start to the season. He had a huge 58-yard catch in the first quarter that got the Packers on the board early. Meanwhile, Adams has emerged as a reliable target for Rodgers. He has 25 catches over the last 2 games and should continue to be heavily targeted as he continues to get open. The only concern about Adams today was a fumble that rolled out of bounds. He tried to do a bit too much to get extra yardage and lost the ball. You cannot fault him for effort, but he needs to be more careful in the future.    One of the most important plays of the day came on the final touchdown drive for the Packers. Rodgers hit Nelson for what would have been a first down, but Nelson backtracked and was short of the first down. However, upon video review it was revealed that Brooks Reed never got off the field for the Falcons. As a result, a 12-men-on-the-field penalty was called, giving the Packers a first down. Three plays later, Rodgers tossed the ball to Jeff Janis (3-23) for the score. Rodgers then ran the ball in for the 2.point conversion to make the score 32-26. The Falcons were able to battle back, however, thanks to an equally as impressive performance from quarterback Matt Ryan. Ryan went 28-of-35 on the day for 288 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was on fire, and his game-winning drive was fantastic. Ryan marched the team down the field for 75 yards in just over 3 minutes. He threw crisp passes and left only 30 seconds on the clock for the Packers to strike back. It was a signature moment for him, as he proved that he can be a clutch quarterback for the team. Ryan made some great passes during the rest of the game as well. On his first touchdown, he lofted a perfect pass to Taylor Gabriel in the end zone. Gabriel, a 5-foot-8 receiver, was well covered in the end zone, but Ryan managed to put the perfect touch on it. The ball dropped straight into Gabriel's hands on what was the best throw of the day for Ryan.    The receivers for the Atlanta Falcons were expected to have a huge day against the banged-up Green Bay secondary, but Julio Jones (3-29) was a disappointment. He hurt his knee at some point in the contest, and did not look comfortable out on the field. His injury will definitely be something to monitor in the future. While Jones had a tough game, Mohamed Sanu put together a really strong performance. Sanu saw 10 targets from Ryan and caught 9 of them. He turned those 9 balls into 84 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Sanu is worth consideration as a bench receiver, but he should only be started in favorable matchups. That said, if Jones is out, Sanu could end up being a WR3 due to the volume of targets he would see. Aside from Sanu, Gabriel (3-68, 1 TD) and "

   "comment":"Mohamed Sanu. A bit later, the awful tackling was on display once again, as numerous defenders whiffed on a Freeman 12-yard reception, allowing the Falcons to reach the red zone once again. Freeman scored a couple of plays later, giving the Falcons a 2.touchdown lead that the Lions couldn't overcome despite some late heroics. Atlanta didn't punt until the 4.h quarter.    Despite the offensive brilliance, Ryan didn't have a great fantasy outing because of 3 interceptions. One was his fault, as Glover Quin jumped the route and returned the turnover for a touchdown. The other 2 weren't on Ryan, as the ball bounced off the hands of Tevin Coleman and Mohamed Sanu. Ryan finished 24-of-35 for 294 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks.    Coleman looked good otherwise, gaining 46 yards on just 4 carries and snatching 3 catches for 43 receiving yards. However, it was Freeman who had the monstrous performance. He burst for 106 yards and a touchdown on just 21 attempts, and he also added 3 catches for 32 receiving yards.    "

Ryan had a chance to take the lead at the very end, but no 1 could get open on the final drive. This forced Ryan to throw the ball away twice, and on 4.h down, he tried to get the ball to "
