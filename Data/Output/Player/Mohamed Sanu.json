The touchdown reception was 1 of Dalton's few bright moments of the afternoon. He was pretty mediocre, going 15-of-23 for 169 yards and an interception which occurred on a horrible attempt at a screen pass. Dalton is mostly responsible for his team's struggles in the red zone, and it's not going to get easier for him because he just battled 2 pretty weak defenses.    Cincinnati scored thrice on the ground. Giovani Bernard found the end zone on a couple of occasions, but struggled to find running room, gaining 47 yards on 14 carries. Jeremy Hill (7-39) had a late touchdown.    Excluding Green, only 1 Bengal accumulated more than a single reception. That was Sanu, who hauled in 5 of his 8 targets for 44 yards.    As for Tennessee, when news broke of Rob Bironas' passing Sunday morning, I wondered if the Titans would be distracted. Many of the players were teammates with Bironas, so the news had to devastate them. Sure enough, the Titans moved the chains well on occasion, but made plenty of mistakes in this game, which seemed to indicate that their minds were elsewhere. Even his non-teammates struggled mentally, as "

Dalton went 15-of-24 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his numbers would've been so much better if his supporting cast hadn't capsized.    Dalton's scores went to Green, who lost a fumble, and Sanu (5-70). Bernard probably should've been utilized more in the passing game, as he caught just 2 passes. He finished with 62 rushing yards on 13 carries.    I have to vent about Jerome Boger, who is easily the worst official in the NFL. Boger and his crew committed numerous blunders throughout the evening, including: - A horrible illegal contact what wiped out a Revis interception. - Gronkowski was whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty followed a routine helmet tap that you see about 20 times per game. - There was an awful pass interference call on the Bengals following a Brady pass to Danny Amedola. There wasn't even any contact while the pass was in the air. - The Bengals lobbied for an intentional grounding and won their argument about a minute after the play was over. I've never seen an official so easily influenced by players. - Boger flagged the Patriots for a blindside block even though he called the play dead beforehand. That infraction made absolutely no sense. - Boger botched a play toward the end of the first half when he misunderstood the difference between a forward fumble and a lateral during a Patriots' defensive return. - Boger incorrectly ruled a Green touchdown when it was obvious the star wideout was bobbling the ball while falling out of bounds. There were other errors I didn't list. Roger Goodell needs to remove Boger because he's an embarrassment to the NFL.   "

   "comment":"Sanu came up with huge performances to lead an injury-depleted Cincinnati squad to the win.    The Jaguars were fortunate to get on the board first as Bengals cornerback Terence Newman dropped interception deep in Jacksonville territory. Denard Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to A.J. Green, a clutch reception by Cedric Peerman, a chunk run by Hill, and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanu.

Lewis not being on the field was just as huge as Graham's injury, as the Saints just didn't have anyone who could cover A.J. Green.    Only 1 Cincinnati player had more than 36 receiving yards, and that was Green, who hauled in 6 balls for 127 yards and a touchdown, as he was thrilled that Lewis couldn't play much.

He was much better than he was last week, but he just didn't do enough to keep pace with Roethlisberger.    Green had all but 78 of Dalton's yardage, as he completely humiliated Ike Taylor and both of Pittsburgh safeties. Taylor has gotten the better of Green in the past, which always was bizarre, but that apparently was just a fluke. Green had a monstrous outing, snagging 11 balls for 224 yards and a touchdown.    Jermaine Gresham (3-23) had Dalton's other touchdown, and he actually happened to be Cincinnati's second-leading receiver.

   "comment":"Sanu on a third down during the second quarter. He then opened the second half with 2 awful throws, 1 of which was almost intercepted. Dalton was so bad that the Bengals didn't achieve a first down following halftime until there were 11 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. I really didn't understand Cincinnati's offensive game plan. I liked that the team came out with some effective trick plays to Rex Burkhead, which included a 23-yard end-around, but the Bengals didn't involve Jeremy Hill or Giovani Bernard nearly enough. Those were the only 2 play-makers Cincinnati had with Green and Gresham both out, so they should've had a combined 35 touches at the very least. Instead, that number was only 24. Hill carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards and a touchdown. The Colts clamped down on the run with Green out, but the Bengals didn't try hard enough to establish the ground game. In fact, Hill had just 4 attempts following halftime. Bernard, meanwhile, caught 8 balls for 46 receiving yards, but most of that came in garbage time. Granted, he had a long reception on a screen wiped out by a Russell Bodine hold, but Bernard should've been used in space more. Instead, the Bengals had Dalton repeatedly fire futile passes downfield to Sanu and Brandon Tate that had no chance of being completed."

There were a couple of late lead changes, but at the end of the day, the Falcons came out on top. Still, the Packers have to be happy with how their offense played today. The most impressive part of this game was the fact that the Packers ran a completely 1.dimensional offense and were still able to put up 32 points. The team really did not have a rush offense. Ty Montgomery was surprisingly inactive due to an illness, so the team did not have much in the backfield. Fullback "

Julio Jones caught only 3 passes in the first half, but he was unstoppable after intermission, finishing with 8 grabs for 111 yards and a spectacular, leaping touchdown in which he was able to impressively tap his feet inbounds. Jones constantly beat the Buccaneers with in-cuts, as they just couldn't figure out how to stop it.    Ryan's other 3 touchdowns went to Austin Hooper (3-46), Levine Toilolo and Patrick DiMarco. Sanu made up for the early drop, finishing with 5 receptions for 74 yards. He also drew a pass-interference call in the end zone.    With Tevin Coleman out, "

   "comment":"Sanu (2-26) as Ryan's preferred No. 2 option. Gabriel was highly involved in the option, and he got an opportunity to catch a couple of screen plays. He has explosive ability that Sanu does not have, and he could be worth a speculative add in fantasy. Still, do not expect much from him.    One of the best offensive weapons on the day for the Falcons was Devonta Freeman. He took 15 carries for 56 yards and managed a couple of short-yardage touchdowns. He also made a big impact in the passing game, catching 4 passes for 49 yards. He is definitely the lead back in the formation, but "

Freeman scored a couple of plays later, giving the Falcons a 2.touchdown lead that the Lions couldn't overcome despite some late heroics. Atlanta didn't punt until the 4.h quarter.    Despite the offensive brilliance, Ryan didn't have a great fantasy outing because of 3 interceptions. One was his fault, as Glover Quin jumped the route and returned the turnover for a touchdown. The other 2 weren't on Ryan, as the ball bounced off the hands of Tevin Coleman and Mohamed Sanu. Ryan finished 24-of-35 for 294 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks.    Coleman looked good otherwise, gaining 46 yards on just 4 carries and snatching 3 catches for 43 receiving yards. However, it was Freeman who had the monstrous performance. He burst for 106 yards and a touchdown on just 21 attempts, and he also added 3 catches for 32 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Sanu leave the game after that. With a skeleton-crew offense, Ryan couldn't muster much by himself and transformed into a turnover machine in the second half. The end result was an upset victory by the upstart Bills, who have improved to a very surprising 3-1 record. Ryan had a chance to take the lead at the very end, but no 1 could get open on the final drive. This forced Ryan to throw the ball away twice, and on 4.h down, he tried to get the ball to Taylor Gabriel, who couldn't separate from the cornerback. It was very evident how much Ryan missed Jones and Sanu in that sequence, and their absences ended up costing the Falcons the game.    Ryan finished 24-of-42 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had 3 give-aways in the second half. He was strip-sixed and then forced a bad interception, which "
