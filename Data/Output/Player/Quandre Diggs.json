The NFL Network crew teased us by saying they'd make the announcement of who would be playing at halftime of the Super Bowl. Of course, anyone who had been on Twitter or watched ESPN knew already that it would be Coldplay. Their decision to tease the viewing public by making them wait until halftime to learn it was Coldplay, despite Jim Nantz's play on words, was ridiculous. I personally don't care whether Coldplay performs or not. I'm not a music fan at all, and as I've said before, I don't know why the NFL insists on putting on musical performances during halftime of big games. Most football fans aren't looking for the music aspect of it, and the casual audience won't really care, since they can watch or listen to Coldplay elsewhere. Besides, non-football fans aren't going to start liking football because Coldplay is performing at halftime of the Super Bowl. It's stupid. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Diggs.
