   "comment":"Zach Miller touchdown. Later in the game, the Raiders were offside on a Jets' 4.h-and-four. Instead of a punt, New York was awarded a new set of downs, prompting an enraged Randy Cross to yell, Don't stop yourself! You tell em, Randy!    Oh, but that wasn't the only way the Raiders killed themselves. They dropped countless passes, especially in overtime. Tom Cable iced Jets kicker Jay Feeley on a potential game-winner, which didn't work - Feeley missed before the timeout and made the attempt afterward. Meanwhile, Sebastian Janikowski missed a 40-yard field goal. Good thing the Raiders didn't spend an early draft pick on him!    I'd love to continue to bash these 2 teams, but I'll have Carpal Tunnel before I'm finished. So, let's move on to the stats: Brett Favre really struggled for the Jets, going 21-of-38, 197 yards, 2 interceptions and 3 fumbles. Favre also had a number of passes that were dropped by Oakland's defensive backs. Laveranues Coles and Jerricho Cotchery consequently did nothing; Coles had 4 grabs for 51 yards, while Cotchery had 1 reception for no yardage.    Thomas Jones did the most damage for New York, inexplicably compiling 159 yards on 24 carries.    Justin Fargas didn't run as well, gaining just 74 yards on 28 carries. Darren McFadden rushed the ball only 8 times, but collected 50 receiving yards on 3 receptions.    JaMarcus Russell looked really good. His numbers weren't amazing - 17-of-30, 203 yards and a touchdown - but he was decisive in the pocket and move the chains efficiently. Russell went to Javon Walker 5 times for 75 yards and a touchdown. Zach Miller registered 4 catches and 57 yards.   "

The Bears were up when these injuries began taking place, so I have to imagine that they may have won. Instead, the Giants have become quite possibly the worst 7-3 team of all time.    The Giants are 7-3, but came close to a let-down loss against Chicago. The Bears outplayed New York in the first half as the Giants were flat, but in the second half of the game, New York's defense pitched a shutout to keep the Giants in prime position for a wild-card slot. The Bears (2-8) are already out of the playoff race, so losing maintains their draft position.    The Bears struck first early in the first quarter as they moved down the field before Jay Cutler threw a beautiful 19-yard pass to Zach Miller. New York quickly responded with an 11-yard run from "
