   "comment":"Dante Fowler, setting up a short Jacksonville touchdown. Two more drops occurred on the next drive, coupled with another sack of Luck. An Allen false start then ruined a possession, as the Colts were set up with a third-and-1 in Jacksonville territory. Indianapolis then committed tons of senseless penalties on defense, including numerous, unnecessary late hits. There was a lot of talk about Gus Bradley possibly getting fired following this contest, but Chuck Pagano and Ryan Grigson should be the 1. left in London. Grigson has screwed up repeatedly, failing to improve Luck's pass protection, which was a major issue in this game, as Luck was hit seemingly on every other play. Pagano, meanwhile, did a horrible job of preparing his team for this divisional battle. With the AFC South improved, it's difficult to imagine the Colts having consistent success as long as both Grigson and Pagano are employed.    Luck finished 27-of-42 for 234 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but those numbers are very deceiving. Most of Luck's yardage, as well as his 2 scores, came when his team was down double digits, so most of his production came in garbage time. Luck was only at about 80 yards entering the 4.h quarter! That said, Luck didn't play poorly. He was victimized by countless drops. Pressure was also a factor. He was sacked 6 times and hit on numerous other occasions. His right guard and right tackle were out of the lineup, but those missing players weren't very good. It's almost a crime that Grigson is derailing Luck's career.    Luck's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Dante Fowler and returned 53 yards for a touchdown. The Jaguars took a 19-0 lead into the half. Deshaun Watson took over at quarterback for the Texans in the second half and promptly moved the ball down the field. A penalty on the Jaguars took away an interception, and Watson made them pay by throwing a short touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. Jacksonville answered by moving the ball down the field on the Houston defense as Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to fullback Tommy Bohanon. Watson moved the ball across midfield again before Fowler kicked the ball out of Watson's hand, and Ngakoue recovered the fumble. Late in the 4.h quarter, Watson moved the ball inside the 10-yard line, but threw an interception to Tashaun Gipson to finish off Houston.    Fournette ran for 100 yards on 26 carries and a touchdown in his NFL debut. He also caught 3 passes for 24 yards.    Bortles had an easy game, completing 11-of-21 for 125 yards with a touchdown.    Watson was 12-of-23 for 102 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. Savage finished 7-of-13 for 62 yards.    Lamar Miller ran for 65 yards on 17 carries, plus made 2 receptions for 31 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins caught 7 passes for 55 yards with a touchdown.    The Jaguars' defense was incredible, totaling 10 sacks. Calais Campbell (4 sacks, 5 quarterback hits), Yannick Ngakoue and Dante Fowler overwhelmed Houston's offensive line. The only thing that didn't really go well for the Jaguars was new cornerback "
