  "comment":"George Wilson dived out of bounds to get out of Wayne's way for no apparent reason. He wasn't pushed or anything; he just leapt out of the way. Perhaps ownership told him to make sure the Colts scored enough so that they could have a shot at the first-overall selection. Wayne led the team with 2 catches for 91 yards. "
