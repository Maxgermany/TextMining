Abdullah managed just 9 yards on 6 attempts, while Bell was restricted to only 2 yards on 4 carries. Bell can probably be dropped in all leagues; he can barely move at all at this point, so unless he receives some bionic leg transplant, he'll continue to struggle. Abdullah, meanwhile, is a buy-low option of sorts, but I wasn't very high on this Detroit team heading into the season, so I can't be overly excited about that opportunity.    Stafford's only touchdown of consequence went to "

Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Chad Greenway, Harrison Smith, Anthony Barr (.5), Erik Kendricks, Tom Johnson and Everson Griffin (1.5) combined for 7 sacks. The day's total was the most sacks that Stafford had ever taken in a single game.    Detroit's leading rusher was Ameer Abdullah, who totaled 43 yards on 8 carries.    Eric Ebron led the Lions with 5 catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. Calvin Johnson had 86 yards on a handful of receptions with a score.    On the bright side for Detroit, young defensive tackle Caraun Reid had a superb game with 6 tackles, 1 sack and 4 for a loss. He was overwhelming the interior of the Vikings' offensive line.

   "comment":"Abdullah drop. It appeared as though this was going to be yet another long Thanksgiving afternoon for the Lions, but the team completely turned things around after that. In fact, Stafford led 6 consecutive scoring drives that featured 5 touchdowns and a field goal. Stafford was on fire, putting together 1 of the best games of his career. He went 27-of-38 for 337 yards and 5 touchdowns despite seeing his targets drop 4 passes. Stafford was battling a defense that didn't seem to have any sort of sensible game plan, but he was still amazing.    I still can't believe that the Eagles allowed a second-round rookie to cover Johnson without safety help. Megatron responded with 8 catches for 93 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also should've drawn pass interference in the end zone on 1 occasion, but the flag wasn't thrown for some reason.    Stafford's other 2 touchdowns went to Golden Tate (7-50) and Theo Riddick (5-62). The latter was constantly open in the middle of the field, as it seemed as though Philadelphia had no idea that he could catch passes. Tate, meanwhile, dropped a pass, but was terrific otherwise.    No Detroit runner posted great numbers, but the Lions ran the ball very well, ripping off at least 4 yards on most of their carries, which constantly set up Stafford in second-and-short situations. Abdullah, who dropped a ball, managed to gain 63 yards on 16 carries. "

   "comment":"Abdullah. To end the drive, Theo Riddick knifed through the Colts' defense for a 21-yard touchdown as rookie left tackle Taylor Decker made an excellent block at the second level to spring Riddick downfield. After trading punts, Stafford got moving again with a 27-yard gain to Marvin Jones (4-85), a third-down conversion to Boldin, and a gain of 13 yards to Eric Ebron (5-46-1). That set up Dwayne Washington to plunge into the end zone from a yard out. Luck responded with a drive that saw him complete passes to Donte Moncrief (6-64-1) and T.Y. Hilton (6-79) to set up a 50-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. Stafford answered with a 32-yard pass to Jones and finished another drive with a strike to Ebron for a short touchdown reception. Ebron made a superb catch while getting hit by 2 defenders. Luck quickly moved the ball with a 32-yard completion to Moncrief, 14 yards to Josh Ferguson, 16 yards to Dwayne Allen, 8 to Hilton, and a short touchdown strike to Moncrief. The Lions took a 21-10 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Luck got rolling with a 51-yard pass to Philip Dorsett (4-94), who beat Darius Slay for the reception. Allen (4-53-1) got open in busted coverage for a 19-yard score. Luck went back to Allen for a 2.point conversion and midway through the third quarter, the Lions' lead was cut to 21-18. Stafford answered ripping the ball down the field and finished it with a short touchdown toss to Abdullah, who was left uncovered in the flat. Luck came back to produce another field-goal drive. The Lions punted the ball away, and Luck went right back to work with a 32-yard pass to Hilton to get into Detroit territory. The Lions' lead evaporated when Luck hit tight end "

   "comment":"Abdullah touchdown run. Detroit took the lead on the play, and the team didn't relinquish the 7.point advantage, thanks to some key plays down the stretch. As for Cook, it doesn't look good. Following the game, he had a brace on his knee and was on crutches. It's unclear what the injury is exactly, but the Vikings fear that it's a torn ACL. That's terrible news for the offense, which was so reliant on him. Without Cook, who gained 66 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries, the Vikings couldn't run the ball. Latavius Murray mustered only 21 yards on 7 attempts. Murray was mediocre behind Oakland's elite offensive line last year, so he's not going to be able to accomplish much in Minnesota. The Lions, meanwhile, came through in the end. Anthony Zettel had a big sack on third down, and then a fumble was forced from Adam Thielen to win the game at the very end. The defense was very impressive in this contest. I know they were going against Case Keenum, but the unit was missing Jarrad Davis (concussion).    Matthew Stafford finished 19-of-31 for 209 yards. He refrained from throwing an interception, but with some luck, as a couple of Minnesota defenders dropped the ball. Stafford didn't have much time in the pocket, as he often had to use his mobility to escape sacks. On 1 occasion, he did this and found a receiver to convert a third down. He then hit Marvin Jones for 38 yards on a third-and-17 to set up a field goal.    With the Detroit receivers dealing with a tough secondary, the Lions focused on involving Abdullah as much as possible, and it paid off. Abdullah gained 94 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, with a big chunk of his output coming on a 20-yard burst in the first half.    Marvin Jones (2-42) and "

   "comment":"Abdullah. Early in the second quarter, Detroit moved into Cleveland territory when Stafford made a nice play to buy time before hitting Tate on the run for a 35-yard gain. A 10-yard run by Stafford set up Abdullah to finish the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run that tied the game at 10. Then, the Browns started to play like the Browns; Nevin Lawson stripped tight end Seth DeValve of the ball and scooped it up. Lawson was untouched by DeValve and was able to bolt down the sideline for a 44-yard touchdown. In the final minutes of the half, Kizer made some nice throws to move ball into Detroit territory. He took off on an 18-yard run to get the ball to the 2.5-yard line with 19 seconds remaining. On second-and-goal with 15 seconds, Cleveland ran a quarterback sneak from over 2 yards out, and it was stuffed by Detroit. Before the Browns could get set up to spike the ball, the clock ran out, and they went into the half missing out on the points opportunity. It was a horrible play call, but hilarious and typical of the Browns. Cleveland opened the third quarter by moving down the field with "
