Later in the first half, the Bengals were down 14-0 but were getting the ball back. Brandon Tate fumbled the kickoff return, however, and Pittsburgh would quickly score again. At 21-0, this game was out of reach, and if there was doubt, Antonio Brown scored on a punt return touchdown just prior to halftime, thanks in part to a missed block-in-the-back penalty.    It was a different story in the second half though. The Bengals mustered just 63 total yards after the break and were able to convert only 2-of-11 third downs overall. Dalton (11-of-24, 135 yards, TD) was knocked out of the game in the 4.h quarter because of a hip injury he incurred after a sack. It didn't appear to be serious; Marvin Lewis may have held him out because his team was trailing by 4 touchdowns.    Dalton struggled, but at least A.J. Green had a solid fantasy outing. The dynamic rookie wideout had more than half of Dalton's yardage, as he hauled in 6 grabs for 87 yards and a touchdown.    There was some concern about "

They outgained the Chiefs, 409-284. They won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 11 minutes, as Kansas City converted just 1-of-11 third downs. Andy Dalton dissected Kansas City's underachieving defense, going 18-of-29 for 230 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) that went to A.J. Green (6-91) and "

   "comment":"A.J. Green was pushed out of bounds before he could get 2 feet down on a superb catch. Pittsburgh took advantage with a drive that produced a Shaun Suisham 40-yard field goal. The Bengals crossed midfield in the 4.h quarter but Green fumbled the ball away after getting hit by Allen. Dalton threw another pick to Allen, who made a great catch off a deflection. Cincinnati missed a 56-yard field goal late in the 4.h quarter, but the Steelers missed a 53-yard field goal, too. With 20 seconds remaining, Roethlisberger made a dumb decision and overthrew Mike Wallace (1-3) on a roll out. The ball was easily picked off by Reggie Nelson. Dalton made a huge throw to Green to move the ball about 20 yards and get in range for the game-winning 43-yard field goal by Josh Brown.    Roethlisberger was 14-of-28 for 220 yards with a score and 2 picks. Pittsburgh's ground game never got into a groove. Jonathan Dwyer (14-39) and Rashard Mendenhall (11-50) had some nice runs but never could establish control against the tough Bengals defense.    One field-goal drive was all Cincinnati's offense could muster. The Steelers shut down the Bengals' ground offense, rendering BenJarvus Green-Ellis (15-14) completely ineffective. All Cincinnati could do to move the ball was some occasional completions to A.J. Green (10-116), "

He made some nice throws and connected with A.J. Green for a 53-yard scoring bomb, though that pass was underthrown. Dalton did manage to set the franchise single-season record for passing yardage and touchdowns with his numbers, but his struggles shouldn't be lost because they're a huge concern going forward.    Injuries are an issue for Cincinnati as well. Dalton didn't have either of his 2 tight ends in this matchup. He also missed left tackle "

   "comment":"A.J. Green dominated the Ravens through the air. Dalton and Green each set career highs for yards. Baltimore almost pulled out a win thanks to the inspired play of Steve Smith, but in the end, Dalton and Green were too dominant for Smith to overcome.    The Bengals got on the board first when Dalton connected with Marvin Jones along the sideline for 32 yards. In the red zone, the Ravens hurt themselves as Courtney Upshaw dropped an interception and a penalty on Will Hill gave the Bengals a first down. Dalton finished the drive by diving into the end zone after a 7-yard run. Ravens answered with a drive that was led by a Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback "

   "comment":"A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, DeAngelo Williams took over and had some nice numbers, rushing 9 times for 71 yards, including a 55-yard run that Panthers fans would recognize. He also caught 4 passes for 39 yards. If Bell is out for a while, Williams should be a capable backup, especially with the Steelers' usually good passing game.    The leading target for the Steelers this week wasn't Antonio Brown, but tight end Heath Miller, who had zero receptions last week for the first time since 2007. He followed up that zero with 10 receptions on 13 targets for 105 yards as the Bengals gave way over the middle, to focus on stopping Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant.    Coming out of halftime, the Steelers still led 7-6 and drove down the field, but were stalled and had to kick a field goal to make it 10-6. That was the last lead Pittsburgh would have, as Roethlisberger went on to throw 3 interceptions, helping Dalton and company work with shorter fields.    The Bengals' defense coupled with A.J. Green are the MVPs of this game, but Green gets the glory as he caught a 9-yard touchdown with 2:57 seconds left in the game to make it 13-10 Bengals.    Much of Roethlisberger's troubles came after Le'Veon Bell went down, which is somewhat understandable, but Roethlisberger had 2 opportunities to drive his team to a victory, once with 2:57 left, when he threw an interception and then again with 1:47 left, and he came up short both times. I think Pittsburgh fans can chalk this 1 up to rust and a good Cincinnati defense more than Bell's absence.    The Bengals' running backs split was highly in favor of "

   "comment":"A.J. Green open repeatedly on the opening drive. The team struggled to stop the run throughout the afternoon, and it missed several tackles. I know Robert Quinn is out, but the Rams should be better than this. It almost seemed like they were more concerned with injuring the opposition than making stops. That's Gregg Williams and Jeff Fisher, for you. Two of the dirtiest people in the NFL are getting what's been coming to them. Credit Dalton for taking advantage of this. He went 20-of-27 for 233 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was 1 of his 2 mistakes, and it occurred when he didn't set his feet and floated a pass that was easily snatched by a St. Louis defender. Dalton was terrific otherwise, save for a near-interception in the end zone. Fortunately for Dalton, the defender was able to just get 1 foot inbounds.    Two of Dalton's scores went to Green (6-61), while the other was thrown to "

   "comment":"A.J. Green for a 66-yard touchdown pass to bring it to 13-7 Steelers. McCarron went on to finish the game with a decent 280 yards passing for 2 touchdowns, but 2 interceptions as well.    One of McCarron's interceptions came in the third quarter with the score 16-7. It was an extremely poor decision as he floated a pass to the sideline that was easily intercepted and returned for a touchdown by William Gay, putting the score at 23-7 Pittsburgh. And by the time McCarron threw his second touchdown, the game was already over.    Roethlisberger, despite completing 30-for-39 passes for 282 yards, did not throw a touchdown and was intercepted once. But he did look sharp all game and led his team into Bengals' territory over and over again. Williams was the beneficiary, with 2 touchdown runs, as he rushed 23 times for 76 yards and caught 2 passes for 15 more.    Heath Miller returned from his rib injury and was the chain mover all game, as he caught 10-of-10 targets for 66 yards. That's not much in yards per catch, but it is the definition of a quarterback's security blanket. That left the team's 2 most explosive players, finishing with not-so explosive numbers, with Antonio Brown totaling 87 yards and no touchdowns on 7 receptions and Martavis Bryant also catching 7 passes, but for just 49 yards.    The Bengals were led by their all-world receiver A.J. Green, who finished with 6 receptions on 9 targets for 132 yards and 1 touchdown. He now has 4 touchdowns in his last 3 games and back-to-back 125-plus-yard games. He was getting open at will, and McCarron did a good job getting him the ball. We'll see if they can build on this good start.    Besides losing Dalton, the Bengals also lost the leading touchdown receiver in the league, "

   "comment":"A.J. Green dominating the Redskins' defense, it appeared as though the Bengals would pull away. They entered the red zone, up 3. but Dalton forced a poor throw while under pressure, and the ball sailed right to linebacker Will Compton. The Redskins were able to drive the field for a touchdown to take the lead, and the contest eventually went into overtime, the first extra session that British people have ever seen in person. Much like the last NFL overtime affair that everyone else witnessed on national TV, this contest came down to a short field goal, which was whiffed, as Dustin Hopkins was wide left from 34 yards. As a result, we've had a tie in consecutive weeks for the first time in nearly 2 decades.    It's pretty horrible to have to fly to London and just come away with a tie, but if there's a silver lining for the Bengals, it's that Eifert finally became a big part of the offense. Eifert caught 9 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. He's definitely back, and he'll help Cincinnati's offense immensely in the second half of the season.    Eifert's presence will undoubtedly be a boost for Dalton, who had a solid morning if some mistakes are ignored. Dalton finished 27-of-42 for 284 yards and a touchdown, but he was also guilty of a horrible interception that allowed the Redskins to crawl back into it. Dalton was lucky to get away with a couple of other picks, as Norman dropped a pair of passes. Dalton also lost a fumble on a third-down sneak late in overtime near midfield, negating a potential game-winning field goal for Cincinnati.    Only 3 Bengals caught more than 1 pass. In addition to Eifert, they were A.J. Green (9-121) and "

   "comment":"A.J. Green, and the Bills had LeSean McCoy knocked out, well, you finally had your answer after watching this beauty.    This was a game that neither team really deserved to win. Both teams blew opportunities to pull away from 1 another, but neither was able to do it. At the end of the day, the Bills emerged victorious because they were able to make fewer mistakes than the Bengals. Andy Dalton was mediocre for the entire day. His numbers may not look bad at a glance, as he went 24-of-43 for 207 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks, but he really did not do much. Dalton spent a majority of the day dinking and dunking to his receivers. He rarely threw more than 10 yards down the field, and that really hurt the Bengals during the contest. That said, Dalton did have some nice throws. In particular, his touchdown to Tyler Boyd was a pretty pass. Dalton lofted it to the perfect spot in the back of the end zone where only his rookie receiver could grab it. That was Dalton's best play of the day. However, his interceptions were both brutal. The first was underthrown, and it was wobbling like crazy. On the second, he threw well behind Tyler Eifert, and it was tipped to Stephon Gilmore. Overall, Sunday was a tough day for Dalton, and the loss can partially be blamed on him.    Of course, there was another major reason for Dalton's struggles today. On the second offensive play of the day for the Bengals, A.J. Green left the game with a hamstring injury. He would not return. The stud receiver was writhing around in pain, and it frankly did not look good. The Bengals are fearing that Green tore his hamstring. With Green bound to miss time, look for Tyler Boyd to pick up some extra catches. The rookie looked fairly solid during the contest and emerged as Dalton's top target with Green out. Boyd ended up catching 6 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. This could be the beginning of a strong stretch for the second-round pick. Elsewhere, "

   "comment":"A.J. Green (5-63) also found the end zone.    As for the Browns, Kizer was eventually benched in the second half, and for good reason. He finished 16-of-34 for only 118 yards and the interception, which wasn't his fault. That said, Kizer played terribly. So many of his passes were off the mark, and it took him forever to process information. He also wasn't a factor as a runner - 5 scrambles, 10 rushing yards - so he didn't have any positive moments outside of a 26-yard completion on a third-and-13. The Browns really need to consider sitting Kizer for a while until things slow down for him. "

   "comment":"A.J. Green. Dalton demonstrated nice touch on his passes and also was extremely accurate. While his ball placement wasn't always perfect and he 10.ed to throw a bit on the higher side, he for the most part was able to put his receivers in position to make catches. Dalton did well on the touchdown pass to hit Green in stride after he torched rookie Tre'Davious White on a go route. As for the picks, neither was Dalton's fault. Both actually bounced off the hands of Green, who uncharacteristically knocked them into the air. Dalton could have thrown the first a little lower, but both were absolutely balls that Green should have caught.    Speaking of Green, he was far and away the leading receiver for the Bengals. He totaled 189 yards and the touchdown on just 7 catches. He saw a team-leading 13 targets and had a huge day. However, it should have been better. Not only did Green cause both picks, but he fumbled at the end of a long catch after taking a big hit from a Bills player. Green is still 1 of the best receivers in the NFL, but don't let the stat line fool you. This was not his best performance. Meanwhile, Dalton's other top targets were "

   "comment":"A.J. Green, who had a man beaten, for another downfield touchdown that saw him loft the ball perfectly to Green and hit him in stride. It was a very nice throw and really helped to seal the deal for the team. Overall, Dalton finished 15-of-25 for 154 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was able to do everything needed of him to help the Bengals win. It was an encouraging performance for the veteran quarterback, and the Bengals need to hope that it carries over to the upcoming weeks.    Dalton spent a majority of the day targeting A.J. Green, which should come as no surprise. Green caught 4 passes for 50 yards and had the aforementioned touchdown. He did all this while battling a stellar Denver secondary. Green is a matchup-proof WR1, and while he has had a rough outing or 2 this year, he should be trusted every week. Elsewhere in the receiving corps, Erickson (2-42, 1 TD) looked solid, while "
