   "comment":"Aaron Hernandez). Despite those 4 drops, Brady was still 25-of-35 for 258 yards and 3 touchdowns, looking sharper than he has ever been since his nasty knee injury.    Wes Welker is back! He led the Patriots in receptions with 8 for 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. I'm still concerned that he's playing so soon off a torn ACL, but he'll continue to be a dangerous weapon for Brady as long as he's on the field. "

Welker and Hernandez, meanwhile, each had 6 grabs for 38 and 101 yards, respectively. Welker scored once, while Hernandez really shined in his second ever NFL game.    The Patriots predictably got nothing out of their running game. "

   "comment":"Aaron Hernandez (5-56), who was playing for the first time since Week 2. The pick prevented New England from running away in this game, allowing the Jets to hang around. Had Brady converted his 101st touchdown, the Patriots would have been up 24-7 at the beginning of the third quarter.    Brady went 24-of-33 for 321 yards, 1 score and that interception. He was pressured constantly, but that didn't deter him from hanging 30 on Rex Ryan's defense. He's unstoppable right now.    Brady's tight ends didn't do much. I already mentioned Hernandez; "

Despite playing poorly throughout, Brady somehow mustered a game-winning drive in the final couple of minutes. When he hit Aaron Hernandez for the decisive 8-yard touchdown, Brady pumped his fist and yelled triumphantly. He didn't look passive there, so maybe he was just told that he couldn't cover the spread. I don't know. This game was just weird.    Brady went 27-of-41, 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of ugly picks. His scores went to Hernandez (8-68) and "
