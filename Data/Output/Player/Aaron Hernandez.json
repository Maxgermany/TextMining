   "comment":"Hernandez). Despite those 4 drops, Brady was still 25-of-35 for 258 yards and 3 touchdowns, looking sharper than he has ever been since his nasty knee injury.    Wes Welker is back! He led the Patriots in receptions with 8 for 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. I'm still concerned that he's playing so soon off a torn ACL, but he'll continue to be a dangerous weapon for Brady as long as he's on the field. Randy Moss, meanwhile totaled 5 receptions for 59 yards.    Brady's 2 rookie tight ends each had a catch. Hernandez hauled in a 45-yard grab, while Gronkowski scored a 1-yard touchdown.    With Laurence Maroney out, "

He was pressured constantly, but that didn't deter him from hanging 30 on Rex Ryan's defense. He's unstoppable right now.    Brady's tight ends didn't do much.

   "comment":"Hernandez running open in the end zone, which really hurt as the Patriots missed the field goal, and at halftime, the score was deadlocked at zero. To start the third quarter, Brady threw a bad pass for an interception to Deon Grant. There was no opening as the New England signal-caller forced the ball to Rob Gronkowski. The Giants took advantage and started moving the ball. Manning had good gains to Victor Cruz and Jake Ballard. That set up a field goal for New York. On the next New England possession, Brady got hit as he reared back to throw the ball and it came loose. The sack-fumble was recovered by the Giants at the Patriots' 10-yard line. The next play saw Brandon Jacobs run up the gut into the end zone, virtually untouched. Special teams became a liability for both teams in the second half. First, a muffed punt by Giants cornerback Aaron Ross was recovered by New England. That set up the Patriots for a field goal. A short time later, New England committed their fourth turnover when Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich forced a fumble from Julian Edelman in punt coverage. On the drive, Manning moved the ball with a couple of good passes along the sideline. The Giants got inside the 10-yard line when Manning hit Michael Clayton in the back of the end zone. His catch was tossed because he had stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, Manning threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone after throwing off his back foot. Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington spun off of his man and made a leaping interception to negate scoring chance. It was Arrington's fifth interception of the season. Brady answered with a big 27-yard toss to Welker in the middle of zone coverage. They hooked up again for 28 yards to get inside the 20. Brady finished the drive with a touchdown strike to Hernandez. He caught the ball short of the end zone and made a few defenders miss before charging in for the game-tying score. Brady led another a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead in the fourth quarter. The Giants came up with a big answer. Manning made a few good throws to move the ball down the field. He was aided by a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Arrington. On 3rd-and-5, Manning made a perfect throw to "

Brady went 28-of-46 for 316 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The score went to Rob Gronkowski (6-75). Wes Welker led the team with 95 receiving yards (5 catches), though it's worth noting that he barely did anything in the first half. The decision to involve him in the offense again was clearly made at halftime when it was apparent that Hernandez was not returning.    Of course, some credit needs to be awarded to the Cardinals, particularly the offensive line, which held up relatively well. "

Sanchez kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone for a safety. Massive penetration by Vince Wilfork caused the fumbled handoff. Sanchez got lucky on a few passes that could've been intercepted. His suspect decisions caught up with him when he threw a ball too late for an open receiver. It hung up in the air and that let Patriots corner Alfonzo Dennard recover to make a leaping catch. Sanchez should've had a touchdown on the play, but blew it by waiting. He did help move the ball down the field for a 54-yard field goal from Nick Folk just before halftime. Brady had a nice drive in the third quarter with a few third-down conversions by hooking up with Wes Welker (6-66). Hernandez (5-54) had a catch to bring it to the goal line and Brady went to Gronkowski (6-78) for the score. In the fourth quarter, down by 10, Sanchez engineered a nice drive with a short touchdown pass to Keller (7-93). It was a laser into a tight window. The game-tying drive started with a good completion to Keller, but rookie "

Kaepernick finished 14-of-25 for 216 yards, a whopping 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He also rushed 7 times for 28 yards.    Two of Kaepernick's scores went to Crabtree (7-102), who now has 23 catches for 301 yards and the 2 touchdowns in the past 3 weeks. Kaepernick also found Randy Moss (2-36) and Delanie Walker in the end zone. Vernon Davis hauled in 1 reception for 10 yards. Kaepernick actually had him for a potential score, but overshot him during 1 of his rare poor attempts.    The 49ers ran the ball extremely well. In addition to Kaepernick, 2 other 49ers averaged about 4 yards per carry: Frank Gore (21-83) and LaMichael James (7-28).    As for New England's ground attack, Belichick benched both Ridley and Vereen because of their fumbles. He turned to the reliable Danny Woodhead, who looked great. He collected 61 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 12 carries.    The 49ers did a great job of taking Wes Welker (5-56) away for the most part.
