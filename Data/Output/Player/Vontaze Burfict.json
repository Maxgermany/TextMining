Before the game started, these teams were scuffling and all throughout the game as well.    The drama and importance of this game lost a little of its edge after Andy Dalton broke his thumb on the Bengals' first possession. After Dalton had driven his team deep into the Steelers' territory on their first possession, he made an errant shovel pass that was intercepted by defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Burfict slammed Roethlisberger into the ground on the next possession. Roethlisberger had to be carted off with a shoulder injury. As this was happening, Cincinnati fans showered him with water bottles and other debris, prompting Jim Nantz to call the people in the fans disgraceful. That adjective can be used to describe the commentary of Nantz and Phil Simms, which was absolutely abysmal. In fact, their audio feed cut out at 1 point of the game, and it was the best moment of the evening. That, and Simms saying the tables have switched. I don't even know anymore. Act 4: With Roethlisberger knocked out, it appeared as though the Bengals finally realized that they had a chance. McCarron caught fire, leading the team down the field for 3 scoring drives. The first, capped off by a Jeremy Hill touchdown, was set up by an A.J. Green-drawn pass interference at the 6-yard line. The second, which ended in a field goal, saw Tyler Eifert (5-58) making a great diving catch for 18 yards on third-and-9 just 1 play after committing a terrible drop. The third concluded with a beautiful McCarron-to-Green touchdown. Just like that, the Bengals came back from down 15-0 to take the lead, 16-15. And to top it off, Landry Jones, who had replaced Roethlisberger, threw an interception to Burfict that appeared to end the game... Act 5: All the Bengals needed to do was run out the clock, but they couldn't do that. Jeremy Hill lost a fumble, giving the Steelers 1 last chance. Roethlisberger took the field to replace Jones. It didn't appear as though he could throw the ball very far at all, but he still did a decent job of connecting with his receivers on short routes. That said, it didn't seem as though Pittsburgh was going to move into field-goal range in time - until Burfict inexplicably crash into "

   "comment":"Burfict. Dalton then used Tyler Boyd (4-66) to turn the give-away into 3 more points and a 29-0 lead. The Eagles finally got on the board as Zach Ertz was wide open in busted coverage for a short touchdown. Bennie Logan forced a fumble from Rex Burkhead, and Philadelphia recovered the ball. Wentz threw into a crowd of defenders, however, and after being juggled around, Shawn Williams corraled the ball for an interception. After a punt, Philadelphia had a 15-play drive that ended with a short touchdown run for Darren Sproles (7-14-1, 6-35). The Bengals got too cute after that, throwing a pass to tackle Jake Fisher, and he fumbled the ball away to Philadelphia. The Eagles were set up close to midfield down 15 with 6 minutes remaining. However, Burfict made a great play to intercept Wentz and slam the door for Cincinnati.    Dalton completed 23-of-31 passes for 332 yards with 2 touchdowns. LaFell led the Bengals in receiving with 5 receptions for 95 yards and a score.    Wentz was 36-of-60 for 308 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Ertz had 9 receptions for 79 yards and a score.    Burfict had a tremendous game with 15 tackles and 2 interceptions. The Bengals' defensive line dominated the Eagles' offensive front. Carlos Dunlap was constantly making his presence felt, while "

   "comment":"Burfict and Vinny Rey were knocked out, and the reason the Bengals have been so much better defensively since the bye has been Burfict's improved play, but still, talk about a double bad beat.    When the Steelers and Bengals meet, there's always a heightened sense of competition and each hit seems to have more impact. The Bengals were the team to strike first with a touchdown, as after Jeremy Hill was stopped 3 times at the goal line, the Bengals went for it on 4.h-and-goal, and Andy Dalton snuck it in to take a 10-3 lead in the first quarter. The Bengals were bottling up "

   "comment":"Burfict was penalized for a late hit and then thrown out of the game several plays later for contacting an official.    Dalton finished 20-of-35 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and the lost fumble. Considering that his team barely had the ball, those were solid numbers. Dalton did what he could, and even led an impressive touchdown drive to take the lead in the 4.h quarter, but Tennessee marched back down the field for the decisive score.    "
