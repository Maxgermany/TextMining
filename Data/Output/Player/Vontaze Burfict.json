No matter what side you are on, both teams were extremely hyped for this second meeting. Before the game started, these teams were scuffling and all throughout the game as well.    The drama and importance of this game lost a little of its edge after Andy Dalton broke his thumb on the Bengals' first possession. After Dalton had driven his team deep into the Steelers' territory on their first possession, he made an errant shovel pass that was intercepted by defensive lineman "

The Bengals were the team to strike first with a touchdown, as after Jeremy Hill was stopped 3 times at the goal line, the Bengals went for it on 4.h-and-goal, and Andy Dalton snuck it in to take a 10-3 lead in the first quarter.
