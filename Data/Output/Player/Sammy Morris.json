His offensive line dominated and gave him plenty of time throughout. On 1 of his touchdowns, he seriously had 15 seconds in the pocket. Romo's scores went to usual suspects Morris needs to be fired. The Buccaneers flat-out quit on him. Some of the NFL Network analysts believed that was because of the news that broke this week about Morris perhaps being fired, but the team has been mailing it in since losing to the Packers. The players are just taking after their leader. Morris doesn't work nearly as hard as other head coaches. Thus, it's no surprise that the team often quits and gets whistled for stupid penalties.    It doesn't help Tampa that it has no explosion on offense. I mean, "
