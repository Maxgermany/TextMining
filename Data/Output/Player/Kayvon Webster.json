   "comment":"Kayvon Webster. Moreno then scored his third touchdown to sealed the game for Denver.    Manning completed 28-of-42 passes for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacksonville's defense did a nice job of pressuring him with a 4.man rush and playing a deep zone to make Denver dink and dunk the ball down the field.    Despite a dropped touchdown in the 4.h quarter, Justin Blackon was awesome for the Jaguars. The Broncos had no answer for him as he caught 14 passes for 190 yards. Denver has to be worried about its ability to defend elite receivers considering what Blackmon and "

  "comment":"Kayvon Webster repeated Johnson's earlier mistake. Prescott also had Bryant open for a potential reception in the second half, but missed him.    Speaking of Bryant, he caught just 5 of his 13 targets for 98 yards, as Trumaine Johnson did a good job in coverage. Aside from Bryant and Elliott, no Cowboy accumulated more than 34 receiving yards.
