   "comment":"Daniel Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards.Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards. That set the Steelers up at the 17-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Hines Ward. After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9.yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward. Down 28-3, Hasselbeck and the Titans moved into the hurry-up offense. They were aided by a catch to Jared Cook that was actually an incompletion. The Titans capped the drive with Johnson's first touchdown of the season from 1.yard out. After the score, the Titans executed a nice onside kick that was recovered by cornerback Alterraun Verner. The next play saw a pass from Hasselbeck get batted into the air. Linebacker LaMarr Woodley came down with the ball and it was the first interception of the season for the Pittsburgh defense. It led to a field goal and a 31-10 advantage for the Steelers. Sepulveda had a punt blocked midway through the 4.h quarter. It was picked up by Finnegan and returned for a touchdown, but a block in the back penalty took the score away and gave the Titans the ball in Steelers' territory.

Ward had 7 receptions for 54 yards and 2 scores.    Roethlisberger completed 24-of-34 passes for 228 yards with 5 touchdowns and 1 interception.
