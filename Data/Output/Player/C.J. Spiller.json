He rushed for just 6 yards on 7 attempts, and also chipped in with 4 receptions for 8 receiving yards. Spiller took numerous losses, as his offensive line couldn't open up any lanes for him. No surprise there.    I'll have time to bash the Bills even further for the next 16 weeks. As for the Dolphins, they were nearly as anemic on offense, especially in the second half, where they had only 37 yards on their first 4 possessions.    "

   "comment":"C.J. Spiller more touches all week. The first was a killer because it came at the goal line. The second was reviewed and ruled a non-fumble, but it cost Buffalo its final timeout because Jackson was injured on the play (a possible concussion). The lack of touches Spiller received was alarming. He had 11 last week and was given just 2 more at New England. He had 9 carries for 70 rushing yards and 4 catches for 61 receiving yards. He did so much more with the football than Jackson (16-80; 4-35) and didn't even cough it up. You have to wonder what Chan Gailey is thinking with this bizarre strategy.    Outside of the strip-sack, Fitzpatrick had a solid outing. He went 27-of-40 for 337 yards, 2 touchdowns and a late, desperation interception.    "

Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"C.J. Spiller looked terrific today for the Seahawks. He is a perfect fit as the team's third-down back, given his explosiveness and his pass-catching ability. Spiller only ran the ball once for minus-3 yards, but he caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He should continue to operate in this role, and general manager John Schneider looks like a genius for signing the veteran recently.    Seattle's defense looked good today. "
