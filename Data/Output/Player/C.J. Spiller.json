He rushed for just 6 yards on 7 attempts, and also chipped in with 4 receptions for 8 receiving yards. Spiller took numerous losses, as his offensive line couldn't open up any lanes for him. No surprise there.    I'll have time to bash the Bills even further for the next 16 weeks. As for the Dolphins, they were nearly as anemic on offense, especially in the second half, where they had only 37 yards on their first 4 possessions.    "

   "comment":"C.J. Spiller (20-77) didn't have as much luck, and he even was guilty of a bone-headed play at the end of the first half when he ran out of bounds as the Bills were trying to run out the clock. It appeared as though he gave a gift 3 points to the opposition, but the Dolphins were just too inept offensively to take advantage of that blunder.   "

However, Jackson was used more in the passing game. He logged 6 catches for 52 receiving yards, while Spiller secured all 3 targets thrown his way for 24 receiving yards.    Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    "
