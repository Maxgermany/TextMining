   "comment":"Spiller fumble on a kickoff return that gave Baltimore a late touchdown in the first half. Expect a joke or 2 about this in my    Despite Ed Reed being back in the lineup (Reed had 2 interceptions), Baltimore's defense was awful in this contest. The Bills totaled 506 net yards, and Ryan Fitzpatrick went 29-of-43 for 374 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 picks. Buffalo may have won in overtime had the officials properly overturned a fumble because a Bills player's forward progress was stopped.    Steve Johnson (8 catches, 158 yards, TD) and Lee Evans (6 catches, 105 yards, 3 TDs) were both awesome against the Ravens. They have renewed fantasy life with Fitzpatrick under center.    Oh, and I feel obligated to mention this: Fred Jackson had 23 carries (73 yards). Spiller had just 7 (33 yards). Spiller, selected ninth overall, is barely being used. Meanwhile, Aaron Maybin, taken No. 11 overall a year before, was a healthy scratch. Perhaps, the Bills shouldn't even draft anyone to save themselves the embarrassment.    The Ravens ran the ball all over the Bills - "

   "comment":"Spiller, thrust into a featured role now that star Fred Jackson is on injured reserve, immediately became a factor. He had the ball in his hands 7 times on the drive and was bottled up other than a 13-yard reception. His biggest impact was when Brodney Pool grabbed his face mask for a 15-yard penalty early in the possession. Ryan Fitzpatrick hit David Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Dave Rayner flubbed the kickoff, hitting Emanuel Cook who was up on the front line. It looked almost like he was trying to knock the ball off an unsuspecting player and get a surprise onside kick, but up 14-7 with the half close to ending, it would make no sense. The Jets went to Greene who picked up 7 yards on a reception and another 15 was added on a personal foul by rookie Marcell Dareus. All of a sudden, they were at the Bills' 14-yard line as the 2.minute warning sounded. After 2 failed plays, Sanchez found Burress wide open for the tying touchdown pass. Buffalo's answer was 2 incompletions and another Maybin sack. New York tried to steal a field goal attempt, but couldn't get past the midfield stripe until the final play of the half. The Bills went right back to picking on Revis to start the second half with an 8-yard pass to Stevie Johnson (8-75 yards, TD), who had his fingerprints all over this result. Ex-Jets receiver Brad Smith picked up 17 yards on a reception and another 3 on an end around as part of a promising drive, but Spiller's inability to find open space ultimately doomed the march, and an awful punt went through the end zone for a touchback. Breathing room really helped New York, which went to the running game with Greene (13-78) and "

   "comment":"Spiller. The Dolphins answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Moore to Anthony Fasano. Miami cornerback Vontae Davis then set up a field goal via an interception to give his offense the ball at the 24-yard line. It should have gone for more but Brandon Marshall dropped his second touchdown of the game. He is 1 of the league leaders in drops, and his 2 early in the game looked like they would be costly. His concentration and focus are terrible. If Marshall could get his head straight, he would be a much better receiver. Moore blew a scoring chance in the third quarter when he fumbled the ball away deep in Buffalo territory. A bit later, Marshall made up for his drops with a 65-yard touchdown on a go route. The pass was thrown in perfectly by Moore to Marshall, who made a nice over-the-shoulder catch while burning cornerback Drayton Florence. The reception put Marshall over 1,000 yards on the season for the fifth straight year. The afternoon got very sloppy in the third quarter. Dolphin safety Reshad Jones caught a deflected pass for an interception. On the Bills' next drive, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw his third interception to Davis (for his second) when he out-fought Stevie Johnson on a ball lofted downfield. The Bills made it 23-13 after a short touchdown pass to Spiller. Fitzpatrick threw an interception on the 2.point attempt. Late in the third quarter, and then early in the 4.h quarter, Bush was running well and moving the ball for the Dolphins. Miami's offensive line was winning the battle up front and doing a good job of opening up lanes and getting to the second level of the defense. Bush sealed the game with a 76-yard touchdown jaunt. He ran through a big hole and broke a tackle from Jarius Byrd to sprint downfield for the score. Bush had a few other highlight-reel runs in the game including an ankle-breaking spin move to juke a defender. He finished with 203 yards on 25 carries with a touchdown. Fitzpatrick attempted a comeback with a short touchdown toss to "

The Bills' offensive line did a fantastic job of blowing open big holes for him, and he did the rest with his superior quickness. Still this made me wonder what the hell happened to all of Kansas City's defensive talent.    Ryan Fitzpatrick had a nice rebound game, going 10-of-19 for 178 yards and 2 touchdowns. His receivers did most of the work, but at least he didn't float soft passes toward the sideline like he did last week.    Fitzpatrick's scores went to Steve Johnson (2 catches, 56 yards) and Scott Chandler (2-53). Spiller was the only Buffalo player with more than 2 receptions.    The most disappointing player in this game was "

Spiller had already tallied 58 total yards and a touchdown, so his fantasy owners have to be frustrated that they didn't enjoy what looked like a potentially monstrous day. As you can imagine, Buffalo's offense sputtered afterward. The team scored just 10 points and lost a fumble in the final 3 quarters without Spiller. "

The second was reviewed and ruled a non-fumble, but it cost Buffalo its final timeout because Jackson was injured on the play (a possible concussion). The lack of touches Spiller received was alarming. He had 11 last week and was given just 2 more at New England. He had 9 carries for 70 rushing yards and 4 catches for 61 receiving yards. He did so much more with the football than Jackson (16-80; 4-35) and didn't even cough it up. You have to wonder what Chan Gailey is thinking with this bizarre strategy.    Outside of the strip-sack, Fitzpatrick had a solid outing. He went 27-of-40 for 337 yards, 2 touchdowns and a late, desperation interception.    "

He was so much better than Fred Jackson; it wasn't even close. Jackson mustered only 14 yards on 9 attempts, which included a lost fumble deep in St. Louis territory. Jackson ultimately suffered a knee injury that reportedly doesn't look good. I don't understand what the hell Gailey was thinking; his refusal to involve Spiller in this offense has cost his team multiple victories. It's bad enough to do it once or twice, but this has occurred at least half-a-dozen times already this season. He has to be axed because he clearly can't learn from his mistakes.    Despite holding a lead throughout, the Bills attempted 33 passes to just 16 runs. That's smart. "

However, Jackson was used more in the passing game. He logged 6 catches for 52 receiving yards, while Spiller secured all 3 targets thrown his way for 24 receiving yards.    Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards. Bill Belichick adjusted by rolling Tom Brady out to negate pressure, and the Bills simply had no answer for it. Brady caught fire as a consequence, misfiring just twice after halftime. He finished 27-of-37 for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady had some brilliant moments. His second touchdown was a great heave into triple coverage to someone named Brian Tyms. Brady then marched down the field, up just 8 points, beginning from his own 7-yard line. He moved the chains and ultimately threw a score, thanks to a third-and-16 conversion to Rob Gronkowski. If the Bills had a legitimate stop unit, they wouldn't have allowed that; instead, they had Preston Brown trying to cover the monstrous tight end. That's just not going to work.    I mentioned that Brady threw touchdowns to Wright (1-1) and Tyms (1-43). Brady's other scores went to Brandon LaFell (4-97). Gronkowski (7-94) and Edelman (9-91) didn't find the end zone, but they both made big contributions. The former appeared to hurt his shoulder in the second half, but he didn't miss much action.    Before moving on to the Buffalo stats, I should mention that this was a Pyrrhic victory for the Patriots. They lost Stevan Ridley, Dan Connolly and Jerod Mayo in this contest, yet they were still able to prevail. Ridley struggled to find running room (10-23) before leaving with what might be a torn ACL.    Orton had a relatively decent outing, going 24-of-38 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. However, the turnovers were costly, and Orton was guilty of holding on to the ball too long. Orton's scores were fired to Robert Woods (7-78) and Chris Hogan (5-72). Scott Chandler led the team with 105 receiving yards on 6 grabs. Sammy Watkins (2-27) barely did anything because he had to deal with Darrelle Revis. Watkins was also flagged for offensive pass interference on 1 play, which I'll discuss in a bit.    Spiller, as mentioned, cost his team with a horrible fumble, and he saw just 2 touches after that. He finished with a mere 19 yards on 6 carries, while "

The severity of Lee's concussion will also be key. Of course, Tony Romo's future health will determine how far the Cowboys ultimately advance. The good news is that the rest of the NFC East is 2-2 or worse.    The Saints, meanwhile, have issues of their own. Drew Brees clearly isn't 100 percent. He misfired on just 8 passes, going 33-of-41 for 359 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he doesn't have the same type of arm strength in the wake of his shoulder injury. Brees was fortunate to be battling a Dallas skeleton-crew defense that actually dropped a couple of potential interceptions. The Saints also had to rely on several illegal pick plays that weren't whistled by an incompetent officiating crew that blew calls for both teams in this contest.    Spiller ended up as New Orleans' top receiver, but prior to the game-winning score - the 400th touchdown in Brees' career, by the way - he had just 4 catches for 19 yards. He was barely a factor, so keep this in mind if you have wild ideas about plugging him into your lineup. Keep sticking with "
