  "comment":"Lorenzo Alexander whiff. Despite the long run, Forte outgained Powell, 77-74, doing so on 5 more carries (14-9). Eli McGuire was also mixed in for some reason, though he was far less effective (13-30). Forte also caught 4 passes, but didn't do much with them, generating 19 receiving yards.    "
