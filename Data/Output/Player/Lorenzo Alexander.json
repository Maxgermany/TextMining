Alexander continues to have a Pro Bowl-caliber season.    For the Browns, this was yet another embarrassment. They dropped to a lowly 0-14 on the season, and they seem to have no chance of winning. They are not helping themselves out by continuing to start "

Eli McGuire was also mixed in for some reason, though he was far less effective (13-30). Forte also caught 4 passes, but didn't do much with them, generating 19 receiving yards.    "
