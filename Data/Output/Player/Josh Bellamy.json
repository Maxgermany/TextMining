The Bears were able to get wide open against Tennessee's poor secondary, but couldn't prevent themselves from dropping lots of passes. Of course, this is what happens to a team missing 3 of its top weapons.    At any rate, Mariota finished 15-of-23 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well overall, especially in the first half, but he barely threw the ball following the break; he was just 5-of-9 for 87 yards after intermission. The Titans didn't need to throw much at first, and this appeared to ruin Mariota's rhythm. This was apparent when he overthrew a wide-open "
