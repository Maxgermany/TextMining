Many people on Twitter compared Kaepernick's performance to that of QB Dog Killer in <i>Madden 2004</i>. It was just that dominant, and quite frankly, it wasn't fair for the Packers. They just stood no chance.    Aaron Rodgers was able to match the 49ers point for point for slightly more than 1 half of action, but he couldn't keep up the pace. His team was just exhausted beginning in the middle of the third quarter because the game was too late. I discussed this on my NFL Picks page - San Francisco had a tremendous advantage in this contest because of the 8 p.m. start time. Circadian rhythms set in, and many Packer bodies shut down just after halftime. I don't think Green Bay would have won either way, but it turned into a blowout because of the NFL's irresponsible scheduling. This should have been a much tighter battle. At any rate, Rodgers finished 26-of-39 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that was pretty much like a punt on third-and-long. Rodgers didn't misfire on many attempts, but his big incompletion was a slight overthrow of "

   "comment":"Matthews put immense pressure on him. Wilson couldn't even scramble; he generated just 2 rushing yards in the opening half. Following intermission, Wilson was 12-of-20 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception that wasn't his fault, as the ball deflected off Kearse's hands. Wilson also finished with 25 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The transformation was amazing; Wilson looked like Jake Delhomme in the first half, but was his usual clutch self when the game was on the line. A tearful Wilson was overcome with emotion during his post-game interview with Erin Andrews, who had to be relieved that she wasn't getting yelled at like she was at this time last year. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    Kearse was 1 of the heroes because he caught the touchdown, but he was having a miserable afternoon prior to that reception, which was his first of the contest. Kearse, who was responsible for a pick, dropped several other passes. "

It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners. A mega congrats to the few who used Thielen. The slot receiver had a huge game, catching 12 passes for a whopping 202 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've scored thrice, but Bradford missed him in the end zone. Thielen's output is a clear indicator of how horrible Green Bay's secondary is. Elsewhere in the Minnesota receiving corps, Stefon Diggs caught 4 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown. Kyle Rudolph, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 53 yards.    With Adrian Peterson out, "
