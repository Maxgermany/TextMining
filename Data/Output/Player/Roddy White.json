   "comment":"White (11 catches, 84 yards, TD). But for whatever reason, Ryan struggled coming out of the locker room; his combined stats in the first and third quarters were 4-of-11, 28 yards and a pair of interceptions.    But this game was more about Arizona proving itself to the rest of the league. After all, the franchise hadn't hosted a playoff game since 1947! Though the Cardinals were at home, they were underdogs until Saturday morning. That's because of how poorly they finished the year. Well, the way they played, you wouldn't have known that they tanked against the Vikings and Patriots. Arizona was actually running the ball well and playing solid defense, prompting Cris Collinsworth to suggest that the Cardinals and Falcons switched jerseys before kickoff. Though Ryan would eventually throw for 200 yards and 2 scores, Arizona was able to restrict "

   "comment":"White, meanwhile ran for no gain and was incomplete on 1 attempt, missing an open Ted Ginn downfield.    As for Miami's regular offense, the 7 points it put up pretty much speaks for itself. The score could have been a lot closer, but Anthony Fasano fumbled the ball away at the Atlanta 10. In total, the Dolphins had 4 turnovers after coming up with a plus-17 turnover differential last year - a sign that things won't be the same in 2009.    Chad Pennington was 21-of-29, but threw for just 176 yards, which gives him a pretty weak YPA of 6.1. Pennington also had a touchdown and an interception.    Perhaps Miami's greatest mistake was not getting Ronnie Brown involved enough. Despite the fact that Brown averaged 4.3 yards per carry against Atlanta's pedestrian run defense, Brown was given only 10 carries. He also had just 3 receptions for 10 more yards. I understand being scared of Brown wearing down late in the year, but with games coming up against Indianapolis and San Diego, this was 1 the Dolphins had to have.    Another concern the Dolphins suddenly have is pass protection; the Falcons, not known for being able to get after the quarterback consistently, managed 4 sacks on Pennington. John Abraham and Kroy Biermann had 2 each, exposing Jake Long and Vernon Carey.    Matt Ryan was as good as advertised, going 22-of-36 for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns. Ryan found Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White 5 times each. Gonzalez had 73 yards and a score, while White had 42 yards.    A disappointing outing for "

   "comment":"White on a 5-yard touchdown on 4th-and-5 with 26 seconds remaining in regulation. Redman was solid on Atlanta's last possession, and his numbers look good on the stat sheet (23-of-41, 243 yards, 2 TDs). However, Redman took far too many sacks (6), which stalled a lot of drives and allowed the Buccaneers to hang around. Redman played relatively well, but there's no way the Falcons will be able to beat the Eagles or Saints without Ryan under center.    Ryan's toe wasn't the only major injury for Atlanta. Michael Turner, who rushed for only 33 yards on 12 carries, re-aggravated the high ankle sprain he suffered 2 weeks ago in the third quarter. One has to wonder why Turner was even playing in this contest because he clearly wasn't 100 percent. With a deficit, the Falcons couldn't establish Jason Snelling (4 carries, 8 yards).    White, who had the decisive score, had 5 catches for 57 yards. "

Ryan later had White for a potential touchdown, but his No. 1 wideout dropped the ball. Atlanta had to settle for a field goal and never got the ball back because Tampa Bay was able to run out the clock.

   "comment":"White after a great play fake to Turner. Stalling in the red zone led to another field goal and a 6-3 lead. An exchange of punts left New Orleans in business at midfield. They took advantage hitting Graham for 29 yards, missing Sproles on a screen pass and then going back to Graham for the 21-yard score. I joked on Twitter that Graham's plan was to drop passes on third down to set up the defense. It sure looked that way considering how open he was. Another exchange of punts left the Falcons stuck at their own 1-yard line. At first, the Saints were trying to get the ball back, calling timeout after a quick screen was completed to Jones, who would not play down the stretch after his hamstring flared up. However, Turner rumbled 10 yards around the edge to flip the script and put them on the offensive. After a penalty, slot receiver Harry Douglas ripped up the middle of the field for 46 yards. The big play helped put them in position for a field goal attempt at the gun, but Matt Bryant missed it to leave New Orleans up 10-6 at the half. The Saints felt a similar sting when their first drive of the second half ended in a failed field goal. Robert Meachem turned in a 36-yard reception to get them down the field, but Pierre Thomas was locked up in the backfield and Darren Sproles got nothing on a screen to stop the march. This rivalry has been marked by tight games, and this was no exception. The Falcons started working the ball to Douglas who would have more success later in the half, but nevertheless kept the chains moving. They didn't have to worry about blowing it in the red zone because a dump pass to Jason Snelling turned into a 21-yard touchdown when he refused to be tackled, putting Atlanta ahead 13-10. New Orleans immediately answered, and they were, as usual, very aggressive on offense. Drew Brees found Marques Colston for gains of 15 and 19 then capped the drive with a deep ball to Meachem for a touchdown. The final play of the third quarter turned out to be crucial. Matt Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the fourth quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for "

   "comment":"White, allowing the Falcons to move the chains, eat up more time on the clock and kick the covering 32-yard field goal, prompting Al Michaels to give us his obligatory gambling reference.    Of course, the Falcons weren't flawless either. Matt Bryant whiffed on 2 attempts from 37 and 43 yards. Asante Samuel, meanwhile, dropped a gift Tony Romo interception in the end zone during the first half. Romo was decent overall, going 25-of-35 for 321 yards and a touchdown to Kevin Ogletree (3-96).    Dez Bryant was questionable entering this contest. He played, but did nothing (1-15), hurting his fantasy owners. Three Cowboys caught at least 5 passes: Austin-Jones (7-76), Felix Jones (5-70) and Jason Witten (7-51). Witten now has more receptions than any Dallas player in franchise history, passing Michael Irvin tonight.    With DeMarco Murray out again, Jones (9-39) and Lance Dunbar (8-26) split carries. Jones did well on some of his touches, but it's clear that Murray is missed.    Matt Ryan went 24-of-34 for 342 yards. He was clutch all evening on third downs, going 7-of-14 in those instances.    Julio Jones (5-129) and Roddy White (7-118) performed well despite battling a tough secondary. Jones also looked good on an 8-yard carry in the second half.    "

Jones (4-75) eventually reentered the contest, but it was too late by then, as the Saints had established a 28-17 lead. It's worth noting that White screwed up on 1 play in the fourth quarter. Ryan threw a nice deep ball in his direction, but White underplayed it by stopping his route. Had he kept running, it may have been a touchdown.    "

   "comment":"White and 2 others were tipped. Ryan threw 2 legitimate interceptions - and they were both bad, but he did a good job of leading the Falcons on enough scoring drives - most of which culminated with a field goal - to barely eke out the team's ninth win of the season. Ryan finished 28-of-46 for 301 yards and the quintet of interceptions. He was pressured often - 1 of his other picks came as he was getting hit - and didn't really have his No. 1 receiver, as Julio Jones was laboring through an injury. Ryan had to resort to throwing to Roddy White (8-123), Harry Douglas (5-48) and Tony Gonzalez (3-33)."

   "comment":"White's nagging injury has been well-documented. He played, but once again barely did anything more than be a decoy (3 catches, 21 yards). He saw just 3 targets, as he stood on the sidelines most of the afternoon. Steven Jackson suffered a thigh injury in the first quarter. The Falcons listed him as questionable to return, but he never took the field again. All he was able to do was catch an 8-yard touchdown and carry the ball 3 times for no yards. Despite missing 2 key weapons, Matt Ryan was still unstoppable. He misfired on just 10 attempts, going 33-of-43 for 373 yards and 2 touchdowns despite having tons of pressure in his face. Ryan heavily favored Julio Jones, who hauled in 11 passes for 182 yards, including an 81-yarder in the first quarter, beating Janoris Jenkins, to give Atlanta a 14-0 lead. The Falcons, who were up 24-3 at the half, nearly blew this contest because they had trouble running the ball and consequently couldn't bleed the clock out. Jacquizz Rodgers proved to be a poor substitute for Jackson, managing just 17 yards on 11 attempts. Once the Rams drew to within 7 in the fourth quarter, Ryan had to start throwing again - and the Rams had no answer for him.    Other Atlanta stats: Tony Gonzalez (4-33) had a poor performance considering that Ryan didn't have much else to work with. Harry Douglas also disappointed (4-43), as many considered him to be a sneaky fantasy option with White suffering through his malady.    Atlanta's defense also saw a key player go down; "

   "comment":"White to halt an Atlanta comeback from down 30-13 and seal the victory for New England. Brady's scores went to Thompkins and Matthew Mulligan. Thompkins had a huge outing, catching 6 balls for 127 yards, which included a great grab over stud safety William Moore. He wasn't perfect - he dropped a couple of passes - but it's extremely obvious that he has made big strides. The sky is the limit for him, as well as the Patriots, who will have Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski back in the next couple of weeks.    New England's other receivers of note include Julian Edelman (7-118), who did all of his damage in the second half, and Aaron Dobson (1-10) who left the game in the middle of the third quarter with an injury.    The Patriots ran the ball well against Atlanta's skeleton-crew defense that was missing Asante Samuel, as well as linebackers Akeem Dent and Paul Worrilow (both of whom left the game in the second half). Stevan Ridley gained 53 yards on 11 carries, while LeGarrette Blount (9-64) broke free for a 47-yard score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, can blame this loss on themselves. They made numerous errors in this contest, including: - Left tackle Sam Baker ruined a drive in the first half with 2 penalties (holding, face mask). He would leave the game with an injury a little bit later. - The Falcons went for it on a fourth-and-2 inside the red zone in the middle of the second quarter. A field goal would've made a huge difference later on, though it's always difficult to know what would've happened. - Julio Jones dropped a big gain. He missed some time with a leg injury, but managed to finish with solid stats (6 catches, 108 yards). - Dent was whistled for a penalty that gave New England a first down on what would've otherwise been a punt attempt. The Patriots would go on to score a touchdown on that drive. - Atlanta surrendered a third-and-19. The team couldn't get any sort of pressure on Brady, who found Thompkins for a 26-yard completion. On top of that, the Patriots got 15 yards for a Moore hit to the helmet. - Roddy White was whistled for offensive pass interference on Talib in the red zone. - Talib came up with an interception when "

Glennon finished 20-of-23 for 231 yards with 2 scores. He played well around a great running game and had all day to throw downfield.

   "comment":"White, who was starting in place of the injured Jabari Greer. Though he had a great game, he had 2 interceptions dropped and took some heat for sliding down 4 yards short of the end zone on third-and-goal. The crowd booed him, as it thought he had a chance to score. Ryan probably wouldn't have found the end zone, but a greater effort could've set up a fourth-and-goal situation inside the 2-yard line, so that negated a possible touchdown. Ryan was also betrayed by his offensive line (5 sacks allowed) as well as 1 of his young receivers. He constantly threw to SMU rookie Darius Johnson, who caught 6 balls for 67 yards. Johnson had a brilliant first half, but dropped a big third-down pass in the third quarter that would've moved the chains and then lost a fumble inside the red zone during the early stages of the final period.    Ryan's usual suspects didn't do much. In fact, Tony Gonzalez didn't catch his first pass until around the 2-minute warning at the end of the opening half. Gonzalez finished with 4 grabs for 43 yards, while Roddy White was an even greater disappointment (2-24). "

He heaved a pick-6 toward Rashean Mathis, but the play was negated by defensive pass interference. Ryan, however, struggled following intermission. He was just 6-of-10 for 68 yards and an interception in the second half. The pick was terrible, as it sailed right to a Detroit defensive back with no Atlanta player in the area. Ryan finished 20-of-27 for 228 yards, 2 touchdowns and that interception. He saw much more pressure following the break. He also fumbled twice, but his linemen recovered both loose balls.    Roddy White also recovered a fumble, making fortunate Atlanta 3-of-3 on loose balls. White led the team with 5 grabs for 66 yards. Julio Jones (4-58) had a disappointing outing. His drop at the end of the game was an absolute killer.    The Lions strangely struggled against the run. "

   "comment":"White on a third down. He was pick-sixed in the second quarter and then took a devastating hit that drew a penalty, though I didn't think it should've been flagged. Ryan was down for about 15 seconds, but didn't miss a snap. Ryan ultimately finished 26-of-37 for 310 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick-6. He did a good job of moving the chains without Jones, but some missed opportunities in the red zone, as well as a 3-and-out on his final offensive possession, allowed Pittsburgh to prevail.    With Jones out, Harry Douglas and Devin Hester stepped up. They were the 2 leading receivers, with Douglas snagging 10 balls for 131 yards, while Hester posted a 5-85-1 line. Hester nearly had a second score, but a poor Ryan throw plus a Douglas offensive pass interference negated it. Roddy White (7-58) also found the end zone.    "

   "comment":"White: Despite Leonard Hankerson being out, White caught just 1 pass for 20 yards. He's not even close to any sort of fantasy radar.    Before I move on to the Falcons, I need to mention Dan Quinn and his horrible mistake late in the game. The Falcons, down 17-13, had a fourth-and-goal on the San Francisco 2-yard line. Quinn opted for a field goal with 3 minutes remaining. The Falcons drew to within 1, but after kicking the ball away, they never obtained possession again. I thought this was horrible. Ryan and Jones are the strength of the team. Why not rely on them rather than a defense that had been shaky at best throughout the afternoon? Even if Atlanta wouldn't have converted, the 49ers would've been stranded deep inside their own territory.    San Francisco was able to keep possession with a Blaine Gabbert designed scramble on a third down. Gabbert played well throughout, going 15-of-25 for 185 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions to go along with 9 scampers for 32 rushing yards. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as "
