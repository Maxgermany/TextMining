Ryan, who looks like a seasoned veteran, was 22-of-30 for 301 yards and a touchdown versus Chicago's defense, though it should be noted that Nathan Vasher was out and Charles Tillman left the game with an injury. Still, Ryan was able to perform well despite the fact that Michael Turner was limited to 54 yards on 25 carries. More importantly, Ryan has the Falcons at 4-2. The same Falcons who were picked by many to finish at the bottom of the NFC South.    We all know about Roddy White, who was once again a force, catching 9 balls for 112 yards and a touchdown. But rookie Harry Douglas is beginning to emerge as a solid secondary option for Ryan. Douglas compiled 5 receptions and 96 yards.    Though the Bears couldn't score against the Falcons, "

   "comment":"Roddy White touchdown. Atlanta just ripped through Dallas' defense and it looked like the team would dominate this game. Oddly enough, the Falcons mustered just 208 yards the rest of the contest. Michael Turner struggled to find any running room, gaining just 50 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Even more troubling, Atlanta's offensive line struggled to pass protect. Coming into this contest, the front 5 surrendered only 2 sacks all year. On Sunday, the Falcons surrendered 4 sacks; 2 to DeMarcus Ware.    With lots of pressure in his face, Matt Ryan put together a pretty mediocre performance, going just 19-of-35 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 picks and 2 fumbles.    Ryan went to Roddy White 6 times. White managed 50 yards and a touchdown. "

However, Redman took far too many sacks (6), which stalled a lot of drives and allowed the Buccaneers to hang around. Redman played relatively well, but there's no way the Falcons will be able to beat the Eagles or Saints without Ryan under center.    Ryan's toe wasn't the only major injury for Atlanta. "

Another exchange of punts left the Falcons stuck at their own 1-yard line. At first, the Saints were trying to get the ball back, calling timeout after a quick screen was completed to Jones, who would not play down the stretch after his hamstring flared up. However, Turner rumbled 10 yards around the edge to flip the script and put them on the offensive. After a penalty, slot receiver "

   "comment":"Roddy White by at least 5 yards on the first play from scrimmage. He did the same thing to Julio Jones 2 snaps later. Ryan also had a strip-sack nullified by a holding penalty.    Tony Gonzalez paced the Falcons in both receptions and receiving yards (7-100), while Roddy White (4-51) scored Ryan's touchdown. Julio Jones, however, was a major disappointment. His numbers weren't bad (4-68), but he dropped a game-tying touchdown as time expired.    Give the Texans major credit for shutting down "

   "comment":"Roddy White, allowing the Falcons to move the chains, eat up more time on the clock and kick the covering 32-yard field goal, prompting Al Michaels to give us his obligatory gambling reference.    Of course, the Falcons weren't flawless either. Matt Bryant whiffed on 2 attempts from 37 and 43 yards. Asante Samuel, meanwhile, dropped a gift Tony Romo interception in the end zone during the first half. Romo was decent overall, going 25-of-35 for 321 yards and a touchdown to Kevin Ogletree (3-96).    Dez Bryant was questionable entering this contest. He played, but did nothing (1-15), hurting his fantasy owners. Three Cowboys caught at least 5 passes: Austin-Jones (7-76), Felix Jones (5-70) and Jason Witten (7-51). Witten now has more receptions than any Dallas player in franchise history, passing Michael Irvin tonight.    With DeMarco Murray out again, Jones (9-39) and Lance Dunbar (8-26) split carries. Jones did well on some of his touches, but it's clear that Murray is missed.    Matt Ryan went 24-of-34 for 342 yards. He was clutch all evening on third downs, going 7-of-14 in those instances.    Julio Jones (5-129) and Roddy White (7-118) performed well despite battling a tough secondary. Jones also looked good on an 8-yard carry in the second half.    "

   "comment":"Roddy White and 2 others were tipped. Ryan threw 2 legitimate interceptions - and they were both bad, but he did a good job of leading the Falcons on enough scoring drives - most of which culminated with a field goal - to barely eke out the team's ninth win of the season. Ryan finished 28-of-46 for 301 yards and the quintet of interceptions. He was pressured often - 1 of his other picks came as he was getting hit - and didn't really have his No. 1 receiver, as Julio Jones was laboring through an injury. Ryan had to resort to throwing to Roddy White (8-123), Harry Douglas (5-48) and Tony Gonzalez (3-33)."

   "comment":"Roddy White to halt an Atlanta comeback from down 30-13 and seal the victory for New England. Brady's scores went to Thompkins and Matthew Mulligan. Thompkins had a huge outing, catching 6 balls for 127 yards, which included a great grab over stud safety William Moore. He wasn't perfect - he dropped a couple of passes - but it's extremely obvious that he has made big strides. The sky is the limit for him, as well as the Patriots, who will have Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski back in the next couple of weeks.    New England's other receivers of note include Julian Edelman (7-118), who did all of his damage in the second half, and Aaron Dobson (1-10) who left the game in the middle of the third quarter with an injury.    The Patriots ran the ball well against Atlanta's skeleton-crew defense that was missing Asante Samuel, as well as linebackers Akeem Dent and Paul Worrilow (both of whom left the game in the second half). Stevan Ridley gained 53 yards on 11 carries, while LeGarrette Blount (9-64) broke free for a 47-yard score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, can blame this loss on themselves. They made numerous errors in this contest, including: - Left tackle Sam Baker ruined a drive in the first half with 2 penalties (holding, face mask). He would leave the game with an injury a little bit later. - The Falcons went for it on a 4.h-and-2 inside the red zone in the middle of the second quarter. A field goal would've made a huge difference later on, though it's always difficult to know what would've happened. - Julio Jones dropped a big gain. He missed some time with a leg injury, but managed to finish with solid stats (6 catches, 108 yards). - Dent was whistled for a penalty that gave New England a first down on what would've otherwise been a punt attempt. The Patriots would go on to score a touchdown on that drive. - Atlanta surrendered a third-and-19. The team couldn't get any sort of pressure on Brady, who found Thompkins for a 26-yard completion. On top of that, the Patriots got 15 yards for a Moore hit to the helmet. - Roddy White was whistled for offensive pass interference on Talib in the red zone. - Talib came up with an interception when "

   "comment":"Roddy White on a tough third-and-8 on the opening drive. This ultimately led to a passing score to Devonta Freeman. By halftime, he was 14-of-17 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns. He heaved a pick-six toward Rashean Mathis, but the play was negated by defensive pass interference. Ryan, however, struggled following intermission. He was just 6-of-10 for 68 yards and an interception in the second half. The pick was terrible, as it sailed right to a Detroit defensive back with no Atlanta player in the area. Ryan finished 20-of-27 for 228 yards, 2 touchdowns and that interception. He saw much more pressure following the break. He also fumbled twice, but his linemen recovered both loose balls.    Roddy White also recovered a fumble, making fortunate Atlanta 3-of-3 on loose balls. White led the team with 5 grabs for 66 yards. Julio Jones (4-58) had a disappointing outing. His drop at the end of the game was an absolute killer.    The Lions strangely struggled against the run. "

Before I move on to the Falcons, I need to mention Dan Quinn and his horrible mistake late in the game. The Falcons, down 17-13, had a 4.h-and-goal on the San Francisco 2-yard line. Quinn opted for a field goal with 3 minutes remaining. The Falcons drew to within 1. but after kicking the ball away, they never obtained possession again. I thought this was horrible. Ryan and Jones are the strength of the team. Why not rely on them rather than a defense that had been shaky at best throughout the afternoon? Even if Atlanta wouldn't have converted, the 49ers would've been stranded deep inside their own territory.    San Francisco was able to keep possession with a Blaine Gabbert designed scramble on a third down. Gabbert played well throughout, going 15-of-25 for 185 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions to go along with 9 scampers for 32 rushing yards. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as "
