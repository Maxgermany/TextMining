   "comment":"Devin Smith wide open for a touchdown in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick simply missed him.    With Decker out, it's not a surprise that Brandon Marshall dominated the targets. Fourteen balls went his way, and he caught 10 of them for 109 yards and a touchdown. Marshall, however, had 1 of the dumbest plays of the year, when he foolishly tried to lateral to no 1 in particular while being tackled. Marshall was charged with a fumble as a consequence. Toward the end of the game, he dropped a pass that was tipped and intercepted. Marshall's stat line was great, and he'll continue to produce, but he cost his team a potential victory with those 2 errors.    Other notables in the New York passing game: Jeremy Kerley scored a touchdown, but he's just a mediocre slot receiver not worth owning. He caught 6 passes for only 33 yards. Meanwhile, second-round rookie Devin Smith made 3 grabs for 39 yards. He simply couldn't connect with Fitzpatrick; as mentioned earlier, the bearded quarterback missed him for a score. He might be a fantasy option next year, but not anytime soon.    Ivory's carries went to "
