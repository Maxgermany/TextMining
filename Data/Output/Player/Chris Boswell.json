   "comment":"Chris Boswell, but this week, he sure was. The Bengals stopped the Steelers over and over, but not quickly enough, as Boswell tied a Steelers record with 6 field goals from 45, 49, 49, 40, 49 and 30 yards in a fairly windy stadium. The Steelers in the past would often eschew field goals to try to score touchdowns, but Boswell was on and the Steelers weren't getting into 4.h-and-short situations. By halftime, the Steelers had cut the Bengals' lead by just 3 points as they trailed 20-9, but the conservative approach kept the Steelers in the game.    After halftime, the Bengals' offense tanked and was unable to score another point, while the Steelers continued to move the ball just enough to get into field goal range and let Boswell finish drives. On Boswell's last field goal of the day, the Steelers pulled within 2. Then, on their next drive, the Steelers finally got into the end zone on a 24-yard bullet from Boswell, but this week, he sure was.
