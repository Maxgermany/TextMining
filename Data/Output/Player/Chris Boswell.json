   "comment":"Chris Boswell field goal.    That reception put Brown at 17 catches for the day, which he managed to take for a Steelers-record 284 yards and the 7.h-most receiving yards in a game, while somehow not finding the end zone. But I don't think Brown backers are going to get to picky there. Besides the 284 yards, he also ran the ball twice for 22 yards, putting him at 306 total yards on the day. That's a month's worth of work for most receivers in the league.    Before Roethlisberger left midway through the 4.h quarter with his foot injury, he was already up to 334 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Of course, the majority of his 44 passes had gone to Brown, who had 23 targets, while "

  "comment":"Chris Boswell's extra point was blocked and returned just yards from the end zone and 2 points for the Colts. This was a close game, and the hustle by the Steelers to get him down was a huge play. The Colts managed to hold the Steelers scoreless on the next 2 possessions, as they held to a 17-9 lead in the 4.h quarter, but Jacoby Brissett's inconsistencies hurt him, as he tossed an interception deep in Indianapolis territory, which wasn't totally on him, but it was a ball he probably shouldn't have thrown.
