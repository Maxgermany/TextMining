   "comment":"Siemian. The score is misleading, as Denver's defense scored 2 touchdowns, both of which came in the 4.h quarter. The first was an Aqib Talib pick-six, as Talib read Andrew Luck's eyes perfectly. The second occurred at the end, as Von Miller strip-sacked Luck. Shane Ray picked up the ball and ran in for 6. It was actually a dumb play on Ray's part, as falling on the ball would've completely ended the game - the Colts were out of timeouts - but I can't completely blame Ray because it was the heat of the moment, and a defensive score will help his case when he's pining for a big contract when he hits free agency. While Denver's defense nearly matched its offense's production, that doesn't mean that Siemian played poorly either. Siemian had a solid showing, going 22-of-33 for 266 yards. However, he did throw a careless interception that should've been returned for 6. but cornerback "

   "comment":"Siemian and first-round rookie Paxton Lynch. Perhaps Lynch had potential, but the other 2 were considered horrible replacements. Everyone has seen enough of Sanchez, while Siemian was unknown to many. As it turns out, Siemian, thus far, has proven to be a big upgrade over Manning. It sounds crazy to say it, and I actually can't believe I'm typing it, but Manning was horrible last year, and Siemian, at least in this contest, was far more than just some game manager. Siemian didn't begin the afternoon all that well. The Broncos actually threw the ball on their first 3 plays. One pass was off the mark, while the other was swatted away. Siemian also had some poor throws in the red zone a bit later, which forced Denver into a field goal. However, Siemian improved as the afternoon progressed, and he was unstoppable in the second half. I'm not exaggerating. Siemian went 10-of-11 for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns after intermission. He sliced through Cincinnati's secondary, constantly connecting on deep throws to "

   "comment":"Siemian hit Demaryius Thomas for a big gain, but the star receiver lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and following a late scare that involved an onside kick recovery, they finally sealed their first victory since they beat the Jaguars in Week 2.    Philip Rivers set the tone for this victory by torching the Broncos on the initial 2 drives. Rivers was absolutely on fire, slinging precise throws on nearly attempt. In fact, his second possession went for 10 minutes, which was the longest drive of the season for any team. He began 14-of-18 for 148 yards and a touchdown. However, Denver's defense clamped down on the Chargers after that. Rivers was just 4-of-11 for 30 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 18-of-29 for 178 yards and a score. His overall numbers would've been better had Antonio Gates not dropped 2 passes, 1 of which would've moved the chains on a third down. Rivers played a great game despite the injuries he's been dealing with up front; Joe Barksdale was the latest blocker to get hurt, though he did return to action eventually. Rivers passed Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time passing leader in terms of yards.    Gates caught only 2 passes for 16 yards, and he played second fiddle to Hunter Henry. The rookie tight end was terrific, catching 6 balls for 83 yards and a touchdown. He was dominant, and the struggling Denver linebackers didn't have any sort of answer for him.    Excluding Henry and Gates, only 3 Chargers caught multiple passes: Tyrell Williams (3-28), Travis Benjamin (3-17) and Dexter McCluster (2-15). Benjamin muffed a punt in the opening half, setting up a Denver field goal. However, he made up for it by drawing a pass-interference flag on Aqib Talib.    Melvin Gordon struggled to find running room for the most part, but finally broke free for a 48-yard gain in the third quarter. Gordon dashed for 94 yards on 27 carries.    Before moving on to the Broncos, I have to say that this was definitely a feel-good moment for Mike McCoy, who was set to be fired if the Chargers lost this game. A teary-eye McCoy addressed the media, which called for his firing during the week, and he told them that he met with his daughter right after the game.    Denver struggled to move the chains until garbage time at the end that nearly turned into an improbable comeback. The Broncos were limited to 60 net yards of offense in the opening half. Part of this was because the Chargers controlled the clock, holding the ball for 20:27 of 30 first-half minutes. The other part was that the entire offense was both ineffective and mistake-prone. Trevor Siemian struggled. His final numbers don't look horrible - 30-of-50, 230 yards, 1 touchdown - but at the end of the third quarter, he was just 10-of-19 for only 58 yards. He didn't have any significant yardage, as most came with the Broncos down 2 or 3 scores and the Chargers turning into a prevent defense that nearly lost them the game. It's unknown why they changed their strategy, but it nearly clost them. Siemian had chances to score points in meaningful action, but missed throws. He had "

   "comment":"Siemian had an interception that was dropped in his own territory. It seemed as though San Diego could've literally sat on the lead, but the team began imploding. It started when Philip Rivers threw a pick-six that was a slightly high pass that was tipped by Tyrell Williams. The Chargers had another chance to score off their defense, but Casey Hayward dropped a potential interception returned for a touchdown of his own. San Diego had more bad luck following intermission, as another Rivers pass was tipped - this time by Travis Benjamin - and that set up a Devontae Booker touchdown. This gave the Broncos a double-digit lead. At that point, it appeared as though Denver would run away with it, but Siemian was finally picked, as he had a tipped pass of his own returned for 6. The Chargers were back in the game, and 1 drive later, they drove down to the 2-yard line, down just 8. With 4 downs, all they had to do was punch it in to give themselves a chance to tie, but they couldn't do it. All of the controversy will be regarding their play calls. "

He could only really complete passes in the intermediate game and showed no ability to throw anything downfield. His arm strength is relatively weak, and for this reason alone, I would not be surprised to see Paxton Lynch on the field for the Broncos at some point this season. Siemian also looked a bit out of it mentally. His offensive line was terrible on Sunday, as they allowed a whopping 6 sacks to the New Orleans front, so that may have shaken his confidence a bit. Still, on his interceptions, he failed to see players moving across the field, and in general, he had issues making decisions. A good quarterback would release the ball quicker if he ends up being under pressure. Siemian simply looks like a low-end starter or high-quality backup at this point in the season. He will limit the team's potential moving forward.    During the contest, Siemian primarily relied on "

The tackles couldn't block whatsoever, and if that wasn't bad enough, Donald Stephenson was guilty of FIVE penalties. How can anyone be penalized 5 times in 1 game!? Many of Stephenson's infractions were very untimely, negating quality plays or putting the Broncos in third-and-long situations. Siemian finished just 17-of-43 for 183 yards and an interception on his final throw, and as unbelievable as it may sound, the night could've been so much worse for him. He's extremely fortunate that he was picked off only once. The Chiefs dropped an early interception on a 15-yard flea-flicker, and then "

The tight end, who caught 4 balls for 75 yards, snatched a pass with 1 hand and ran into the end zone. Ironically, Derby dropped a much easier pass on third down later in the game.    Excluding Derby, Bennie Fowler led the Broncos in receiving with 2 grabs for 35 yards. It was very surprising to see Denver's wideouts struggle, as neither Emmanuel Sanders (4-27) nor Demaryius Thomas (1-11) couldn't get anything against a secondary that lost 2 starters - David Amerson and rookie Gareon Conley - to injury in this contest. Siemian didn't have much time with Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin breathing down his neck."

   "comment":"Siemian, while their offense established the run extremely well. They led from start to finish as a result, maintaining a 20-3 lead heading into the 4.h quarter.    Many people may not have heard of Orleans Darkwa before this game. A few individuals may have even confused his name with Darkwing Duck. Darkwa, however, gashed the Broncos' No. 1 ground defense for 117 yards on 21 carries. Darkwa looked good, but it was more of the Giants' new blocking scheme that did the trick. That, and it looked like the Broncos were half-asleep in this game, as they were caught off-guard by a winless foe they were supposed to vanquish quite easily.    Eli Manning was pretty sharp considering he didn't have Beckham and Sterling Shepard at his disposal. Manning went 11-of-19 for 128 yards and a touchdown. Manning made sure to release the ball quickly to avoid Von Miller and the rest of Denver's ferocious front. Manning made no mistakes as a result, using his veteran leadership to help will the Giants to victory.    Manning targeted rookie tight end Evan Engram primarily, and it paid off. Engram caught 5 of his 7 targets for 82 yards and a touchdown. No other Giant saw more than 3 targets, and besides Engram, no New York player logged more than 15 receiving yards.    Siemian, meanwhile, generated 376 passing yards, but that was a very misleading figure. Much of that came in garbage time. By intermission, he was 11-of-23 for 148 yards and a pair of picks. he suffered an injury while trying to tackle "

   "comment":"Siemian was under siege on almost every pass attempt. Joey Bosa hounded him in the pocket, recording 2 sacks. Bosa almost nearly forced an interception by tipping a pass into the air, but the potential pick was dropped by linebacker Jatavis Brown. This wasn't the only time that a Siemian pick was dropped, as he tossed an ugly duck in the second quarter because of some horrible mechanics. Siemian finished 25-of-35 for 207 yards, a stat line that was helped by garbage time; Siemian was 11-of-17 for only 89 yards by halftime. He actually turned the ball over twice, tossing a horrible pass on a desperation 4.h-down attempt and also getting strip-sacked to ruin a solid drive in the third quarter. There's going to be a lot of chatter about removing Siemian as the quarterback, and the discussion needs to happen. Siemian sucks. However, he didn't have much of a chance because of his poor pass protection.    Siemian wasn't the only 1 making mistakes. Tight end "
