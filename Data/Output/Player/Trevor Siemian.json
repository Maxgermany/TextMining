   "comment":"Trevor Siemian and first-round rookie Paxton Lynch. Perhaps Lynch had potential, but the other 2 were considered horrible replacements. Everyone has seen enough of Sanchez, while Siemian was unknown to many. As it turns out, Siemian, thus far, has proven to be a big upgrade over Manning. It sounds crazy to say it, and I actually can't believe I'm typing it, but Manning was horrible last year, and Siemian, at least in this contest, was far more than just some game manager. Siemian didn't begin the afternoon all that well. The Broncos actually threw the ball on their first 3 plays. One pass was off the mark, while the other was swatted away. Siemian also had some poor throws in the red zone a bit later, which forced Denver into a field goal. However, Siemian improved as the afternoon progressed, and he was unstoppable in the second half. I'm not exaggerating. Siemian went 10-of-11 for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns after intermission. He sliced through Cincinnati's secondary, constantly connecting on deep throws to "

   "comment":"Trevor Siemian hit Demaryius Thomas for a big gain, but the star receiver lost a fumble. The Chargers recovered, and following a late scare that involved an onside kick recovery, they finally sealed their first victory since they beat the Jaguars in Week 2.    Philip Rivers set the tone for this victory by torching the Broncos on the initial 2 drives. Rivers was absolutely on fire, slinging precise throws on nearly attempt. In fact, his second possession went for 10 minutes, which was the longest drive of the season for any team. He began 14-of-18 for 148 yards and a touchdown. However, Denver's defense clamped down on the Chargers after that. Rivers was just 4-of-11 for 30 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 18-of-29 for 178 yards and a score. His overall numbers would've been better had Antonio Gates not dropped 2 passes, 1 of which would've moved the chains on a third down. Rivers played a great game despite the injuries he's been dealing with up front; Joe Barksdale was the latest blocker to get hurt, though he did return to action eventually. Rivers passed Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time passing leader in terms of yards.    Gates caught only 2 passes for 16 yards, and he played second fiddle to Hunter Henry. The rookie tight end was terrific, catching 6 balls for 83 yards and a touchdown. He was dominant, and the struggling Denver linebackers didn't have any sort of answer for him.    Excluding Henry and Gates, only 3 Chargers caught multiple passes: Tyrell Williams (3-28), Travis Benjamin (3-17) and Dexter McCluster (2-15). Benjamin muffed a punt in the opening half, setting up a Denver field goal. However, he made up for it by drawing a pass-interference flag on Aqib Talib.    Melvin Gordon struggled to find running room for the most part, but finally broke free for a 48-yard gain in the third quarter. Gordon dashed for 94 yards on 27 carries.    Before moving on to the Broncos, I have to say that this was definitely a feel-good moment for Mike McCoy, who was set to be fired if the Chargers lost this game. A teary-eye McCoy addressed the media, which called for his firing during the week, and he told them that he met with his daughter right after the game.    Denver struggled to move the chains until garbage time at the end that nearly turned into an improbable comeback. The Broncos were limited to 60 net yards of offense in the opening half. Part of this was because the Chargers controlled the clock, holding the ball for 20:27 of 30 first-half minutes. The other part was that the entire offense was both ineffective and mistake-prone. Trevor Siemian struggled. His final numbers don't look horrible - 30-of-50, 230 yards, 1 touchdown - but at the end of the third quarter, he was just 10-of-19 for only 58 yards. He didn't have any significant yardage, as most came with the Broncos down 2 or 3 scores and the Chargers turning into a prevent defense that nearly lost them the game. It's unknown why they changed their strategy, but it nearly clost them. Siemian had chances to score points in meaningful action, but missed throws. He had "

   "comment":"Trevor Siemian, meanwhile, failed to complete half of his passes. He began the game 1-of-8 for only 4 yards, as it didn't seem like the Broncos would be able to achieve a first down all evening. Siemian eventually got into a rhythm, but it was too little, too late because the Raiders were able to hold a lead throughout. Siemian was also hurt by drops. He finished 18-of-37 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, a late interception and a lost fumble, but it's worth noting that a 69-yard score of his was a fluky 1. as "

   "comment":"Trevor Siemian played a part in that. Siemian put up some decent looking numbers, going 25-of-40 for 258 yards and 2 touchdowns and 2 picks, but the numbers are misleading. He could only really complete passes in the intermediate game and showed no ability to throw anything downfield. His arm strength is relatively weak, and for this reason alone, I would not be surprised to see Paxton Lynch on the field for the Broncos at some point this season. Siemian also looked a bit out of it mentally. His offensive line was terrible on Sunday, as they allowed a whopping 6 sacks to the New Orleans front, so that may have shaken his confidence a bit. Still, on his interceptions, he failed to see players moving across the field, and in general, he had issues making decisions. A good quarterback would release the ball quicker if he ends up being under pressure. Siemian simply looks like a low-end starter or high-quality backup at this point in the season. He will limit the team's potential moving forward.    During the contest, Siemian primarily relied on "
