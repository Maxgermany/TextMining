   "comment":"Trevor Siemian and first-round rookie Paxton Lynch. Perhaps Lynch had potential, but the other 2 were considered horrible replacements. Everyone has seen enough of Sanchez, while Siemian was unknown to many. As it turns out, Siemian, thus far, has proven to be a big upgrade over Manning. It sounds crazy to say it, and I actually can't believe I'm typing it, but Manning was horrible last year, and Siemian, at least in this contest, was far more than just some game manager. Siemian didn't begin the afternoon all that well. The Broncos actually threw the ball on their first 3 plays. One pass was off the mark, while the other was swatted away. Siemian also had some poor throws in the red zone a bit later, which forced Denver into a field goal. However, Siemian improved as the afternoon progressed, and he was unstoppable in the second half. I'm not exaggerating. Siemian went 10-of-11 for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns after intermission. He sliced through Cincinnati's secondary, constantly connecting on deep throws to "

He could only really complete passes in the intermediate game and showed no ability to throw anything downfield. His arm strength is relatively weak, and for this reason alone, I would not be surprised to see Paxton Lynch on the field for the Broncos at some point this season. Siemian also looked a bit out of it mentally. His offensive line was terrible on Sunday, as they allowed a whopping 6 sacks to the New Orleans front, so that may have shaken his confidence a bit. Still, on his interceptions, he failed to see players moving across the field, and in general, he had issues making decisions. A good quarterback would release the ball quicker if he ends up being under pressure. Siemian simply looks like a low-end starter or high-quality backup at this point in the season. He will limit the team's potential moving forward.    During the contest, Siemian primarily relied on "
