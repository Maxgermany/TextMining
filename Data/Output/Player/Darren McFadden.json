Andrew Walter picked up where Russell left off, and finished 8-of-17, 61 yards and an interception.    Once again, the only target of note for Oakland was Zach Miller, who had 8 grabs for 64 yards.    Justin Fargas rushed for 50 yards on 12 carries. Darren McFadden had 8 total yards of offense on 1 rush attempt and 2 receptions.

   "comment":"Darren McFadden. McFadden. Jason Campbell rumbled for 17 yards and followed it up with a 23 yard pass to Boss. It took the running game 3 shots from first and goal, but Michael Bush cashed in to put Oakland back in front 10-7. Welker receptions and a few BenJarvus Green-Ellis runs, including a 1-yard plunge for a touchdown, changed that in a hurry to make it 14-10 New England. The Black Hole was not in panic mode though. Darrius Heyward-Bey picked up 28 yards on a reception, and the return of Jacoby Ford was felt with a trick play run good for 30 yards. The drive ended on an interception I can't even describe. Announcer Solomon Wilcots assumed Campbell was trying to throw the ball away with no Raiders in the vicinity at the New England 6-yard line on second down and goal. I surmised he just delivered it directly to Patrick Chung, who caught it easily even with a hand in a cast. The Patriots drove for a field goal to make it 17-10 at the halftime gun. Wasted yardage, 75 on that drive, was a theme for the Raiders, who piled up 504 while never realistically having a shot to win down the stretch. If it feels like I am jumping ahead ,it is because the Patriots moved the ball at will in this game when they needed to. Welker's receiving and the hard running of rookie Stevan Ridley were unstoppable. Ridley capped the first drive of the second half with a touchdown run from 33 yards out. Oakland did answer with a drive for a field goal, but it took 7:34 to get it done. An offense built to wear teams down running the ball is not going to beat an offense run by Tom Brady with long marches for 3 points. Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the 4.h quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown. The 31-19 final was secured when Campbell failed to find Chaz Schilens on the 2.point attempt.    The summary here is that New England got enough protection for Brady, thanks to the running of Ridley and Green-Ellis, who combined for 172 yards on 26 carries. Welker was the only receiver targeted, but it didn't matter because the defense couldn't stop him. As expected, Bill Belichick did not allow McFadden to beat him. He did total 123 yards on 18 touches, but 67 of that came on 2 plays and he failed to score. This is a good, not great Raider team ,and to no 1.s surprise, the Patriots were not excited about losing consecutive games.   "

Unfortunately, the offense eventually had to throw another pass. Boller found McFadden left with an injury (sprained right foot), it was looking like 1 of those days. Still, the defense forced a punt. Unfortunately, the offense eventually had to throw another pass. Boller found Brandon Flowers on the interception to set up Kansas City. He was looking for Moore again, this time on a deep ball and had linebacker Derrick Johnson in his face. The Chiefs got 2 key receptions each from Dwayne Bowe and Steve Breaston totaling 54 yards. Le'Ron McClain plunged in from a yard out and as the opening quarter came to a close, Kansas City led 14-0. The Raiders were apparently motivated to respond, and their offense got moving. Rookie running back Taiwan Jones kicked off the drive with a 14-yard run. The revitalized Darius Heyward-Bey caught a pass for another 14 yards, and Michael Bush rumbled down the middle for 35 more. Setting up camp at the Kansas City 5-yard line for first-and-goal, a touchdown seemed inevitable. Four Bush runs later, it was not to be. The final effort was from the Wildcat formation with Bush taking the snap in a shotgun formation. Punts dominated the rest of the second quarter. As time ran down, Boller got the offense going again on a drive that began on the 2-yard line. He connected on a 21- yard toss to Heyward-Bey, following it up with a scramble for 20 yards to the Kansas City 36. However, a deep ball to Heyward-Bey was intercepted by Brandon Carr, giving Boller the hat trick. Down 14-0 at the half, it appeared to be only a matter of time before Palmer was given his opportunity to lead the offense. However, Jackson stuck with Boller, who threw 3 incompletions to open the third quarter. The pressure was catching up to the Oakland defense, and 2 personal foul penalties catapulted Kansas City's offense down the field. Savvy runs from Jackie Battle (16 carries for 76 yards) surrounded those key mistakes, and Javier Arenas capped the march with a 7-yard touchdown run. At 21-0, there was no reason for Jackson not to turn to Palmer. Boller finished 7-for-14 passing with 61 yards and the 3 interceptions. On his first play, Palmer hit Heyward-Bey (5 receptions for 89 yards) for a gain of 18 and picked up another 15 thanks to a personal foul from Tamba Hali, who hit him low after the pass. One more first down was all they could muster however, and the absence of kicker Sebastian Janikowski was felt. He might have gotten them on the board with a long field goal. Instead the Raiders were forced to punt. After an exchange of punts, the Kansas City offense got going a bit, moving into Oakland territory until rookie DeMarcus Van Dyke intercepted Cassel. The Raiders countered by moving into Kansas City territory as the 4.h quarter began. Then Flowers put a stamp on any thoughts of a comeback by housing an interception of Palmer. Jon McGraw and Travis Daniels ended the next 2 Oakland drives with interceptions to give Palmer his own hat trick. His debut could not have been more forgettable, completing just 8-of-21 passes for 116 yards. The 3 quarterbacks finished 30-of-65 for 338 yards and 8 interceptions. Adding up their quarterback ratings still results in a pretty bad mark of 77.9. The story of the game was the importance of McFadden to the Raiders' offense. He fights for yardage on running plays and creates offense. Bush finished with 99 yards rushing, but could not punch it in when it mattered, and over 1.third of his yardage came on the 1 long run which of course also resulted in no points. The Chiefs came in desperate and it showed. This was a sloppy game with both teams in double digits for penalties for a combined 218 yards. For good measure, "

A 36-yard pass interference penalty on D.J. Hayden set up the Seahawks at the Raiders' 6-yard line. Lynch finished the drive with a power run, moving a pile from 3 yards out for a touchdown. The Seahawks added to their lead when linebacker Bruce Irvin tipped a pass up in the air. He came down with the ball and sprinted down the field for a 35-yard touchdown. Carr gave the ball right back as Richard Sherman picked off a back-shoulder throw intended for Andre Holmes (2-28). That spotted Seattle a field goal. Just before the half, the Seahawks drove down the field again. They were aided by a taunting penalty on Hayden, and Lynch scored from 5 yards out. The Seahawks had a 24-3 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Hayden dropped an interception that should have been a pick-six as he jumped a route. On the very next play though, Denico Autry blocked a punt and the ball rolled about 25 yards into the end zone before Brice Butler recovered it for a touchdown. The Raiders got going with a punt return by T.J. Carrie to the Seahawks' 30-yard line. A 23-yard pass to McFadden moved the ball inside the 10. On 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, "

A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York.    Rueben Randle had 2 receptions for 68 yards. Odell Beckham Jr. had just 4 catches for 35 yards.    Matt Cassel was 17-of-27 for 227 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could have been worse as Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie dropped an interception early in the game that would have been a pick-six. Robert Ayers dropped another pick.    Darren McFadden ran like he was back at Arkansas with 152 yards on 29 carries and a touchdown. McFadden.
