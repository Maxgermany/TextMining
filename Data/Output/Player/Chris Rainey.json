   "comment":"Chris Rainey lost a fumble with 2:36 remaining in the game near midfield, ruining a potential game-winning drive. - Mendenhall and Rainey both fumbled on another occasion, but Cleveland did not recover. These weren't the only mistakes the Steelers made. They had 9 penalties, 1 of which was a ticky-tack hold that negated a 33-yard "
