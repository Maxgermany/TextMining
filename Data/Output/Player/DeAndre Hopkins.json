   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins for a potential touchdown, while the second was an atrocious interception that he hurled while getting hit. It wasn't a 4.h down, so Hoyer easily could have thrown it away. The camera caught O'Brien shouting, Why did you do that!? right after the pick was made. As for Mallett's actual performance on the field, he was uncharacteristically accurate early on, though he did miss a throw. He went 7-of-10 for 50 yards and a pick, which was only partly his fault.

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins needs to be used in FanDuel each week going forward. He's a monster, and he's getting a billion targets each week. </i>    Both teams entered this game with 1-4 records, so the loser would be putting themselves in better position to land the No. 1 pick. Neither franchise wants to be selecting high again, but the Jaguars seem poised to be picking in the top 10 thanks to a porous defense. By and large, Blake Bortles has been improved this season thanks to offensive coordinator Greg Olson. However, this game showed that Bortles still has room to improve, and the Jaguars' offensive line needs more upgrades, potentially at left tackle as well.    Houston got on the board first. Brian Hoyer executed a 16-play, 99-yard drive led by a 4.h-down conversion with a completion to DeAndre Hopkins and then finished the drive with a third-down 14-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster."

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins made a tremendous leaping catch in the corner of the end zone for a 21-yard score. Bishop Sankey promptly fumbled the ball to the Texans on the kickoff. The Houston offense didn't move the ball though, and Nick Novack kicked a field goal. After trading punts, Dexter McCluster made a 37-yard return to the Texans' 28, but Whitney Mercilus had a sack, which along with a 15-yard penalty on Byron Bell, moved the ball out of field goal position. Houston took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Titans got going when Antonio Andrews put together a 28-yard run. A great play by Texans rookie corner Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Jared Crick at the Tennessee's 10-yard line. Houston could only get 3 out of the turnover, but it didn't matter because the defense slammed the door on the Titans.    DeAndre Hopkins totaled 94 yards on 8 catches with a score. Nate Washington made 4 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown.    "

He got away with a push-off on Ronald Darby to haul in a 19-yard touchdown to finish the possession. Grimes ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. McCoy ripped off a 20-yard run to get Buffalo to midfield in response. After the 2-minute warning, Charles Clay got wide open down the field for a 40-yard touchdown in busted coverage. Dan Carpenter missed the extra point, but the Bills' defense slammed the door for the win. Carpenter added a field goal after the Texans went 4.and-out.    Taylor was 11-of-21 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 28 yards and a score as well. Taylor played well against a good Houston defense, but got lucky as interceptions were dropped by Kevin Johnson and Andre Hal in the 4.h quarter. Hal's would have been a pick-six with 3 or 4 minutes remaining.    LeSean McCoy totaled 112 yards on 21 totes, but missed the majority of the second half in the concussion protocal.    Watkins had 109 yards and a score on 3 receptions. His catches were huge. Charles Clay (4-66) made up for a bad drop with his game-winning touchdown.    Brian Hoyer was 26-of-43 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. He missed on a number of opportunities and illustrates why he really is a backup in the NFL; not a starter.

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins. Once again, the team rode that formula to get a victory as Houston's quarterback carousel continued with both Brandon Weeden and B.J. Daniels seeing action against Tennessee. The Texans hope that Brian Hoyer will return to the field in Week 17.    On the first drive of the game, Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on "

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins for a 50-50 pass and came away with an interception. Jay Cutler took advantage and started moving the ball down the field, including an excellent catch by Alshon Jeffery. To end the drive, Jeremy Langford plunged into the end zone from a yard out and gave the Bears a quick 7-0 lead. Chicago's defense quickly got off the field and Eddie Royal had a 31-yard punt return to the Texans' 40-yard line, but the Texans stopped the Bears on 4.h-and-1 to get the ball back. Houston was able to get a field goal drive thanks to Miller's running. The Texans took the lead with a 23-yard touchdown to Hopkins as, once again, he made a phenomenal contested catch. At the end of the second quarter, Will Fuller dropped what would have been an 83-yard touchdown, and the Bears responded by hitting Jeffery for a 54-yard gain. With only a play before having to settle a field goal, Cutler threw a perfect strike to Royal for a 19-yard touchdown after he worked over Kareem Jackson. That gave the Bears a 14-10 halftime lead. At the start of the third quarter, Kevin White ran the wrong route, and that let Andre Hal pick off a pass to set up the Texans in Chicago territory. Houston had to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, Fuller caught a 27-yard pass to get into Bears territory. He finished the drive by making a shoestring catch on a wide receiver screen before using his speed to dart down the field for an 18-yard touchdown. Shortly later on a third down, Fuller made a superb leaping grab of about 30 yards and set up a short field goal for Nick Novak. Houston's defense then slammed the door for the win.    Brock Osweiler completed 22-of-35 for 231 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He threw the ball better than the numbers illustrate, and he easily could have had a couple more touchdown passes.    Lamar Miller ran for 106 yards on 28 carries with 4 receptions for 11 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins had 5 catches for 54 yards with a score. Will Fuller (5-107-1) had a great debut aside from his drop. Chicago's corners couldn't run with Fuller, especially in the second half. Osweiler targeted Fuller heavily, at times more than Hopkins, and if you need a wideout for your fantasy team, Fuller could be an adept pickup.    Jay Cutler was 16-of-29 for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He played better than the numbers illustrate as well. The Bears' offensive tackles got whipped in the second half.    Jeremy Langford ran for 57 yards on 17 carries, but bailed out his fantasy owners with a score.    Alshon Jeffery had 4 catches for 105 yards. Eddie Royal (4-57-1) chipped well in the first half, and Kevin White (3-34) flashed at times.    Chicago's front 7 played well overall, but the secondary struggled. "

The crowd continuously booed him, and many of the fans left he game early. They'll regret not sticking around, however, as something clicked for Osweiler. He was on fire beginning at the end of the third quarter, and he managed to go 18-of-22 for 205 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. Osweiler was going to receive a ton of criticism for choking in this game, so it was absolutely imperative for him to keep his critics at bay for now.    Osweiler's final numbers looked like this: 25-of-39, 269 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 pick. He was locked in on Hopkins, who caught 9 passes for 71 yards. Osweiler focused in too much on Hopkins at times, though that paid off late. Davis had Hopkins' number early on, but the stud receiver got the better of the veteran cornerback in the final quarter and overtime. Osweiler's touchdowns went to "

It seems like Hopkins' days of being an elite fantasy receiver are over because of Brock Osweiler's struggles.    Under all the criticism and pressure, the Texans (5-3) needed a bounce-back performance, and they got it, taking care of business at home against the Lions (4-4). Brock Osweiler didn't dominate, but he turned in a quality start to manage the game into a victory for Houston. The real leader was the Texans' defense. It was strength versus strength, and Houston's pass defense did a nice job of limiting Matthew Stafford to keep the Texans in sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Detroit was dropped to .500, but still remains in the NFC wild-card race.    To start the first quarter, the Lions had a drive into Houston territory, but Matt Prater missed a 49-yard field goal.

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins on the next snap. The pass wasn't too bad, but it was just a horrible call, as fades seldom work in the red zone. Still, despite trailing 13-5 entering the third quarter and watching the Jaguars score 7 free points on a kickoff return, the Texans were able to come back. Savage was brilliant at the end of this game, while Blake Bortles faltered. Houston's win allowed it to hold a tie with the Titans atop the AFC South, while the Jacksonville loss has resulted in . Click the link to see my grade for this.    Savage is almost certain to hold the starting job in the wake of this victory. He finished 23-of-36 for 260 yards in slightly more than a half of action. Compare this to Osweiler's line of 6-of-11 for 48 yards and 2 interceptions. Bill O'Brien would have a mutiny on his hands if he went back to Osweiler, especially since the Texans were able to win.    DeAndre Hopkins definitely would be pissed if Osweiler started once again. Hopkins has struggled all year statistically because of Osweiler's incompetence. However, he managed to catch 8 balls for 87 yards with Savage. He also drew a pass-interference flag on Jalen Ramsay in the second half when the Texans were mounting their comeback. Elsewhere, "

   "comment":"DeAndre Hopkins and a connection to Will Fuller (3-24) for 14 yards. On 4.h-and-goal, Osweiler found C.J. Fiedorowicz (2-12-1) for a short touchdown. The Texans then failed with their onside kick attempt, giving Tennessee good field position. Some good runs by Derrick Henry and a reception to Delanie Walker set up a first-and-goal that Henry turned into a touchdown. The Texans responded with a 51-yard pass to Hopkins, but ultimately had to settle for a field goal. Cassel soon loaded up a 50-yard completion to Matthews after he beat Robert Nelson once again, and that set up a field goal for Tennessee to take a 24-10 lead. Nelson and Texans backup Denzel Rice were being beaten like a drum. Osweiler hit Wendall Williams for a 26-yard reception, and on a 4.h-and-goal, Osweiler ran the ball into the end zone to cut the lead to 24-17 with just over 3 minutes remaining. Derrick Henry ran the clock down, and Osweiler was unable to engineer a touchdown drive in the final minute.    Savage was 5-for-8 for 25 yards before leaving the game. Osweiler was 21-of-40 for 253 yards with a touchdown passing and another 1 rushing.    DeAndre Hopkins made 7 receptions for 123 yards. The Texans pulled him early to protect him for their playoff game.    Cassel was 16-of-26 for 150 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Henry led Tennessee in rushing with 65 yards on 15 carries. "

Watson moved the ball across midfield again before Fowler kicked the ball out of Watson's hand, and Ngakoue recovered the fumble. Late in the 4.h quarter, Watson moved the ball inside the 10-yard line, but threw an interception to Tashaun Gipson to finish off Houston.    Fournette ran for 100 yards on 26 carries and a touchdown in his NFL debut. He also caught 3 passes for 24 yards.    Bortles had an easy game, completing 11-of-21 for 125 yards with a touchdown.    Watson was 12-of-23 for 102 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. Savage finished 7-of-13 for 62 yards.    Lamar Miller ran for 65 yards on 17 carries, plus made 2 receptions for 31 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins caught 7 passes for 55 yards with a touchdown.    The Jaguars' defense was incredible, totaling 10 sacks. Calais Campbell (4 sacks, 5 quarterback hits), Yannick Ngakoue and Dante Fowler overwhelmed Houston's offensive line. The only thing that didn't really go well for the Jaguars was new cornerback "

He nearly scored a touchdown in the opening quarter, but managed to get just 1 foot inbounds. As for Savage's other weapons, tight end Stephen Anderson was next on the stat sheet with 5 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. "
