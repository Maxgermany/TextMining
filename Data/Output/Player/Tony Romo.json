   "comment":"Tony Romo was the 1 who choked, living up to his nickname of Aurora Snowmo.    Snowmo finished the contest 24-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers were pretty artificial; Snowmo compiled that yardage and the 2 scores in a pair of futile drives in the 4.h quarter. At 1 point in this contest, Snowmo was 13-of-25 for 90 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. This was yet another instance of Snowmo coming up small in December. I still don't understand how he beat the Giants. I know the defense stepped up, but Snowmo actually looked decent in that contest. He was dreadful on Saturday night until it was clear that the game was out of hand, enabling Snowmo to exit out of choke mode.    Excluding Snowmo's follies, the biggest difference in this contest was the coaching mismatch. If you couldn't tell that by the penalty difference (Baltimore 3 for 19 yards; Dallas 10 for 86 yards), how about the fake field goal Baltimore ran in the second half? John Harbugh caught the feeble Wade Phillips completely off guard. Later, when Phillips should have kicked onside, Harbaugh called a timeout prior to the kickoff, but not before "

My only regret is not placing 50,000 units on the Chargers. Laying $5.5 million to win $5 million would have been awesome.    I'd love to bash Tony Aurora Snowmo, but this defeat wasn't his fault. Though he converted just 1-of-8 third downs, he was 19-of-30 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dallas' problem was an overall lack of urgency, a leaky defense that couldn't stop Philip Rivers, and poor, predictable play-calling down at the goal line.

Anyone who thinks that the Cowboys have gotten over their annual December swoon is mistaken, or at least very premature in that judgment. I still say Dallas loses to Washington and Philadelphia to close out the year. Call me a hater or whatever, but I'm just calling it like I see it.    I will give credit where credit is due though, and Romo played extremely well. He was 22-of-34 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He didn't throw a pick, though Romo was 20-of-30 for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns. Back then, everyone said the Cowboys had finally gotten over the hump. Even I was fooled. Dallas went on to lose their last 2 games by a combined score of 77-30. We all have a short memory.

It truly was a disgraceful play on Barron's part, and his unborn grandkids will undoubtedly have to live their lives in shame because of it.    Tony Romo went 31-of-47 for 282 yards and a touchdown. Romo did a great job considering how Washington abused his inept offensive line.    His first game after signing a massive contract, Romo pitched the ball to Tashard Choice, who fumbled the ball to see it scooped up by DeAngelo Hall for a back-breaking touchdown. At halftime, Rodney Harrison said the following, This has to be 1 of the dumbest plays I've ever seen. On the final play of the game, Tony Romo found Roy Williams in the end zone for the game-winning score."

   "comment":"Tony Romo tossed 2 interceptions (both to E.Romo tossed 2 interceptions (both to E.J. Henderson), 1 of which was a severely underthrown short pass. The other pick was left tackle Doug Free's fault, who appeared frozen in time because he refused to move once the ball was snapped. - The Cowboys had 11 penalties for 91 yards. By contrast, the Vikings committed only 5 infractions for 45 yards.    With all of this in mind, 1 thing is evident. I'll capitalize to emphasize: JERRY JONES MUST FIRE WADE PHILLIPS TO SALVAGE THIS SEASON. When a team continuously underperforms, it's on the coaching staff. The Cowboys keep making the same dumb mistakes over and over again. Dallas needs a change because things are not going to turn around as long as Wobbling Wade is on the sidelines.    Aside from the horrible interception, Romo played pretty well, going 24-of-32 for 220 yards. He also had that long touchdown to Austin-Jones wiped out. Austin-Jones, meanwhile, was limited to 2 catches for 12 yards. "

It was Jon Kitna time and you know what that means - touchdowns, yards and interceptions. Kitna completed his first 3 passes before Donte Whitner intercepted him when Jason Witten did not go where he expected him to on a deep route. Witten saw a hefty 15 targets, catching 7 passes for 102 yards. Both quarterbacks looked at him, so if Romo's ribs keep him out, fantasy owners should not be worried about putting the tight end in the lineup. That interception was offset by a pick from "

Dallas consequently failed to convert in longer yardage. Panthers: Carolina did the same thing in a 3rd-and-10. Cowboys: Jay Ratliff's personal foul and Brandon Carr's defensive holding helped the Panthers score a touchdown. Dez Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97).

His impressive comeback pretty much nullified all of the dumb mistakes Dallas made throughout - and there were plenty of them. For example, defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was whistled for a 15-yard personal foul penalty for throwing a flag in the third quarter. His defense was then called for 12 men on the field when the Bengals reached the red zone. The Cowboys also were guilty of getting the plays in late yet again, which cost them a timeout in the 2.minute drill of the first half.    Romo finished 25-of-43 for 268 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was essentially a punt on a third-and-long situation.

   "comment":"Tony Romo enthusiasts can defend him at this point. Romo had been playing extremely well entering this game, but had his teammates disappoint him. Well, Romo was at fault this time. When he wasn't yelling at people on the sidelines for failing to pick up the blitz, he was tossing picks. He threw 3 hideous 1.. Romo's first interception was an overthrow as he was getting blitzed. The second was worse, as it was terribly underthrown. Romo, however, saved his worst pick for last. If there were any baseball umpires on the field, they would have called the infield fly rule; Romo just floated the ball, allowing a Washington defender to easily snatch it out of the air. Romo finished 20-of-37 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks. Jerry Jones has a very difficult decision to make with him. Romo is entering the final year of his contract, so he has a massive cap number of $16 million. Jones could decrease that, but that would involve extending Romo to another contract. If Jones does nothing, however, he won't have much maneuverability this offseason.    Of course, this wasn't all on Romo. As mentioned, his teammates struggled to pick up the blitz.

   "comment":"Tony Romo and company enough to limit the defensive coordinator's old team to just 9 first downs. Romo and company enough to limit the defensive coordinator's old team to just 9 first downs. Drew Brees was absolutely unstoppable. He went 34-of-41 for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns, putting together a stretch in which he completed 19 consecutive passes. It helped that the Cowboys lost a couple of defensive starters to injury in this contest, including Sean Lee (hamstring), but Brees was hot even before several Dallas players were sidelined. Lee's absence had no bearing on the result of this game, but it did play a huge factor in allowing the Saints to set that single-game record for first downs.    With the Saints so far ahead, the Cowboys couldn't expose New Orleans' greatest weakness, which happens to be the run defense. DeMarco Murray had great success against New Orleans in the first half, rushing for 80 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, but was given the ball just 5 times following intermission. He ultimately finished with 89 yards and the score on 16 tries.    The Cowboys couldn't run the ball in the second half, but that didn't have much of an impact on Romo because he was just 3-of-9 for 20 yards in the opening half. He simply had no success against the Saints' improved pass rush and aerial defense, as Ryan had a perfect game plan for his former quarterback. Romo would end up going 10-of-24 for 128 yards and a touchdown. He was lucky to get away with a couple of interceptions. Romo's sole score went to "

However, Dallas, down 23-14 in the 4.h quarter, engineered a last-minute surge of its own to keep its season alive. Save for an interception he made because of a bad decision, Romo was awesome in the second half. While he finished 17-of-27 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick, he was 12-of-18 for 164 yards, 1 score and an interception following the break. Romo did this despite suffering some sort of leg/back injury on an attempted spin move. Romo could barely move at times, yet he still led his team from behind. However, despite this win, we've seen this from the Cowboys before. It's not like Romo hasn't orchestrated 4.h-quarter comebacks before. He also played well last December. His problem has always been in Week 17 and beyond. He'll have a chance to win the division with a win over the Eagles in front of his home crowd next week.

   "comment":"Tony Romo and the rest of the starters would play in this contest. As it turns out, Jason Garrett via Jerry Jones allowed Romo, DeMarco Murray and all of his other first-stringers to stay on the field throughout the entire afternoon. I'm all about keeping momentum going, but Garrett and Jones took a major risk by keeping Romo and Murray on the field for the entire game. They're extremely fortunate that they came out of this game unscathed in what ultimately proved to be a blowout victory. Revenge for the Monday night loss apparently served as Dallas' motivation. The Cowboys were so hyped up to win this game that they attempted (and successfully recovered) an onside kick while leading 20-7 in the second quarter.    Murray looked great, which is the big take-away from this game. Murray didn't play well against the Colts last week, as he was favoring his hand while averaging fewer than 3 yards per carry. He looked like a completely different player in this contest, gashing a normally strong Washington ground defense for 100 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. Murray, who broke Emmitt Smith's single-season rushing record with the Cowboys, was robbed of even more yardage when the officials incorrectly blew a play dead because they thought he was down.    Tony Romo was also sharp, though he made a couple of mistakes. He finished 22-of-34 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He also nearly threw a second pick, but Romo and the rest of the starters would play in this contest. As it turns out, Jason Garrett via Jerry Jones allowed Romo, DeMarco Murray and all of his other first-stringers to stay on the field throughout the entire afternoon."
