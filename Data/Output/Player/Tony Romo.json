   "comment":"Tony Romo. And when I say couldn't put any pressure, I mean absolutely no pressure. On multiple occasions, Romo stood still in the pocket for at least 8 seconds as he was scanning the field. Dallas' offensive line is great, but it was heavily publicized, especially on this Web site, that the Browns simply did not do enough this offseason to improve their pass rush.    Speaking of Tony Romo, he finished 24-of-32, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. On 1 of the rare instances where the Browns pressured Romo, the Cowboys' quarterback hit the turf and scratched up his chin. This may not affect your fantasy team, but it will greatly improve Romo's chances of getting laid tonight, as Jessica Simpson will undoubtedly feel sorry for her man.    The NFL's getting ridiculous.

   "comment":"Tony Romo was the 1 who choked, living up to his nickname of Aurora Snowmo.    Snowmo finished the contest 24-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers were pretty artificial; Snowmo compiled that yardage and the 2 scores in a pair of futile drives in the 4.h quarter. At 1 point in this contest, Snowmo was 13-of-25 for 90 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. This was yet another instance of Snowmo coming up small in December. I still don't understand how he beat the Giants. I know the defense stepped up, but Snowmo actually looked decent in that contest. He was dreadful on Saturday night until it was clear that the game was out of hand, enabling Snowmo to exit out of choke mode.    Excluding Snowmo's follies, the biggest difference in this contest was the coaching mismatch. If you couldn't tell that by the penalty difference (Baltimore 3 for 19 yards; Dallas 10 for 86 yards), how about the fake field goal Baltimore ran in the second half? John Harbugh caught the feeble Wade Phillips completely off guard. Later, when Phillips should have kicked onside, Harbaugh called a timeout prior to the kickoff, but not before "

   "comment":"Tony Romo started this game slowly, as he was just 6-of-13 for 64 yards in the first 28 minutes of this contest. I was all prepared to write how Romo struggled with the departure of Terrell Owens, but Romo exploded after that, finishing 16-of-27 for 353 yards and 3 touchdowns. Amazingly, Romo's 353 yards were a career-high. So much for struggling without Owens!    So, who stepped up in Owens' absence? Try everyone. Without needing to target Owens a set amount of times per game, Romo was allowed to scan the field and find the open receiver. "

My only regret is not placing 50,000 units on the Chargers. Laying $5.5 million to win $5 million would have been awesome.    I'd love to bash Tony Aurora Snowmo, but this defeat wasn't his fault. Though he converted just 1-of-8 third downs, he was 19-of-30 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dallas' problem was an overall lack of urgency, a leaky defense that couldn't stop Philip Rivers, and poor, predictable play-calling down at the goal line. The Cowboys had 1st-and-goal on San Diego's 4-yard line in the second quarter. Instead of calling a play-action fake or a bootleg, offensive coordinator Jason Garrett gave "

Dallas went on to lose their last 2 games by a combined score of 77-30. We all have a short memory. Anyone who thinks that the Cowboys have gotten over their annual December swoon is mistaken, or at least very premature in that judgment. I still say Dallas loses to Washington and Philadelphia to close out the year. Call me a hater or whatever, but I'm just calling it like I see it.    I will give credit where credit is due though, and Romo played extremely well. He was 22-of-34 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He didn't throw a pick, though "

   "comment":"Tony Romo. That, apparently, is not the case any longer, as Dallas has now reached a new all-time low in stupidity. Things started innocently enough. Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown."

Romo was unstoppable after halftime, going a perfect 10-of-10 for 169 yards and the 3 scores following the break. Romo probably would've been great throughout had his offensive line held up.

   "comment":"Tony Romo was absolutely lethal in the 4.h quarter, going 11-of-15 for 118 yards and a touchdown in the final period. His impressive comeback pretty much nullified all of the dumb mistakes Dallas made throughout - and there were plenty of them. For example, defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was whistled for a 15-yard personal foul penalty for throwing a flag in the third quarter. His defense was then called for 12 men on the field when the Bengals reached the red zone. The Cowboys also were guilty of getting the plays in late yet again, which cost them a timeout in the 2.minute drill of the first half.    Romo finished 25-of-43 for 268 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was essentially a punt on a third-and-long situation. However, it's worth noting that he was nearly picked in the first half by former teammate "

   "comment":"Tony Romo enthusiasts can defend him at this point. Romo had been playing extremely well entering this game, but had his teammates disappoint him. Well, Romo was at fault this time. When he wasn't yelling at people on the sidelines for failing to pick up the blitz, he was tossing picks. He threw 3 hideous 1.. Romo's first interception was an overthrow as he was getting blitzed. The second was worse, as it was terribly underthrown. Romo, however, saved his worst pick for last. If there were any baseball umpires on the field, they would have called the infield fly rule; Romo just floated the ball, allowing a Washington defender to easily snatch it out of the air. Romo finished 20-of-37 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks. Jerry Jones has a very difficult decision to make with him. Romo is entering the final year of his contract, so he has a massive cap number of $16 million. Jones could decrease that, but that would involve extending Romo to another contract. If Jones does nothing, however, he won't have much maneuverability this offseason.    Of course, this wasn't all on Romo. As mentioned, his teammates struggled to pick up the blitz. "

Even though the Texans lost and their season is over, the silver lining is that they may just have something with Keenum.    Andre Johnson has to be thrilled with Keenum. Whereas Matt Schaub was scared to take shots downfield, Keenum had no concerns airing it out. Johnson, who didn't score a touchdown all year going into this contest, hauled in 3 touchdowns in addition to 9 catches for 229 yards. However, Johnson couldn't come up with an important third-down catch in the 4.h quarter, as he bobbled the ball out of bounds along the sideline. Instead of the chains being moved, Houston had to punt, ultimately leading to Indianapolis' decisive touchdown.    "

   "comment":"Tony Romo can actually come through in the clutch. This was indeed a reversal for the Cowboys, who relinquished an unbelievable comeback to the Packers last week. However, Dallas, down 23-14 in the 4.h quarter, engineered a last-minute surge of its own to keep its season alive. Save for an interception he made because of a bad decision, Romo was awesome in the second half. While he finished 17-of-27 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick, he was 12-of-18 for 164 yards, 1 score and an interception following the break. Romo did this despite suffering some sort of leg/back injury on an attempted spin move. Romo could barely move at times, yet he still led his team from behind. However, despite this win, we've seen this from the Cowboys before. It's not like Romo hasn't orchestrated 4.h-quarter comebacks before. He also played well last December. His problem has always been in Week 17 and beyond. He'll have a chance to win the division with a win over the Eagles in front of his home crowd next week.    Romo's 2 scores went to "

Romo's first pick was carelessly thrown in triple coverage. He then tossed a pick in the end zone. He had someone open, but threw the ball late.

With the Giants fully focused on containing DeMarco Murray, they let Prince Amukamara have single coverage on Dez Bryant. Amukamara played well, but Tony Romo continuously found Bryant, who made fantastic catch after fantastic catch. Meanwhile, Romo's other targets were constantly wide open, including "

In the past, Dallas had always begun hot but withered away in the final week of the year. This game looked like it was going to epitomize all of the Cowboys' late-season failures. The Cowboys, however, took control. They reestablished the lead with a great drive, and thanks to several Philadelphia turnovers, they were able to prevail with a 38-27 victory.    Romo, as mentioned, was exceptional. He had a sequence in the middle of the game in which he had some consecutive drives that went nowhere, 1 of which featured a fumble of his because he held on to the ball for an eternity. However, he went on a tear once the Eagles went in front, completing 8-of-11 attempts for 114 yards and a touchdown following the break. Romo's final numbers were 22-of-31 for 265 yards, 3 touchdowns and a lost fumble. He was nearly picked early, but he torched Philadelphia's beleaguered secondary all evening. "

   "comment":"Tony Romo and the rest of the starters would play in this contest. As it turns out, Jason Garrett via Jerry Jones allowed Romo, DeMarco Murray and all of his other first-stringers to stay on the field throughout the entire afternoon. I'm all about keeping momentum going, but Garrett and Jones took a major risk by keeping Romo and Murray on the field for the entire game. They're extremely fortunate that they came out of this game unscathed in what ultimately proved to be a blowout victory. Revenge for the Monday night loss apparently served as Dallas' motivation. The Cowboys were so hyped up to win this game that they attempted (and successfully recovered) an onside kick while leading 20-7 in the second quarter.    Murray looked great, which is the big take-away from this game. Murray didn't play well against the Colts last week, as he was favoring his hand while averaging fewer than 3 yards per carry. He looked like a completely different player in this contest, gashing a normally strong Washington ground defense for 100 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. Murray, who broke Emmitt Smith's single-season rushing record with the Cowboys, was robbed of even more yardage when the officials incorrectly blew a play dead because they thought he was down.    Tony Romo was also sharp, though he made a couple of mistakes. He finished 22-of-34 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He also nearly threw a second pick, but "
