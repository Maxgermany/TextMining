Dallas' offensive line is great, but it was heavily publicized, especially on this Web site, that the Browns simply did not do enough this offseason to improve their pass rush.    Speaking of Tony Romo, he finished 24-of-32, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. On 1 of the rare instances where the Browns pressured Romo, the Cowboys' quarterback hit the turf and scratched up his chin. This may not affect your fantasy team, but it will greatly improve Romo's chances of getting laid tonight, as Jessica Simpson will undoubtedly feel sorry for her man.    The NFL's getting ridiculous.

   "comment":"Romo was the 1 who choked, living up to his nickname of Aurora Snowmo.    Snowmo finished the contest 24-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, but those numbers were pretty artificial; Snowmo compiled that yardage and the 2 scores in a pair of futile drives in the 4.h quarter. At 1 point in this contest, Snowmo was 13-of-25 for 90 yards, 2 picks and a fumble. This was yet another instance of Snowmo coming up small in December. I still don't understand how he beat the Giants. I know the defense stepped up, but Snowmo actually looked decent in that contest. He was dreadful on Saturday night until it was clear that the game was out of hand, enabling Snowmo to exit out of choke mode.    Excluding Snowmo's follies, the biggest difference in this contest was the coaching mismatch. If you couldn't tell that by the penalty difference (Baltimore 3 for 19 yards; Dallas 10 for 86 yards), how about the fake field goal Baltimore ran in the second half? John Harbugh caught the feeble Wade Phillips completely off guard. Later, when Phillips should have kicked onside, Harbaugh called a timeout prior to the kickoff, but not before Nick Folk sailed the attempt deep. This gave the Ravens an idea of what Phillips was planning to do. And despite the extra chance to call for an onside attempt, Phillips elected to relinquish possession, which epically failed because LeRon McClain broke free for an 82-yard touchdown run on Baltimore's first play. This eclipsed the Ravens' previous offensive play - a 77-yard Willis McGahee scamper.    McClain (22 carries, 139 yards, TD) and McGahee (8 carries, 108 yards, TD) weren't the whole story on offense. Joe Flacco's numbers weren't spectacular - 17-of-25 for 149 yards and a touchdown - but made clutch throws, allowing the Ravens to keep drives alive. Romo had nearly double the yardage, but Flacco was infinitely better.    Flacco found "

   "comment":"Romo was 20-of-30 for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns. Back then, everyone said the Cowboys had finally gotten over the hump. Even I was fooled. Dallas went on to lose their last 2 games by a combined score of 77-30. We all have a short memory. Anyone who thinks that the Cowboys have gotten over their annual December swoon is mistaken, or at least very premature in that judgment. I still say Dallas loses to Washington and Philadelphia to close out the year. Call me a hater or whatever, but I'm just calling it like I see it.    I will give credit where credit is due though, and Romo played extremely well. He was 22-of-34 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He didn't throw a pick, though "

His favorite receiver was obviously Miles Austin-Jones, who managed 7 catches for 82 yards and a score. Roy Williams (5-59) was also involved for a change.    With Dallas' 6-game playoff losing streak over, I guess you can say the monkey is off Romo and Wade Mr. Turkey Neck Phillips' back. I had the Cowboys seeded No. 2 in my NFL Power Rankings for a reason; they might just be the best team in the league with an upgrade at receiver (Austin-Jones over malcontent Terrell Owens) and a legitimate leader on the team in "

   "comment":"Romo, meanwhile, was prolific. He torched a lethargic Tampa secondary, going 23-of-30 for 249 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). His 1 error came on a strip-six in the third quarter that gave the Buccaneers life. But as Charlie Campbell pointed out on the forum, Before Dekoda Watson's touchdown, the Bucs had given up 69 straight points going back to the second quarter against the Jaguars last week. In other words, Tampa had life, but it was still in the ICU.    Raheem Morris needs to be fired. The Buccaneers flat-out quit on him. Some of the NFL Network analysts believed that was because of the news that broke this week about Morris perhaps being fired, but the team has been mailing it in since losing to the Packers. The players are just taking after their leader. Morris doesn't work nearly as hard as other head coaches. Thus, it's no surprise that the team often quits and gets whistled for stupid penalties.    It doesn't help Tampa that it has no explosion on offense. I mean, Kregg Lumpkin paced the team with 5 catches for 50 yards. Mike Williams, meanwhile, didn't log a single reception. Terence Newman was draped all over him in a nice rebound performance.    Since the Buccaneers were down the entire time, LeGarrette Blount carried the ball just 9 times for 21 yards. Dallas, conversely, ran it extremely well. Felix Jones tallied 108 yards on 22 attempts, while Sammy Morris (12-53) served as a solid change of pace.    As mentioned, Romo shredded a Buc team that put forth little effort. His offensive line dominated and gave him plenty of time throughout. On 1 of his touchdowns, he seriously had 15 seconds in the pocket. Romo's scores went to usual suspects "

Cowboys: Austin-Jones lost a fumble in Carolina territory in the second quarter. Panthers: Newton overthrew Jonathan Stewart in the end zone later in the period. Cowboys: Doug Free was whistled for a false start on a 3rd-and-4 in Carolina territory after halftime. Dallas consequently failed to convert in longer yardage. Panthers: Carolina did the same thing in a 3rd-and-10. Cowboys: Jay Ratliff's personal foul and Brandon Carr's defensive holding helped the Panthers score a touchdown. Dez Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97).

   "comment":"Romo. That, apparently, is not the case any longer, as Dallas has now reached a new all-time low in stupidity. Things started innocently enough. Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown."

His impressive comeback pretty much nullified all of the dumb mistakes Dallas made throughout - and there were plenty of them. For example, defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was whistled for a 15-yard personal foul penalty for throwing a flag in the third quarter. His defense was then called for 12 men on the field when the Bengals reached the red zone. The Cowboys also were guilty of getting the plays in late yet again, which cost them a timeout in the 2.minute drill of the first half.    Romo finished 25-of-43 for 268 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was essentially a punt on a third-and-long situation. However, it's worth noting that he was nearly picked in the first half by former teammate "

Romo showed tremendous faith in Austin-Jones (4-45), who hurt him with 3 drops on the afternoon.    Romo's 2 other prominent targets are worth noting. "

   "comment":"Romo enthusiasts can defend him at this point. Romo had been playing extremely well entering this game, but had his teammates disappoint him. Well, Romo was at fault this time. When he wasn't yelling at people on the sidelines for failing to pick up the blitz, he was tossing picks. He threw 3 hideous 1.. Romo's first interception was an overthrow as he was getting blitzed. The second was worse, as it was terribly underthrown. Romo, however, saved his worst pick for last. If there were any baseball umpires on the field, they would have called the infield fly rule; Romo just floated the ball, allowing a Washington defender to easily snatch it out of the air. Romo finished 20-of-37 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks. Jerry Jones has a very difficult decision to make with him. Romo is entering the final year of his contract, so he has a massive cap number of $16 million. Jones could decrease that, but that would involve extending Romo to another contract. If Jones does nothing, however, he won't have much maneuverability this offseason.    Of course, this wasn't all on Romo. As mentioned, his teammates struggled to pick up the blitz. "

Romo went 25-of-36 for 506 yards and 5 touchdowns. For 58 minutes, he was amazing. He was doing his weird hocus-pocus BS where he inexplicably spins out of sacks and finds receivers deep downfield. His first posssession was a thing of beauty, as he held control of the ball for 6:54 and eventually found "

Even though the Texans lost and their season is over, the silver lining is that they may just have something with Keenum.    Andre Johnson has to be thrilled with Keenum. Whereas Matt Schaub was scared to take shots downfield, Keenum had no concerns airing it out. Johnson, who didn't score a touchdown all year going into this contest, hauled in 3 touchdowns in addition to 9 catches for 229 yards. However, Johnson couldn't come up with an important third-down catch in the 4.h quarter, as he bobbled the ball out of bounds along the sideline. Instead of the chains being moved, Houston had to punt, ultimately leading to Indianapolis' decisive touchdown.    "

   "comment":"Romo and company enough to limit the defensive coordinator's old team to just 9 first downs. Drew Brees was absolutely unstoppable. He went 34-of-41 for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns, putting together a stretch in which he completed 19 consecutive passes. It helped that the Cowboys lost a couple of defensive starters to injury in this contest, including Sean Lee (hamstring), but Brees was hot even before several Dallas players were sidelined. Lee's absence had no bearing on the result of this game, but it did play a huge factor in allowing the Saints to set that single-game record for first downs.    With the Saints so far ahead, the Cowboys couldn't expose New Orleans' greatest weakness, which happens to be the run defense. DeMarco Murray had great success against New Orleans in the first half, rushing for 80 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, but was given the ball just 5 times following intermission. He ultimately finished with 89 yards and the score on 16 tries.    The Cowboys couldn't run the ball in the second half, but that didn't have much of an impact on Romo because he was just 3-of-9 for 20 yards in the opening half. He simply had no success against the Saints' improved pass rush and aerial defense, as Ryan had a perfect game plan for his former quarterback. Romo would end up going 10-of-24 for 128 yards and a touchdown. He was lucky to get away with a couple of interceptions. Romo's sole score went to "

   "comment":"Romo came through in the clutch. No, really. He's done that before. His issues, over the years, have been in Week 17 and beyond. It's not Week 17 yet.    The Cowboys needed a win to keep pace in the NFC East, and Tony Romo came through with a clutch drive to get Dallas out of New Jersey with a win. In the weak NFC East, the Giants could start to entertain getting back into the playoff race, but this was a crushing loss to those hopes. In full disclosure, the first quarter wasn't seen as FOX showed the end of the Packers and Vikings games. During that time, Dallas got on the board with a fumble return for a touchdown by "

   "comment":"Romo led a last-second, game-winning drive against the Giants this past Sunday. This week, he had to engineer a double-digit comeback to help his team achieve another victory. The Cowboys are now 7-5 and have temporarily established sole possession of first place in the NFC East. Things did not look promising for the Cowboys in the early stages of this game. Terrance Williams fumbled a kickoff that was returned for a touchdown. The defense then couldn't stop a Matt McGloin-to-Andre Holmes connection, while their only points came off a botched snap by the Raiders inside their own 10, which prompted Phil Simms to remark, Matt McGloin pulled out a little quick. Somewhere, Matt Millen was watching the game and smiling. Romo had just 69 passing yards entering the final drive of the first half, trailing 21-7. He couldn't get anything going with "

However, Dallas, down 23-14 in the 4.h quarter, engineered a last-minute surge of its own to keep its season alive. Save for an interception he made because of a bad decision, Romo was awesome in the second half. While he finished 17-of-27 for 226 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick, he was 12-of-18 for 164 yards, 1 score and an interception following the break. Romo did this despite suffering some sort of leg/back injury on an attempted spin move. Romo could barely move at times, yet he still led his team from behind. However, despite this win, we've seen this from the Cowboys before. It's not like Romo hasn't orchestrated 4.h-quarter comebacks before. He also played well last December. His problem has always been in Week 17 and beyond. He'll have a chance to win the division with a win over the Eagles in front of his home crowd next week.    Romo's 2 scores went to "

   "comment":"Romo, meanwhile, went 19-of-29 for 176 yards and a touchdown. It appeared as though he'd have a rough afternoon early on. He took a sack from Jurrell Casey and saw Bryant leave the game with an injury. However, Bryant quickly returned, and Romo didn't need to do much because his team had the lead the entire afternoon, while Murray was breaking off big chunks of yardage on almost every carry. Despite Romo's meager yardage, Bryant still had a big afternoon. He saw 14 targets, catching 10 balls for 103 yards and a touchdown. "

With the crowd going crazy, as usual, it appeared as though Seattle would run away with an easy victory. And then something strange happened - Pete Carroll and his coaching staff forgot that they had Marshawn Lynch. Facing the NFL's worst run defense, the Seahawks were expected to pound the ball early and often against Dallas, but they did the exact opposite. Lynch was given just 2 carries in the opening half, which was just mind-boggling. The Seahawks didn't have nearly as much success passing the ball, which allowed the Cowboys to maintain possession and limit Seattle's time on offense, effectively mimicking what the Chargers did in their Week 2 victory over Seattle. The Cowboys won the time of possession by 15 minutes, leaving many of the players frustrated. Doug Baldwin was even heard yelling at Wilson at the end of regulation and then sounded off to the media, complaining that his teammates were slacking off in meetings and practice. Perhaps he was referring to Lynch, who was seen laughing on the sideline as time expired. Lynch might have been cracking up at his team's atrocious game plan.    Romo, who legitimately looked done after the first-quarter hit, finished 21-of-32 for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns. He moved the chains mostly with short throws to his running backs. The Seahawks were so concerned about deep balls to "

In the past, Dallas had always begun hot but withered away in the final week of the year. This game looked like it was going to epitomize all of the Cowboys' late-season failures. The Cowboys, however, took control. They reestablished the lead with a great drive, and thanks to several Philadelphia turnovers, they were able to prevail with a 38-27 victory.    Romo, as mentioned, was exceptional. He had a sequence in the middle of the game in which he had some consecutive drives that went nowhere, 1 of which featured a fumble of his because he held on to the ball for an eternity. However, he went on a tear once the Eagles went in front, completing 8-of-11 attempts for 114 yards and a touchdown following the break. Romo's final numbers were 22-of-31 for 265 yards, 3 touchdowns and a lost fumble. He was nearly picked early, but he torched Philadelphia's beleaguered secondary all evening. "

With this victory, as well as Philadelphia's inexplicable loss to Washington, the Cowboys were able to clinch their division. They might even have a chance at the No. 1 seed depending on what occurs next week, so they won't be resting their starters against the Redskins.    Romo was near-perfect. He misfired just twice, though 1 of those passes was a dropped pick-six in the second half. Still, Romo was an impressive 18-of-20 for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Colts, who have struggled against elite quarterbacks this year, had absolutely no answer for him.    The big, non-playoff-related story entering this game, of course, was DeMarco Murray's status off hand surgery. Murray didn't look all that great outside of an 11-yard run, tallying 58 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He seemed to be favoring his surgically repaired hand at times, and when the Cowboys went up 14-0, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms wondered if the coaching staff would sit Murray. That did not happen, as Murray played into the second half, which I thought was pretty foolish. Murray didn't suffer a setback, but he easily could have, and he would've done so senselessly because Dallas had the game in hand. Besides, "

   "comment":"Romo era, and the first overall since 2009, albeit amid officiating controversy. All everyone is talking about is a call made in the middle of the 4.h quarter. The Lions were driving past midfield, when Matthew Stafford fired a pass toward Brandon Pettigrew. The tight end was clearly interfered with by linebacker Anthony Hitchens, as the 2 announcers plus Mike Pereira pointed out. The flag was thrown, and official Pete Morelli announced that there was pass interference. At that moment, Dez Bryant ran onto the field without his helmet on, which was going to be a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. And then the crowd began cheering. That's because Morelli told the fans that there was no flag for pass interference. He didn't give an explanation to the crowd or Jim Caldwell. He simply picked up the flag after making the initial announcement. Pereira was so flabbergasted that he was speechless. There's never been anything like this in recent NFL history, and the poor Lions couldn't have done anything about it, as Morelli was likely signaled by the league office to disallow the call, given that the NFL wanted a matchup between Green Bay and Dallas next week for ratings purposes. Thus, it was no surprise that the Cowboys got all of the penalties from that point on. Following a 10-yard shank by the punter, Dallas drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown, with the assistance of 2 crucial defensive flags that kept the possession alive. I hope the league compensates the Lions in some way because they were epically screwed by some of the worst officiating in NFL history. Detroit should've had the ball on the Dallas 19-yard line with the potential to go up 2 scores; instead, all a teary-eyed Caldwell could do was mutter not good enough during the post-game press conference.    I suppose Romo deserves some credit for that game-winning drive. He got a ton of help from the officials and the league office, but he didn't choke for a change. The forces around him didn't allow him to gag, but he still played fairly well when he needed to. He finished 19-of-31 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns despite the fact that he was sacked 6 times. "

   "comment":"Romo broke his clavicle while being sacked and fumbling in the third quarter. At first, it seemed as though he could be out for the season, but the most-recent report says that he'll miss 8 weeks. There's no question that this is a huge blow for Dallas' chances. Brandon Weeden was fine in relief, but the disparity between the 2 quarterbacks is immeasurable. For more on how this affects the Cowboys, check out my NFL Disaster Ratings. The injury is a shame, especially since Romo had played well overall prior to getting hurt. Despite missing Dez Bryant, Romo finished 18-of-27 for 195 yards and the lost fumble, but his numbers could've been much better. Romo missed out on a touchdown to "
