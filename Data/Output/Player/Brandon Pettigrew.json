It'll be a shame if Stafford is out for a while because he just had a great performance, going 26-of-43 for 422 yards, 5 touchdowns and 2 picks. After that 5-interception debaclation at Seattle, Stafford has turned it around the past 2 weeks. The good news is that the injury was to his non-throwing shoulder.    Stafford's 5 scores all went to different targets: Calvin Johnson (7 catches, 161 yards), Brandon Pettigrew (6 catches, 72 yards), Aaron Brown, Will Heller and Kevin Smith."

   "comment":"Pettigrew catching 3 balls for 20 yards.    Tony Romo was red hot in the first half. He hooked up with Dez Bryant for a 25-yard touchdown on Dallas first possession. Bryant caught the pass right over the head of Lions cornerback Chris Houston. Romo continued to drive that ball down the field on the Lions' second possession. The Cowboys offensive line was doing a very good job of blocking the Lion defensive line. Romo had time to throw, and they were getting some good runs out of Felix Jones and Tashard Choice. The Cowboys were stopped on the goal line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-goal. Jones was stuffed at the line by Lions linebacker Ashlee Palmer, and Detroit took over. Passing up on 3 points would come back to hurt the Cowboys. Romo attacked Houston again with a 44-yard pass to Laurent Robinson that got the Cowboys all the way to the Lions' 6-yard line. On the next play, Romo threw a pass up to Bryant who grabbed the ball and fought off cornerback Eric Wright in the front of the end zone. Following that, Romo led a field goal drive midway through the second quarter and just before halftime for a 20-3 halftime lead. Romo picked apart the Detroit defense, completing 19-of-24 passes for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jones ran for 37 yards on 10 carries. Robinson paced Dallas in receiving with 4 receptions for 85 yards. Bryant had 2 catches for 37 yards and 2 scores.    At the beginning of the third quarter, Romo didn't miss a beat as he moved the ball downfield and hit tight end Jason Witten for a 1-yard touchdown. With the Lions up 27-3, Romo breathed some life into a Lion defense that was bleeding yards and points. Romo threw a terrible pass short of his receiver, and it was intercepted by Lions linebacker Bobby Carpenter. The former Cowboy first-round pick cut in front of a receiver around the 35-yard line. He zig-zagged his way downfield and returned the interception for a touchdown. The next possession was, as Yogi Berra would say, deja vu all over again. Romo threw a slant pass toward Robinson, but it was off the mark. Houston out-fought Robinson for the ball and made the interception. Houston raced down the sideline 56 yards and dodged a few potential tackles for a touchdown. Romo was aided by a dumb facemask penalty on Ndamukong Suh. The Lions kept Suh blocked for most of the game, but Suh hit Romo hard with a hand to the face of Romo. It turned an incompletion on a third down to a first down around midfield. Romo's next play was a 37-yard pass to Witten. That led to a field goal and a 30-17 lead. After the Lion defense got Stafford back in the game, he returned the favor in the fourth quarter when he finally got the ball into the end zone. Stafford threw a jump ball in the end zone for Johnson, and Megatron out leaped 2 defenders to come down with a 23-yard touchdown catch. After a 3-and-out, the Lions moved the ball, but sloppy play and penalties forced Detroit to settle for a field goal to make it a 3-point game. Detroit put up 10 more points to narrow it to 30-27. With just over 4 minutes remaining, Romo was pressured by Suh. He tossed a ball up for Witten that was short of his tight end. Linebacker Stephen Tulloch tipped the ball to himself and secured a huge interception for Detroit. The Lions made Romo pay and took the lead. Some good passes from Stafford to Johnson and hard runs by Best, moved the ball inside the 5-yard line. Stafford finished the drive with a fade pass to Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown toss. Romo didn't have a comeback in him, and Detroit improved to 4-0 for the first time since 1980. Dallas fell to 2-2.    Stafford ended the game 21-of-43 for 240 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Johnson had 8 receptions for 96 yards and 2 scores. Pettigrew caught 6 for 64. Best ran for 47 yards on 11 carries.    Robinson led the Cowboys in receiving with 7 receptions for 116 yards. Witten had 7 catches for 94 yards with 1 score, while Bryant had 3 catches for 37 yards and 2 scores. Jones ran for 57 yards on 16 carries.    For the game, Romo finished 34-of-47 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Lions could not have made their comeback win without Romo's 2 pick-sixes and final interception. It was a terrible meltdown performance from the Cowboys signal-caller. Romo turns 32 next April, so next offseason may be time for Dallas to think of the long-term future at the position. His performance against the Lions and Jets this season have to make them start pondering that.   "

Whatever works, right? Those key plays helped them take the lead 12-10. After a quick San Francisco punt opened the second half, Detroit drove for a field goal on a march fueled by consecutive passes to Jahvid Best (6 receptions for 73 yards) covering 53 yards.

   "comment":"Pettigrew, who was covered closely by linebacker Nile Diggs, for a 7-yard touchdown. Detroit's defense was playing well, while the Lions' offense was finding massive openings in the Chargers' zone coverage. Stafford converted a 3rd-and-19 with a 30-yard pass to Nate Burleson to the San Diego 3-yard line. A play later, Stafford tossed a short touchdown pass to Kevin Smith. Just before halftime, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 14-yard score. The first half ended with the Detroit up 24-0. It was utter domination on both sides of the ball by the Lions. The Chargers' offense couldn't get into any rhythm. The line was allowing some pressure while the receivers weren't getting open for Philip Rivers. San Diego's pass rush stank, and Stafford had good time to throw all afternoon. The Chargers' secondary was pitiful with receivers running wide open constantly. Apparently, Norv Turner turned over a table or 2 in the locker room, because the Chargers played with better execution and a sense of urgency in the third quarter. Their offense was finally able to move down the field. A beautiful 1-handed catch by Antonio Gates was called back by a penalty, but Rivers kept advancing the ball. He finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. San Diego then caught the Lions' special teams napping with an onside kick that was recovered by Eric Weddle. Rivers hit Floyd for a gain of 30 to the Detroit 3-yard line after he beat Chris Houston running downfield. Houston bounced back to break up a pass in the end zone on third-and-goal so the Chargers had to settle for a field goal. The Lions answered by moving the ball down the field and Smith running into the end zone from 6 yards out. Detroit was up 31-10 entering the fourth quarter. San Diego followed up with another promising drive, moving the ball down the field. However, Houston had another good pass breakup in the end zone. The Lions' stand forced a fourth-and-goal from the 3 that fell incomplete. Houston would kill another drive by intercepting a jump ball at the goal line. He returned it 43 yards and the pick sealed the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished the afternoon 29-of-36 for 373 yards and 3 touchdowns. Pettigrew (9-80), Johnson (4-102) and Nate Burleson (6-83) all had good games. For San Diego, Rivers completed 28-of-53 passes for 299 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Floyd (6-95) led the Chargers in receiving with Gates (4-40) contributing. He became the franchise's all-time receptions leader in this loss, passing Charlie Joiner.    It was a huge win for the Lions as they clinched their first playoff appearance since 1999. Congratulations to the long-suffering Lions fans who finally get to see their team play in the postseason after a long drought.   "

   "comment":"Pettigrew had multiple drops, including 1 in the end zone. Titus Young dropped a potential first-down catch on a third down. Even Calvin Johnson had 2 drops, including a potential touchdown. Meanwhile, Mikel Leshoure lost a fumble and Matthew Stafford should have thrown an interception, but rookie safety Harrison Smith dropped the ball. Ser Stafford finished 30-of-51 for 319 yards. As mentioned, drops wiped out a touchdown and an interception. It's worth noting that he was able to get a 56-yard pass-interference flag on an attempt to Johnson.    Megatron totaled just 5 catches for 54 yards, but had that long pass-interference flag, as just mentioned. He also nearly caught a touchdown, but Harrison Smith dislodged the ball with a great hit. Detroit's 2 leading receivers were Pettigrew (7-67) and Joique Bell (6-72)."

   "comment":"Pettigrew (3-31) and Bush, whose 8 catches for 30 receiving yards complemented his 92 rushing yards and touchdown on 21 carries. Bush wasn't perfect though; in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble, he also dropped a pass, which has been a problem for him this year.    As for the Cowboys' offense, they had to rely on big plays to score in this contest. They had trouble sustaining drives - 3-of-13 on third downs - because Detroit put immense pressure on Romo. It seemed like he was being blasted on almost every single attempt, which would explain why he was only able to complete half of his passes. He went 14-of-30 for 206 yards and 3 touchdowns. Two of Romo's scores went to Bryant (3-72), who broke free with a 50-yard scamper along the sidelines and also had a David Tyree-esque catch in which he pinned the ball to the side of his helmet. "
