He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage.

A bit more on Pryor: He has unbelievable athleticism and will eat up inept defenses that aren't prepared for him. He made some clutch plays in this contest, including 1 4th-and-9 conversion in the final quarter. However, there were some mental mistakes. He had to waste a timeout and later was whistled for delay of game inside the Indianapolis 5-yard line. He also can't read defenses, so coordinators who have talent to work with will befuddle him.
