The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by Matt Giordano on third down, blowing a chance to take the lead. The long return of the pick set up the Raiders, but the Chiefs quickly forced third down, and Palmer (16-of-26, 237 yards, TD, 2 INTs) squandered a potential long field-goal attempt opportunity by tossing an interception to Javier Arenas. Starting at the 2.minute warning, Kansas City again moved the ball with double-digit yardage passes to rookie wide receiver Jonathan Baldwin, Dwayne Bowe and tight end Leonard Pope. Let me backtrack for a moment though, because prior to the Pope gain, the Chiefs were at the the Raiders' 23-yard line. I was thinking field goal, but interim head coach Romeo Crennel was thinking touchdown. Orton threw incomplete and was flagged for grounding (loss of 11 yards). Flags for delay of game and false start seemingly put them out of scoring range, but the pass to Pope salvaged a Succop attempt. Richard Seymour blocked it and the game went to half at 3-3. Remember what I said about big plays? Early in the second half, Oakland's defense forced a quick punt and drove the Raiders drove their way towards midfield. A holding penalty backed them up, but Palmer went deep to Moore for a 61-yard touchdown that changed the complexion of the game. Staked to a 10-3 lead, Oakland's defense was in bend but don't break mode the rest of the afternoon, taking advantage of an offense unable to finish drives. Kansas City's next possession was highlighted by a 43-yard pass to "

The Saints were actually whistled for 11 infractions, which makes me wonder how lopsided this could have been had they taken Oakland completely seriously.    Palmer had a solid fantasy day, going 22-of-40 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned couple of picks. His scores went to Brandon Myers (6-55) and Juron Criner (3-23).    Marcel Reece was the Raiders' most effective offensive player. Not only did he rush for 103 yards on just 19 carries, but he led the team in receiving, snagging 4 balls for 90 yards. His only blemish was getting stuffed at the goal line in the first half.    On the other end of the spectrum, Denarius Moore was a major disappointment with just a mere 9-yard catch. "

Pryor later had a similar play for 20 yards to Brice Butler to convert a crucial third-and-14 in the final quarter. Pryor went on to finish 18-of-23 for 221 yards and the pair of scores to go along with 11 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. He also should've thrown a third touchdown, but Moore stepped out of bounds prior to catching the ball. Pryor's only real blemish was when he fumbled the ball trying to desperately do something while wrapped up in a sack. He's fortunate that 1 of his teammates recovered the ball.    As mentioned, Moore (5-84) and Streater (3-56) caught the touchdowns. "

On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure. Smith then had a chance to be more comfortable, so he settled for more checkdowns, which is what he usually does anyway. As a consequence, Moore opened things up with a sack by beating Eric Fisher, who should not be starting because of performance issues. Alex Smith was brought down 3 times in the first quarter alone. However, the Chiefs cleaned things up after that. The Raiders, however, never fixed their blocking woes. Terrelle Pryor took a whopping 10 sacks (including 3.5 from Tamba Hali), which is remarkable considering how mobile he is. I can only imagine how high that number would be if Pryor couldn't move around so well. Having said that, Pryor himself was a big reason Oakland allowed so many sacks. The Raiders had a terrible habit of breaking the huddle super late. Pryor would then go under center and snap the ball right away, not even looking at the defense despite the fact that Kansas City was giving him complicated looks the entire afternoon. This is the same type of lethargic quarterbacking that Cam Newton is often guilty of. For Pryor to progress, he'll need to develop the mental aspect of his game, or dominant defenses will continue to crush him. Pryor finished 18-of-34 for 216 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions along with 6 scrambles for 60 rushing yards. He was absolutely atrocious after halftime. Kansas City made the appropriate adjustments and limited the first-year starter to 11-of-23 for 116 yards and 3 picks (with 13 rushing yards off 2 carries) following the break.    Darren McFadden was a surprise start because he was expected to rest until after the team's bye. He did what he could versus Kansas City, mustering 52 yards on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 31 receiving yards.    Pryor's lone score was thrown to Denarius Moore (5-82). This is the silver lining in the Raiders' loss, as the connection between Pryor and Moore continues to strengthen.    On the other side, Alex Smith failed to complete half of his passes, going 14-of-31 for 128 yards. Most of his incompletions came in the first half (7-of-19) and were the result of pressure.
