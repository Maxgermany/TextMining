The following 2 notes are from Wraith: <i> - I would like to say that if I ever have to see a Bills 2.minute drill ever again, I am going to vomit. The Bills, with 55 seconds remaining in the first half, were trying to drive as they were down 21-17, by throwing 4-6 yard patterns. It was the most conservative play-calling ever. - I must say I was confused about 1 thing. How was Adam Sandler watching the game from the stands AND playing quarterback for the Bills? Did he clone himself, or is he able to do 2 things at once? </i>   "

As for Matt Cassel, he wasn't even named the starter until minutes before kickoff. He started poorly, but finished pretty decently (15-29, 184 yards, TD, INT), but you could see that the appendectomy affected him once in a while. Cassel seemed to hesitate to run on several occasions, though he did scramble 6 times.    The Chiefs generated 210 rushing yards, thanks to a late 80-yard burst from Jamaal Charles. Charles finished with 126 yards and a score on 11 attempts. Thomas Jones (22-62, TD) vultured the touchdown immediately following Charles' long gain.
