It was the most conservative play-calling ever. - I must say I was confused about 1 thing. How was Adam Sandler watching the game from the stands AND playing quarterback for the Bills?

Peyton Manning looked bored on sidelines as Chiefs ate up the clock on an 8-minute drive in the first quarter, but Kansas City couldn't convert in the red zone because of Cassel's struggles.    The Colts racked up 341 total yards of offense, but had just 19 points because they uncharacteristically struggled in the red zone.    Manning went 26-of-44 for 244 yards and an interception. Four Colts had at least 5 receptions: "

He went for it thrice on 4.h down in the first half. The first 2 attempts were successful, though the first was a questionable pass interference on "
