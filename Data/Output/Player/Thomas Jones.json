   "comment":"Jones showed flashes of his 2008 performances, accumulating 210 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Leon Washington also got into the mix, netting 99 yards on 15 attempts.

Edwards hit all 5 of his passes for 43 yards, but he missed a wide-open Terrell Owens for a potential long touchdown. That incompletion was wiped out by a Jets penalty.    Ryan Fitzpatrick replaced Edwards and led the Bills to an overtime victory. Fitzpatrick was 10-of-25 for 116 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He doesn't have much of an arm, but seemed more willing than Edwards to take a shot downfield. There's really not much of a difference between Edwards and Fitzpatrick at this point.    Marshawn Lynch once again received more touches (21) than Fred Jackson (15). Lynch's 19 carries went for 61 yards, while Jackson turned 15 rushes into 52 yards.    With Fitzpatrick under center, Lee Evans had a solid performance, catching 4 balls for 68 yards and a touchdown. Terrell Owens, meanwhile, grabbed just 3 balls for 13 yards. Owens couldn't get away from Darrelle Revis on most occasions, and on the 1 time he did, Edwards missed him for a big score.    Both teams screwed themselves late. Rian Lindell was wide right (shocker) on a 46-yard field goal at the end of regulation. The Jets won the coin toss and took the ball deep into Buffalo territory. Unfortunately, a long Jones run was nullified by a holding penalty. On the subsequent field goal attempt, there was an errant snap, so the holder had to try a pass on the botched play.

He hauled in 5 balls for 74 yards, but struggled on the ground, rushing for just 47 yards on 16 attempts.    The Chiefs gashed the poor-tackling Jaguars on the ground. Thomas Jones (20-125, TD) finally out-produced Jamaal Charles (15-71, TD)."

He started poorly, but finished pretty decently (15-29, 184 yards, TD, INT), but you could see that the appendectomy affected him once in a while. Cassel seemed to hesitate to run on several occasions, though he did scramble 6 times.    The Chiefs generated 210 rushing yards, thanks to a late 80-yard burst from Jamaal Charles. Charles finished with 126 yards and a score on 11 attempts. Thomas Jones (22-62, TD) vultured the touchdown immediately following Charles' long gain. Congratulations to Jones, by the way, who became the 25th player in league history to rush for 10,000 yards.   "
