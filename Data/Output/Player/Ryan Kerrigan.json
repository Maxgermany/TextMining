The offensive line stinks, but a capable quarterback would have taken at least half of those sacks. Henne is pure garbage and should not start another game going forward. Bradley needs to be fired if he doesn't give Bortles the nod in Week 3.    Perhaps the general manager should be axed as well for signing "
