   "comment":"Ryan Kerrigan came around the edge to hit Manning's arm and force a fumble. Brian Orakpo recovered the fumble at the Denver 19-yard line. Morris ran the ball in on a few plays to give Washington a touchdown lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Manning get pick-sixed by Hall. Demaryius Thomas (7-75) fell down and the ball floated right to Hall. He coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. Manning answered with a drive down the field that was capped off with a short touchdown run from Montee Ball (11-37). The Broncos' next drive went down to the 1-yard line. On 4.h-and-goal, Manning hit Joel Dreessen (2-9) for a touchdown to tie the game. Sav Rocca soon shanked a punt, which set up Denver at Washington's 35-yard line. The next play was a perfectly called and executed screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. He bolted down the field and weaved his way into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown. Moreno had a big game with 14 carries for 44 yards, 6 receptions for 89 yards and that score. Von Miller then made his presence felt with a strip-sack that was recovered by Derek Wolfe at the Redskins' 24-yard line. That led to a field goal. The Broncos got the ball back and were driving for more points when E.J. Biggers dropped an interception, but Jordan Pugh caught the deflection. Griffin gave it right back 2 plays later as Pierre Garcon fell down and the pass was caught by Chris Harris. Denver put the game on ice with a Demaryius Thomas 35-yard touchdown on short pass. Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to Rahim Moore for his second interception. Manning gave it right back when DeAngelo Hall ripped the ball out of the hands of Thomas for an interception. Kirk Cousins came in to finish out the game and threw a pick-six to Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Shaun Philips added an interception in garbage time.    Manning finished completing 30-of-44 for 354 yards with 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.    Griffin was 15-of-30 for 132 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions. Jordan Reed (8-90) led the Washington receivers. Pierre Garcon (7-46) and Griffin came close to some long completions, but their timing was off - in part because of the Denver pass rush.    Terrence Knighton had a sack and a lot of pressures for the Broncos. Danny Trevathan picked up 10 tackles and a forced fumble. Von Miller also played well. Wolfe had a huge sack coming up the middle.    For the first 3 quarters, the Redskins' defense played pretty well. The defenders didn't get help from their offense when they needed it, and the game spiraled out of control. Rob Jackson picked up a sack. Perry Riley (10 tackles), Ryan Kerrigan and Bacarri Rambo (9 tackles) all played well.Kerrigan came around the edge to hit Manning's arm and force a fumble. Brian Orakpo recovered the fumble at the Denver 19-yard line. Morris ran the ball in on a few plays to give Washington a touchdown lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Manning get pick-sixed by Hall. Demaryius Thomas (7-75) fell down and the ball floated right to Hall. He coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. Manning answered with a drive down the field that was capped off with a short touchdown run from Montee Ball (11-37). The Broncos' next drive went down to the 1-yard line. On 4.h-and-goal, Manning hit Joel Dreessen (2-9) for a touchdown to tie the game. Sav Rocca soon shanked a punt, which set up Denver at Washington's 35-yard line. The next play was a perfectly called and executed screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. He bolted down the field and weaved his way into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown. Moreno had a big game with 14 carries for 44 yards, 6 receptions for 89 yards and that score. Von Miller then made his presence felt with a strip-sack that was recovered by Derek Wolfe at the Redskins' 24-yard line. That led to a field goal. The Broncos got the ball back and were driving for more points when E.J. Biggers dropped an interception, but Jordan Pugh caught the deflection. Griffin gave it right back 2 plays later as Pierre Garcon fell down and the pass was caught by Chris Harris. Denver put the game on ice with a Demaryius Thomas 35-yard touchdown on short pass. Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to Rahim Moore for his second interception. Manning gave it right back when DeAngelo Hall ripped the ball out of the hands of Thomas for an interception.

   "comment":"Ryan Kerrigan. Foster (27-103) and Kerrigan. Foster (27-103) and Andre Johnson (6-93) moved the ball for a field goal drive to ice the game for Houston. The Texans' defense did the rest and slammed the door on Washington.    Griffin was 29-of-37 for 267 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. Pierre Garcon (10-77) and DeSean Jackson (8-62) were kept from making any long pass receptions. The big regret for Washington has to be not giving Morris more carries, as he had 91 yards on only 14 attempts.    You can't say enough about Watt. He was absolutely dominant with a sack, a blocked extra point, a fumble recovery, a batted pass, a tackle for a loss and a ton of pass pressures on Griffin, plus drew an intentional grounding penalty. Swearinger notched 8 tackles with a sack, forced fumble and other good blitzes for pass pressure. Linebacker Brooks Reed was very good with 5 tackles - some of them for a loss - and a sack, plus some plays in the backfield.    The Redskins' defense played well and put a lot of heat on Ryan Fitzpatrick. The Texans' starter was 14-of-22 for 206 yards and a touchdown. Jason Hatcher had a sack, while Keenan Robinson and Kerrigan played well.    Finally, Washington's special teams were a mess. Not only did that unit have the blocked punt for a touchdown, but it also committed a hilarious play on a punt return where a Redskins blocker rocked his own punt returner out of bounds to cancel out a return with plenty of room to run.
