While Jeff Triplette was the most corrupt official of the day, Pete Morelli was certainly the dumbest. It was amazing how incompetent he was in this game. He spent 10 minutes deciding whether the Cardinals had a second or a third down in the opening quarter. He actually got it wrong, and he also missed that the 49ers had 13 men on the field on 1 play. THIRTEEN! Morelli was an equal-opportunity horrible official. He eventually screwed over the 49ers, giving Arizona a free down in the second quarter for no apparent reason. Later on, he threw a flag for roughing-the-passer on Palmer when it was a completely clean tackle. The NFL needs to fire several of its officials this offseason, and Morelli has to be at the top of the list, right next to Walt Coleman and Triplette.   "
