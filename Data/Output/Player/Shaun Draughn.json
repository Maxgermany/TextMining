While Jeff Triplette was the most corrupt official of the day, Pete Morelli was certainly the dumbest. It was amazing how incompetent he was in this game. He spent 10 minutes deciding whether the Cardinals had a second or a third down in the opening quarter. He actually got it wrong, and he also missed that the 49ers had 13 men on the field on 1 play. THIRTEEN! Morelli was an equal-opportunity horrible official. He eventually screwed over the 49ers, giving Arizona a free down in the second quarter for no apparent reason. Later on, he threw a flag for roughing-the-passer on Palmer when it was a completely clean tackle. The NFL needs to fire several of its officials this offseason, and Morelli has to be at the top of the list, right next to Walt Coleman and Triplette.   "

   "comment":"Draughn did not see a carry, but he did have 5 catches for 37 yards and a touchdown. Perhaps he will get more carries moving forward if Hyde misses any more time.    Defensively, the 49ers suffered a lot of injuries. At any point, it seemed like they were missing multiple players. "

   "comment":"Draughn on a wheel route and an 11-yard run by Carlos Hyde. New England quickly tacked on another touchdown as LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5-yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the fourth quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.    The Patriots' defense had a good team effort with 4 sacks and 3 forced fumbles.   "
