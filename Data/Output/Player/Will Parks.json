   "comment":"Parks picked up the deflected ball and started to run it back to the New Orleans end zone. He made it, giving the Broncos the 25-23 lead. The play went under review, however, and on tape, it appeared that Parks had stepped out of bounds at around midfield. The officials determined that there was not enough evidence to say that Parks went out, so the ruling on the field remained unchanged. As a result, the Saints tried an onside kick, but the Broncos recovered the attempt, allowing them to run out the clock to cement the win. Personally, I thought Parks had stepped out of bounds. There were several angles where it looked like his shoe was squarely on the boundary, and I was frankly shocked that the officials did not overturn the call. Then again, it probably was more beneficial for the league to have the Broncos win, since they are considered 1 of the best teams in the AFC.    Anyway, speaking of the Broncos, they were not great on offense today, and "
