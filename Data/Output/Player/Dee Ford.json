That turnover pretty much ended any hopes for a Raiders comeback, and Ford added a 4.h down sack in garbage time.    Derek Carr was 22-of-34 for 225 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Carr was fortunate a few passes weren't picked off. Amari Cooper was excellent with 10 catches for 129 yards.    Once again, the Raiders didn't have much of a running game as they were led by DeAndre Washington (10-49) with Latavius Murray out.    Alex Smith was 19-of-22 for 224 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Jeremy Maclin led the Chiefs in receiving with 3 receptions for 49 yards. Travis Kelce was held to 3 catches for 32 yards and wasn't targeted much.    Spencer Ware was superb, running for 131 yards and a score on 24 carries with 2 catches for 32 yards. Jamaal Charles had 9 carries for 33 yards with a score and 2 receptions for 14 yards.    Defensively, Karl Joseph played well for the Raiders with 9 tackles. Oakland's Khalil Mack beat Eric Fisher for a sack and added 7 tackles. For the Chiefs, Derrick Johnson was very good with 9 tackles and Dee Ford added 2 sacks.
