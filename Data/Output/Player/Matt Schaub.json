   "comment":"Schaub. He finally plays a defense not considered to be among the NFL's elite, and his valiant effort was wasted because Houston's defense couldn't force Jacksonville into a punt in the second half. The Texans managed just 1 sack on David Garrard. Good job solidifying your pass rush this offseason, Houston.    I've been on Garrard's case for not being able to produce a solid performance this year, which includes the preseason. Well, Jaguar fans should be thrilled with how he played on Sunday. Garrard was 23-of-32, 236 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed 7 times for 41 yards and a score.    Coke-Free Matt Jones continues to impress. Jones was Jacksonville's top statistical wideout, catching 5 balls for 71 yards and a score. Mike Walker also caught 5 passes for 46 yards. Marcedes Lewis, meanwhile, dropped 4 passes.    While Houston couldn't stop the pass to save its life, it actually somehow stopped the run pretty well, limiting Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor to 57 combined yards on 17 rushes.    I mentioned Schaub earlier. He was 29-of-40 for 307 yards and 3 touchdowns, and probably could have led Houston to a victory if the team won the overtime coin flip.    Despite Schaub's brilliant performance, "

   "comment":"Schaub was on fire, starting 9-of-9 for 106 yards and a score. The defense intercepted Peyton Manning twice. Everything was going Houston's way. That said, I never had any doubt that the Colts would win. I'll never forget that Sage Rosencopter game last year where Houston blew a huge lead with 5 minutes to go. The Texans always choke, and Manning always pulls through. I had to resort to praying that Houston would hold on and cover to preserve my half unit. My prayers were not answered.    Schaub was really hot at the beginning of the game, but fizzled out, finishing 31-of-42 for 284 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions and a big lost fumble. His second score and some of his yardage came in junk time when the Texans fell behind 35-20.    "

It really looked like Houston was about to take the next step. - But as usual, the Texans withered down the stretch, choking for what seems like the billionth time in franchise history. Suddenly, Brees was the quarterback who couldn't be stopped (31-44, 370, 3 TDs, 2 INTs). Schaub also tossed a horrible 4.h-quarter pick with the lead. There's no excuse for that. In my 2011 Houston Texans season preview, I expressed concern with Schaub being able to perform in the clutch, listing his awful 4.h-quarter and overtime numbers when the game is close. Well, it appears as though nothing has changed. Well, scratch that. The Colts are a non-factor, so maybe the Texans can sneak into the playoffs by winning an awful AFC South. Maybe...

Jacksonville will be better defensively once it gets several of its key players back (linebacker Daryl Smith, cornerback Derek Cox), but Gabbert simply doesn't give this team a chance to win. Gene Smith needs to be fired for taking a homoclitic approach to his quarterbacking situation this offseason.    The Texans had a really clean game, but screwed up just before halftime. They didn't have any timeouts, and the clock was ticking down on what would have been a 4th-and-5. Gary Kubiak hesitated in terms of making his decision, and by the time he called the play in to Schaub, it was too late. The play clock expired, and Houston was whistled for a delay of game. This sort of sloppiness needs to be cleaned up if Houston wants to make a deep playoff run.    Some fantasy players of note: - "

   "comment":"Schaub, meanwhile, went 23-of-37 for 256 yards and a couple of scores. After the Texans went up by double digits, the Ravens looked like they were sleepwalking. The only player showing any sort of effort was Suggs, who was all over the place. He even had some decent stints in pass coverage. I have no idea how he performed so well just 6 months after tearing his Achilles. The Ravens may have actually been competitive if the other players showed the same sort of heart that Suggs did.    Schaub's touchdowns went to Kevin Walter (4-74) and Owen Daniels (7-59)."

Of course, you can't really blame the Bills for getting tricked like that, as Foster couldn't stopped all afternoon. He rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries.    Schaub, as usual, utilized play-action fakes beautifully. He went 19-of-27 for 268 yards and 2 scores to Daniels (4-62) and reserve tight end Garett Graham. "

One of the picks seemed to go back for a touchdown, courtesy of Tim Jennings, but after a review, it was ruled that Jennings was (barely) down by contact. It was close; the call could have gone either way.    Andre Johnson had more than a third of Schaub's yardage, which normally would be good enough for a solid fantasy performance, but not in this contest. Johnson had just 4 catches for 35 yards.

Schaub seldom looked downfield, as it appeared that he didn't trust his pass protection; stud left tackle Duane Brown was out of the lineup. Schaub was sacked 3 times and was able to convert only 3-of-12 third-down attempts. Given that Schaub was 10.ative in the pocket, it should be no surprise that the Texans didn't have many big gains.

   "comment":"Schaub. He's played poorly recently, but he has gone up against a barrage of stout defenses. Besides, what else could Houston possibly do? Neither T.J. Yates nor Case Keenum could give Houston a realistic shot of advancing deep into the playoffs. Schaub doesn't exactly have the greatest postseason history himself, but he's the best quarterback on the roster. Well, watching the first half, I changed my mind. Schaub didn't even play poorly or anything - he was 11-of-14 for 153 yards prior to intermission - but he had such horrible body language that it looked like he was negatively impacting his teammates. As the Texans continued to kill themselves with mistakes, all Schaub did was pull on defenders' legs (he literally did this when he was on the ground), shake his head and appear as if he wanted to cry. I was going to argue that Yates should replace Schaub - and that's exactly what happened, but not because of a coach's decision. Schaub injured his leg in the third quarter and had to leave the game. The crowd cheered while he was on the ground, which infuriated the players afterward. Yates then ran onto the field to a standing ovation - but that was very short-lived because Yates fired an interception in the red zone, which was taken back for a touchdown. It was the fifth time in as many games that Houston had been guilty of a pick-six. Yates then proceeded to heave a second interception. While Schaub went 15-of-21 for 186 yards, Yates was 12-of-17 for 91 yards and the 2 picks. So, umm... Case Keenum?    I mentioned earlier that the Texans repeatedly shot themselves in the foot. It was terrible. Despite outgaining St. Louis by intermission, 248-115, the Texans were losing because of a lost fumble in the red zone by "

Keenum struggled with his accuracy throughout, but the Texans should have kept him in the game, not only to ensure defeat; but to also make sure that they know what they have in Keenum going forward. Playing Schaub was very pointless and almost extremely harmful. Schaub went 17-of-29 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad pick at the very end.    Some players stood out: - "

   "comment":"Schaub dropped an errant snap. After recovering the ball, the veteran threw 1 of his telegraphed passes for an interception to Tashaun Gipson. Gipson returned the ball to midfield, and the Browns turned the big play into a field goal. Cleveland added 2 more field goal drives in the first half, but paid the price after tight end Jordan Cameron took a hard hit to the head and went into the locker room with the training staff. He didn't return to the game, and his status going forward looks questionable. The Raiders got a drive going with a beautiful 21-yard, 1.handed reception by Mychal Rivera (7-83) to set up a Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Carr moved the ball again for 3 with a perfect strike for a 30-yard gain to Andre Holmes, who got open against Justin Gilbert. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-34) made an awesome 1.handed, back-shoulder reception to give Janikowski an easy 38-yarder. The Browns took a 9-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Carr had a nice drive going with accurate passes to a variety of receivers, but at the 20-yard line, Darren McFadden (12-59 rushing, 4-26 receiving) fumbled the ball after getting blasted by Donte Whitner. Joe Haden caught the fumble in the air and returned it to midfield. On the next play, Brian Hoyer hit a 32-yard pass to Andrew Hawkins. Hoyer then hit tight end Jim Dray for 16 yards to the 5. Hoyer finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Hawkins (7-88). To clinch the win, Austin Howard was knocked back into Carr, who fumbled the ball away. Barkevious Mingo recovered at Oakland's 9-yard line. Ben Tate (15-26) scored to put the game on ice for Cleveland. In the final seconds of the game, Carr threw a short touchdown pass to Holmes (5-69), as he powered through Gilbert for 6.    Hoyer finished 19-of-28 for 275 yards with a touchdown. The Browns really never got into a groove offensively, as they had only 39 yards rushing.    The Browns' defense was the real star of the game. Haden has been criticized for his play this season, but he had a bounce-back performance against Oakland. Haden had 2 impressive pass breakups in the 4.h quarter. He led Cleveland with 9 tackles. Paul Kruger had his best game as a Brown with 3 sacks and a forced fumble. Whitner (8 tackles), Dansby (8 tackles) and Gipson all played well for the Browns.    Carr completed 34-of-54 for 328 yards with a touchdown. He made some nice passes, but his fumble, McFadden's turnover and Schaub's interception killed the Raiders' offense.    Oakland's defense actually played well for a change, but the turnovers put the stop unit in impossible situations. "

Carr was able to reenter the game after the stoppage. Instead of an inevitable pick-six - Schaub seemed poised to throw 1 - the Raiders were able to preserve the field goal.    Oakland's leading receiver was Thompkins, who caught 5 balls for 90 yards. Only 2 other Raiders had 3 or more receptions: Holmes (3-73), who made a great, leaping catch over a defender, and Murray (3-22). "
