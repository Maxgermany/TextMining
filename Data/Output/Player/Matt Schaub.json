However, after the fumble, he didn't receive a single touch. So much for Gary Kubiak getting a close look at Foster. Instead, Ryan Moats received the majority of the work, taking 13 rushes for 46 yards.    Matt Schaub played well, going 28-of-40, 367 yards and a touchdown. More than half of that yardage went to "

   "comment":"Matt Schaub barely had to throw the ball. Schaub was just 9-of-17 for 107 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception to the chagrin of fantasy owners everywhere. Andre Johnson consequently did nothing either, hauling in just 3 balls for 33 yards.    Owen Daniels, by the way, had only 1 catch for 9 receptions, though this was expected considering that he was coming off a knee injury. He'll be more of a factor as the season goes on.    Peyton Manning was 40-of-57 for 433 yards and 3 touchdowns, marking the 8. time in his career that he totaled more than 400 passing yards in a contest. Most of Manning's yardage came when the game was out of hand, though it's also worth noting that Pierre Garcon screwed him over multiple times in the first half. Garcon dropped 2 passes (1 was a touchdown) and ran the wrong route on another occasion.    As you can imagine, the Indianapolis receivers posted pretty numbers: Austin Collie (10 catches, 131 yards, TD), Reggie Wayne (7-99, TD), Dallas Clark (11-80, TD), Garcon 4-75).    Joseph Addai rushed for just 44 yards on 10 carries, though he saved his fantasy day (at least in PPR leagues) with 6 catches for 29 receiving yards. Donald Brown, by the way, had just 1 touch.    This is just sad: Bob Sanders looked like he got hurt on the first Texans drive. He came back a couple of plays later, and nearly intercepted Matt Schaub in end zone. Later on, however, Sanders left the game with an elbow injury. He just can't stay healthy.   "

Schaub was sacked 3 times and was able to convert only 3-of-12 third-down attempts. Given that Schaub was 10.ative in the pocket, it should be no surprise that the Texans didn't have many big gains.

   "comment":"Matt Schaub. The latter came in and nearly led the team to victory, which would've been disastrous. As my Las Vegas Hilton partner Matvei wrote in a text to me, After ruining the season, Matt Schaub is now making a bid to ruin the Texans draft pick. Keenum struggled with his accuracy throughout, but the Texans should have kept him in the game, not only to ensure defeat; but to also make sure that they know what they have in Keenum going forward. Playing Schaub was very pointless and almost extremely harmful. Schaub went 17-of-29 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and a bad pick at the very end.    Some players stood out: - "

Carr was able to reenter the game after the stoppage. Instead of an inevitable pick-six - Schaub seemed poised to throw 1 - the Raiders were able to preserve the field goal.    Oakland's leading receiver was Thompkins, who caught 5 balls for 90 yards. Only 2 other Raiders had 3 or more receptions: Holmes (3-73), who made a great, leaping catch over a defender, and Murray (3-22). "

He's cursed, just as I am with my picks.    These 2 teams came into this game with little but pride to play for. Both had records of 4-7 and no real shot at the playoffs. The Dolphins had just canned their offensive coordinator Bill Lazor and not long before, had let their head coach go, while the Ravens lost their starting quarterback, No. 1 receiver and No. 1 running back. This game, was in fact, not ready for primetime.    These teams decided to play football anyway, and we did get to see some football. Mostly bad, but enough good to feel like you didn't just black out for 3 hours.    Ryan Tannehill threw for 86 yards in this game, and the Dolphins somehow won. This stat is largely due to the new offensive coordinator Zac Taylor, who is more of a Dan Campbell puppet than anything. Campbell wants a hard-nosed run-focused offense and tough defense, and that worked out this week.    That run-first philosophy was evident from the fact that Lamar Miller rushed for 20 times for the first time since December 1, 2013. And in the passing game, Tannehill threw the ball just 19 times. On the day, the Dolphins threw the ball 19 times and ran it 27 times. On the whole, Miami had 8 first downs and 219 total yards. That's not usually your recipe for a win, but the defense came up big.    The Dolphins' first score came in the second quarter with the game knotted up a0-0 after Reshad Jones intercepted a Matt Schaub pass deflected by defensive tackle Jordan Phillips."
