   "comment":"Matt Schaub. He finally plays a defense not considered to be among the NFL's elite, and his valiant effort was wasted because Houston's defense couldn't force Jacksonville into a punt in the second half. The Texans managed just 1 sack on Schaub. He finally plays a defense not considered to be among the NFL's elite, and his valiant effort was wasted because Houston's defense couldn't force Jacksonville into a punt in the second half. The Texans managed just 1 sack on David Garrard. Good job solidifying your pass rush this offseason, Houston.    I've been on Garrard's case for not being able to produce a solid performance this year, which includes the preseason. Well, Jaguar fans should be thrilled with how he played on Sunday. Garrard was 23-of-32, 236 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed 7 times for 41 yards and a score.    Coke-Free Matt Jones continues to impress. Jones was Jacksonville's top statistical wideout, catching 5 balls for 71 yards and a score. Mike Walker also caught 5 passes for 46 yards. Marcedes Lewis, meanwhile, dropped 4 passes.    While Houston couldn't stop the pass to save its life, it actually somehow stopped the run pretty well, limiting Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor to 57 combined yards on 17 rushes.    I mentioned Schaub earlier. He was 29-of-40 for 307 yards and 3 touchdowns, and probably could have led Houston to a victory if the team won the overtime coin flip.    Despite Schaub's brilliant performance, "

Andre Johnson consequently did nothing either, hauling in just 3 balls for 33 yards.    Owen Daniels, by the way, had only 1 catch for 9 receptions, though this was expected considering that he was coming off a knee injury. He'll be more of a factor as the season goes on.    Peyton Manning was 40-of-57 for 433 yards and 3 touchdowns, marking the 8. time in his career that he totaled more than 400 passing yards in a contest. Most of Manning's yardage came when the game was out of hand, though it's also worth noting that Pierre Garcon screwed him over multiple times in the first half. Garcon dropped 2 passes (1 was a touchdown) and ran the wrong route on another occasion.    As you can imagine, the Indianapolis receivers posted pretty numbers: Austin Collie (10 catches, 131 yards, TD), Reggie Wayne (7-99, TD), Dallas Clark (11-80, TD), Garcon 4-75).    Joseph Addai rushed for just 44 yards on 10 carries, though he saved his fantasy day (at least in PPR leagues) with 6 catches for 29 receiving yards. Donald Brown, by the way, had just 1 touch.    This is just sad: Bob Sanders looked like he got hurt on the first Texans drive. He came back a couple of plays later, and nearly intercepted Matt Schaub in end zone. Later on, however, Sanders left the game with an elbow injury. He just can't stay healthy.   Schaub barely had to throw the ball. Schaub was just 9-of-17 for 107 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception to the chagrin of fantasy owners everywhere. "

Everything started out fine for Houston. The crowd was raucous with the roof closed and rain pouring down outside. Oakland ran 3 plays and punted. The Texans then got a 20-yard rumble from "

The team never looked back. It went up 24-3 in the middle of the third quarter. At that point, the Texans were outgaining the Titans, 237-144. Tennessee didn't help its cause with numerous turnovers. Chris Johnson, who had just 51 yards on 13 carries, lost a fumble when he was trying to find a running lane that just didn't exist. The ball was forced out by J.J. Watt and returned for a touchdown by Antonio Smith - except that the official incorrectly ruled Smith down by contact. Jake Locker, meanwhile, was a disaster. His final numbers don't look too bad - 21-of-45, 309 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions - but most of those statscame late in garbage time. When Houston went up 24-3, Locker was just 8-of-24 for 96 yards, 2 picks and a lost fumble - and this was without No. 1 corner Johnathan Joseph on the other side.    Locker's score went to Kenny Britt (2-40). His leading receivers were Nate Washington (3-96) and Kendall Wright (6-78).    Meanwhile, the Texans sat on their 24-3 advantage and didn't seem interested in expanding it. Schaub finished 21-of-35 for 207 yards and 2 touchdowns. He threw just 11 passes after intermission.    Two Texans tied for the team lead with 5 receptions: "

He's played poorly recently, but he has gone up against a barrage of stout defenses. Besides, what else could Houston possibly do? Neither T.J. Yates nor Case Keenum could give Houston a realistic shot of advancing deep into the playoffs. Schaub doesn't exactly have the greatest postseason history himself, but he's the best quarterback on the roster. Well, watching the first half, I changed my mind. Schaub didn't even play poorly or anything - he was 11-of-14 for 153 yards prior to intermission - but he had such horrible body language that it looked like he was negatively impacting his teammates. As the Texans continued to kill themselves with mistakes, all Schaub did was pull on defenders' legs (he literally did this when he was on the ground), shake his head and appear as if he wanted to cry. I was going to argue that Yates should replace Schaub - and that's exactly what happened, but not because of a coach's decision. Schaub injured his leg in the third quarter and had to leave the game. The crowd cheered while he was on the ground, which infuriated the players afterward. Yates then ran onto the field to a standing ovation - but that was very short-lived because Yates fired an interception in the red zone, which was taken back for a touchdown. It was the fifth time in as many games that Houston had been guilty of a pick-six. Yates then proceeded to heave a second interception. While Schaub went 15-of-21 for 186 yards, Yates was 12-of-17 for 91 yards and the 2 picks. So, umm... Case Keenum?    I mentioned earlier that the Texans repeatedly shot themselves in the foot. It was terrible. Despite outgaining St. Louis by intermission, 248-115, the Texans were losing because of a lost fumble in the red zone by "

   "comment":"Matt Schaub dropped an errant snap. After recovering the ball, the veteran threw 1 of his telegraphed passes for an interception to Schaub dropped an errant snap. After recovering the ball, the veteran threw 1 of his telegraphed passes for an interception to Tashaun Gipson. Gipson returned the ball to midfield, and the Browns turned the big play into a field goal. Cleveland added 2 more field goal drives in the first half, but paid the price after tight end Jordan Cameron took a hard hit to the head and went into the locker room with the training staff. He didn't return to the game, and his status going forward looks questionable. The Raiders got a drive going with a beautiful 21-yard, 1.handed reception by Mychal Rivera (7-83) to set up a Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Carr moved the ball again for 3 with a perfect strike for a 30-yard gain to Andre Holmes, who got open against Justin Gilbert. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-34) made an awesome 1.handed, back-shoulder reception to give Janikowski an easy 38-yarder. The Browns took a 9-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Carr had a nice drive going with accurate passes to a variety of receivers, but at the 20-yard line, Darren McFadden (12-59 rushing, 4-26 receiving) fumbled the ball after getting blasted by Donte Whitner. Joe Haden caught the fumble in the air and returned it to midfield. On the next play, Brian Hoyer hit a 32-yard pass to Andrew Hawkins. Hoyer then hit tight end Jim Dray for 16 yards to the 5. Hoyer finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Hawkins (7-88). To clinch the win, Austin Howard was knocked back into Carr, who fumbled the ball away. Barkevious Mingo recovered at Oakland's 9-yard line. Ben Tate (15-26) scored to put the game on ice for Cleveland. In the final seconds of the game, Carr threw a short touchdown pass to Holmes (5-69), as he powered through Gilbert for 6.    Hoyer finished 19-of-28 for 275 yards with a touchdown. The Browns really never got into a groove offensively, as they had only 39 yards rushing.    The Browns' defense was the real star of the game. Haden has been criticized for his play this season, but he had a bounce-back performance against Oakland. Haden had 2 impressive pass breakups in the 4.h quarter. He led Cleveland with 9 tackles. Paul Kruger had his best game as a Brown with 3 sacks and a forced fumble. Whitner (8 tackles), Dansby (8 tackles) and Gipson all played well for the Browns.    Carr completed 34-of-54 for 328 yards with a touchdown. He made some nice passes, but his fumble, McFadden's turnover and Schaub's interception killed the Raiders' offense.    Oakland's defense actually played well for a change, but the turnovers put the stop unit in impossible situations. "
