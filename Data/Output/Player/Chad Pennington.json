Favre's arm strength was apparent in his 15-of-22 for 194 yards and 2 touchdown performance. However, he fumbled twice. That said, Favre's a huge upgrade over Chad Pennington, no matter what Laveranues Coles says."

Perhaps Miami's greatest mistake was not getting Ronnie Brown involved enough. Despite the fact that Brown averaged 4.3 yards per carry against Atlanta's pedestrian run defense, Brown was given only 10 carries. He also had just 3 receptions for 10 more yards. I understand being scared of Brown wearing down late in the year, but with games coming up against Indianapolis and San Diego, this was 1 the Dolphins had to have.    Another concern the Dolphins suddenly have is pass protection; the Falcons, not known for being able to get after the quarterback consistently, managed 4 sacks on Pennington. "
