After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9.yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan.

He moved to his left and aired the ball out into the end zone. A.J. Green was in double coverage, but the big rookie jumped over the 2 defenders to make a great 36-yard touchdown catch. Green was injured on the play and that was his only reception of the game. He was on the field on the next Cincinnati possession and ran the ball for 7 yards, but was favoring his knee. Pittsburgh's next possession saw the Bengals get opportunistic when cornerback Leon Hall intercepted a bobbled ball. That set up Cincinnati at the Steelers' 41-yard line. The Bengals had to settle for a 43-yard field goal from Mike Nugent. Just before halftime, the Steelers put together a good drive with Roethlisberger moving the ball through the air. He hit some big throws to Antonio Brown to move the ball into Cincinnati territory. A second touchdown pass to Cotchery was called back due to an offensive pass interference penalty on Miller. The Bengals' defensive line came through with their third sack of the first half on third down to force a field goal. Pittsburgh was up 17-10 at halftime. Unfortunately, Hall suffered a ruptured Achilles' 10.on against the Steelers and will miss the rest of the season. It is a devastating injury for the Bengals. He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with "

Brown had about 100 yards worth of returns nullified by those infractions. - Roethlisberger was guilty of another mistake; he was strip-sacked deep in his own territory which led to a quick Cincinnati touchdown.    The Steelers cleaned things up in the second half. Jonathan Dwyer provided some tough running with 122 yards on 17 carries, while Roethlisberger (27-of-37, 278 yards, TD, INT) did a remarkable job of converting third downs once again, moving the chains 10-of-16 tries in those instances. Big Ben's touchdown went to Miller (6-53).    Earlier, I said the Steelers were lucky. That's because the Bengals couldn't do anything offensively after an 80-yard opening drive. They had just 105 total net yards after that. A big reason for this was the injury to center "

Batch went 20-of-34 for 199 yards and the 3 picks. He had some very ugly passes, but wasn't as bad as some media members are making him out to be. Had he gotten some help from his teammates, he may have pulled off a victory.    Batch's preferred targets were Emmanuel Sanders (5-75), Heath Miller (6-63) and Rainey (4-15). Wallace caught 1 pass for 9 yards, which was the final play of the game. He was thrown to 8 times.    "

   "comment":"Miller and then nearly lofted a touchdown to Antonio Brown, who dropped the ball. Roethlisberger was unfazed by this, finishing 23-of-30 for 264 yards and a score. He took just 2 more sacks the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Roethlisberger's counterpart came into this contest with some momentum, but there were reports Sunday morning that the Jets had some concerns that he wasn't handling the accolades very well. Sure enough, Smith struggled and New York as a whole was completely out of sorts. Smith went 19-of-34 for 201 yards and 2 interceptions. He wasn't bad early on, but struggled immensely following the break (11-of-22, 140 yards, 2 INTs). He completed just 1 pass longer than 20 yards. One of his picks was brutal, as it was heaved carelessly into triple coverage. All of this shouldn't have been a surprise, by the way, as the Jets' concerns about Smith's arrogance were highly warranted. Also, it must be noted that only 2 rookie quarterbacks have beaten Dick LeBeau. The legendary defensive coordinator doesn't have the same type of talent he used to, but he can still confuse the hell out of raw signal-callers.    Both teams struggled to run the ball. Le'Veon Bell had the opportunities (16 carries) but simply couldn't find any holes behind a poor offensive line and against a stout Jet front, as he was able to muster only 34 yards, though he did chip in with 3 catches for 22 receiving yards. Bilal Powell, meanwhile, turned 9 attempts into 30 yards. He also had 3 snags for 20 yards. New York trailed for most of the way, so the coaching staff had to ask Smith to air the ball out 34 times.    The only touchdown in this contest came on a 55-yard Roethlisberger pass to Emmanuel Sanders (3-70). Meanwhile, just 2 Steelers had more than 3 receptions. Antonio Brown (9-86) had the most yardage, but as mentioned, he screwed himself out of a touchdown reception. Miller (6-84) looked good, and Big Ben has to be thrilled that his favorite security blanket is back.    "

   "comment":"Miller not converting a touchdown because he let the ball hit the ground at the last second. But Pittsburgh was blowing out Detroit, up 17-3, so it didn't seem to matter at the time. - The Steelers apparently could have used those points, as the Lions came roaring back, ultimately establishing a 7.point lead at the break, thanks to Calvin Johnson, who had mind-boggling numbers in the first half (6 catches, 179 yards, 2 touchdowns). Matthew Stafford was also on pace for a record-setting day, as he was 16-30 for 327 yards and 2 touchdowns at intermission. - I was excited to think about what sort of numbers Stafford and Megatron could compile. After all, Ike Taylor looked completely helpless trying to cover Megatron - not included in the stats were consecutive penalties on Taylor - but Johnson was remarkably held to no catches in the second half. He was targeted just 3 times, with 1 of the passes resulting in an interception on what was a desperation into double coverage. The Steelers made the proper adjustments to take Megatron out of the game, prompting Stafford to force poor throws elsewhere. Stafford was dreadful as a result, going just 3-of-16 for 35 yards and the pick after the break, though he was hurt by some drops. His final numbers (19-of-46, 362 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) were disappointing considering what he had going on at halftime. The Steelers, meanwhile, couldn't be stopped. Ben Roethlisberger, who was sharp in the first half, was even better after the break. He finished 29-of-45 for 367 yards and 4 touchdowns. He made several great throws, including a third-and-9 conversion on his own 4-yard line that eventually led to the decisive score. Roethlisberger's numbers could've been even better had his teammates not dropped a couple of touchdowns. I mentioned Miller's miscue; Antonio Brown also let a potential score slip out of his hands."

   "comment":"Miller had just 20 yards on 6 carries (his afternoon was cut short by a concussion), but Daniel Thomas did all of the damage, generating 105 yards and a score on 16 attempts.    Mike Wallace didn't do much in his return to Pittsburgh, catching 2 passes for 19 yards. He was booed following each of his receptions. Charles Clay (7-98, 2 TDs) and Brian Hartline (5-51, TD) did all of the damage against the Steeler secondary.    Despite Miami's offense playing so well, particularly after intermission, the Steelers were a couple of inches away from winning this game. They tried a Stanford Band-type play at the very end, and it nearly worked - Antonio Brown ran into the end zone to put Pittsburgh on top, pending an extra point. However, the officials correctly ruled that Brown's toes were out of bounds inside the Miami 15-yard line, nullifying what would have been 1 of the greatest plays in NFL history. Perhaps this was karma for Mike Tomlin's sideline blunder.    Ben Roethlisberger was strip-sacked early, but played well after that. He went 23-of-39 for 297 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, he had trouble with pass protection at times, as his hobbled offensive line couldn't keep Miami's fierce pass rush out of the backfield. Cameron Wake registered a pair of sacks. Roethlisberger's scores went to 3 different receivers: Brown (5-82), Jerricho Cotchery (5-63) and Emmanuel Sanders (4-62). Heath Miller was also a contributor with his 3 grabs for 56 yards.    "

   "comment":"Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated. Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with Bernard Pierce and Justin Forsett in the first half, but Pierce ended up with way more carries. Pierce gained 96 yards on 22 attempts, while Forsett managed 56 yards on just 8 tries. Most of Forsett's yardage came on 1 41-yard burst when the game was out of hand. Forsett appeared to land in the end zone, but was ruled inches short. John Harbaugh considered challenging, but opted against it. Forsett was a bigger factor in the passing game - 4 catches, 16 receiving yards - but it was disappointing to see Pierce utilized much more. It should be noted that Pierce (1 catch, 7 rec. yards) also dropped a pass.    As for the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 22-of-37 for 217 yards and a garbage-time interception off a tip by Haloti Ngata. The Ravens were able to put considerable pressure on him, which was a bit of a surprise because Andy Dalton was hit only once last week. It's not nearly all Roethlisberger's fault, but the Steelers have just 9 points in their previous 6 quarters. That's just awful. Roethlisberger targeted Antonio Brown more than anyone despite the fact that the speedy wideout missed about a quarter of action. Brown hauled in 7 balls for 90 yards. Wheaton (5-38) and Miller (4-35) also contributed.    The only Steeler offensive player who played a great full game was "

Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on "

   "comment":"Miller (6-76) for a big gain on third-and-10. However, Roethlisberger was brought down 5 times, and 1 Baltimore defender was able to hit him as he was releasing the ball, which resulted in a tipped pick by Suggs, who somehow caught the ball in between his legs. On the very next Pittsburgh drive, Suggs forced a hold that nullified a Roethlisberger touchdown to Dri Archer. Roethlisberger appeared to be concussed late in the 4.h quarter when he took a big hit, and he had to miss a few plays. Mike Tomlin put him back in, which I thought was a big mistake. Roethlisberger naturally threw an interception on the first play. Miller, meanwhile, also got knocked out with a head injury. Like Roethlisberger, he reentered the game and made an error, losing a fumble. The game was pretty much decided at that point, but Tomlin shouldn't have risked the longevity of 2 of his key players, especially considering the game was in doubt.    Antonio Brown was his usual dominant self, catching 9 of 14 targets for 117 yards. He picked up an early first down with a great spin move on "

   "comment":"Miller (2-17) and Markus Wheaton (2-16) weren't big factors. With Roethlisberger out for the foreseeable future, and Martavis Bryant returning in 2 weeks, Wheaton can be dropped in all formats.    The Steelers aren't the only team with quarterbacking issues. Despite battling 1 of the weakest secondaries in the NFL, Nick Foles was a huge disappointment. He went 19-of-28 for 197 yards and an interception, an overthrown lollipop toss that resembled a punt late in the 4.h quarter. Foles was very conservative prior to that throw, which was odd, considering the poor shape of the Ryan Shazier-less Pittsburgh stop unit. He's not worth owning in any format.    The good news for Pittsburgh is that Todd Gurley saw his first NFL action in this contest. The Steelers have a strong rush defense, however, so they were able to limit him to just 9 yards on 6 carries. Tre Mason (9-16) didn't fare any better. The Rams couldn't block for Gurley, who looked pretty 10.ative, which is understandable. Gurley will have a larger role going forward, so he's a buy-low option right now.    While Gurley is a buy-low, Kenny Britt is a sell-high. Britt secured 7 balls for 102 yards, but this is going to go down as 1 of his top performances of the season. Britt is a lethargic bum who can't be counted on, but he was robbed of a key reception at the very end of the game. Britt made a great grab to move the chains on St. Louis' final drive. His forearm was definitely under the ball, yet the incompetent officials somehow overturned it to the surprise of the 2 CBS announcers. I'd say this ended up costing the Rams a victory, but that would be a lie; I'm not sure their inept offense could've achieved another first down after that.    Aside from Britt, only 1 other Ram collected more than 18 receiving yards. That would be Tavon Austin, whose 5 receptions went for 38 yards. He should be ignored in fantasy. Lance Kendricks (2-12) was guilty of 2 key drops, 1 of which would've set up the Rams with a first down at the Pittsburgh 15-yard line.    Kendricks wasn't the only Ram making mistakes. Just take a look at St. Louis' sole red-zone sequence, which occurred early in the 4.h quarter: - Tre Mason given a carry, blown up in the backfield. - Jared Cook false started. - Foles' pass to Cook nowhere near the tight end. Cook stopped running inexplicably on the route. - Greg Robinson false started. A Robinson hold, by the way, ruined a previous promising drive. - Field goal. That's just awful. So was Jeff Fisher's decision-making. Fisher ran a fake punt on 1 occasion, which failed, and then he inexplicably punted on a 4.h-and-5 on Pittsburgh's 42 late in the third quarter. The punt went into the end zone for a net gain of just 22 yards.    This game was delayed for nearly a half hour because of a pyrotechnics accident when a blue flame torched part of the field. This was especially embarrassing, as these fireworks were unnecessary because the stadium was half-empty. Those in the stands cheered for the Steelers. A loud HEEEEEATH was heard when Miller caught a pass, and a Pittsburgh touchdown was cheered frantically. The Rams barely have any fans, and it's painfully obvious that the team needs to move back to Los Angeles. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Miller and Markus Wheaton, while feeding DeAngelo Williams, ending in a 1-yard Williams touchdown run.    That 7-0 lead expanded to 13-0 after 2 Boswell field goals, but McCarron fired back by hitting A.J. Green for a 66-yard touchdown pass to bring it to 13-7 Steelers. McCarron went on to finish the game with a decent 280 yards passing for 2 touchdowns, but 2 interceptions as well.    One of McCarron's interceptions came in the third quarter with the score 16-7. It was an extremely poor decision as he floated a pass to the sideline that was easily intercepted and returned for a touchdown by William Gay, putting the score at 23-7 Pittsburgh. And by the time McCarron threw his second touchdown, the game was already over.    Roethlisberger, despite completing 30-for-39 passes for 282 yards, did not throw a touchdown and was intercepted once. But he did look sharp all game and led his team into Bengals' territory over and over again. Williams was the beneficiary, with 2 touchdown runs, as he rushed 23 times for 76 yards and caught 2 passes for 15 more.    Heath Miller returned from his rib injury and was the chain mover all game, as he caught 10-of-10 targets for 66 yards. That's not much in yards per catch, but it is the definition of a quarterback's security blanket. That left the team's 2 most explosive players, finishing with not-so explosive numbers, with Antonio Brown totaling 87 yards and no touchdowns on 7 receptions and "
