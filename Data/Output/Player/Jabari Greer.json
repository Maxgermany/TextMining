   "comment":"Greer. Freeman threw his second red-zone interception a short time later to Rafael Bush. That turned into another Brees-led drive with a short touchdown toss to Darren Sproles (5-22 rushing, 5-21 receiving). A nice punt return by Sproles and a great catch by Jimmy Graham (5-69) set up a short touchdown to Lance Moore (4-42) with a few seconds left before halftime. The third quarter started with another Freeman interception. He threw the ball up for grabs in the deep middle of the field and safety Isa Abdul-Quddus came down with the ball. Once again, Brees made the Bucs pay with a 34-yard touchdown to Joe Morgan (2-61). Freeman threw his 4.h interception on a terrible pass into the end zone down field that was nowhere near his receiver. Greer came down with his second pick of the game. Freeman's fifth turnover came on an impressive sack-fumble by Cam Jordan that was recovered by Jordan.    Brees had it easy picking apart a terrible Bucs secondary. He completed 26-of-39 passes for 307 yards and 4 touchdowns. It was a nice bounce-back performance after 2 rough outings for the veteran signal-caller. "
