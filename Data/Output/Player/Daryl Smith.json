   "comment":"Smith, cornerback Derek Cox), but Gabbert simply doesn't give this team a chance to win. Gene Smith needs to be fired for taking a homoclitic approach to his quarterbacking situation this offseason.    The Texans had a really clean game, but screwed up just before halftime. They didn't have any timeouts, and the clock was ticking down on what would have been a 4th-and-5. Gary Kubiak hesitated in terms of making his decision, and by the time he called the play in to Schaub, it was too late. The play clock expired, and Houston was whistled for a delay of game. This sort of sloppiness needs to be cleaned up if Houston wants to make a deep playoff run.    Some fantasy players of note: - "
