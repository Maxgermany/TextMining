As for the Raiders, they showed so much promise on offense in the early stages of this contest, but they fizzled out in the second half. McGloin, who was 11-of-15 for 146 yards in the opening 2 quarters, was just 7-of-15 for 109 yards and an interception following intermission. The pick was a back-breaker, as it occurred in the red zone when McGloin underthrew his intended receiver. Had Oakland just converted a field goal there, it could have concentrated on a touchdown on its final offensive drive where the team wisely settled for a field goal once it got into "

   "comment":"Lance Dunbar and new receiver Brice Butler to injury.Dunbar and new receiver Brice Butler to injury. Lee's absence was especially huge. Missing action with a concussion, Lee had to watch a replacement linebacker get confused in coverage during the second play of overtime. C.J. Spiller took advantage of this on an 80-yard touchdown to win the game. I'd say Dallas would be leaking oil, but Hardy and McClain returning will be huge. The severity of Lee's concussion will also be key. Of course, Tony Romo's future health will determine how far the Cowboys ultimately advance. The good news is that the rest of the NFC East is 2-2 or worse.    The Saints, meanwhile, have issues of their own. Drew Brees clearly isn't 100 percent. He misfired on just 8 passes, going 33-of-41 for 359 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he doesn't have the same type of arm strength in the wake of his shoulder injury. Brees was fortunate to be battling a Dallas skeleton-crew defense that actually dropped a couple of potential interceptions. The Saints also had to rely on several illegal pick plays that weren't whistled by an incompetent officiating crew that blew calls for both teams in this contest.    Spiller ended up as New Orleans' top receiver, but prior to the game-winning score - the 400th touchdown in Brees' career, by the way - he had just 4 catches for 19 yards. He was barely a factor, so keep this in mind if you have wild ideas about plugging him into your lineup. Keep sticking with Mark Ingram instead. Ingram gained 77 yards on 17 carries to go along with 6 catches for 51 receiving yards. Ingram appeared to score a touchdown, but replay review incorrectly overturned it. Khiry Robinson vultured the end-zone trip on the very next play. Ingram also appeared to lose a fumble, but replay review worked in his favor on that occasion.    Brandin Cooks had yet another disappointing performance, catching just 4 of his 8 targets for 25 yards. Willie Snead once again out-performed Cooks, catching 6 balls for 89 yards. Snead can't be ignored any longer, and he should be added to your roster.    It's worth noting that Brees' other touchdown went to Josh Hill. Before you get too excited, Hill had just 2 catches for 11 yards. Ben Watson (3-30) outgained him.    Going back to the Cowboys, Brandon Weeden was relatively solid, but unspectacular, going 16-of-26 for 246 yards and a touchdown. He put together a great, game-tying drive with a few minutes remaining, capped off with a score to Terrance Williams, who secured the ball while diving to the ground. Williams was inefficient all evening, hauling in just 3 of his 10 targets for 49 yards, but he made it count at the end.    Amazingly, only 3 Cowboys had more than 1 target. Aside from Williams, Cole Beasley (6-62) and Jason Witten (4-57) held that distinction. The Saints struggle versus tight ends, so I was surprised that Witten didn't have a bigger performance.    Each of the 3 main Dallas running back had a long run, but none of them did much else. Dunbar led the way with 54 yards on 3 attempts, but most of that came on a 45-yarder. He was missed when he left the game. "
