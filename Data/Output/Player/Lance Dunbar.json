   "comment":"Lance Dunbar, meanwhile, spelled Murray and had even more success in terms of yardage. He tallied 82 yards on just 12 carries.    As for the Raiders, they showed so much promise on offense in the early stages of this contest, but they fizzled out in the second half. McGloin, who was 11-of-15 for 146 yards in the opening 2 quarters, was just 7-of-15 for 109 yards and an interception following intermission. The pick was a back-breaker, as it occurred in the red zone when McGloin underthrew his intended receiver. Had Oakland just converted a field goal there, it could have concentrated on a touchdown on its final offensive drive where the team wisely settled for a field goal once it got into "
