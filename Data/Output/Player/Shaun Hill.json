   "comment":"Hill was an economical 30-of-46 for 233 yards. More importantly, he refrained from turning the ball over and converted third downs (8-of-17). For that reason, San Francisco won the time-of-possession battle, 38:13 to 21:47.    Gore's replacement, DeShaun Foster, rushed for 76 yards on 18 carries. He also had 5 catches for 25 more yards. That's not bad, but Foster obviously isn't even close to as talented as Gore. The team's red zone woes would indicate that.    The Dolphins didn't have the ball all that much, so their numbers were pretty limited. For instance, Chad Pennington was 12-of-19 for 156 yards, though he threw 2 touchdowns. Davone Bess was Pennington's most-utilized receiver, and he had only 3 catches for 25 yards.    Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams pretty much split carries, for some reason. Brown gained 67 yards on just 10 rushes. Williams had 23 yards on 7 attempts.    The game ended when Joey Porter sacked Shaun Hill on a 4.h-and-10 on Miami's 21 with about a minute left in regulation. The sack pushed Porter's yearly total to 17.5.   "

You're 1 win away from ensuring that Andrew Luck won't be your franchise quarterback!    Ryan Fitzpatrick, Buffalo's beloved signal-caller, went 12-of-24 for 146 yards and a touchdown at a rainy Orchard Park. Lee Evans and Steve Johnson combined for just 5 catches.    Fred Jackson did it all. It seemed like every 5 minutes, NFL.com would have a Big Play Alert highlighting a long Jackson gain. Jackson rushed for 133 yards on 25 carries, and also caught 6 balls for 37 receiving yards. He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon. He had some passes dropped, but should have also tossed a couple more picks.    "

Jeff Fisher, who spent most of the time yelling at his players like a deranged lunatic, appeared to make a very curious choice to go with practice-squad fodder Austin Davis. However, it was later revealed that Hill endured a thigh malady. Either way, Hill didn't look too pleased. He stood on the sidelines and shook his head the entire second half. Davis went 16-of-23 for 192 yards and a pick, but most of that was against prevent. Davis didn't look like a functional quarterback. In fact, Dick Stockton, who called the game, had some fun with Davis' ineptitude, citing that he was lofting dying quails to his receivers.    Some quick numbers on St. Louis' crappy offense: - "

In all seriousness, I thought the Rams would cover this spread because it was absurdly high, but I never envisioned them actually beating the Broncos, considering all of the late-game meltdowns they've had this season. Give them credit though, as they bounced back from last week's gut-wrenching loss to the Cardinals. Having said that, it's fair to wonder if the end result would've been any different had the Broncos not lost some key personnel throughout the contest. Both Montee Ball and Julius Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when "

   "comment":"Hill drove the team down to the San Diego 4-yard line, but even though he could have settled for a field goal to send the contest into overtime, Hill forced a poor throw into the end zone that was picked off. The Chargers escaped with their 7.h victory of the season.    Both the officials and Hill spoiled a potential upset. Hill was also responsible for a San Diego touchdown, as he lost a fumble that was returned for a score. He struggled, going 18-of-35 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The Rams would probably be a top-10 NFL team if they had a legitimate quarterback. I still can't get over how ridiculous Hill's pick was. I have no idea what he or offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer were thinking.    As for Hill's counterpart, "

The Rams couldn't keep drives alive, going just 4-of-15 on third down. There were so many instances in which they had just 1 yard to go, but gave up and punted. That was the story of the game for them, as they moved the ball to the Arizona 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but had to settle for a field goal. The Rams, otherwise, made mistakes and blew opportunities. They committed their first error in the opening quarter when Tre Mason lost a fumble, setting up the Cardinals with a short field goal. They were flagged for offensive pass interference twice. They dropped 2 interceptions. They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball. They nearly had some picks themselves, but the Cardinals couldn't convert either. Shaun Hill, meanwhile, was an abomination. He went 20-of-39 for 229 yards and an interception on the final play of the game. That pick wasn't his fault, but as mentioned, he could've had several others. He had so many inaccurate passes, including at the very end, when he overthrew "

After losing 4 units to the Seahawks in Week 16, I don't think I could have lived with myself if they hadn't met expectations at home against the Rams.    Facing a tough St. Louis defense, the Seahawks did their part to land home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, thanks to some huge plays from their defense. Seattle's stop-unit came up with a touchdown, 2 interceptions and a clutch goal-line fumble to make the road to the Super Bowl run through Seattle and the 12th Man in the NFC.    The Rams got on the board first with a short field goal drive. They put tons of pressure on Russell Wilson throughout the first half, which eventually paid off with Wilson scrambling and overthrowing in the middle of the field. The ball sailed to St. Louis cornerback Marcus Roberson for the interception. However, the Seahawks' pass rush stepped up to knock St. Louis backward and get the ball back. The Rams' defense took it right back after Alec Ogletree stripped Marshawn Lynch (14-60) and T.J. McDonald recovered the fumble. Greg Zuerlein kicked a 52-yarder to produce points from that turnover. Wilson moved the ball into St. Louis' territory just before the half, but Aaron Donald sacked Wilson to knock the Seahawks out of field goal range. The Rams took 6-0 lead into the half. The Seahawks got moving in the third quarter with a great leaping grab by Paul Richardson (5-60) over Janoris Jenkins that went for 32 yards. That led to a field goal before Seattle tacked on another 3.pointer to tie the game. St. Louis started moving the ball into Seahawks territory with Shaun Hill completing a clutch third-down conversion to Jared Cook (3-37), but Seattle's defense came up with a huge play as defensive tackle Jordan Hill made a diving interception when Shaun Hill was trying to throw a screen pass into the turf because the play was covered."
