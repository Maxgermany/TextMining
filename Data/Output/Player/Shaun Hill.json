Look at the Redskins - they won back-to-back games at Dallas and Philadelphia, and they've struggled ever since. I'll discuss this in more detail later.    Speaking of Hill, I was pleased to see that he had a solid performance because I touted him in last week's USA Today Sports Weekly. Hill finished 28-of-39, 285 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick.

   "comment":"Shaun Hill was an economical 30-of-46 for 233 yards. More importantly, he refrained from turning the ball over and converted third downs (8-of-17). For that reason, San Francisco won the time-of-possession battle, 38:13 to 21:47.    Gore's replacement, DeShaun Foster, rushed for 76 yards on 18 carries. He also had 5 catches for 25 more yards. That's not bad, but Foster obviously isn't even close to as talented as Gore. The team's red zone woes would indicate that.    The Dolphins didn't have the ball all that much, so their numbers were pretty limited. For instance, Chad Pennington was 12-of-19 for 156 yards, though he threw 2 touchdowns. Davone Bess was Pennington's most-utilized receiver, and he had only 3 catches for 25 yards.    Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams pretty much split carries, for some reason. Brown gained 67 yards on just 10 rushes. Williams had 23 yards on 7 attempts.    The game ended when Joey Porter sacked Shaun Hill on a 4.h-and-10 on Miami's 21 with about a minute left in regulation. The sack pushed Porter's yearly total to 17.5.   "

   "comment":"Shaun Hill, replacing an injured Matthew Stafford, tossed a touchdown to Calvin Johnson. Detroit then recovered an onside kick, and Hill launched a Hail Mary that was answered when a crowd of players tipped the ball to Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), "

   "comment":"Shaun Hill. Maybe this result explain the second polar vortex. In all seriousness, I thought the Rams would cover this spread because it was absurdly high, but I never envisioned them actually beating the Broncos, considering all of the late-game meltdowns they've had this season. Give them credit though, as they bounced back from last week's gut-wrenching loss to the Cardinals. Having said that, it's fair to wonder if the end result would've been any different had the Broncos not lost some key personnel throughout the contest. Both Montee Ball and Julius Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were Demaryius Thomas, C.J. Anderson and Wes Welker. Thomas led the team in receiving, catching 7 passes for 103 yards. He just barely outgained Sanders, who was having a huge afternoon before going down. Sanders snagged 5 balls for 102 yards and a deep touchdown when the Rams were caught offguard on a 4.h-and-10 in the second quarter just over midfield. Welker continued to do nothing; he had just 4 receptions for 28 yards to go along with a drop. Jacob Tamme, meanwhile, took over for Julius Thomas and was highly inefficient, converting just 4 of 10 targets for 31 yards.    As for Anderson, he struggled to find running lanes against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 29 yards on 9 carries. However, he was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 8 passes for 86 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the victors didn't melt down for once. Perhaps the difference was Shaun Hill replacing the inconsistent Austin Davis. Hill had some accuracy issues early on, completing a pass to "

   "comment":"Shaun Hill drove the team down to the San Diego 4-yard line, but even though he could have settled for a field goal to send the contest into overtime, Hill forced a poor throw into the end zone that was picked off. The Chargers escaped with their 7.h victory of the season.    Both the officials and Hill spoiled a potential upset. Hill was also responsible for a San Diego touchdown, as he lost a fumble that was returned for a score. He struggled, going 18-of-35 for 198 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The Rams would probably be a top-10 NFL team if they had a legitimate quarterback. I still can't get over how ridiculous Hill's pick was. I have no idea what he or offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer were thinking.    As for Hill's counterpart, "

The Rams couldn't keep drives alive, going just 4-of-15 on third down. There were so many instances in which they had just 1 yard to go, but gave up and punted. That was the story of the game for them, as they moved the ball to the Arizona 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but had to settle for a field goal. The Rams, otherwise, made mistakes and blew opportunities. They committed their first error in the opening quarter when Tre Mason lost a fumble, setting up the Cardinals with a short field goal. They were flagged for offensive pass interference twice. They dropped 2 interceptions. They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball. They nearly had some picks themselves, but the Cardinals couldn't convert either. Shaun Hill, meanwhile, was an abomination. He went 20-of-39 for 229 yards and an interception on the final play of the game. That pick wasn't his fault, but as mentioned, he could've had several others.

   "comment":"Shaun Hill outplay Russell Wilson in the first half. Things were back to normal in the second half, however, which preserved my sanity. After losing 4 units to the Seahawks in Week 16, I don't think I could have lived with myself if they hadn't met expectations at home against the Rams.    Facing a tough St. Louis defense, the Seahawks did their part to land home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, thanks to some huge plays from their defense. Seattle's stop-unit came up with a touchdown, 2 interceptions and a clutch goal-line fumble to make the road to the Super Bowl run through Seattle and the 12th Man in the NFC.    The Rams got on the board first with a short field goal drive. They put tons of pressure on Russell Wilson throughout the first half, which eventually paid off with Wilson scrambling and overthrowing in the middle of the field. The ball sailed to St. Louis cornerback Marcus Roberson for the interception. However, the Seahawks' pass rush stepped up to knock St. Louis backward and get the ball back. The Rams' defense took it right back after Alec Ogletree stripped Marshawn Lynch (14-60) and T.J. McDonald recovered the fumble. Greg Zuerlein kicked a 52-yarder to produce points from that turnover. Wilson moved the ball into St. Louis' territory just before the half, but Aaron Donald sacked Wilson to knock the Seahawks out of field goal range. The Rams took 6-0 lead into the half. The Seahawks got moving in the third quarter with a great leaping grab by Paul Richardson (5-60) over Janoris Jenkins that went for 32 yards. That led to a field goal before Seattle tacked on another 3.pointer to tie the game. St. Louis started moving the ball into Seahawks territory with Shaun Hill completing a clutch third-down conversion to Jared Cook (3-37), but Seattle's defense came up with a huge play as defensive tackle Jordan Hill made a diving interception when Shaun Hill was trying to throw a screen pass into the turf because the play was covered."

   "comment":"Shaun Hill was very ineffective in this contest, as he would've had major problems dealing with a real defense. Hill finished 18-of-33 for 236 yards, as he only did enough to keep the Vikings from losing this game. Some may look at Minnesota's point total of 25, but the defense had 13 on 2 return touchdowns (1 missed extra point). All Hill could do was dink and dunk, which is highly discouraging, considering that the Titans have 1 of the worst secondaries in the NFL. The opportunities were definitely there for Hill. On 1 occasion, he had "
