   "comment":"Lavelle Hawkins and the 5-foot-11 wide out caught the pass over a defensive back for a 32-yard gain. It set up Tennessee at the Atlanta 4.yard line with 4 minutes left and down by 13. Locker made a good throw on third-and-goal to Washington for his second touchdown pass. Locker finished the game 9-of-19 for 140 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons' offense ran out the clock with some tough runs by Turner. Atlanta's offense played a balanced game. Turner ran for 100 yards on 21 carries with a score. Ryan was 22-of-32 for 316 yards and 1 touchdown. White led Atlanta with 7 receptions for 147 yards. It could have been an even bigger game but he dropped a couple of passes. The Falcons' defense really played well. Conversely, the Titans' offensive line played like crap. They weren't winning at the point of attack, and had only 41 yards rushing in the game. They looked very predictable for the Atlanta defense. Hawkins and the 5-foot-11 wide out caught the pass over a defensive back for a 32-yard gain.
