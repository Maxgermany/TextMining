   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers pass to Brandon Jackson bounced off of Jackson's hands and into Derrick Brooks', setting up an easy Tampa Bay touchdown. Later, a Ryan Grant fumble was returned for a score. In the second half, Rodgers suffered a shoulder injury. He sat out 2 drives, and was ineffective when he came back in. His replacement, rookie Matt Flynn, nearly threw a pick on his first throw. Flynn finished 2-of-5 for 6 yards.    With that in mind, we have to ask why the Packers didn't have a veteran backup quarterback in this situation. Flynn was completely shellshocked and unprepared to take the field. A veteran signal caller could have at least moved the chains and put Green Bay in favorable field position. Instead, the Packers were forced to punt after a 3.and-out, setting up Bryant's decisive kick.    Aaron Rodgers finished 14-of-27 for 165 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. One of the interceptions was the aforementioned Jackson gaff. Another came after Rodgers returned off his shoulder injury. Most of Rodgers' yardage went to "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers could play in this game, it really didn't matter. Green Bay's defense was abysmal, and the team as a whole was very sloppy; it was if they relaxed and took this game for granted when it was announced that Rodgers would start. Green Bay was whistled for 9 penalties, which totaled for 92 yards. As a comparison, the Falcons had just 2 infractions for 15 yards. One of the Green Bay penalties was a holding call on rookie Jermichael Finley, which nullified a 43-yard Mason Crosby field goal. Crosby subsequently missed from 53.    The Packers didn't have a prayer of stopping Michael Turner, who managed 121 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. This opened up easy passing opportunities for Matt Ryan, who torched a Green Bay secondary that was missing Al Harris and Atari Bigby. Ryan went 16-of-26, 194 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. He was 4-of-4 for 65 yards and a touchdown on the opening drive of the game.    Roddy White grabbed 8 passes for 132 yards and a score. He should be in your starting lineup unless he's playing the Buccaneers.    I stated Aaron Rodgers was a non-factor because he finished 25-of-37, 313 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, and the Packers still lost. "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers-Brett Favre talk before this year began, it's been Green Bay's defense that has debacled the team's postseason hopes.    Garrard somehow went 21-of-33 for 238 yards and 2 touchdowns, despite not having Matt Coke Zero Jones at his disposal. An interesting note is that Garrard is now 8-of-8 when running on third-and-one this season.    Northcutt somehow caught 5 passes for 127 yards and a score. I guess that's what happens when you put 2 crappy teams together.    Maurice Jones-Drew pleased fantasy owners with 2 touchdowns, but didn't do much otherwise (48 rushing yards, 22 receiving yards).    Meanwhile, Rodgers once again put together a solid performance, going 20-of-32 for 278 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The interception came late when he was trying to mount a desperate, last-second score.    While Greg Jennings had a touchdown (but only 22 yards) and Donald Driver caught 5 passes for 65 yards, Green Bay's leading receiver was James Jones, who notched 4 receptions for 132 yards. Ryan Grant, meanwhile, compiled 56 yards on 21 carries.    Let's make fun of NFL.com's GameCenter. Did you know that Aaron Rodgers threw a pass for minus-40 yards in this contest? It's true! He must have been drunk and tossed the ball the wrong way, or something. That said, it was a good thing the officials decided to review it! Don't believe me? Here's proof (thanks Holder):   "

By rule, the game concluded with a 10-second runoff. - Bengals defensive end Antwan Odom had FIVE sacks. Packers left tackle Chad Clifton suffered an injury and had to go into the locker room for X-rays for his ankle. Right tackle Allen Barbre, meanwhile, was just as horrible as he was Sunday night. In total, Aaron Rodgers was sacked 6 times. - "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers was sacked 5 times. Green Bay was also penalized 13 times. And you can't ignore the fact that the Packers were just 1-of-5 in the red zone in terms of scoring touchdowns.    Green Bay was in the red zone a lot, as the team seemed to live off of Detroit turnovers. Daunte Culpepper, who was 6-of-14 for 48 yards, tossed a pick that gave the Packers an easy touchdown (their only 1 in the red zone). Culpepper left in the third quarter because of a hamstring injury. Drew Stanton took his place and went 5-of-11 for 57 yards and 2 interceptions.    With Calvin Johnson out, neither Culpepper nor Stanton had many options. Dennis Northcutt led the team with 5 receptions for 40 yards. Brandon Pettigrew didn't catch a single pass.    Culpepper and Stanton were too inept to get Kevin Smith the ball out of the backfield. Smith finished with no receptions. He rushed for 61 yards on 15 carries.    Despite poor protection, Aaron Rodgers went 29-of-37 for 358 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick against Detroit's sorry secondary.    "

Later, the Buccaneers had another short field because of an 83-yard kickoff return. That's 21 points that never should have happened. The Packers actually out-gained Tampa Bay, 404-279.    Green Bay's offensive front also had a say in the loss. Rodgers (17-35, 266 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) went down a whopping 6 times. He held the ball for too long on occasion, but the bottom line is that his blockers can't keep anyone out of the backfield.    Rodgers' top 3 receivers all posted solid numbers. "

Warner was 29-of-33 for 379 yards and 5 scores. You read that right - Warner had more touchdowns than incompletions. That's more amazing because Warner didn't have "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers fumbled on the 1-yard line, negating a possible touchdown or chip-shot field goal. And in the 4.h quarter, Green Bay failed on a 4th-and-1 on its own territory. The Packers outgained Atlanta, 418-295. But the short-yardage screw-ups were the deciding factor.    The Falcons ultimately prevailed on a game-winning 47-yard field goal by Matt Bryant, thanks in part to a face mask penalty that set up Matt Ryan at midfield. Ryan was brilliant all afternoon, completing 24-of-28 passes for 198 yards and a touchdown to Tony Gonzalez (6-51).    Ryan really capitalized off Michael Turner's incredible running; Turner trampled the Packers for 110 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries. Green Bay really had to sell out to stop Turner.    With no running game to speak of - Brandon Jackson, at 1 point, had minus-2 yards on 5 carries - Aaron Rodgers pretty much did everything for his team. He went 26-of-35 for 344 yards and a touchdown. He scored another time on a run, compiling 51 yards on 12 scrambles. He was clutch in a 4.h-quarter comeback, but left too much time on the clock for the Falcons.    Five of Rodgers' receivers caught 5 passes: "

The Lions were already missing their top 2 quarterbacks, while the Packers had to use backup, Matt Flynn, because Aaron Rodgers suffered a concussion in the second quarter when he was hit in the head while going to the ground. Rodgers finished the game 7-of-11 for 46 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault (Jennings dropped a perfect pass). This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers was, the defense was a major part of why this was a massive blowout.    Matt Ryan had no chance. He was sacked 5 times and intercepted twice by Tramondous Williams (1 returned for a score). Ryan finished 20-of-29 for 186 yards, 1 touchdown, the 2 picks and a lost fumble. Atlanta's front office will need to add weapons around Ryan this offseason; aside from Roddy White, he has nothing. And that includes Tony Gonzalez. He's done. The 1 bad thing about watching Green Bay win was witnessing the end of Tony Gonzalez's career. Gonzalez, a complete shell of his former self, caught just 1 pass for 7 yards. Though he'll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Gonzalez has never won a playoff game.    The Falcons became the third No. 1 seed in the NFC to lose in the divisional round in the past 4 years. The previous 2 No. 1 seeds - 2007 Cowboys, 2008 Giants - failed to make the playoffs the following season.    As for the Packers, Rodgers was nearly perfect. He went 31-of-36 for 366 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 pass, 1 rush). Rodgers now has 12 touchdowns in his first 3 playoff starts - the most by any quarterback in such a span; the previous record-holder was Daryle Lamonica (10). Rodgers converted third downs all night, showcasing his trademark ability to elude pass-rushers in the pocket and extend plays. Troy Aikman said that Rodgers would be his first choice at quarterback if he were starting a franchise from scratch.    Three Packers had at least 6 receptions: Greg Jennings (8-101), "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers will have to be perfect, which will be a huge challenge given how bad the offensive line is.)    The Chiefs pulled off 1 of the biggest upsets of the year, ending the Packers bid for a perfect season. Green Bay had a generally crappy game on both sides of the ball. Every team has an off day, and the Packers definitely were not themselves against Kansas City. The Chiefs had a nice drive to start the game, but it ended with a 19-yard field goal. Kansas City then stopped the Green Bay offense, but a stupid roughing-the-punter penalty gave the Packers the ball at their own 48-yard line. Fortunately for the Chiefs, Mason Crosby missed both a 59-yard field goal, as well as a re-kick from 54 yards out after a 12-men-on-the-field penalty on Kansas City. This left the Chiefs with good field position which they converted into another Ryan Succop field goal. Aaron Rodgers was off on some passes, but he also was throwing some darts that his receivers were dropping. "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers, however, did a great job of evading the Cardinal defenders. He scrambled so many times in the first half that it made me realize how often he used to do this. Rodgers hasn't utilized his legs much this season, failing to rush more than 5 times in any contest entering this weekend. He ran 8 times versus the Cardinals. He picked up 33 rushing yards on those attempts, which doesn't seem like much, but they were instrumental in picking up first downs.    Looking at the box score, you may think that Rodgers struggled. He went 14-of-30 for 218 yards. However, he threw 4 touchdowns to just 1 interception, and he endured so many dropped passes. The Packers were actually guilty of 4 drops in the first 22 minutes of action. It must also be noted that Rodgers didn't have the services of his top 2 receivers. Greg Jennings is going to be out for several more weeks, while "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with 1 touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took 3 sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers had shoddy blocking in this contest. He was sacked twice on his second drive and was constantly under duress. He ultimately took 4 sacks, a figure that easily could've been greater had he not used his athleticism to scramble out of pressure so often. And of course, the backup center opened the game with a botched snap, which set up an early Jets' touchdown. Despite all of the heat he faced, Rodgers still went 25-of-42 for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 28 rushing yards. Many of Rodgers' incompletions were thrown away to avoid sacks, but he missed a few passes he would've normally made. However, he made up for it with some great throws, including an 80-yard touchdown bomb to "

They won by 32, but it could've easily been uglier, as they pulled Rodggers when the score was 42-0. Minnesota didn't even run a play past midfield until there were 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. It was so bad that even Jim Nantz laughed at them, chuckling before halftime, Do you think the Vikings are up to doing something tonight? I'm certainly not feeling it. This was such a lopsided contest that Rodgers had to throw just 17 passes. He completed 12 of them for 156 yards and 3 touchdowns. A couple of drives ended because Rodgers took sacks - he wasn't touched last week, but Minnesota's defense is much better than Chicago's - but the Packer offense was unstoppable otherwise. Had the Vikings been remotely competitive, Rodgers' yardage total could've easily exceeded 300.    Rodgers didn't have to do much because "

Anyone watching this game quickly discovered that Rodgers was undoubtedly 100 percent. He torched the Bears mercilessly, going 18-of-27 for 315 yards and 6 touchdowns in just slightly more than 1 half of action. It was clear that he was healthy when he sprinted out and hit "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers that eventually led to some Packer points. Belichick then made a tactical error, not going for it on 4.h-and-1 at midfield in the second quarter. It was the same blunder Jim Caldwell was guilty of last week; with superior personnel, there's no reason not to take a chance like that, especially when knowing the opposing offense will probably score anyway. An offense with Brady, Rob Gronkowski, etc. should be able to gain 1 yard. The issues persisted, when Brady and Belichick left too much time on the clock at the end of the first half, allowing Rodgers to score a touchdown on a 45-yard dart to Jordy Nelson, who beat Darrelle Revis for the only time on the afternoon. It was a bad scheme that allowed Nelson to run past Revis and the other Patriots for the touchdown. This was huge, as the Packers had issues in the red zone the entire game. Belichick then went on to waste a timeout early in the third quarter, which he sorely needed at the end of the contest. Of course, the killer for the Patriot bettors occurred at the end of the game when Stephen Gostkowski whiffed on a 47-yarder to cover the spread, which was his first real missed field goal of the year. Of course, Mason Crosby was errant on a try earlier and Davante Adams dropped a touchdown, so you can't exactly call that a bad beat - just a frustrating 1.    Hats off to Rodgers through, who continued his brilliant play at home. Despite Revis locking down Nelson, save for that 1 play, Rodgers managed to go 24-of-38 for 368 yards and 2 touchdowns, with a third throw that should've gone into the end zone to Adams. Rodgers injured his hand on 1 of his scrambles (5 carries, 22 rush yards), but didn't appear to be affected by it. He was helped by his offensive line, which provided tremendous protection. The Patriots barely put any pressure on him.    With Nelson smothered - he didn't even see a target until the 7:55 mark in the second quarter - Adams and Randall Cobb tied for the team lead with 11 targets. Adams and Cobb tallied 121 and 85 yards, respectively. Neither found the end zone, but Adams easily could have twice. I already mentioned his drop; he nearly had a touchdown in the first half, but managed to get just 1 foot inbounds. Meanwhile, Nelson managed just 2 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. Richard Rodgers (2-35) secured Aaron Rodgers' other score.    The Packers ran the ball well, especially in the first half. "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was Jermaine Kearse last week, yet he failed to reel in a single reception. Doug Baldwin led the way instead, catching 7 balls for 92 yards and a touchdown. No Seattle wideout should be on any roster in 12-team leagues.    Jimmy Graham caught a touchdown in the opener, but managed to secure just 1 catch in this game. He was targeted just twice. Graham will continue to struggle because he's not a good fit in Seattle's offense. I would attempt to unload him.    As for the Packers, they trailed 17-13 in the third quarter, but Aaron Rodgers went nuts and closed the game out on a 14-0 run. Rodgers was perfect in the final quarter. Literally. He was 9-of-9 for 91 yards and a touchdown in the final frame despite dealing with a key injury in his backfield. Rodgers went 25-of-33 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 23 rushing yards. He did a great job of repeatedly drawing the Seahawks offsides and torching Richard Sherman, who was flagged twice.    Rodgers' performance was particularly impressive considering that he was missing "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers had gone nearly 3 years without throwing an interception at home, but his initial pick came in the first half when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage and snatched in mid-air by a diving James Laurinaitis. Rodgers' next streak? Just 6 passes. Trumaine Johnson had the next pick, a lazy pass toward the sideline, though there was some question about whether it hit the ground. The play stood as called, and it wasn't Rodgers' final turnover of the afternoon. He didn't fire another interception, but he was strip-sacked after the Rams missed 1 of their field goals. Rodgers finished 19-of-30 for 241 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Rodgers hit 2 big plays in this contest - a 65-yard score to James Jones that was initially ruled down at the 1-yard line prior to replay review changing it, and a 31-yard touchdown strike to Ty Montgomery on the opening offensive drive - but was otherwise very mediocre. A big part of the problem was that Rodgers dealt with a ton of pressure. The Rams' ferocious defensive line hounded him, and it didn't help that guard T.J. Lang was carted into the locker room. This is the second straight week that Rodgers has been rushed heavily, so this has to be a concern for the team going forward.    Jones and Montgomery, who had the 2 scores, led the team in receiving yardage. The former caught 2 balls for 77 yards, while Montgomery snared 4 balls for 59 yards. If you want to own Montgomery, that's fine, but keep in mind that he was 4.h on the team in targets despite his output. He saw just 5 balls go his way, and if you take away the 31-yard score, his final numbers would've been 3 receptions for 28 yards. I'm not going to add him to my fantasy roster.    Randall Cobb and Richard Rodgers both had more targets than Montgomery, but neither did much in terms of final numbers. Cobb caught just 3 passes for 23 yards, while Richard Rodgers had 6 receptions for 45 yards, but was guilty of a couple of poor penalties, including 1 that nullified a field goal. He also dropped a possible touchdown.    Green Bay's leading rusher? Not Eddie Lacy. Not James Starks. Not John Kuhn either. It was Aaron Rodgers, who had to scramble 8 times because of pressure. He gained 39 yards on the ground. Lacy, meanwhile, barely mustered more than 2 yards per carry. He managed only 27 yards on 13 tries. I wouldn't panic yet if you own him in fantasy. He's still averaging 4.1 YPC on the year.    Given the Packers' offensive struggles, if the Rams had any sort of decent quarterbacking and kicking, they may have won this game. It's a shame for "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers would be limited to 77 passing yards in this matchup, I would've asked, OK, what quarter did he get injured in? If you missed this game, yes, Rodgers played throughout. He simply had no chance against Denver's prolific defense. It was amazing how dominant the Broncos' stop unit was. The group both pressured Rodgers heavily, who barely had any room to breathe, and smothered his receivers. "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers had no 1 behind him. He absorbed the tackle, and the game was over. Except, the Lions had Rodgers by the face mask - not really, but the officials thought so in real time - extending the contest for 1 more play. Rodgers, taking advantage of 1 final chance, launched a 61-yard bomb into the end zone. Richard Rodgers hauled in the pass for the game-winning score. I'd say unreal, but it was destined to happen. The Packers had been struggling going into this contest, so they were very fortunate to get the much-needed win. However, this was a Pyrrhic victory. Green Bay, which already had issues on its offensive line heading into this game, lost 2 more blockers. Center Corey Linsley aggravated his ankle, while left tackle David Bakhtiari also got knocked out. Rodgers, as a result, had issues moving the chains for most of the evening because he was constantly under siege. At halftime, the Packers were averaging just 2.4 yards per play, and they had a turnover early on that led to a Detroit touchdown. It seemed like they were destined to drop to 7-5, but Detroit failed to put them away. That, and my bet doomed the Lions.    Rodgers finished 24-of-36 for 273 yards, 2 passing touchdowns and an interception, which was behind his receiver. He also did some damage on the ground, scrambling 4 times for 27 rushing yards and a score, which turned out to be the penultimate touchdown of the game. Rodgers fumbled as well, but his center recovered the ball. However, his center ended up getting hurt on the play, so that ended up being costly. Rodgers was on fire after intermission, going 14-of-20 for 193 yards and 3 scores.    Besides the win, the injuries and Rodgers' play, the big news concerning for the Packers was Eddie Lacy's benching. James Starks started, but wasn't completely effective on the ground, mustering 15 yards on 9 carries to go along with 5 catches for 45 receiving yards. He had a 32-yard reception called back, but fumbled twice. Lacy was on the field for a bit, but following some ineffective runs (5 carries, 4 yards), the fat running back was benched in favor of some practice-squad player named John Crockett, who gained 22 yards on 5 carries. Both Crockett and Starks looked much better than Lacy, who needs to lose about 20 pounds.    Richard Rodgers snared all 8 targets of his for 146 yards and the game-winning touchdown. I've heard people lamenting not playing him in fantasy, but his stat line prior to the Hail Mary was 7-85, which is solid, but not great. The play should have never even happened; the Lions could have just tackled Aaron Rodgers without getting him on the face mask - well, they actually did - and Rodgers would've never been in position to win the game with the touchdown.

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers prevailed, but once again didn't look like himself. He barely completed half of his passes, going 23-of-45 for 259 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as the ball bounced off James Starks' hands. However, Rodgers was off the mark on a number of throws and had 2 interceptions that were dropped, 1 of which was by a safety that appeared as though it could go the other way for 6. Rodgers really doesn't have anyone to blame at this point, especially when considering the Giants' already-thin secondary lost Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Eli Apple to groin injuries. Both of Rodgers' primary receivers appear to be healthy, while his offensive line kept him clean the entire night. He wasn't sacked a single time, and there were instances in which he stood in the pocket for 6 or more seconds without anyone even coming close to him. It's mind-boggling that the Giants' high-priced defensive line couldn't generate an sort of heat on Rodgers.    Randall Cobb had a huge performance. Banged up prior to the bye, he used his week off to heal up, and it showed in this contest. He caught 9 of his 11 targets for 108 yards. There was a huge play in which he broke 2 tackles to reach for the first down, ultimately leading to a Green Bay score. Cobb later caught a third-down pass while falling down, which sealed the victory for the Packers. His 1 blemish was a drop.    Rodgers' 2 touchdowns went to Jordy Nelson (4-38) and Davante Adams (5-85). Nelson could've drawn a couple of pass-interference flags downfield, especially 1 on the opening drive, but the officials allowed the teams to play.    Eddie Lacy ran well, gaining 81 yards on just 11 carries. Unfortunately for Lacy, he sustained an ankle injury in the third quarter and never returned. James Starks (12-33) nearly lost the game with a fumble on the final drive, but the Packers were able to recover. Starks also dropped a potential touchdown.    Moving on to the Giants, Eli Manning's play was deplorable. In fact, as bad as Rodgers was, he looked like, well, vintage Aaron Rodgers compared to Manning. When someone commented about this game on Facebook, I wrote that Manning appeared to be drunk. That, or he was secretly streaming the debate between Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich and wasn't focused on this game as a consequence. Manning began the evening by missing Odell Beckham for a gain of what would've been 25 yards. He then threw behind Beckham on the next drive and "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers' pedestrian play of late. The $64,000 question is: What's wrong with Rodgers? Green Bay's Super Bowl-winning quarterback struggled mightily in this contest and hasn't been quite himself since the beginning of last season. I thought it might have been because of a slight shoulder injury he dealt with last year, but he still hasn't recovered. I thought Troy Aikman said it perfectly in this contest when he cited that Rodgers isn't seeing the field clearly. It could be possible that his fame - filming tons of commercials, dating Olivia Munn - could have something to do with it, as it might be taking away from his film study. That's my best guess, as there probably aren't many people who really know what's going on. We can only speculate, but it is clear that Rodgers has regressed. On the other side, "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers? The future Hall of Famer hasn't played like himself since the beginning of last season, and many theories spawned. A reader even had a great crackpot theory on our this week. The first half of this game confirmed everyone's suspicions. Rodgers was 19-of-30 in the opening 30 minutes, but for only 150 yards (an abysmal 5.0 YPA), as he missed numerous throws. It only got worse at the beginning of the third quarter, when Rodgers didn't recognize Leonard Floyd's blind-side pressure and was strip-sacked. The ball trickled into the end zone, and the Bears recovered the touchdown, giving them the lead. Lambeau Field was completely quiet at that point, as the Packer supporters were stunned. Moments later, Rodgers drove down the field and helped get the team into the end zone with some clutch third-down conversions. Rodgers did the same thing on the next couple of possessions, and before anyone knew it, the Packers were up 16. Rodgers finished 39-of-556 for 326 yards and 3 touchdowns. The stats look great, and everyone on NFL Network and CBS will tell you that there's nothing wrong with Rodgers. There definitely is something wrong, however. The Rodgers of old would've thrown for at least 450 yards on 56 attempts, and he wouldn't have missed so many throws. His receivers were covered tightly for the most part, but Rodgers has always been able to hit them on impressive back-shoulder throws. That's still happening on occasion, but it's not nearly as consistent as it once was.    Rodgers' 3 star receivers were Davante Adams, Randall Cobb and Ty Montgomery, as Jordy Nelson did nothing. Adams caught a ridiculous 13 passes for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is remarkable because he wasn't even expected to play, given that he was going through concussion protocol on a short work week. Cobb snatched 11 balls for 95 yards and a late score, though he dropped an early touchdown on the opening drive. Montgomery, meanwhile, played running back, yet was still able to catch 10 passes for 66 yards. He also rushed for 60 yards on 9 carries. The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy. As for Nelson, it's clear that he's not 100 percent. "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers played very well for the first time in quite a while. The bad news for the Packers is that Mohamed Sanu beat them. That's how bad things are for their secondary. Sanu shouldn't beat a powderpuff football team; let alone an NFL playoff contender.    This may have been 1 of the best games of the entire season. Both pass offenses were operating at full force, and neither team was ever out of the game. There were a couple of late lead changes, but at the end of the day, the Falcons came out on top. Still, the Packers have to be happy with how their offense played today. The most impressive part of this game was the fact that the Packers ran a completely 1.dimensional offense and were still able to put up 32 points. The team really did not have a rush offense. Ty Montgomery was surprisingly inactive due to an illness, so the team did not have much in the backfield. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski led the way with 6 carries and 34 yards. Aside from him, the team did not have much, especially if you exclude the 6 carries by Aaron Rodgers. This will continue to be the case until either Montgomery or James Starks returns to the lineup.    With that said, the passing game was simply terrific. Aaron Rodgers had what was by far the best performance of the season. There had been some questions about the veteran quarterback, as he had struggled at times during the 2016 season. Some were wondering if he was starting to decline as he got older. Rodgers was able to silence those critics with his play today. Rodgers went 28-of-38 on the day, throwing for 246 yards, and running for 60 as well. He tossed 4 touchdown passes and single-handedly carried the Packers' offense to victory. Rodgers made numerous sharp throws and finally looked comfortable in the pocket. His offensive line gave him ample time to complete his passes, and it really showed. On all of Rodgers' touchdowns, he threw the ball to the perfect location. One of his best passes came on his touchdown to "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers was able to rally Green Bay late, but he could not do enough to carry the team. Rodgers' stat line is a little bit deceiving. He went 26-of-43 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. Two of the touchdowns came in the 4.h quarter, however, and Rodgers had some issues getting the offense moving early. His throws were not bad. Rather, he could not find an open receiver against the Colts' defense. Rodgers was able to move around the pocket effectively as the contest went on, and that really helped him out. Once he did that, the Colts had more trouble following the receivers and Rodgers was able to hit the open man. The performance was not as good as the 1 he had last week against the Falcons, but his play late could have won the game for Green Bay.    Rodgers spread the ball around a fair amount on Sunday. "

His defense was the culprit, as the injury-ravaged stop unit surrendered numerous big gains against the Redskins and couldn't get off the field whatsoever when it mattered most in the second half. Much was made of the wind in this game, as NBC announcers Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth harped about the strong gusts traveling from right to left from the TV camera's perspective. The Redskins even eschewed an extra point heading in that direction. However, the strong gusts didn't affect "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers was taking at the end of the game. Rodgers was limping around, so Green Bay needs Bryan Bulaga back from injury as soon as possible.    This game got off to a weird start. Early on, there was a strange play where Seahawks rookie Nazair Jones intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown. On the play, there was an illegal block in the back, and Jeremy Lane got tangled up with a Packers player. Lane was ejected for throwing a punch, which nobody really seemed to see. Pete Carroll and the Seahawks were rightfully angry, as they lost 1 of their important corners for doing virtually nothing. That set the tone for the contest, which became a physical, defensive struggle. Russell Wilson had about as good a game as he possibly could have. His offensive line played very poorly for a majority of the contest, and the unit constantly allowed pressure on the quarterback. The Packers were only able to total 3 sacks, but part of that was due to Wilson's mobility. If you were to replace Wilson with a non-mobile quarterback, there may have been twice as many sacks. Despite the lack of protection, Wilson was able to make some great throws. In the 2-minute drill at the end of the second half, Wilson found Doug Baldwin down the right sideline on a perfect strike to kick the offense into gear. To that point, the Seahawks had only 1 first down, but that throw really snapped them out of their funk. Wilson later scrambled for a 29-yard gain on that same drive and worked the team into field goal range. It was a nice drive by the veteran, and 1 that only he would be able to orchestrate. In the second half, Wilson continued to show a strong arm and threw his receivers open on many occasions. Wilson also knew exactly where to throw the ball to let his receivers go and get it. On 1 throw in the 4.h quarter, Wilson lofted a pass to Paul Richardson that hung up just long enough in the perfect place for the receiver to haul it in. Overall, Wilson ended up going 14-for-27 with 158 yards and a fumble. It wasn't the best stat line but again, it wasn't his fault. Seattle needs to get him some offensive line help, or it is not going to be able to compete in the postseason.    The Seahawks got a pretty nice performance from their receivers in this contest. Doug Baldwin (4-63) and Paul Richardson (4-59) both looked good on the field. Baldwin was an efficient player as always and ran crisp routes for the team. However, he will be limited in fantasy because of the lack of time Wilson has in the pocket. For that reason, Baldwin is capped as a WR2 most weeks. Meanwhile, Richardson keeps improving with each game he plays. He is worth monitoring for now, but Wilson seems to like throwing to him. Jimmy Graham (3-8) saw 7 targets, but really didn't do much. It was a disappointing performance for him, but he will bounce back soon.    The most impressive member of Seattle's running back corps was rookie Chris Carson. The 7.h-round pick out of Oklahoma State put together a very strong performance for the team. He ended up getting 6 carries for 39 yards and had a nice combination of burst and physicality. On 1 play in particular, Carson was able to run all the way to the left side and then reverse field all the way to the right to get 3 yards. He was only able to do this because of his great vision and his ability to make men miss. He is worth monitoring as potential running back depth, but once Thomas Rawls comes back, the backfield will be more crowded. Elsewhere, Eddie Lacy and C.J. Prosise were largely disappointing. Lacy looked very sluggish, and he shouldn't be trusted in fantasy.    On defense, the Seahawks' defensive line looked very good. Sheldon Richardson, Frank Clark and Michael Bennett look like a fearsome trio, though Bennett was dealing with injury problems during the game. When they are all healthy, Seattle will be able to rack up a great deal of sacks in 2017.    I don't usually note kickers, but it's nice to see Blair Walsh succeed in his Seattle debut. He went 3-for-3 on field goals, including a 41-yarder. If Walsh has his confidence back, he could be 1 of the better kickers in the NFL again.    For the Packers, this was an overall solid performance, but their offensive line was an issue too. Without Bryan Bulaga and the departed T.J. Lang, the unit struggled immensely. Against Seattle's strong defensive line, second-year man Kyle Murphy had real issues at right tackle, and that caused Aaron Rodgers to be under pressure. Still, Rodgers did well enough to help the Packers win the contest. Rodgers, like Wilson, was able to use his mobility to his advantage, but it was in a different way. He moved around the pocket and was able to find open receivers frequently. Things really opened up for Rodgers in the second half. Rodgers continued to show why he is the best quarterback in the NFL, as his mix of arm strength, ball placement, and accuracy was on full display. Against a tough secondary, Rodgers was able to make plays and move the ball at will after halftime. One of his best throws came on a touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers' first overtime victory ever. You'd think he'd have like 20, 30, or even 500 by now. Weird.    It wasn't a pretty first half, but Aaron Rodgers pulled off the 4.h-quarter comeback and overtime win to get Green Bay to a 2-1 start on the 2017 season. This victory has the Packers keeping pace with the Vikings and Lions at 2-1 in the NFC North. Green Bay, however, will need to fix its leaky offensive line in the weeks to come. The Bengals changed their offensive coordinator after their 0-2 start, and the early returns were good as their scoring unit played well in the first half, but the offensive line wasn't changed out, and that weakness led to Green Bay holding the Bengals to only 3 points over the final 2 quarters and overtime.    On the first drive of the game, Cincinnati went down the field for a touchdown with "

   "comment":"Aaron Rodgers impression to draw the Ravens offside. However, the Packers came away with no points because Hundley tossed a stupid interception into double coverage in the end zone. Hundley looked good at times on the next 2 possessions as well, but those drives also ended in turnovers. Hundley threw an interception up for grabs because he was under pressure. After that, backup running back Devante Mays lost a fumble. The Packers were guilty of 3 turnovers on their first 3 drives. The Packers continued to shoot themselves in the foot, ruining their chances to pull the upset. A quality opponent would've taken advantage of that and put the game away, but Baltimore's pedestrian offense couldn't do anything about it. The Ravens were only able to go into halftime with a 6-0 lead, as they averaged only 3.8 yards per play. The offensive line was a mess heading into this contest, so that wasn't a surprise. On 1 drive, the Ravens had a botched snap and a sack. On another, Flacco was picked off on a forced throw to Danny Woodhead. Baltimore generated just 106 yards of offense prior to intermission. Flacco, however, rebounded with a strong second-half effort, taking advantage of Clay Matthews' absence (groin). He found Ben Watson for a big gain, then lofted a beautiful touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, who came up with a 1.handed reception despite some great coverage by Damarious Randall. This put Baltimore up 13-0, which put the game out of reach for the struggling Packers.    Flacco misfired on just 6 passes, going 22-of-28 for 183 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Flacco didn't take too many chances, but it's not like he needed to. With a lead throughout the afternoon, Flacco never had to press, which was a good thing considering that he was missing left tackle Ronnie Stanley.    Wallace led the Ravens with 56 receiving yards on 4 catches with a touchdown. Jeremy Maclin (4-34) was next on the list. Baltimore's receiving numbers were more suppressed than usual because of the flow of the game.    The Ravens struggled to run the ball, with Alex Collins mustering just 49 yards on 20 carries. He was at least able to score a touchdown. Woodhead, meanwhile, did all of his damage as a receiver, catching 5 balls for 21 yards.    As for the Packers, Hundley killed his team by taking big sacks and failing to anticipate throws. His passes were late, and he made too many mistakes. He finished 21-of-36 for 239 yards, 3 picks and a lost fumble. He took a major step backward this week, as he no longer had the luxury of battling a defense missing its star linebacker.    Despite Hundley's struggles, Davante Adams had another strong performance, catching 8 balls for 126 yards. It's clear that Adams is the only receiver Hundley trusts, as Jordy Nelson (2-24) hasn't done anything of note since Aaron Rodgers' injury.    "
