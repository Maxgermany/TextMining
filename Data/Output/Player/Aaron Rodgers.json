Green Bay was in the red zone a lot, as the team seemed to live off of Detroit turnovers. Daunte Culpepper, who was 6-of-14 for 48 yards, tossed a pick that gave the Packers an easy touchdown (their only 1 in the red zone). Culpepper left in the third quarter because of a hamstring injury. Drew Stanton took his place and went 5-of-11 for 57 yards and 2 interceptions.    With Calvin Johnson out, neither Culpepper nor Stanton had many options. Dennis Northcutt led the team with 5 receptions for 40 yards. Brandon Pettigrew didn't catch a single pass.    Culpepper and Stanton were too inept to get Kevin Smith the ball out of the backfield. Smith finished with no receptions. He rushed for 61 yards on 15 carries.    Despite poor protection, Aaron Rodgers went 29-of-37 for 358 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick against Detroit's sorry secondary.    "

Green Bay's offensive front also had a say in the loss. Rodgers (17-35, 266 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) went down a whopping 6 times. He held the ball for too long on occasion, but the bottom line is that his blockers can't keep anyone out of the backfield.    Rodgers' top 3 receivers all posted solid numbers. "

These 2 teams combined for an amazing 973 total yards. But here's the amazing thing: There were still 10 punts and 17 penalties in this game! If I didn't know any better, I'd say the Steelers and Packers played 5 quarters. This contest was the last 1 to end, so I think that's a possibility.    Roethlisberger was sacked 5 times, 2 times each by rookies Clay Matthews and Brad Jones. Matthews also forced Roethlisberger into a lost fumble, but that play was overturned on a review.    None of Big Ben's scores went to Hines Ward, Heath Miller and Santonio Holmes. Two of them were to Mike Wallace (2-79). The other found Mewelde Moore. As for the 3 big names, both Ward and Miller made 7 grabs for 126 and 118 yards, respectively. Ward's numbers were shocking, considering he was hobbled with a hamstring injury and appeared to be limping around the field at times. Holmes, meanwhile, made 3 receptions for 77 yards.    Rashard Mendenhall also chipped in with 6 catches for 73 yards. He didn't do much on the ground though, mustering just 38 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries.    Ryan Grant oddly just ran the ball 8 times, gaining 37 yards and a touchdown. Unlike Mendenhall though, Grant didn't do anything in the passing game.    Jermichael Finley paced the Packers in receptions with 9 for 74 yards and a touchdown. The team's leading receiver was Greg Jennings, who hauled in 5 catches for 118 yards and a score. Donald Driver caught only 3 balls for 76 yards.    As for the dumb coaching decision, Mike Tomlin opted to try an onside kick in the fourth quarter - only he was up 2 points and there were 4 minutes remaining in regulation. Tomlin said afterward that he didn't have any confidence in his defense to stop the Packers. Well, I'm not going to disagree with that, but an onside kick has what, a 20-percent chance of working? Did Tomlin actually think that there was less than a 20-percent chance that his defense could contain Rodgers? If so, will he try an onside kick every single time he plays a good offense? If so, I'd like to see that game.   "

The Packers outgained Atlanta, 418-295. But the short-yardage screw-ups were the deciding factor.    The Falcons ultimately prevailed on a game-winning 47-yard field goal by Matt Bryant, thanks in part to a face mask penalty that set up Matt Ryan at midfield. Ryan was brilliant all afternoon, completing 24-of-28 passes for 198 yards and a touchdown to Tony Gonzalez (6-51).    Ryan really capitalized off Michael Turner's incredible running; Turner trampled the Packers for 110 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries. Green Bay really had to sell out to stop Turner.    With no running game to speak of - Brandon Jackson, at 1 point, had minus-2 yards on 5 carries - Aaron Rodgers pretty much did everything for his team. He went 26-of-35 for 344 yards and a touchdown. He scored another time on a run, compiling 51 yards on 12 scrambles. He was clutch in a fourth-quarter comeback, but left too much time on the clock for the Falcons.

This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back "

   "comment":"Rodgers was, the defense was a major part of why this was a massive blowout.    Matt Ryan had no chance. He was sacked 5 times and intercepted twice by Tramondous Williams (1 returned for a score). Ryan finished 20-of-29 for 186 yards, 1 touchdown, the 2 picks and a lost fumble. Atlanta's front office will need to add weapons around Ryan this offseason; aside from Roddy White, he has nothing. And that includes Tony Gonzalez. He's done. The 1 bad thing about watching Green Bay win was witnessing the end of Tony Gonzalez's career. Gonzalez, a complete shell of his former self, caught just 1 pass for 7 yards. Though he'll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Gonzalez has never won a playoff game.    The Falcons became the third No. 1 seed in the NFC to lose in the divisional round in the past 4 years. The previous 2 No. 1 seeds - 2007 Cowboys, 2008 Giants - failed to make the playoffs the following season.    As for the Packers, Rodgers was nearly perfect. He went 31-of-36 for 366 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 pass, 1 rush). Rodgers now has 12 touchdowns in his first 3 playoff starts - the most by any quarterback in such a span; the previous record-holder was Daryle Lamonica (10). Rodgers converted third downs all night, showcasing his trademark ability to elude pass-rushers in the pocket and extend plays. Troy Aikman said that Rodgers would be his first choice at quarterback if he were starting a franchise from scratch.    Three Packers had at least 6 receptions: Greg Jennings (8-101), "

   "comment":"Rodgers will have to be perfect, which will be a huge challenge given how bad the offensive line is.)    The Chiefs pulled off 1 of the biggest upsets of the year, ending the Packers bid for a perfect season. Green Bay had a generally crappy game on both sides of the ball. Every team has an off day, and the Packers definitely were not themselves against Kansas City. The Chiefs had a nice drive to start the game, but it ended with a 19-yard field goal. Kansas City then stopped the Green Bay offense, but a stupid roughing-the-punter penalty gave the Packers the ball at their own 48-yard line. Fortunately for the Chiefs, Mason Crosby missed both a 59-yard field goal, as well as a re-kick from 54 yards out after a 12-men-on-the-field penalty on Kansas City. This left the Chiefs with good field position which they converted into another Ryan Succop field goal. Aaron Rodgers was off on some passes, but he also was throwing some darts that his receivers were dropping. "

Chicago's offense moved the ball effectively with tough runs by Kahlil Bell, and short, accurate throws from McCown. The defense, meanwhile, buckled down and forced Green Bay into 3 consecutive 3-and-outs. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. The Bears killed themselves with stupid mistakes (penalties, missed field goal, 2 interceptions), while Rodgers caught fire, continuously torching beleaguered cornerback Zackary Bowman."

He picked up 33 rushing yards on those attempts, which doesn't seem like much, but they were instrumental in picking up first downs.    Looking at the box score, you may think that Rodgers struggled. He went 14-of-30 for 218 yards. However, he threw 4 touchdowns to just 1 interception, and he endured so many dropped passes. The Packers were actually guilty of 4 drops in the first 22 minutes of action. It must also be noted that Rodgers didn't have the services of his top 2 receivers. Greg Jennings is going to be out for several more weeks, while "

Mason Crosby then whiffed on a 43-yard field goal that wasn't even close. - Ryan Grant (8-32) lost a fumble near midfield. - Crosby missed another field goal. He hit the left upright on a 42-yard try. - The Packers, for whatever reason, attempted a backward pass on a punt return, up 21-10 with 8 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. The throw was dropped, which gave Chicago a fumble recovery. Unfortunately for the Bears, they could do very little with it, mustering just a field goal.    Rodgers was great enough to overcome those errors. Though he blew a potential touchdown, he threw 3 more on 23-of-36 passing for 291 yards.

   "comment":"Rodgers had a nice performance considering the defense he was battling. He went 21-of-37 for 333 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault; Jermichael Finley bobbled the ball and allowed rookie safety Eric Reid to pick it off. Reid had a second interception, but an offside penalty nullified that. Rodgers' scores went to Jordy Nelson (7-130), Randall Reggie Cobb (7-106) and Finley (5-56)."

   "comment":"Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with 1 touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took 3 sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to "

   "comment":"Rodgers was very sharp, while Chicago looked nearly as good, though it benefited from some great luck. For instance, Jay Cutler fumbled 2 snaps, yet was able to make great plays on both instances. He scrambled and picked up a first down the initial time and then threw a completion for a first down on the second occasion. Meanwhile, the grass caused corner Davon House to fall down a couple of times on a pair of big Chicago plays. However, the Bears' great fortunes quickly ran out, and it began just before halftime. Martellus Bennett was tackled inches short of the goal line just as time expired. Cutler then was erratic as he was trying to come from behind, tossing 2 interceptions in the second half. One of them was a miscommunication that led to a Packer field goal attempt. The Bears held on the play, granting Green Bay with a first-and-goal opportunity. Rodgers took advantage with a touchdown on the very next snap. That put the Packers up 21, icing the second victory for them. Cutler had a miserable second half, going 7-of-13 for 83 yards and the 2 picks following intermission. He had a third potential interception that was dropped. Green Bay's defensive improvement after halftime was inexplicable, though Cutler melting down had something to do with it.    Rodgers, meanwhile, was brilliant throughout. He backed up his message about relaxing despite the team's 1-2 start by going 22-of-28 for 302 yards and 4 touchdowns. Whereas Cutler struggled immensely following halftime, Rodgers misfired on just 2 of his 11 attempts during the same time span. One of the incompletions was actually a drop by "

   "comment":"Rodgers in a potential shootout. As a result, the Packers dominated the Vikings. They won by 32, but it could've easily been uglier, as they pulled Rodggers when the score was 42-0. Minnesota didn't even run a play past midfield until there were 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. It was so bad that even Jim Nantz laughed at them, chuckling before halftime, Do you think the Vikings are up to doing something tonight? I'm certainly not feeling it. This was such a lopsided contest that Rodgers had to throw just 17 passes. He completed 12 of them for 156 yards and 3 touchdowns. A couple of drives ended because Rodgers took sacks - he wasn't touched last week, but Minnesota's defense is much better than Chicago's - but the Packer offense was unstoppable otherwise. Had the Vikings been remotely competitive, Rodgers' yardage total could've easily exceeded 300.    Rodgers didn't have to do much because "

The opening drive epitomized how long of a day this was going to be for Carolina. The Panthers lucked into a sack when Rodgers slipped. Green Bay was forced into a long-yardage situation, but the team got out of it because of some Carolina penalties. One infraction negated an interception. In fact, Rodgers just stood there because he knew it wasn't going to stand. He ultimately threw a touchdown to "

He grabbed his left hamstring and shouted expletives. Cris Collinsworth picked up on it immediately, saying this was a huge deal for Green Bay.

After a pass to Andrew Quarless (2-50) moved the ball inside the 10, Eddie Lacy dove over the top at the goal line for a touchdown. Minnesota answered with a nice drive that featured a critical holding call drawn by Cordarraelle Patterson (2-18) and a fourth-and-short conversion by Jerick McKinnon (15-54). Bridgewater found an open Charles Johnson (3-52) for a 22-yard score after he ran by Tramon Willims to get open. After Green Bay punted, Bridgewater made a bad mistake throwing a pass up for grabs off his back foot. Packers safety Micah Hyde went up to intercept the pass close to midfield. A great run by Lacy was taken away by a penalty, but Rodgers hit Andrew Quarless for a 34-yard reception to the 1-yard line. For the next play, Rodgers lobbed a pass to a wide open "

   "comment":"Rodgers that eventually led to some Packer points. Belichick then made a tactical error, not going for it on fourth-and-1 at midfield in the second quarter. It was the same blunder Jim Caldwell was guilty of last week; with superior personnel, there's no reason not to take a chance like that, especially when knowing the opposing offense will probably score anyway. An offense with Brady, Rob Gronkowski, etc. should be able to gain 1 yard. The issues persisted, when Brady and Belichick left too much time on the clock at the end of the first half, allowing Rodgers to score a touchdown on a 45-yard dart to Jordy Nelson, who beat Darrelle Revis for the only time on the afternoon."

   "comment":"Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1-handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was Jermaine Kearse last week, yet he failed to reel in a single reception. Doug Baldwin led the way instead, catching 7 balls for 92 yards and a touchdown. No Seattle wideout should be on any roster in 12-team leagues.    Jimmy Graham caught a touchdown in the opener, but managed to secure just 1 catch in this game. He was targeted just twice. Graham will continue to struggle because he's not a good fit in Seattle's offense. I would attempt to unload him.    As for the Packers, they trailed 17-13 in the third quarter, but Aaron Rodgers went nuts and closed the game out on a 14-0 run. Rodgers was perfect in the final quarter. Literally. He was 9-of-9 for 91 yards and a touchdown in the final frame despite dealing with a key injury in his backfield. Rodgers went 25-of-33 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 23 rushing yards. He did a great job of repeatedly drawing the Seahawks offsides and torching Richard Sherman, who was flagged twice.    Rodgers' performance was particularly impressive considering that he was missing "

Rodgers' halftime numbers - 8-of-16, 117 yards, 1 touchdown - are more indicative of how he played, though his struggles weren't his fault. He dealt with so much pressure in the pocket, so like last week, his inability to have time to find his receivers disrupted the timing of his offense. Rodgers caught fire in garbage time, when Carolina fell asleep, but it was telling that he couldn't punch the ball in for a game-winning score after the aforementioned Newton pick.    "

The blocking group is in terrible shape. Left tackle David Bakhtiari was ruled out, while guard Josh Sitton, who is usually a great player, is hampered by a bad back. Bryan Bulaga, meanwhile, had to leave the game with an injury of his own, but the contest was well decided even before that. With barely any time to throw, Rodgers went 15-of-28 for 151 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick was a killer, as it occurred in the end zone when it appeared as though the Packers would get back into it in the second quarter. Rodgers foolishly forced the issue, heaving a ball that had no chance of being caught. Rodgers later had some turnovers in the second half. He fumbled thrice, losing 2 of them. Both were returned for scores.    In addition to poor blocking, Rodgers also didn't get any sort of help from his wideouts. "

   "comment":"Rodgers, backed up near his own goal line because of a J.C. Tretter false start, took a sack in the end zone on a safety, thanks to rookie pass-rusher Preston Smith getting by Tretter, who was playing for the injured David Bakhtiari. The Redskins turned their 2-0 advantage into a 5-0 lead, but it could've been 9-0 had DeSean Jackson put forth some effort when running near the end zone. Jackson, who dogged it on the play, nonchalantly waltzed out of bounds when he could have dived for 6. The Redskins still had first-and-goal on Green Bay's 1-yard line, but couldn't punch it in. They were, however, able to score shortly afterward when Kirk Cousins hit Jordan Reed. Up 11-0, Washington looked like it was in great shape, while a reeling Rodgers was just 1-of-8 for 11 yards, missing open receivers and looking skittish. And then, everything changed, and I mean everything. The Redskins scored just 1 touchdown after that, while Rodgers caught fire. Following his 1-of-8 start, Rodgers went 20-of-28 for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns the rest of the way. The quarterback who couldn't fire a pass within 10 yards of his receivers disappeared, and the Rodgers of old abused Washington's miserable secondary. He was the primary factor for the Packers outscoring the Redskins, 35-7, following that 11-0 start by Washington.    Rodgers' final numbers were 21-of-36 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns. He sparked the Packers' offense surge in the second quarter, while the running game capped things off. Rodgers threw just 8 times following intermission, which was for the best, given the windy conditions. "

   "comment":"Rodgers prevailed, but once again didn't look like himself. He barely completed half of his passes, going 23-of-45 for 259 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as the ball bounced off James Starks' hands. However, Rodgers was off the mark on a number of throws and had 2 interceptions that were dropped, 1 of which was by a safety that appeared as though it could go the other way for 6. Rodgers really doesn't have anyone to blame at this point, especially when considering the Giants' already-thin secondary lost "

   "comment":"Rodgers' pedestrian play of late. The $64,000 question is: What's wrong with Rodgers? Green Bay's Super Bowl-winning quarterback struggled mightily in this contest and hasn't been quite himself since the beginning of last season. I thought it might have been because of a slight shoulder injury he dealt with last year, but he still hasn't recovered. I thought Troy Aikman said it perfectly in this contest when he cited that Rodgers isn't seeing the field clearly. It could be possible that his fame - filming tons of commercials, dating Olivia Munn - could have something to do with it, as it might be taking away from his film study. That's my best guess, as there probably aren't many people who really know what's going on. We can only speculate, but it is clear that Rodgers has regressed. On the other side, "

   "comment":"Rodgers played very well for the first time in quite a while. The bad news for the Packers is that Mohamed Sanu beat them. That's how bad things are for their secondary. Sanu shouldn't beat a powderpuff football team; let alone an NFL playoff contender.    This may have been 1 of the best games of the entire season. Both pass offenses were operating at full force, and neither team was ever out of the game. There were a couple of late lead changes, but at the end of the day, the Falcons came out on top. Still, the Packers have to be happy with how their offense played today. The most impressive part of this game was the fact that the Packers ran a completely 1-dimensional offense and were still able to put up 32 points. The team really did not have a rush offense. Ty Montgomery was surprisingly inactive due to an illness, so the team did not have much in the backfield. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski led the way with 6 carries and 34 yards. Aside from him, the team did not have much, especially if you exclude the 6 carries by Aaron Rodgers. This will continue to be the case until either Montgomery or James Starks returns to the lineup.    With that said, the passing game was simply terrific. Aaron Rodgers had what was by far the best performance of the season. There had been some questions about the veteran quarterback, as he had struggled at times during the 2016 season. Some were wondering if he was starting to decline as he got older. Rodgers was able to silence those critics with his play today. Rodgers went 28-of-38 on the day, throwing for 246 yards, and running for 60 as well. He tossed 4 touchdown passes and single-handedly carried the Packers' offense to victory. Rodgers made numerous sharp throws and finally looked comfortable in the pocket. His offensive line gave him ample time to complete his passes, and it really showed. On all of Rodgers' touchdowns, he threw the ball to the perfect location. One of his best passes came on his touchdown to "

He went 26-of-43 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. Two of the touchdowns came in the fourth quarter, however, and Rodgers had some issues getting the offense moving early. His throws were not bad. Rather, he could not find an open receiver against the Colts' defense. Rodgers was able to move around the pocket effectively as the contest went on, and that really helped him out. Once he did that, the Colts had more trouble following the receivers and Rodgers was able to hit the open man. The performance was not as good as the 1 he had last week against the Falcons, but his play late could have won the game for Green Bay.    Rodgers spread the ball around a fair amount on Sunday. "

   "comment":"Rodgers was in his first year as a starter. However, the NFC North is wide open with the Vikings continuing their losing streak, so the Packers still have a shot to get to the postseason.    The first half of the game felt like you were watching the Big XII, as both defenses couldn't contain the quarterbacks, each of whom threw for more than 200 yards. On the Titans' first offensive play from scrimmage, DeMarco Murray ran untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. Mariota converted a third-and-14 to Tajae Sharpe (3-68-1) and then hit Delanie Walker for 41 yards after he beat Kentrell Brice to get open and shed the tackle. A few plays later, Tennessee went into its bag of tricks as Murray took a handoff and sold a run to convince safety Morgan Burnett to move up; Murray then threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Walker. The Titans quickly got the ball back thanks to a sack from rookie safety Kevin Byard, and Mariota kept torching Green Bay with passes to Walker. To finish the drive, Mariota hit Anthony Fasano, who was wide open, for a short touchdown, which put the Titans up 21-0 at the end of the first quarter. Green Bay got moving with a few receptions to Davante Adams and a pass to Randall Cobb (4-31) to get to the 1-yard line. To end the drive, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson on a slant for the touchdown."

   "comment":"Rodgers was extremely sharp. And this wasn't nearly the final time that the luck factor was on Atlanta's side. The Falcons fumbled twice, but recovered on both occasions. The Packers also had some opportunities at interceptions on instances in which Matt Ryan threw passes up for grabs, but they dropped the potential turnovers. Given that Atlanta's offense is so lethal, the Packers couldn't screw up on offense and blow opportunities on defense. This game could've gone a lot differently, and in most permutations, this wouldn't have been so lopsided.    That said, Ryan is playing on another level. He's resembling Peyton Manning in his prime, and the AFC representative in the Super Bowl will have immense issues dealing with him. Ryan, abusing the Packers cerebrally, went 27-of-38 for 392 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Three of his 11 incompletions were dropped, so his numbers could've looked even better. On the other hand, he made a couple of poor throws that should've been intercepted, but the Packer defensive backs dropped the ball. Ryan will have a tougher matchup in the Super Bowl by default. He won't be battling a stop unit that has absolutely no idea what it's doing. Defensive coordinator Dom Capers seemed utterly clueless and outmatched in this contest, though it didn't help that he lost Micah Hyde in the second quarter and had Morgan Burnett playing at half strength. Still, secondary help is definitely needed. Check out our 2017 NFL Draft Cornerback Prospect Rankings to see whom Green Bay could select this April.    Julio Jones was a monster in the NFC Championship, catching 9 of his 12 targets for 180 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jones dropped a pass, but was otherwise terrific. He made a big catch on third down of the opening drive to move the chains, and he did the same thing in the second half, hauling in an acrobatic grab over the incompetent Packer defenders. So much for that injured toe!    Ryan's 2 other aerial scores went to Mohamed Sanu (5-52) and Devonta Freeman (4-42). Sanu, who came up with a clutch third-and-11 grab to secure a first down, actually played well for once, though the Green Bay secondary was mostly responsible for that. Taylor Gabriel, meanwhile, didn't do much; he caught 2 passes for 24 yards, and he was responsible for a drop of about 15 yards.    The Falcons had a couple of nice runs, but otherwise didn't do very much on the ground. Freeman gained 42 yards on 14 carries, while Coleman managed just 29 yards and a score on 11 attempts.    As for the Packers, Rodgers' stat line looks nice, but he'll be disappointed with this performance. Rodgers finished 27-of-45 for 287 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but all of his scores came in the second half when Atlanta was already winning in a blowout. Rodgers was uncharacteristically off the mark on some of his throws. He also saw more pressure than he's used to. Rodgers didn't recognize what Atlanta was doing with its blitzes, and it also didn't help that the Packers lost both guards in this contest. "

   "comment":"Rodgers simply didn't have to do much, outside of making a few clutch throws to keep possessions alive. The Packers had just 2 lengthy drives that resulted in touchdowns, and 1 came via some impressive Ty Montgomery runs. Yet, Rodgers still was able to fire 4 scores thanks to a trio of Glennon turnovers. Rodgers' final numbers were 18-of-26 for 179 yards and the 4 touchdowns. The tackles impacted a couple of drives in the first half, but Chicago's pass rush as a whole was very underwhelming.    Montgomery, meanwhile, looked like he was going to have a huge game. He rushed for 28 yards on just 5 carries, as he was given the ball on 5 of Green Bay's initial 7 plays. Unfortunately, Montgomery was knocked out of the contest with a rib injury. Montgomery was 1 of several Packer players who left the game. "

The Packers were down by 3, thanks to a pair of missed extra points, but they had about 70 seconds remaining in regulation with 1 timeout.

He was carted into the locker room minutes later, and even though he was listed as questionable to return, he didn't make it back to the field. It was later ruled that Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone, and he'll miss most or all of the season as a result. Check my Disaster Grades for more.

   "comment":"Rodgers impression to draw the Ravens offside. However, the Packers came away with no points because Hundley tossed a stupid interception into double coverage in the end zone. Hundley looked good at times on the next 2 possessions as well, but those drives also ended in turnovers. Hundley threw an interception up for grabs because he was under pressure. After that, backup running back Devante Mays lost a fumble. The Packers were guilty of 3 turnovers on their first 3 drives. The Packers continued to shoot themselves in the foot, ruining their chances to pull the upset. A quality opponent would've taken advantage of that and put the game away, but Baltimore's pedestrian offense couldn't do anything about it. The Ravens were only able to go into halftime with a 6-0 lead, as they averaged only 3.8 yards per play. The offensive line was a mess heading into this contest, so that wasn't a surprise. On 1 drive, the Ravens had a botched snap and a sack. On another, Flacco was picked off on a forced throw to Danny Woodhead. Baltimore generated just 106 yards of offense prior to intermission. Flacco, however, rebounded with a strong second-half effort, taking advantage of Clay Matthews' absence (groin). He found Ben Watson for a big gain, then lofted a beautiful touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, who came up with a 1-handed reception despite some great coverage by Damarious Randall. This put Baltimore up 13-0, which put the game out of reach for the struggling Packers.    Flacco misfired on just 6 passes, going 22-of-28 for 183 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Flacco didn't take too many chances, but it's not like he needed to. With a lead throughout the afternoon, Flacco never had to press, which was a good thing considering that he was missing left tackle Ronnie Stanley.    Wallace led the Ravens with 56 receiving yards on 4 catches with a touchdown. Jeremy Maclin (4-34) was next on the list. Baltimore's receiving numbers were more suppressed than usual because of the flow of the game.    The Ravens struggled to run the ball, with Alex Collins mustering just 49 yards on 20 carries. He was at least able to score a touchdown. Woodhead, meanwhile, did all of his damage as a receiver, catching 5 balls for 21 yards.    As for the Packers, Hundley killed his team by taking big sacks and failing to anticipate throws. His passes were late, and he made too many mistakes. He finished 21-of-36 for 239 yards, 3 picks and a lost fumble. He took a major step backward this week, as he no longer had the luxury of battling a defense missing its star linebacker.    Despite Hundley's struggles, Davante Adams had another strong performance, catching 8 balls for 126 yards. It's clear that Adams is the only receiver Hundley trusts, as Jordy Nelson (2-24) hasn't done anything of note since Aaron Rodgers' injury.    "
