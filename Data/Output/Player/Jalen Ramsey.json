Ramsey in the first half to the tune of 6 receptions for 90 yards. After trading punts in the third quarter, the Bears got moving when they hit Cameron Meredith for 36 yards on a wide receiver screen. Ka'Deem Carey added a 16-yard run to set up a first-and-goal, but the Jaguars held Chicago to 3 points. Jacksonville got moving with passes of 25 and 29 yards to Allen Hurns to set up the Jaguars inside the Bears' 5-yard line to start the 4.h quarter. Chris Ivory soon plunged into the end zone to cut the Bears' lead to 13-7. The Jaguars got the ball back rather quickly, but Willie Young strip-sacked Bortles, and Chicago recovered at Jacksonville's 30-yard line. A Yannick Ngakoue sack held the Bears to another field goal. The Jaguars responded with a field goal drive of their own. They then got the ball with just over 3 minutes at their own 20. After a few completions got the ball to midfield, Bortles hit backup wide receiver Arrelious Benn, who made a sliding catch. Benn was untouched and got up to sprint down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. It was Benn's first score since 2011, when he was playing for Tampa Bay. With about 2 minutes left, Hoyer got moving with a crossing completion to Meredith (11-113), but on a 4.h-and-10, Ramsey came back to break up a pass intended for Jeffery, letting the Jaguars get the ball back.    Ramsey showed his resiliency by holding Jeffery (7-93) to just 1 reception for 3 yards in the final 2 quarters. "

Bortles, meanwhile, continued to do more harm than good, missing an open Julius Thomas for a touchdown and then getting flagged for intentional grounding on a play in which the Raiders were offside. Robinson, meanwhile, spent the afternoon dropping passes, while the special teams were guilty of a muffed punt. The Raiders, meanwhile, did just enough offensively to prevail. Derek Carr went 23-of-37 for 200 yards and a touchdown. He could've thrown a second score, but Clive Walford dropped the ball in the end zone. With the Raiders leading throughout, Carr didn't have to force the issue at all, so he effectively was just a game-manager in this contest, all while the Jaguars melted down in front of his very eyes.    Michael Crabtree was Oakland's only productive receiver in this contest. He caught 8 balls for 96 yards and the only touchdown Carr threw on the afternoon. Amari Cooper didn't do much - 4 catches, 29 yards - but that's because Ramsey was draped all over him.    "
