   "comment":"Martavis Bryant was out of bounds before the second foot landed in the end zone, yet the play was never reviewed. Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal. It's not a matter of whether or not this game was fixed; it's only a question of who happened to pay off Hochuli. </i>    Bruce Arians' homecoming looked like it would be an inevitable win, even though the Cardinals' offense wasn't getting into the end zone, because Mike Vick was so unbelievably bad. At halftime, the Steelers had totaled just 59 yards, while the Cardinals had 279, but astonishingly, the score was 10-3 Cardinals (Editor's Note: Read the previous editor's note to understand why).    Carson Palmer and company were moving the ball with ease through the air, and he and Michael Floyd connected in the first quarter for a 3-yard touchdown. But that was the only touchdown Arizona would score all day. Floyd was called for offensive pass interference, which wiped away what would have been his second touchdown. The Steelers' defense played the epitome of bend, but don't break defense, picking Palmer off twice and stopping the Cardinals on 58 percent of third downs.    Palmer was not his usual, accurate self and relied on some big receptions from his receivers, especially John Brown, who continues to show his immense ability. Brown made catches all over the field on his way to a big day, finishing with 10 receptions on 14 targets for 198 yards. All 3 were career highs for him. The only blemish, and it was an ugly 1. was a fumble which set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Steelers.    Vick was stuck on negative passing yards for most of the first half, and by the time he left in the third quarter, he was 3-for-8 for 6 yards. He ended up leaving due to a hamstring strain or possibly was just benched for Oklahoma Sooners product Landry Jones. Jones had never shown much ability in his 3 years with Pittsburgh, and just the fact that he hadn't taken over for Vick already showed exactly what coaches thought of Jones. But he came to play this week. After Vick went down in the third quarter, Jones quickly showed he should have been in the game the whole time with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant, which put the Steelers up 12-10 after having barely moved the ball all game. And it wouldn't be the last time Jones found Bryant for a touchdown. With a 5.point lead and 2:15 left in the game, Jones hit Bryant on a crossing pattern that he took 88 yards to pay dirt.    Bryant ended up catching 6-of-8 targets for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns in his first game back from suspension/injury, while "

   "comment":"Martavis Bryant.    Coming out of halftime, the Steelers still led 7-6 and drove down the field, but were stalled and had to kick a field goal to make it 10-6. That was the last lead Pittsburgh would have, as Roethlisberger went on to throw 3 interceptions, helping Dalton and company work with shorter fields.    The Bengals' defense coupled with A.J. Green are the MVPs of this game, but Green gets the glory as he caught a 9-yard touchdown with 2:57 seconds left in the game to make it 13-10 Bengals.    Much of Roethlisberger's troubles came after Le'Veon Bell went down, which is somewhat understandable, but Roethlisberger had 2 opportunities to drive his team to a victory, once with 2:57 left, when he threw an interception and then again with 1:47 left, and he came up short both times. I think Pittsburgh fans can chalk this 1 up to rust and a good Cincinnati defense more than Bell's absence.    The Bengals' running backs split was highly in favor of "

   "comment":"Martavis Bryant dropped a pass that was only slightly high.    Having a strong running game to support Roethlisberger was huge. DeAngelo Williams was fantastic, trampling the Colts for 134 yards on 26 carries. Cris Collinsworth gushed all night at how incredible Williams' vision and cutting ability were. He's not even close to the same running back we saw in Carolina. Williams told the media that he finally figured things out; he's now apparently running with his feet instead of his head. It works, apparently, as Williams ripped off quality run after quality run.    The Colts eventually figured out that they couldn't double team "
