   "comment":"Rudolph came up a yard short. After a good punt backed the Raiders up, the defense gave up a first down then killed Oakland's first drive with a sack by Chad Greenway. Christian Ponder (19-of-33 for 211 yards 2 TD 3 INT) has a chance to be a good player and his scrambling ability is a big reason why. He ran 5 times for 71 yards in the game, but came up on the short end because the pass rush was effective in getting him out of rhythm. The Raiders came up with 5 sacks even with Richard Seymour out of the lineup; not to mention Matt Shaughnessy sitting on injured reserve. Tommy Kelly had the first drive stopped with a sack, but clipped Ponder's face mask while taking him down for a 15-yard penalty. Another personal foul, this 1 a questionable call on linebacker Aaron Curry, who merely hit Rudolph squarely after a short gain, set up the Vikings in plus territory. Harvin had a sweet 35-yard touchdown run negated by a hold on wide receiver "

Adrian Peterson had some really tough runs, accumulated 86 yards on 25 carries. Those numbers aren't great on their own, but considering the opponent, they're pretty impressive. Peterson moved the piles and showed tons of heart, continuing to amaze considering the severity of the knee injury he suffered in December.    "

As for the Rams, I made note of Bradford's contract situation in my recently updated : The Rams will probably know what they have in Sam Bradford following the 2013 season. Bradford will be due $14 million in 2014, so St. Louis will either have to give him a new contract or pull the plug. Well, Bradford didn't do anything today to give the front office any sort of confidence in him. His final numbers look great - 35-of-55 for 377 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception - but most of that came in garbage time. He was just 14-of-23 for 148 yards a score and the pick at halftime. His interception was returned for 6. as he didn't see lineman "

   "comment":"Rudolph put together a terrific drive to move the team into short field-goal range. All Blair Walsh had to do was drill a 27-yarder after he connected on 3 longer field goals earlier in the contest. He whiffed, wide left, and it wasn't even close. And just like that, Minnesota's valiant effort in the third-coldest playoff game in NFL history ended in bitter disappointment. It's easy to blame Walsh, and he definitely deserves most of the responsibility for this defeat. However, Adrian Peterson needs to shoulder some of the blame as well. Peterson lost a crucial fumble in the 4.h quarter in his own territory that set up the Seahawks with what turned out to be the game-winning field goal. Peterson, of course, has a history of fumbling, so it wasn't exactly a surprise to see him cough up the ball. He did so at the worst moment possible, as the Vikings, up 9-7, converted a first down and appeared to be gaining momentum. The Seahawks had barely done anything offensively on the afternoon, save for 1 drive, so giving them a gift like that was devastating. Peterson, by the way, couldn't find any room against Seattle's stalwart front, mustering just 45 yards on 23 carries. He was taken off the field following the fumble, but only because Jerick McKinnon is better in the passing game. Mike Zimmer trusted Peterson enough to move his team closer into field-goal position at the very end, but it was all for naught.    Going into the game, I liked the Vikings to keep this contest close, but I wasn't crazy about it to wager more than 3 units on it because Teddy Bridgewater had never been primarily responsible for winning a big game. Bridgewater certainly played well, completing 17-of-24 passes for 146 yards in an environment in which it was incredibly difficult to air it out. Bridgewater played very well. In fact, he could've enjoyed a much better stat line had McKinnon not dropped a deep pass in the first half. If there's a silver lining for Minnesota, it's that Bridgewater took some major steps, especially on the final drive, which bodes well for the future.    Thanks to the sub-zero conditions and Seattle's terrific secondary, Minnesota's leading receiver had just 26 receiving yards. That was Stefon Diggs, who logged 4 catches. Rudolph snatched just 1 pass for 24 yards, but it was a big 1. as it moved the team into field-goal range. Rudolph also drew a big pass interference on "

He was brutal in the first half, going just 4-of-11 for 26 yards. He was nearly picked by a rookie corner and missed an open receiver on a low throw. He was hurt by a dropped deep pass by Charles Johnson, so it's not like he was the only 1 at fault in the early going.    Only 2 Vikings had more than 30 receiving yards. Those were the usual suspects. Rudolph caught 7 passes for 70 yards and a touchdown, while Stefon Diggs hauled in 4 balls for 40 yards."

   "comment":"Rudolph for a first down and followed that up with a delay-of-game penalty when he left the clock expire in the red zone. That 5-yard penalty proved to be huge, as the Vikings needed the yardage because Stefon Diggs was short of the first down on the ensuing catch. If that's not enough, Bradford was later charged with 2 fumbles. One was a botched snap, but the second was a strip-sack in which Bradford didn't feel the blind-side pressure from Clay Matthews. On another occasion, Bradford needed to convert a third-and-9, but threw a short pass that actually ended up being a loss of 2 yards. It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners. A mega congrats to the few who used Thielen. The slot receiver had a huge game, catching 12 passes for a whopping 202 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've scored thrice, but Bradford missed him in the end zone. Thielen's output is a clear indicator of how horrible Green Bay's secondary is. Elsewhere in the Minnesota receiving corps, Stefon Diggs caught 4 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown. Kyle Rudolph, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 53 yards.    With Adrian Peterson out, "
