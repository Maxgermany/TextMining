As for the Rams, I made note of Bradford's contract situation in my recently updated : The Rams will probably know what they have in Sam Bradford following the 2013 season. Bradford will be due $14 million in 2014, so St. Louis will either have to give him a new contract or pull the plug. Well, Bradford didn't do anything today to give the front office any sort of confidence in him. His final numbers look great - 35-of-55 for 377 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception - but most of that came in garbage time. He was just 14-of-23 for 148 yards a score and the pick at halftime. His interception was returned for 6. as he didn't see lineman "

   "comment":"Kyle Rudolph for a first down and followed that up with a delay-of-game penalty when he left the clock expire in the red zone. That 5-yard penalty proved to be huge, as the Vikings needed the yardage because Stefon Diggs was short of the first down on the ensuing catch. If that's not enough, Bradford was later charged with 2 fumbles. One was a botched snap, but the second was a strip-sack in which Bradford didn't feel the blind-side pressure from Clay Matthews. On another occasion, Bradford needed to convert a third-and-9, but threw a short pass that actually ended up being a loss of 2 yards. It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners. A mega congrats to the few who used Thielen. The slot receiver had a huge game, catching 12 passes for a whopping 202 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've scored thrice, but Bradford missed him in the end zone. Thielen's output is a clear indicator of how horrible Green Bay's secondary is. Elsewhere in the Minnesota receiving corps, Stefon Diggs caught 4 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown. Kyle Rudolph, meanwhile, snatched 6 balls for 53 yards.    With Adrian Peterson out, "
