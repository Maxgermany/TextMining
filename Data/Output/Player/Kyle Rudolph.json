That 5-yard penalty proved to be huge, as the Vikings needed the yardage because Stefon Diggs was short of the first down on the ensuing catch. If that's not enough, Bradford was later charged with 2 fumbles. One was a botched snap, but the second was a strip-sack in which Bradford didn't feel the blind-side pressure from Clay Matthews. On another occasion, Bradford needed to convert a third-and-9, but threw a short pass that actually ended up being a loss of 2 yards. It was a pathetic display, emblematic of why Bradford has been a failure of a quarterback when he's been able to play.    I gave congrats to Nelson owners. A mega congrats to the few who used Thielen. The slot receiver had a huge game, catching 12 passes for a whopping 202 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could've scored thrice, but Bradford missed him in the end zone. Thielen's output is a clear indicator of how horrible Green Bay's secondary is.
