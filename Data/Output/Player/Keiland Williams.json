   "comment":"Keiland Williams (9 carries for 44 yards) who took the spot of the almost-traded Jerome Harrison after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor which negated the swap for Philadelphia's Ronnie Brown. Got all that? The backfield tumult resulted in a very uneven rushing attack. If you look at the combination of Morris and Williams, they had a total 94 yards, but almost half of that (49 yards) came on each player's long run of the day. The meat of their carries produced an average of 2.81 yards. Atlanta's running game was similarly stagnant, but they went to it more to help balance the offense. Michael Turner (27 carries for 122 yards) had a big run for 50 yards, leaving his average for the rest at 2.77. Running so much while moving the chains, allowed them to control the ball and the momentum. Meanwhile, Detroit could only convert 1-of-12 third-down attempts. It looked like the Lions would capitalize on home field advantage when Eric Wright intercepted Matt Ryan, setting them up at the Atlanta 15-yard line just minutes into the game. Immediately, John Abraham abused Jeff Backus and sacked Matthew Stafford. After that, linebacker Sean Weatherspoon blitzed and got his own sack. A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference. Two innocuous penalties on Detroit later, Ryan snuck in the ball for a 10-3 lead. It was an exchange they were never able to overcome. The rest of the game was pretty mundane, actually. The Lions immediately answered with a field goal drive, getting the aforementioned long run from Keiland Williams (18 yards) for the pivotal play. An exchange of punts later, with time running out in the first half, the Falcons had a drive getting all their playmakers involved with big plays. Gonzalez, who moved to second on the NFL's all-time receptions list, picked up a 30-yard gain. Turner had a 19-yard run, and Williams (9 carries for 44 yards) who took the spot of the almost-traded Jerome Harrison after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor which negated the swap for Philadelphia's Ronnie Brown. Got all that? The backfield tumult resulted in a very uneven rushing attack.
