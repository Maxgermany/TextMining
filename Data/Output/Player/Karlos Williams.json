He disappointed in terms of running, as he gained just 40 yards on 18 carries, but he bailed out those who started him with a receiving touchdown. He caught 3 balls for 30 extra yards.    The Giants won this game, by the way. They didn't have to do all that much, as the Bills simply self-destructed with penalties. They did a good job of moving the chains, however. They picked up 19 first downs and did a great job of controlling the clock until this contest was well in hand.    "

   "comment":"Karlos Williams vultured 2 touchdowns away from him when he was knocked out with a shoulder injury. Williams gashed the Dolphins' lazy rush defense as well, tallying 110 yards on just 9 carries. McCoy will obviously remain the starter, but Williams has shown that he deserves a healthy workload as well.    As for the Dolphins, they had a very sloppy game. I already mentioned their tackling ineptitude. They also had some horrible drops, and PC Head Coach, at 1 point, showed that he had a degree from the Andy Reid School of Poor Clock Management. PC Head Coach, with 1 timeout in his back pocket, allowed 24 seconds to elapse after a reception deep in Buffalo territory. Because of this, he gave his team just 2 opportunities to punch the ball in, and the team didn't even get a chance to kick a field goal because time expired after a drop on first-and-goal. It was absolutely ridiculous, and if that wasn't enough, PC Head Coach wasted multiple timeouts in the third quarter. Despite this, the Dolphins were in this game until late into the third frme. They trailed by just 5 while driving the ball in Buffalo territory. However, "
