   "comment":"Weddle in the helmet, allowing Pittsburgh to recover deep in San Diego territory.    While recovering those turnovers was huge, the most important element for the Steelers, at least going forward, was their dynamic pass protection. They surrendered just 1 sack to San Diego, and Ben Roethlisbeger pretty much had a clean pocket all evening.    Speaking of Roethlisberger, I was concerned about his ability to play off a concussion. While my worries were validated early on - he had more punt yardage (25) than passing yardage (24) as of the 2.minute warning in the second quarter - he finished strong, going 17-of-26 for 181 yards and a score. And in the third quarter alone, Big Ben converted a third-and-seven, third-and-11, third-and-eight and a third-and-three.    "
