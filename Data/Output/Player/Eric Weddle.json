   "comment":"Eric Weddle in the helmet, allowing Pittsburgh to recover deep in San Diego territory.    While recovering those turnovers was huge, the most important element for the Steelers, at least going forward, was their dynamic pass protection. They surrendered just 1 sack to San Diego, and Ben Roethlisbeger pretty much had a clean pocket all evening.    Speaking of Roethlisberger, I was concerned about his ability to play off a concussion. While my worries were validated early on - he had more punt yardage (25) than passing yardage (24) as of the 2.minute warning in the second quarter - he finished strong, going 17-of-26 for 181 yards and a score. And in the third quarter alone, Big Ben converted a third-and-seven, third-and-11, third-and-eight and a third-and-three.    Willie Parker stole the show in this contest, rushing for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns on 27 attempts. Hines Ward paced the team with 4 receptions and 70 yards.    While Pittsburgh ran the ball extremely well, the Chargers could do nothing on the ground, managing 15 yards on 12 attempts. "

However, a flag came out after the pick, and McAulay announced that prior to the pass there was holding. Once again, Nantz, Simms and Carey were all miffed by the call. There was barely any contact, and it was within 5 yards anyway, so there shouldn't have been any sort of infraction. And if the penalty occurred prior to the pass, why was the flag thrown after the actual interception? Once again, the Broncos took advantage, scoring a touchdown. 3. "
