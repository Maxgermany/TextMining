   "comment":"Brodie Croyle was very impressive in this contest, considering the defense he was going up against. Croyle was 16-of-24 for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns. On a game-tying drive late in the 4.h quarter, Croyle was 4-of-5 for 55 yards. There's little doubt that Croyle is the best quarterback on the Chiefs, but he can't stay healthy. Ironically, Matt Cassel should be back to ruin things next week.    Croyle was very impressive in this contest, considering the defense he was going up against.

Second, good teams can win without their starting quarterback during a short period of time. Just look at the Steelers, who upset the Falcons with Dennis Dixon. The Chiefs just aren't a good team.    Besides, Cassel needs a running game to be effective, which is something Kansas City could not establish Sunday. Croyle was awful (7-of-17, 40 yards), but Cassel isn't very talented either.

The Chiefs just aren't a good team.    Besides, Cassel needs a running game to be effective, which is something Kansas City could not establish Sunday. Jamaal Charles rushed for 40 yards on 10 attempts, while Thomas Jones mustered only 1 yard on 3 carries.    Sorry, Dwayne Bowe fantasy owners. Bowe caught only 1 ball for 3 yards. Croyle could not get Bowe the ball. He nearly hit the stud wideout on a deep pass, but San Diego corner "
