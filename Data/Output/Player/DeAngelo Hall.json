  "comment":"DeAngelo Hall sustained the worst injury of them all, tearing his ACL.    Moving on to the Giants, it's safe to say that they absolutely blew this game. I mentioned the Manning interception at the goal line and Beckham's offensive pass interference, but there were numerous other plays where they made mistakes. Manning was strip-sacked early, but a teammate recovered. Shane Vereen fumbled, which would've led to Washington points had Cousins not screwed up at the end of the first half. Following the break, Manning threw an interception in the red zone, but the officials ruled it to be incomplete for some strange reason. They then weren't prepared for a Redskins fake punt conversion, which ended up costing them 3 points. The Giants blocked a punt after that which would've set them up for at least 3 points, but an unnecessary roughness penalty negated it. And speaking of unnecessary roughness, center ",
