It looked like it could pull off a big road win, but its offense and defense went limp as Denver rattled a string of touchdowns and takeaways. The Broncos went into beast mode and dominated the Redskins with 38 unanswered points. The first half was mostly a defensive strugle. The Broncos' first drive carved up the Redskins to move the ball down the field and Manning threw a short touchdown pass to Wes Welker (6-81). For most of the first half, the teams were trading punts. Alfred Morris (17-93) was running well in the first half including a run of 27 yards to get Washington out of being backed up. Griffin had a big third-down conversion on a pass to Roy Helu (5-11 rushing, 1-14 receiving). Santana Moss dropped a touchdown on a third down, but on the field goal set-up, Denver had 12 men on the field. That gave the Redskins a first down at the 7-yard line. The next play Griffin threw a bullet to Leonard Hankerson (1-7) for 6. Early in the third quarter, Ryan Kerrigan came around the edge to hit Manning's arm and force a fumble. Brian Orakpo recovered the fumble at the Denver 19-yard line. Morris ran the ball in on a few plays to give Washington a touchdown lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Manning get pick-sixed by Hall. Demaryius Thomas (7-75) fell down and the ball floated right to Hall. He coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. Manning answered with a drive down the field that was capped off with a short touchdown run from Montee Ball (11-37). The Broncos' next drive went down to the 1-yard line. On 4.h-and-goal, Manning hit Joel Dreessen (2-9) for a touchdown to tie the game. Sav Rocca soon shanked a punt, which set up Denver at Washington's 35-yard line. The next play was a perfectly called and executed screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. He bolted down the field and weaved his way into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown. Moreno had a big game with 14 carries for 44 yards, 6 receptions for 89 yards and that score. Von Miller then made his presence felt with a strip-sack that was recovered by Derek Wolfe at the Redskins' 24-yard line. That led to a field goal. The Broncos got the ball back and were driving for more points when E.J. Biggers dropped an interception, but Jordan Pugh caught the deflection. Griffin gave it right back 2 plays later as Pierre Garcon fell down and the pass was caught by Chris Harris. Denver put the game on ice with a Demaryius Thomas 35-yard touchdown on short pass. Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to Rahim Moore for his second interception. Manning gave it right back when DeAngelo Hall ripped the ball out of the hands of Thomas for an interception. Hall pick-six of Peyton Manning in the third quarter. It looked like it could pull off a big road win, but its offense and defense went limp as Denver rattled a string of touchdowns and takeaways.

   "comment":"DeAngelo Hall, but the ball luckily skipped in front of the cornerback. Manning will continue to be a decent streamer versus bad defenses.    Manning's touchdowns went to Rueben Randle and Odell Beckham Jr. Each caught 7 balls each for 116 and 79 yards, respectively. Randle's score, a 41-yarder, came very late in which Manning surprised the Redskins with a pass on a third down as he was running out the clock. Randle wasn't even open; there was good coverage, but the ball bounced right into his hands after it was tipped. Beckham, on the other hand, is a legitimate stud receiver, and this sort of production will be typical for him going forward.    Larry Donnell caught 3 passes for 32 yards. He also dropped a pass. He's not worth owning in 12-team leagues that start only 1 tight end.    The Giants struggled to run the ball against Washington's stout front. Rashad Jennings, who contributed with a blocked punt, managed only 32 yards on 11 carries. Andre Williams, meanwhile, mustered only 29 yards on 14 attempts. He scored a touchdown in the first half. Neither is really much of a fantasy option until the other gets hurt. The offensive line just isn't opening holes, and neither back is talented enough to compensate for it.    Shane Vereen, meanwhile, logged 23 yards on 6 carries. He didn't catch a single ball, partly because he dropped a key pass deep in Washington territory. Vereen is just a reserve in PPR formats.    In addition to Lauvao, DeAngelo Hall sustained an injury. He hurt his foot and had to be helped off the field. He couldn't put any pressure on his leg.    One last note: The officials were terrible in this game. They didn't make any shady calls, or anything, but they repeatedly picked up flags they threw. This happened on at least 5 occasions. Additionally, a late Washington touchdown should've been reviewed. It wasn't, and a pissed-off Tom Coughlin threw the challenge flag. At the time, it looked like a dumb move on his part because he was trying to review something illegally, but he was probably just pissed off that the officials were so incompetent. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Hall, but the ball luckily skipped in front of the cornerback.

   "comment":"DeAngelo Hall sustained the worst injury of them all, tearing his ACL.    Moving on to the Giants, it's safe to say that they absolutely blew this game. I mentioned the Manning interception at the goal line and Beckham's offensive pass interference, but there were numerous other plays where they made mistakes. Manning was strip-sacked early, but a teammate recovered. Shane Vereen fumbled, which would've led to Washington points had Cousins not screwed up at the end of the first half. Following the break, Manning threw an interception in the red zone, but the officials ruled it to be incomplete for some strange reason. They then weren't prepared for a Redskins fake punt conversion, which ended up costing them 3 points. The Giants blocked a punt after that which would've set them up for at least 3 points, but an unnecessary roughness penalty negated it. And speaking of unnecessary roughness, center "
