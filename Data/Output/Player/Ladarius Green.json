That's such a long list, comprised of talented play-makers and key blockers, so the 26-point output just shows how porous Baltimore's defense really is. Of course, it didn't help that C.J. Mosley and Kendrick Lewis also got hurt. Philip Rivers was terrific, going 28-of-37 for 301 yards and 3 touchdowns. He only made 1 bad decision, which was flipping the ball carelessly while in field goal range at the end of the game, and the pass was nearly pick-sixed. It was dropped, and San Diego was able to tie the game with about 2 minutes remaining in regulation. Unfortunately for him, his defense betrayed him and couldn't send the game into overtime.    I mentioned that Allen was knocked out. It was a shame for his fantasy owners, as it appeared as though he was on pace for a solid performance. He caught all 5 of his targets for 35 yards and a touchdown in less than a half of action. Rivers' other scores both went to Malcom Floyd (4-92).    Antonio Gates was suspected to be out, but he was a surprise active. It's a good thing he was, as Green (1-10) went down. Gates hauled in 4 passes for 56 yards, some of which were key third-down conversions.    "

   "comment":"Green was the field-stretcher, as he caught 6-of-11 targets for 110 yards and a touchdown. With Sammie Coates still dealing with an injured hand, the Steelers had lost their deep threat, but Green filled that role today. He had receptions of 37, 33 and 20 yards, which was for his touchdown. The receptions and yards were both highs for Green, who had been on injured reserve for much of the season. He's slowly been getting up to speed, and you could see glimpses of his speed and ability to run by linebackers over the last 2 games, but now we're seeing him get a larger share of snaps, which is paying off for the Steelers. If they can get Sammie Coates back and healthy, this offense could be difficult to slow.    "
