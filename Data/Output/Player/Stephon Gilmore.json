   "comment":"Gilmore had an impressive game. He had blanket coverage on Brandon Lloyd on a number of throws to force incompletions. Gilmore helped set up Gronkowski's fumble by holding him up for Byrd. Gronkowski got open running deep down the field during the third quarter, but Gilmore blasted him as he crossed into the end zone to force an incompletion. It wasn't a complete game as Gilmore couldn't hold on for an acrobatic interception and was trucked over on a play in run defense. Still, it was an impressive performance for the rookie.    Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 350 yards with 4 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Stevie Johnson (2-23) saw double coverage, and Fitzpatrick missed him for an easy touchdown. "

   "comment":"Gilmore. Overall, Sunday was a tough day for Dalton, and the loss can partially be blamed on him.    Of course, there was another major reason for Dalton's struggles today. On the second offensive play of the day for the Bengals, A.J. Green left the game with a hamstring injury. He would not return. The stud receiver was writhing around in pain, and it frankly did not look good. The Bengals are fearing that Green tore his hamstring. With Green bound to miss time, look for Tyler Boyd to pick up some extra catches. The rookie looked fairly solid during the contest and emerged as Dalton's top target with Green out. Boyd ended up catching 6 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. This could be the beginning of a strong stretch for the second-round pick. Elsewhere, Brandon LaFell (4-32) and Eifert (3-37) were both decent. LaFell is still just a middling fantasy option at best. If Green is out longer term, LaFell could be a valuable bench asset.    In the running game, Jeremy Hill looked strong for the Bengals. Hill got 16 carries for 62 yards, but he performed better than those numbers. He ripped off a few nice gains and was able to move the pile in short-yardage and red-zone situations. Hill had a nice 20-yard burst that reminded many that he can be explosive when he needs to be. Hill should continue to be the starter for the Bengals. Meanwhile, Giovani Bernard put together a good game as well. He only got 21 yards on 7 carries, but he made an impact in the receiving attack. Bernard was Dalton's top checkdown, recording 5 catches for 40 yards. Unfortunately, Bernard tore his ACL.    The late-game clock management from Marvin Lewis and Andy Dalton was not too good. Dalton had just over 2 minutes to drive the ball down the field without any timeouts. Dalton was able to get the ball moving, but he constantly threw checkdowns over the middle of the field. The team needed a touchdown to have a chance at winning, but as a result of the play-calling, the Bengals were only able to have enough time to try a 30-yard Hail Mary. They were unable to convert as time expired.    Sunday was a bad day for kickers, and Mike Nugent was no exception. He missed both extra points, which were crucial to the outcome. Had Nugent made even 1. the Bengals may have had a chance to kick a game-winning field goal at the end.    For the Bills, this was a big win. However, their offense suffered a blow when they lost their top running back, LeSean McCoy. Late in the second half, McCoy took a carry out of bounds and got hit in the thumb. He grabbed at his hand and headed to the locker room early. He would not return with what was determined a dislocated thumb. Sources are saying that he will be OK and that the injury should not keep him out long. In limited action, McCoy had 5 carries for 33 yards and a touchdown. He waltzed into the end zone untouched on his score as the blocking was perfect. McCoy also had a 20-yard carry where he demonstrated his elusive ability. He is still 1 of the better runners in the league and is the catalyst for the Bills' offense. In McCoy's stead, Mike Gillislee took over as the lead back. He performed relatively well, getting 14 carries and turning them into 72 yards. He helped to run the clock in the second half as well. Gillislee was able to gain yardage on almost all of his carries, and he helped take the pressure off of Tyrod Taylor. If McCoy misses a game, Gillislee is a viable FLEX in all fantasy formats.    Speaking of Tyrod Taylor's performance, he had a mixed day as well. He was definitely better than Dalton, but he still had some issues of his own. In particular this week, Taylor had issues finding open receivers. In his defense, he lost his top receiver Robert Woods to an injury early in the game, so he did not have much to work with. Still, Taylor looked indecisive in the pocket and too often tried to scramble for first downs. It seemed like he was not fully going through his progressions; he just ran if his first option was not open. Taylor also was guilty of staring down his receivers, and that almost resulted in a couple of picks. Taylor's final stat line was as follows: 19-of-27 for 166 yards and an interception. He also scrambled 9 times for 39 yards. Moving forward, Taylor needs to improve his accuracy and hope that his receiving corps can improve in the coming weeks. Otherwise, Taylor could continue to have more issues.    In terms of the Bills' receivers, Woods (3-41) would have posted a big stat line had he not gotten hurt. Woods had a good first quarter and was able to make some nice moves against the Bengals' defenders. After he went down, Brandon Tate (2-48) and Charles Clay (5-23) led the team in receiving. It was a pretty poor day for Buffalo's unit.    Two defenders stood out in the game for the Bills. Stephon Gilmore had a great performance after struggling for the first half of the season. He recorded 2 interceptions and was able to shut down Cincinnati's receivers. On the defensive front, "

   "comment":"Gilmore returning from injury, did a great job of limiting Thomas. It's clear that the film work that Gilmore put in during his time off has clearly paid off, as the Patriots didn't have nearly as many miscommunications in this contest as they did earlier in the year.    The Broncos, who trailed the entire evening, couldn't run the ball very much. C.J. Anderson was limited to just 10 carries, though he managed to turn those into 54 yards, thanks to a 21-yard burst in the opening half. Anderson, as mentioned, scored a touchdown, but Bolles' hold negated it. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
