The Buccaneers kept this close - they led in the second half and had a chance to draw to within 3 during a late red-zone trip - but in the end, the result was the same. The Falcons prevailed, sweeping their NFC South rival.    "

   "comment":"Gerald McCoy and Jacquies Smith came up with sacks, and that led to Washington missing a 47-yard field goal. McCown threw a pass up to Mike Evans for a 51-yard gain to set up another field goal. The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by Roy Helu and Tampa Bay recovered. With a minute remaining before halftime, the Redskins finally finished a drive. Some dump-offs to Alfred Morris moved the ball into Tampa Bay territory. The Bucs sent a blitz, but the Redskins had the perfect play called with a screen to Helu (6-57) that resulted in a 30-yard touchdown. The Bucs took a 13-7 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Michael Johnson had a sack to push back a field goal attempt by the Redskins, and once again, they missed it. McCown took advantage with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Evans, who burned past Tracy Porter. They hooked up again for another score as Evans burned a linebacker for a 56-yard touchdown. The Redskins' offensive line was too porous to give Washington any chance of making a comeback.    McCown completed 15-of-23 passes for 288 yards with 2 scores. Charles Sims led the Bucs on the ground with 36 yards on 13 carries. Vincent Jackson (3-43) is seeing fewer targets, as Evans has emerged as a big-time play-maker.    Griffin finished 23-of-32 for 207 yards with a score and 2 interceptions. Alfred Morris had a solid performance with 96 yards on 20 carries and 2 catches for 36 yards. Griffin missed an opportunity for a big play as he could have had a long touchdown pass of around 60 yards to DeSean Jackson (4-35) in the first half, but he overthrew Jackson in the end zone.    The Bucs' defense got good games from Gerald McCoy (5 tackles, 1.5 sacks), Clinton McDonald (4 tackles, 1 sack), Jacquies Smith (2 sacks), Michael Johnson (1 sack) and Lavonte David (12 tackles).    One of the reasons the Redskins' line struggled was left tackle "

   "comment":"Gerald McCoy are supposed to be the 2 cornerstones of the Tampa Bay defense. They had been taking some heat for being relatively quiet in recent weeks. But David and McCoy both had bounce-back games. David had 2 interceptions and McCoy had 1.5 sacks.    For Philadelphia, Mark Sanchez started at quarterback in place of the injured Sam Bradford but wasn't able to spark the offense. Sanchez completed 26-of-41 passes for 261 yards, with much of his yardage coming after the game already had been decided. Sanchez threw for 2 touchdowns, but was intercepted 3 times.    Philadelphia wasn't able to get much going against Tampa Bay's run defense. "

For the 49ers, they had a terrible play occur that helped the Buccaneers stay in the game. On a punt, rookie wideout "
