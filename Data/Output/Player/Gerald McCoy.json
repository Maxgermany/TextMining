Wilson hit Kearse (2-43) for a 16-yard touchdown and cut the Bucs lead to 21-7. Glennon and James kept things going early in the third quarter to lead Tampa Bay on a field goal drive. After that, the Seahawks' defense shut down the Bucs' offense. Wilson responded with some of his highlight-reel scrambling plays. He made a big throw to convert a third down to Golden Tate (3-29) for 19 yards. Wilson dodged a sack and got 19 more yards on a completion to Doug Baldwin (6-75). Wilson then ran the ball into the end zone on 10-yard run off the read option. At the end of the third quarter, Tate fielded a punt inside the 5-yard line and broke a bunch of tackles to rip off a 71-yard return into Tampa Bay territory. That led to a field goal and cut the Bucs' lead to 24-17. Wilson soon burned a blitz for a 28-yard reception to Baldwin. Kearse made a phenomenal leaping catch for 27-yards to Tampa Bay's 3.yard line, but Wilson threw an ill-advised pass into a crowd that was picked off by Keith Tandy. The Seattle defense forced a 3.and-out, so Wilson had another shot. He hit Zach Miller (3-49) for 26 yards. That set up a 10-yard touchdown strike to Baldwin to tie the game at 24 with just under 2 minutes remaining. The Seahawks' defense then did their job to force overtime. After a Bucs' punt to start the extra period, Marshawn Lynch (21-125) had some good runs including a 14-yarder to convert a third down. He powered the ball down to the 6-yard line, and that set up the game-winning 27-yard field goal for Seattle.    Wilson finished the day 19-of-26 for 217 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He ran for 36 yards and a score. Wilson had some mistakes but was clutch as usual.    Barron had an excellent game for Tampa Bay. McCoy went down with a leg injury in overtime, which could be serious. Once again, the Bucs' defensive line was held without a sack and the lack of pass rush without blitzing continues to hurt Tampa Bay.    Glennon completed 17-of-23 for 168 yards with 2 touchdowns. He protected the ball well and was excellent in the first half, but seemed to get gun shy late in the game. "

McCoy broke his hand, while Foster left with a shoulder and never returned. However, the Rams were moving the chains effectively before they got hurt.    There was a weather delay in this game that lasted about an hour, thanks to afternoon thunderstorms. That begs the question: Why the hell did this contest start at 4:05? As someone who has vacationed in Tampa on multiple occasions during the summer, I could've told the schedule-makers that this was a huge mistake.

McCown threw a pass up to Mike Evans for a 51-yard gain to set up another field goal. The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by Roy Helu and Tampa Bay recovered. With a minute remaining before halftime, the Redskins finally finished a drive. Some dump-offs to Alfred Morris moved the ball into Tampa Bay territory. The Bucs sent a blitz, but the Redskins had the perfect play called with a screen to Helu (6-57) that resulted in a 30-yard touchdown. The Bucs took a 13-7 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Michael Johnson had a sack to push back a field goal attempt by the Redskins, and once again, they missed it. McCown took advantage with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Evans, who burned past Tracy Porter. They hooked up again for another score as Evans burned a linebacker for a 56-yard touchdown. The Redskins' offensive line was too porous to give Washington any chance of making a comeback.    McCown completed 15-of-23 passes for 288 yards with 2 scores. Charles Sims led the Bucs on the ground with 36 yards on 13 carries. Vincent Jackson (3-43) is seeing fewer targets, as Evans has emerged as a big-time play-maker.    Griffin finished 23-of-32 for 207 yards with a score and 2 interceptions. Alfred Morris had a solid performance with 96 yards on 20 carries and 2 catches for 36 yards. Griffin missed an opportunity for a big play as he could have had a long touchdown pass of around 60 yards to DeSean Jackson (4-35) in the first half, but he overthrew Jackson in the end zone.    The Bucs' defense got good games from Gerald McCoy (5 tackles, 1.5 sacks), Clinton McDonald (4 tackles, 1 sack), Jacquies Smith (2 sacks), Michael Johnson (1 sack) and Lavonte David (12 tackles).
