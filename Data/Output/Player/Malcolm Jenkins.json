   "comment":"Malcolm Jenkins showed great hustle to chase down Jackson short of a touchdown, but the wide receiver seemed to be coasting. LeGarrette Blount (5 for -2) was stopped on 3 tries, and on a 4.h-and-goal, Cam Jordan forced Freeman out of bounds. It was an epic fail for Tampa Bay with a bad decision by Greg Schiano not to take the points and terrible play-calling by offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan. The mistakes continued as the Bucs were called for an unsportsmanlike conduct on a pre-snap field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. Brees made Tampa Bay pay by the moving the ball close, setting up "

   "comment":"Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Jason Peters in the first half. Peters was carted off the field with a back injury, and losing him could be a huge blow to the Eagles' offense.    Ryan Mathews led the Eagles with 97 yards on 6 carries and a touchdown. DeMarco Murray had 65 yards on 18 carries.    Tight end Zach Ertz led Philadelphia's receivers with 5 catches for 63 yards. Jordan Matthews (3-14), Darren Sproles (5-31) and Miles Austin (4-52) were contained by Carolina's tough defense.    The Panthers' defense got another excellent game out of defensive tackle Kawann Short. For the second-straight week, Short recorded 2 sacks and caused a lot of disruption in the backfield. Jared Allen also had 2 sacks, including a clutch 1 late in the 4.h quarter. Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Josh Norman all had excellent games for Carolina. Philadelphia's defense received good games from Malcolm Jenkins, Byron Maxwell and Mychal Kendricks."

Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Jason Peters in the first half. Peters was carted off the field with a back injury, and losing him could be a huge blow to the Eagles' offense.    Ryan Mathews led the Eagles with 97 yards on 6 carries and a touchdown. DeMarco Murray had 65 yards on 18 carries.    Tight end Zach Ertz led Philadelphia's receivers with 5 catches for 63 yards. Jordan Matthews (3-14), Darren Sproles (5-31) and Miles Austin (4-52) were contained by Carolina's tough defense.    The Panthers' defense got another excellent game out of defensive tackle Kawann Short. For the second-straight week, Short recorded 2 sacks and caused a lot of disruption in the backfield. Jared Allen also had 2 sacks, including a clutch 1 late in the 4.h quarter. Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Josh Norman all had excellent games for Carolina. Philadelphia's defense received good games from Malcolm Jenkins, Byron Maxwell and Mychal Kendricks."

   "comment":"Malcolm Jenkins. Manning caught fire after that, as he seemed to figure out what the Eagles were doing defensively. He engineered some scoring drives, but his hot streak fizzled when he threw his second of 3 picks, as he telegraphed a throw that was snatched by Malcolm Jenkins. Manning finished 38-of-63, 356 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It certainly wasn't a horrible showing, but his first 2 picks were absolute killers and allowed the Eagles to prevail. Manning is a weak spot on the Giants' roster as it stands, but he's not getting much help from his offensive line. That said, the blocking has been better with "
