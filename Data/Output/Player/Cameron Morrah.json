   "comment":"Morrah 1, Golden Tate 1, Brandon Stokley 1, Ben Obomanu 1). Make it 8 drops if you count Jordan Babineaux's failed attempt at an interception in the first quarter. Jay Cutler tossed the ball right to Babineaux, who couldn't come up with the turnover and perhaps subsequent touchdown. That was the turning point of the game - well, 1 of the 2 - because Chicago scored a touchdown a couple of plays later to make it 14-0. The other turning point was John Carlson's concussion on the second drive of the game. Carlson was a major part of the offensive game plan, and his absence was huge for the Seahawks, who couldn't move the chains whatsoever until the 4.h quarter. In fact, Morrah, Carlson's replacement, had a huge drop later on that same possession.    "
