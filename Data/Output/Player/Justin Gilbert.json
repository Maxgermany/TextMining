   "comment":"Gilbert struggled to cover Wheaton.    I mentioned Shazier earlier. The No. 15 overall pick had a terrific regular-season debut. He made a huge hit on Terrance West, stuffed another running back for a loss and made a pass break-up in the first half, nearly coming away with an interception.   "

   "comment":"Gilbert. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-34) made an awesome 1.handed, back-shoulder reception to give Janikowski an easy 38-yarder. The Browns took a 9-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Carr had a nice drive going with accurate passes to a variety of receivers, but at the 20-yard line, Darren McFadden (12-59 rushing, 4-26 receiving) fumbled the ball after getting blasted by Donte Whitner. Joe Haden caught the fumble in the air and returned it to midfield. On the next play, Brian Hoyer hit a 32-yard pass to Andrew Hawkins. Hoyer then hit tight end Jim Dray for 16 yards to the 5. Hoyer finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Hawkins (7-88). To clinch the win, Austin Howard was knocked back into Carr, who fumbled the ball away. Barkevious Mingo recovered at Oakland's 9-yard line. Ben Tate (15-26) scored to put the game on ice for Cleveland. In the final seconds of the game, Carr threw a short touchdown pass to Holmes (5-69), as he powered through Gilbert for 6.    Hoyer finished 19-of-28 for 275 yards with a touchdown. The Browns really never got into a groove offensively, as they had only 39 yards rushing.    The Browns' defense was the real star of the game. Haden has been criticized for his play this season, but he had a bounce-back performance against Oakland. Haden had 2 impressive pass breakups in the 4.h quarter. He led Cleveland with 9 tackles. "
