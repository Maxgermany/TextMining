   "comment":"Robert Mathis returned the turnover for a touchdown.    Luck played extremely well, save for the near-interception. He finished 27-of-39 for 353 yards and 3 touchdowns, which is impressive considering that he endured countless drops to begin the game. Tennessee's secondary made things easy, however, as the team has major issues both at cornerback and safety. I have them addressing both spots in my .    Luck's touchdowns went to his only reliable players who happen to be healthy at the moment. Hilton caught 7 balls for 133 yards and should've had that second score. "

   "comment":"Robert Mathis. Lewan then false started, and the Titans botched a snap a bit later, which was ruled a false start. On defense, the Titans didn't appear to have their heads in the game either. During 1 instance, 2 players ran into each other, causing a big opening downfield for a big gain. The Titans came into this contest completely overconfident, and it quickly showed, as they fell into a 21-0 hole that they couldn't climb out of. Tennessee did come close, however. The team trimmed the lead to 4 points because the offense caught fire. Following a Colts field goal, the Titans were driving to perhaps tie the game. They once again began committing errors, however. Mariota scrambled for a first down inside the Indianapolis 10-yard line, but the play was called back because of a hold. "
