   "comment":"Winston if they had to go back in time right now. It's a loss-loss either way, really. If they wanted to make the change, they couldn't in real life, which sucks, obviously. If they don't want to swap signal-callers, it just shows that they are stubborn. I wouldn't write off Winston quite yet, or anything, but this was a very disconcerting start to his career.    You have to give credit to Titans general manager Ruston Webster, head coach Ken Whisenhunt, and director of college scouting Blake Beddingfield for trusting their evaluation and plan for Marcus Mariota. The rookie quarterback put on a clinic as the Titans blew out Tampa Bay. Of course, the Bucs passed on Mariota for Jameis Winston, and this game was a terrible start for that decision as Winston struggled, while Mariota was surgical in carving up Tampa Bay. However, you can't put blind faith in Mariota's performance because the Buccaneers' defense was atrocious.    On his first NFL drive, Mariota ripped Tampa Bay on 2 completions. He converted a third-and-10 with a laser to "

   "comment":"Winston has now been the far worse of the top 2 rookie quarterbacks in 2 of the 3 weeks thus far. When time travel becomes possible, Tampa's front office will be the first to use it. Then again, maybe the Texans will go back in time and convince everyone that Marcus Mariota will suck, allowing them to snatch him up at No. 16. </i>    Earl Campbell? Arian Foster? No, it wasn't either of them grinding out yards for the Houston Texans on Sunday. It was Alfred Blue, who ran for 139 yards and a touchdown to help the Texans get their first win of the season. Blue and a strong showing by the defense were the reasons the Texans were able to control the game from start to finish. The Bucs (1-2) were able to convert only 2 runs into first downs and finished the day with 57 yards rushing. The Texans still have a long way to go to contend for a playoff spot, but they, at least, kept their head above water with the victory.    Don't be too fooled by Houston quarterback Ryan Mallett's numbers. He completed 24-of-39 passes for 228 yards with 1 interception and a touchdown. Aside from a quick start, Mallett was rather ordinary. Unless you are desperate for a quarterback, Mallett should not be on your fantasy roster.    Aside from Blue, the other bright spot on Houston's offense was wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. He had 8 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown. He's worthy of being an every-week starting receiver despite the matchup.    Cecil Shorts looked all right in the box score with 6 catches for 58 yards. But don't going putting Shorts onto your fantasy roster. He's just another guy in a very ordinary offense.    For Tampa Bay, rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had a mediocre day. He completed 17-of-36 passes for 261 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winston wasn't as haunted by "

   "comment":"Winston's horrible interceptions, the Panthers could have prevailed if they had shown up completely drunk. </i>    If all you saw was the score of Carolina's victory against Tampa Bay, you would assume the Panthers had a monstrous day on offense. You would be wrong. Carolina's offense wasn't bad by any means, but it was the defense that decided this game. The Panthers scored 27 points off turnovers. They had 5 of them ? 4 interceptions and 1 fumble recovery. That made for an easy day for quarterback Cam Newton and the offense. The victory puts the Panthers (4-0) in great shape as they head into their bye week. Linebacker Luke Kuechly, who has missed the last 3 games with a concussion, should be able to return against Seattle after the bye, and that can only help a defense that already is playing very well.    Carolina cornerback Josh Norman is making an early case for Defensive Player of the Year. Norman had 2 interceptions, including 1 he returned 46 yards for a touchdown. Norman already has 4 interceptions on the season.    Wide receiver Ted Ginn is looking like a player worthy of starting in fantasy. Ginn had only 2 catches, but both of them went for touchdowns. Ginn is known as a deep threat. But, both touchdowns came on short passes. Even when Jerricho Cotchery returns from injury, Ginn still is going to get a fair amount of targets.    The injuries at wide receiver have forced the Panthers to play some young players. Rookie Devin Funchess hasn't stepped up yet though. Funchess was targeted twice and did not have a reception. He's not worth having on your fantasy team.    Running back Jonathan Stewart had a quiet day. Stewart had 50 yards on 10 carries and lost a fumble that tight end Ed Dickson grabbed and ran in for a touchdown. Stewart could have put up bigger numbers, but Carolina elected to rest him and give the carries to Cameron Artis-Payne once the Panthers had a comfortable lead.    Newton continued his steady season on a day when the defense kept handing him good field position. Newton completed 11-of-22 passes for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 51 yards rushing on 12 carries.    For the Buccaneers (1-3), rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had an absolutely dismal day. He was intercepted 4 times and lost a fumble. Winston did put up 287 passing yards and 2 interceptions. But a big chunk of his yardage came after the game was out of hand and the Bucs were throwing on virtually every down.    One of the few bright spots for the Bucs was running back "

   "comment":"Winston, the Bucs won at home for the first time since December of 2013. A victory against Jacksonville might not seem like a big deal, but snapping the home losing streak was important for the Bucs. The victory marked the first time coach Lovie Smith has won a home game. Smith has his share of detractors, but the win (as the Bucs head into a bye week) should silence the doubters for a while.    Martin's 2-year slump appears to be over. He's running the way he did as a rookie in 2012. Martin had his second-straight 100-yard rushing game. He finished with 123 yards on 24 carries and had 3 catches for 35 yards. Martin had 2 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown. The most impressive part might have been that Martin was running behind a make-shift offensive line. Center Evan Smith and left guard Logan Mankins missed the game because of injuries. But replacements Joe Hawley and Kevin Pamphile played well. Martin has turned himself back into a solid fantasy starter the last 2 weeks.    If you're worried about backup Charles Sims cutting into Martin's touches, don't. The Bucs are committed to Martin as their feature back. Sims got 12 carries for 51 yards. But he's being used as a change-of-pace back, often playing on passing downs. Sims had 4 catches for 85 yards, including a crucial 56-yard gain.    Winston bounced back nicely after a 5.turnover game last week. He didn't have a turnover and had the most efficient day of his young career. Winston completed 13-of-19 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown and had a 122.5 passer rating. Those aren't big numbers, but this is the kind of football the Bucs want to play. They want Winston to be a steady game manager. That's exactly what he was against the Jaguars.    Jacksonville's defense did a nice job of shutting down wide receivers "

   "comment":"Winston calmly set up a drive that ended in a 31-yard field goal by Connor Barth. Tampa Bay's defense took care of the rest, shutting down an Atlanta drive in overtime.    Smith has a reputation for being conservative. That's why a decision he made late in regulation was so surprising. Faced with a 4.h-and-1 in his own territory, Smith elected to go for the first down. It didn't work as Doug Martin was stuffed, giving Atlanta the ball at Tampa Bay's 41-yard line with 1:52 remaining. If the Bucs ended up losing, that call would have been questioned endlessly. Instead, we'll give Smith a pass and credit for showing some guts.    Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has taken some recent criticism from fans for not coming up with big plays, but he made 1 against the Falcons. On the final play of overtime, McCoy got to Matt Ryan and tied the quarterback's legs up, forcing an incompletion.    Tampa Bay's defense had a huge outing, forcing 4 turnovers that were converted into 20 points. Rookie middle linebacker Kwon Alexander was a force, coming up with a fumble recovery and an interception.    Winston didn't have a big fantasy day, but he had a solid reality day. He completed 16-of-29 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, Winston didn't throw an interception for the third-straight game, and he showed plenty of poise late in the game.    Atlanta's defense clearly was focused on slowing running back Doug Martin, and that strategy worked. Martin was held to 71 yards on 23 carries, ending his streak of 100-yard games at 3.    With wide receiver Vincent Jackson out with a knee injury, the Falcons were able to devote defensive attention to "

   "comment":"Winston. For the Bucs, the game represented a lost opportunity. Tampa Bay had a chance to get its record to .500 and win back-to-back games for the first time since Lovie Smith took over as coach last year. Tampa Bay was plagued by dropped passes, untimely penalties and the woes in the red zone.    New York quarterback Eli Manning had an up-and-down day. He completed 26-of-40 passes for 213 yards with 2 touchdowns. But Manning was intercepted twice.    Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. continues to be the Giants' best fantasy player. Beckham was targeted 17 times and finished with 9 catches for 105 yards.    The Giants finished with 114 rushing yards, but they were spread out among a committee of running backs. Rashad Jennings led the way with 13 rushes for 48 yards.    For Tampa Bay, dropped passes were the big story of the day. Mike Evans finished with 8 catches for 152 yards. But don't be fooled by the numbers. Evans had a miserable day. Unofficially, Evans dropped 6 passes. If he had made those catches, his numbers would have been outrageous.    With wide receiver Vincent Jackson out with a knee injury, Tampa Bay's receiving corps was pretty much limited to Evans' production. Rookie Adam Humphries had 5 catches for 55 yards, but he's not someone you want on your fantasy team.    Winston showed more maturity than the rest of the Bucs. He had a solid day, completing 19-of-36 passes for 249 yards. Winston's numbers would have been much better if the Bucs didn't drop so many passes. Winston had his 4.h-straight game without an interception and also scored on the rushing touchdown.    Tampa Bay finished with 136 rushing yards, but that total is misleading because 59 of those yards came on a run by "

   "comment":"Winston and running back Doug Martin had huge performances. And it came on a day in which Tampa Bay's defense had no problems with Philadelphia's fast-paced offense. For the Eagles, the lopsided loss at home was embarrassing, but it didn't do all that much harm to their standing in the NFC East. At 4-6, they're only a game behind the first-place New York Giants.    Winston had what was easily the best game of his young career. He threw 5 touchdown passes (to 5 different receivers). Winston tied the rookie record for most touchdown passes in a game and didn't throw an interception. Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 246 yards. With the way, he has played in recent weeks, he now is worthy of being a starter in your fantasy league.    Martin had a monstrous day after being relatively quiet in recent weeks. He finished with 27 carries for 235 yards and cracked the 200-yard mark for only the second time in his career. Martin didn't find the end zone, but he had runs of 84 and 58 yards that set up touchdowns.    Even with "

   "comment":"Winston passed Matt Ryan on the food chain of NFC South quarterbacks. Well, he's still clearly behind Drew Brees. Winston's accuracy was an issue in this contest, though he was still better than Ryan this particular week.    Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver "

   "comment":"Winston. It was Case Keenum, who played the game of his life. Keenum was extremely precise on almost every throw, going 14-of-17 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He began the contest by dinking and dunking, but he made some special passes as the evening progressed. Keenum hit Kenny Britt in stride with a 60-yard bomb in the first quarter. He later showed great touch when lofting a pass over a defender's head to Jared Cook for a 17-yard gain. He then managed to complete another deep pass by threading the needle in between 2 defenders. Keenum made just 2 errors in this contest, both of which occurred on the final drive of the opening half. He had a pass that was dropped by a Tampa defender, and then he took a horrible sack to give his team no chance on a third down. However, those were his only blemishes. It'll be interesting to see how he fares in the next couple of games. If Keenum puts together a pair of quality performances, the Rams may eschew taking a quarterback in the first round, which is what I have happening in my .    As for Gurley, he had trouble finding room against a tough Tampa Bay run defense. He still performed well for his owners, however, as he generated 48 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He was in position for a second score following a Benny Cunningham kickoff return down to the 2-yard line, but he was stuffed on 3 consecutive plays.    Tavon Austin had a spectacular night. He scored twice; once rushing and once receiving. He compiled 32 rushing yards (4 carries) and 41 receiving yards (3 catches). It actually makes me wonder why he touched the ball just 7 times.    St. Louis' 2 leading receivers were Britt (2-71, TD) and Cook (4-64). It was surprising to see both try hard. They must have been motivated because they didn't want to embarrass themselves on national TV.    Moving on to the Buccaneers, Winston struggled, despite what his numbers may say. Winston went 29-of-50 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Those stats are completely misleading, as Winston was just 6-of-12 for 49 yards at halftime. A large chunk of his yardage, as well as both scores, came in garbage time. Winston was very inaccurate throughout the evening. He sailed passes over his receivers' heads, including "

This contest truly came down to Carr just outplaying everyone, including his own team. Would he have needed 59 pass attempts and 513 yards passing if his team hadn't put them in a hole by 200 yards? They did though, but he put them on his back. There were mistakes, don't get me wrong. When you pass 59 times, you will make mistakes, but going on the road and playing that well while your team sabotages you, that's the sign of a very good quarterback.    "

   "comment":"Winston finished 24-of-39 for 331 yards and a touchdown. The result may surprise many, but Marcus Peters wasn't playing in this game, which was a big factor. The Chiefs lost Sean Smith this offseason, but still had a great corner in Peters. He was set to cover Evans, but wasn't around to do so. As a result, Evans had a big performance, catching 6 of 13 targets for 105 yards. He didn't reach the end zone, but came very close; Steven Nelson knocked a potential touchdown out of Evans' hands at the last second in the opening half.    Despite Evans having a big performance, Winston was able to spread the ball around very well, as he had a strong afternoon following a weird fumble on the opening drive in the red zone, where the ball inexplicably slipped out of his hands. Winston was almost picked off in the end zone as well, but improved as the afternoon progressed. Including Evans, 5 Buccaneers reeled in at least 3 receptions. "

   "comment":"Winston was the long-term pro. Brees had a pretty rough outing, going 25-for-41 with 257 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. He struggled with accuracy throughout the whole day. He missed numerous big plays, but none were more important than a couple of deep passes for Brandin Cooks. In the second quarter, Cooks had his man beaten for what would have been a touchdown. Brees saw Cooks streaking over the middle of the field and lofted a pass toward the end zone. Brees put it a step in front of Cooks, however, and the speedy receiver could not get to it in time. It was a throw that Brees definitely should have made, and it was indicative of the larger problems he had during the day. Moving forward, Brees has to improve his accuracy. He simply has not looked good this season, and maybe he is just on the decline. The turnovers and missed opportunities really played a major part in the loss.    Despite Brees' accuracy issues, New Orleans' receiving corps was able to have some success. Three receivers saw 8 or more targets. They were Cooks (5-61), Willie Snead (6-85) and Brandon Coleman (5-47). Cooks saw the most targets with 10, but as mentioned earlier, Brees had some issues connecting with him. Cooks was overthrown on 1 potential touchdown throw and then dropped another 1 later in the contest. Cooks is still a low-end WR1 in fantasy, but if Brees cannot get better, Cooks' upside will be limited. Snead was probably the most impressive Saints receiver on the day. He worked over the middle of the field and had a lot of success doing so. He is becoming 1 of the better slot men in the league, and is a worthy WR3/FLEX in most matchups. Meanwhile, Coleman only saw significant action because rookie Michael Thomas missed the game with a foot injury. Most weeks, Coleman is just a red-zone threat, at the best.    On the ground, the Saints were a major disappointment. Mark Ingram suited up despite concerns over a toe injury, but he was not productive at all. He got 7 carries, yet only managed 14 yards. Backup Tim Hightower was much better than Ingram. Hightower saw 6 carries and turned them into 31 yards. He looked strong bursting through the line, and he definitely outplayed Ingram. Hightower should have a chance to be the starter moving forward.    Defensively, the Saints actually put together a strong performance. Rookie safety Vonn Bell looked good and so did Cameron Jordan. The team needs to add more talent at the corner position, but the Saints have some young talent they can build around.    For the Buccaneers, this win was huge. The Redskins had won earlier in the day, so the Buccaneers had to win to keep control of their own destiny. They were able to do just that, and Jameis Winston really helped his team to do so. Winston did not put together a great stat line, as he went 16-of-26 for 184 yards, but he really did a lot more for his team than the stats suggest. Winston put all of his throws right on the money for his receivers. He threw the balls nicely and put just the right amount of speed on them. He also was able to throw a couple of nice touch passes and simply demonstrated a great knowledge of how to toss a ball. That said, Winston still made some mistakes. Notably, he missed "

   "comment":"Winston didn't have the greatest performance. He began the game well, scrambling around on a third-and-10 to find Adam Humphries, which set up a field goal. However, Winston then was guilty of 2 turnovers; 1 was an interception tipped off Humphries' hands, while the second was a strip-sack in Carolina territory, as he held on to the ball too long. Winston was also very fortunate to get away with a pick at the end of the game when he foolishly threw the ball up for grabs into the end zone while getting hit. It was a tie game, and the Buccaneers were in kicking range, so it's not like Winston had to force anything. The ball fell incomplete, however, and Winston managed to throw a touchdown shortly after. The score turned out to the the game-winner, as the Panthers failed on a 2.point try on the next drive with only a few seconds remaining in regulation. Winston ended up 20-of-35 for 202 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and his fumble. He didn't look very good, perhaps because he was missing his security blanket, Cameron Brate. Humphries took over in that role, snatching 10 balls for 94 yards, but as mentioned, he was responsible for Winston's interception.    Aside from Humphries, only 2 Buccaneers caught multiple passes: "

   "comment":"Winston. On Sunday, Glennon didn't do much to prove his case as a starter. Glennon started off the day fine, completing his first 6 passes, but from there, things fell apart. Glennon threw a couple of ugly interceptions. For the first, he fired directly into double coverage and completely missed his receiver. On his second pick, he stared down his receiver, underthrew him, and happened to hit the corner, who was breaking on the route, right in the hands. The Buccaneers returned it for a pick-six. Overall, Glennon finished 31-for-45 with 301 yards and a touchdown. However, he had the 2 picks and racked up a lot of garbage-time stats, so the numbers are misleading. He stuck mostly to the short and intermediate passing game, but his accuracy simply wasn't there. Glennon shouldn't be the starter for long in Chicago, as Mitchell Trubisky offers more upside at this point in his career. It's unknown why John Fox didn't put Trubisky in late to give the rookie some action in the blowout.    Of course, it didn't help Glennon's cause that he had practically nothing to work with in the receiving corps. Without Cameron Meredith and Kevin White, Glennon's top options were Kendall Wright (7-69) and Josh Bellamy (4-51). Both flashed the ability to function as a capable receiver at times, but neither should be more than a tertiary option for a successful team. Also, a good chunk of Chicago's yardage came during garbage time. Tight end Zach Miller (6-42) was largely a non-factor outside of garbage time.    The Bears' run offense was better than the passing offense, but only by default. The real story of the game for the team was Tarik Cohen. The rookie had a fantastic performance in the first week of the NFL season, and he followed it up with a solid Week 2. Cohen didn't do much on the ground, seeing 7 carries and totaling 13 yards, but he made an impact as a receiver. He had 8 catches for 55 yards and looked like an elusive, Darren Sproles-esque play-maker. The only negative for Cohen was a fumble he had on a punt return. He fielded a punt that rolled to him near his own 10. He should have let it go, but picked it up and was stripped. Still, Cohen needs to get more snaps ahead of the disappointing Jordan Howard (9 carries, 7 yards) and could be a FLEX play most weeks.    The Bears suffered what seemed to be a lot of injuries in this contest, and it appears like that the team is going to have trouble on the offensive line. Kyle Long missed the game due to injury, and Josh Sitton came out late with a malady of his own. They are the 2 best linemen on the team, and the offense can ill afford to lose them.    For the Buccaneers, this was an excellent way to start off their season. After missing Week 1 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Bucs' offense looked like they hadn't missed a beat. Jameis Winston was sharp in his first start of the season. The third-year quarterback showed off his strong arm and was very accurate for a majority of the contest. He was under pressure at times due to the mediocre play of left tackle "

   "comment":"Winston was able to lead his team down the field on a last-minute drive, setting up a Nick Folk field goal as time expired. That said, it shouldn't have come down to that. Folk missed 7 points' worth of kicks, though the FOX announcing crew, which featured both Tiki and Ronde Barber, blamed Folk's poor performance on the sloppy field surface, which was messed up because of a heavy downpour at kickoff. Why the NFL scheduled a 4 p.m. start time in the lightning capital of the world, I have no idea. At any rate, Mike Evans missed out on some opportunities as well. He appeared to have a touchdown in the second quarter, but the play was overturned by replay review. Evans also had several drops, including a potential 18-yard reception and another possible touchdown. Despite this, the Buccaneers prevailed, as Folk overcame his earlier troubles to nail the decisive 34-yard kick.    Winston went 22-of-38 for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, Winston should've had a 4.h score to Evans. He had a strong performance, considering the mistakes his teammates made. He had some odd misfires, but his game-winning drive at the end more than made up for it. He keeps improving, as it seems as though he's making the next step in his career to becoming an elite quarterback.    Evans, meanwhile, really needs to clean up his drops. He caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a touchdown, but he easily could've found the end zone thrice in this game. He converted fewer than half of his 11 targets, as he was extremely inefficient.    Tampa's leader in receiving yards was "

   "comment":"Winston were 100 percent, and that seemed to be the case. Yet, Buffalo won, which was impressive.    The Bills entered as the top scoring defense in the league, but they struggled defending Jameis Winston. The Bills' offense, however, along with a timely 4.h-quarter takeaway, gave Buffalo a late win to help the team improve to 4-2. Conversely, the Bucs lost their fifth-straight road game going back to last year, and fell to 2-4 on the season. The Buccaneers' defensive issues, including poor pass rush and run defense, were painful as they had no answer for "

   "comment":"Winston. The third-year pro was expected to make the leap this year, but that hasn't happened yet. Against the Saints, he demonstrated that he wasn't ready to compete, though that could be due to injury. Winston played only the first half of the contest against the Saints. He went out just before halftime after being driven into the turf on a hit from a defender. Winston aggravated the shoulder injury that has been troubling him in recent weeks. Still, when he was on the field, he wasn't particularly good. Winston only went 7-of-13 for 67 yards. He didn't have the same arm strength that we're accustomed to seeing from him, and he was limited to short passes for most of the day. This was probably due to his shoulder injury, which has been bothering him for weeks. At the same time, Winston just doesn't look comfortable in the pocket and has held the ball for too long repeatedly as he tries to do too much on most plays. That was on display Sunday, as he took 2 sacks and made some risky throws. Despite being out for the second half, Winston did have an impact on the game. It happened to be a negative 1. In the third quarter, Winston came off the bench to poke fun at Saints rookie "
