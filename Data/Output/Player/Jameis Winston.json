   "comment":"Jameis Winston if they had to go back in time right now. It's a loss-loss either way, really. If they wanted to make the change, they couldn't in real life, which sucks, obviously. If they don't want to swap signal-callers, it just shows that they are stubborn. I wouldn't write off Winston quite yet, or anything, but this was a very disconcerting start to his career.    You have to give credit to Titans general manager Ruston Webster, head coach Ken Whisenhunt, and director of college scouting Blake Beddingfield for trusting their evaluation and plan for Marcus Mariota. The rookie quarterback put on a clinic as the Titans blew out Tampa Bay. Of course, the Bucs passed on Mariota for Jameis Winston, and this game was a terrible start for that decision as Winston struggled, while Mariota was surgical in carving up Tampa Bay. However, you can't put blind faith in Mariota's performance because the Buccaneers' defense was atrocious.    On his first NFL drive, Mariota ripped Tampa Bay on 2 completions. He converted a third-and-10 with a laser to "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston has now been the far worse of the top 2 rookie quarterbacks in 2 of the 3 weeks thus far. When time travel becomes possible, Tampa's front office will be the first to use it. Then again, maybe the Texans will go back in time and convince everyone that Marcus Mariota will suck, allowing them to snatch him up at No. 16. </i>    Earl Campbell? Arian Foster? No, it wasn't either of them grinding out yards for the Houston Texans on Sunday. It was Alfred Blue, who ran for 139 yards and a touchdown to help the Texans get their first win of the season. Blue and a strong showing by the defense were the reasons the Texans were able to control the game from start to finish. The Bucs (1-2) were able to convert only 2 runs into first downs and finished the day with 57 yards rushing. The Texans still have a long way to go to contend for a playoff spot, but they, at least, kept their head above water with the victory.    Don't be too fooled by Houston quarterback Ryan Mallett's numbers. He completed 24-of-39 passes for 228 yards with 1 interception and a touchdown. Aside from a quick start, Mallett was rather ordinary. Unless you are desperate for a quarterback, Mallett should not be on your fantasy roster.    Aside from Blue, the other bright spot on Houston's offense was wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. He had 8 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown. He's worthy of being an every-week starting receiver despite the matchup.    Cecil Shorts looked all right in the box score with 6 catches for 58 yards. But don't going putting Shorts onto your fantasy roster. He's just another guy in a very ordinary offense.    For Tampa Bay, rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had a mediocre day. He completed 17-of-36 passes for 261 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winston wasn't as haunted by "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston's horrible interceptions, the Panthers could have prevailed if they had shown up completely drunk. </i>    If all you saw was the score of Carolina's victory against Tampa Bay, you would assume the Panthers had a monstrous day on offense. You would be wrong. Carolina's offense wasn't bad by any means, but it was the defense that decided this game. The Panthers scored 27 points off turnovers. They had 5 of them ? 4 interceptions and 1 fumble recovery. That made for an easy day for quarterback Cam Newton and the offense. The victory puts the Panthers (4-0) in great shape as they head into their bye week. Linebacker Luke Kuechly, who has missed the last 3 games with a concussion, should be able to return against Seattle after the bye, and that can only help a defense that already is playing very well.    Carolina cornerback Josh Norman is making an early case for Defensive Player of the Year. Norman had 2 interceptions, including 1 he returned 46 yards for a touchdown. Norman already has 4 interceptions on the season.    Wide receiver Ted Ginn is looking like a player worthy of starting in fantasy. Ginn had only 2 catches, but both of them went for touchdowns. Ginn is known as a deep threat. But, both touchdowns came on short passes. Even when Jerricho Cotchery returns from injury, Ginn still is going to get a fair amount of targets.    The injuries at wide receiver have forced the Panthers to play some young players. Rookie Devin Funchess hasn't stepped up yet though. Funchess was targeted twice and did not have a reception. He's not worth having on your fantasy team.    Running back Jonathan Stewart had a quiet day. Stewart had 50 yards on 10 carries and lost a fumble that tight end Ed Dickson grabbed and ran in for a touchdown. Stewart could have put up bigger numbers, but Carolina elected to rest him and give the carries to Cameron Artis-Payne once the Panthers had a comfortable lead.    Newton continued his steady season on a day when the defense kept handing him good field position. Newton completed 11-of-22 passes for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 51 yards rushing on 12 carries.    For the Buccaneers (1-3), rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had an absolutely dismal day. He was intercepted 4 times and lost a fumble. Winston did put up 287 passing yards and 2 interceptions. But a big chunk of his yardage came after the game was out of hand and the Bucs were throwing on virtually every down.    One of the few bright spots for the Bucs was running back "

A victory against Jacksonville might not seem like a big deal, but snapping the home losing streak was important for the Bucs. The victory marked the first time coach Lovie Smith has won a home game. Smith has his share of detractors, but the win (as the Bucs head into a bye week) should silence the doubters for a while.    Martin's 2-year slump appears to be over. He's running the way he did as a rookie in 2012. Martin had his second-straight 100-yard rushing game. He finished with 123 yards on 24 carries and had 3 catches for 35 yards. Martin had 2 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown. The most impressive part might have been that Martin was running behind a make-shift offensive line.

   "comment":"Jameis Winston passed Matt Ryan on the food chain of NFC South quarterbacks. Well, he's still clearly behind Drew Brees. Winston's accuracy was an issue in this contest, though he was still better than Ryan this particular week.    Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver Marques Colston caught 2 touchdown passes. Colston, who has been quiet most of the season, finished with 6 receptions. But don't go grabbing Colston for your fantasy team. He finished with only 36 receiving yards, and his 2 touchdowns were a case of being in the right place at the right time. Willie Snead remains the best fantasy option in New Orleans' receiving corps. Snead finished with 7 catches for 122 yards.    The big fantasy question coming into the game was who would pick up the slack for injured running back Mark Ingram. The answer was not C.J. Spiller, whom many expected to take on an increased role. Spiller had only 2 rushing yards on 3 carries. Instead, the Saints turned to Tim Hightower. He finished with 85 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries. That 3.0-yard average might not sound impressive, but Hightower was effective as the Saints were running out the clock.    For the Bucs, there weren't a lot of bright spots from a fantasy perspective because the offense had a bad day. Running back Doug Martin was the most solid producer. He had 81 rushing yards and a touchdown. But Martin was limited to 11 carries as the Bucs turned to the passing game to try to catch up in the second half.    Rookie quarterback Jameis Winston, who had played well in recent weeks, did not have a good day against a bad defense. Winston struggled with accuracy, completing 18-of-32 passes for 182 yards and 1 touchdown.    The Saints did a good job containing "

Winston made an early interception that appeared to be no 1 in particular - I'm still trying to figure out what happened - but the Falcons had no answer for him after that. Winston misfired on just 3 occasions following intermission. Winston finished 23-of-33 for 281 yards, 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception.

   "comment":"Jameis Winston hit Mike Evans for 19 yards and Adam Humphries (9-100) for 31 yards. Winston to Evans later converted a 4.h down to set up a short touchdown run from Charles Sims. After Lavonte David forced a fumble from Kenny Britt, Chris Conte recovered for Tampa Bay just across midfield. Winston went after Mark Barron again to set up a first-and-goal with a 20-yard completion to Cameron Brate. The next play was Winston hitting Brate (5-46-2) on a rollout for a short touchdown. After a T.J. McDonald sack, Trumaine Johnson deflected a pass and Barron got some revenge by catching the errant ball for an interception. That set up Los Angeles at the Tampa Bay 22-yard line. The Bucs committed some penalties, and the Rams moved it the goal line before Todd Gurley powered in from a yard out. The Bucs took a 20-17 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Tampa had a good drive going before Aquayo missed a 41-yard field goal. That miss gave the Rams some juice as Gurley rolled over the Tampa Bay defense. He had a tremendous stumbling run of 16 yards to get to the 1-yard line before he finished it off with another goal-line score. That gave Los Angeles a 24-20 lead going into the 4.h quarter. The Bucs moved the ball into the red zone thanks to completions to Evans. However, on a third down, Robert Quinn beat left tackle Donovan Smith to strip Winston of the ball. Rams defensive tackle Ethan Westbrooks scooped up the fumble and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown. With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston. One came on the first possession for the Buccaneers and seemed to discourage the young quarterback. Talib ultimately helped to shut down Mike Evans. which was huge for the Broncos. Elsewhere, Denver was able to sack Winston on a whopping 5 occasions. Derek Wolfe led the way, getting to Winston 2.5 times. Wolfe is a force to be reckoned with, and he may now be the best 3-4 end in all of the NFL. Shaq Barrett and Sylvester Williams each contributed 1 sack, while Von Miller was able to record a half sack on the day.    For Tampa Bay, the offense was just abysmal. The Bucs battled 1 of the league's top defensive units and lost miserably. As mentioned earlier, Jameis Winston was constantly under pressure and just could not get anything done in the passing game. He finished the day a lowly 17-of-35 for 179 yards and threw the 2 picks. On the bright side, Winston did manage to scramble for the team's lone touchdown. Though he made some poor throws, the entire performance was hardly his fault. Every single time Winston dropped back, a Broncos player immediately broke through the line. The Buccaneers have to do something about this issue, or Winston's confidence may get rattled again in the future. Or worse, he could get hurt. Because of the problems on the offensive line, Tampa Bay's receiving corps did not do much outside of garbage time. The team was led in receiving by tight end "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston came into this game having put up strong numbers against weak defenses, but today he only completed 50 percent of his passes for 180 yards. He did throw for 2 touchdowns, but with so many second chances and the Raiders' secondary allowing the most passing yards coming into the afternoon, it was a disappointing showing.    This contest truly came down to Carr just outplaying everyone, including his own team. Would he have needed 59 pass attempts and 513 yards passing if his team hadn't put them in a hole by 200 yards? They did though, but he put them on his back. There were mistakes, don't get me wrong. When you pass 59 times, you will make mistakes, but going on the road and playing that well while your team sabotages you, that's the sign of a very good quarterback.    "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston, for some strange reason, rolled out on a 2.point conversion, down 40-20 in the 4.h quarter. He was absolutely crushed, twisting around awkwardly. He looked like he was in severe pain, and he was knocked out for the evening. The good news is that Winston has 10 days to recover, but I don't understand why he would be doing that in such a circumstance. Winston had a decent game for the most part, going 23-of-37 for 261 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was very strong in the early going, but slowed down once Hawley left the field, and understandably so, given how important the center position is.    "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston was guilty of an early interception where he fired behind his receiver, and the turnover was taken back into the red zone. Winston settled down after that, however, and he was able to put forth a strong second half, going 11-of-15 for 175 yards and a touchdown following intermission. Winston's final numbers were impressive: 23-of-33 for 312 yards, 2 touchdowns and the early pick. Winston's best moment is 1 you'll likely see on <i>SportsCenter</i>.

   "comment":"Jameis Winston was the long-term pro. Brees had a pretty rough outing, going 25-for-41 with 257 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. He struggled with accuracy throughout the whole day. He missed numerous big plays, but none were more important than a couple of deep passes for Brandin Cooks. In the second quarter, Cooks had his man beaten for what would have been a touchdown. Brees saw Cooks streaking over the middle of the field and lofted a pass toward the end zone. Brees put it a step in front of Cooks, however, and the speedy receiver could not get to it in time. It was a throw that Brees definitely should have made, and it was indicative of the larger problems he had during the day. Moving forward, Brees has to improve his accuracy. He simply has not looked good this season, and maybe he is just on the decline. The turnovers and missed opportunities really played a major part in the loss.    Despite Brees' accuracy issues, New Orleans' receiving corps was able to have some success. Three receivers saw 8 or more targets. They were Cooks (5-61), Willie Snead (6-85) and Brandon Coleman (5-47). Cooks saw the most targets with 10, but as mentioned earlier, Brees had some issues connecting with him. Cooks was overthrown on 1 potential touchdown throw and then dropped another 1 later in the contest. Cooks is still a low-end WR1 in fantasy, but if Brees cannot get better, Cooks' upside will be limited. Snead was probably the most impressive Saints receiver on the day. He worked over the middle of the field and had a lot of success doing so. He is becoming 1 of the better slot men in the league, and is a worthy WR3/FLEX in most matchups. Meanwhile, Coleman only saw significant action because rookie Michael Thomas missed the game with a foot injury. Most weeks, Coleman is just a red-zone threat, at the best.    On the ground, the Saints were a major disappointment. Mark Ingram suited up despite concerns over a toe injury, but he was not productive at all. He got 7 carries, yet only managed 14 yards. Backup Tim Hightower was much better than Ingram. Hightower saw 6 carries and turned them into 31 yards. He looked strong bursting through the line, and he definitely outplayed Ingram. Hightower should have a chance to be the starter moving forward.    Defensively, the Saints actually put together a strong performance. Rookie safety Vonn Bell looked good and so did Cameron Jordan. The team needs to add more talent at the corner position, but the Saints have some young talent they can build around.    For the Buccaneers, this win was huge. The Redskins had won earlier in the day, so the Buccaneers had to win to keep control of their own destiny. They were able to do just that, and Jameis Winston really helped his team to do so. Winston did not put together a great stat line, as he went 16-of-26 for 184 yards, but he really did a lot more for his team than the stats suggest. Winston put all of his throws right on the money for his receivers. He threw the balls nicely and put just the right amount of speed on them. He also was able to throw a couple of nice touch passes and simply demonstrated a great knowledge of how to toss a ball. That said, Winston still made some mistakes. Notably, he missed "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston. On Sunday, Glennon didn't do much to prove his case as a starter. Glennon started off the day fine, completing his first 6 passes, but from there, things fell apart. Glennon threw a couple of ugly interceptions. For the first, he fired directly into double coverage and completely missed his receiver. On his second pick, he stared down his receiver, underthrew him, and happened to hit the corner, who was breaking on the route, right in the hands. The Buccaneers returned it for a pick-six. Overall, Glennon finished 31-for-45 with 301 yards and a touchdown. However, he had the 2 picks and racked up a lot of garbage-time stats, so the numbers are misleading. He stuck mostly to the short and intermediate passing game, but his accuracy simply wasn't there. Glennon shouldn't be the starter for long in Chicago, as Mitchell Trubisky offers more upside at this point in his career. It's unknown why John Fox didn't put Trubisky in late to give the rookie some action in the blowout.    Of course, it didn't help Glennon's cause that he had practically nothing to work with in the receiving corps. Without Cameron Meredith and Kevin White, Glennon's top options were Kendall Wright (7-69) and Josh Bellamy (4-51). Both flashed the ability to function as a capable receiver at times, but neither should be more than a tertiary option for a successful team. Also, a good chunk of Chicago's yardage came during garbage time. Tight end Zach Miller (6-42) was largely a non-factor outside of garbage time.    The Bears' run offense was better than the passing offense, but only by default. The real story of the game for the team was Tarik Cohen. The rookie had a fantastic performance in the first week of the NFL season, and he followed it up with a solid Week 2. Cohen didn't do much on the ground, seeing 7 carries and totaling 13 yards, but he made an impact as a receiver. He had 8 catches for 55 yards and looked like an elusive, Darren Sproles-esque play-maker. The only negative for Cohen was a fumble he had on a punt return. He fielded a punt that rolled to him near his own 10. He should have let it go, but picked it up and was stripped. Still, Cohen needs to get more snaps ahead of the disappointing Jordan Howard (9 carries, 7 yards) and could be a FLEX play most weeks.    The Bears suffered what seemed to be a lot of injuries in this contest, and it appears like that the team is going to have trouble on the offensive line. Kyle Long missed the game due to injury, and Josh Sitton came out late with a malady of his own. They are the 2 best linemen on the team, and the offense can ill afford to lose them.    For the Buccaneers, this was an excellent way to start off their season. After missing Week 1 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Bucs' offense looked like they hadn't missed a beat. Jameis Winston was sharp in his first start of the season. The third-year quarterback showed off his strong arm and was very accurate for a majority of the contest. He was under pressure at times due to the mediocre play of left tackle "

   "comment":"Jameis Winston. The third-year pro was expected to make the leap this year, but that hasn't happened yet. Against the Saints, he demonstrated that he wasn't ready to compete, though that could be due to injury. Winston played only the first half of the contest against the Saints. He went out just before halftime after being driven into the turf on a hit from a defender. Winston aggravated the shoulder injury that has been troubling him in recent weeks. Still, when he was on the field, he wasn't particularly good. Winston only went 7-of-13 for 67 yards. He didn't have the same arm strength that we're accustomed to seeing from him, and he was limited to short passes for most of the day. This was probably due to his shoulder injury, which has been bothering him for weeks. At the same time, Winston just doesn't look comfortable in the pocket and has held the ball for too long repeatedly as he tries to do too much on most plays. That was on display Sunday, as he took 2 sacks and made some risky throws. Despite being out for the second half, Winston did have an impact on the game. It happened to be a negative 1. In the third quarter, Winston came off the bench to poke fun at Saints rookie "
