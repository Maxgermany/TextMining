   "comment":"Spencer Ware, and sure enough, that's exactly what they did. West gained 35 yards on 9 carries, while Ware tallied 26 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries. Ware nearly scored again, but was stuffed on a goal-line carry.    Going back to the Raiders, Carr looked great at times, finishing 31-of-48 for 283 yards and 2 touchdowns. He endured some drops as well, so he could've had a much better performance. However, those 3 interceptions were absolute killers and single-handedly (triple-handedly?) swung the game in Kansas City's favor.    Both Cooper and Crabtree had games to forget. Cooper, who caught 4 passes for 69 yards, dropped a 4.h-down reception early on and then was responsible for Carr's pick-six. Crabtree, on the other hand, logged 5 catches for 45 yards and a touchdown, but was guilty of several drops.    "

Before I move on to Oakland, I need to give Andy Reid a shoutout for trying a fake field goal up 23-10 with a few minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. The attempt failed, and Oakland was able to score a back-door touchdown as a result, helping me win 4 units.    "

Smith just doesn't have the physical skill set to beat superior opponents. Of course, it didn't help that he was missing his 2 starting guards. J.J. Watt played much better this week than he did in his pedestrian 2016 debut.    Andy Reid is often guilty of not getting the ball to his best players. That was the case in this game, as Spencer Ware was given just 12 touches. It made no sense after last week's brilliant performance. And it's not like Ware didn't do much; he had 57 yards on 10 carries and 2 catches for 48 receiving yards. "

He showed excellent burst and strength, and he may have done better against a weaker defense. Ware has made a case to keep the starting job even when Jamaal Charles returns, and he will continue to be a threat in fantasy as a result.    The Chiefs played some terrific defense during the game and really racked up some serious numbers during the game. One of the best stat lines came from the aforementioned Derrick Johnson. Johnson led the team in tackles with 11. In pass defense, he was great as well, recording 2 passes defensed and an interception. Johnson also scored a touchdown and caused another pick off of 1 of his pass defenses. He looked explosive and still has elite instincts. The 33-year-old is showing no signs of dropping off. Marcus Peters also was great for the Chiefs. He grabbed 2 more interceptions to move his season total to 4. Through 18 career games, Peters has 12 interceptions. He is definitely developing into 1 of the best young cornerbacks in the league and should be a force for the Chiefs in years to come.    One of the strangest plays of the day came on a kickoff return. Rookie "

   "comment":"Spencer Ware off of a wheel route and threw the ball to him. However, he put it too far out in front of the back, who could not reel it in. Had he put it on target, it would have almost certainly gone for a touchdown. Smith needs to make sure that he can make the big throws. Like I said earlier, his deep accuracy was better today, but that was a pass that could have changed the outcome of the game.    Thanks to Smith's solid performance, 3 Chiefs receivers were able to post great days. The best performance came from Travis Kelce (8-140). The tight end was absolutely stellar and created some great mismatches for the Chiefs. By halftime, he had 4 catches for 99 yards, and he could have had a bigger day. Kelce should continue to be the top option for Smith moving forward. The other top receivers were Tyreek Hill (5-53) and Albert Wilson (4-48). Hill is really emerging as a weapon in the Chiefs' offense, and he has done enough to earn a starting job even when Jeremy Maclin comes back. Hill is a must-own in dynasty formats, and he is worth adding in standard leagues as well. Wilson, meanwhile, played well, but he is too inconsistent to be considered in fantasy. He did have a nice 55-yard touchdown run on a fake punt, but he is not likely to score much week in and week out.    Spencer Ware once again was the lead back for the Chiefs. He surprisingly had some issues against the Falcons' run defense, carrying the ball 14 times for 29 yards. The line could not get a lot of push up front, and the team had more success in the passing game. Ware did catch 3 passes for 23 yards and a touchdown, and he could have had more if Smith had hit him on that long pass. Ware is a low-end RB1 in most formats moving forward.    Final Note: Having "

Later on, the Chiefs ruined another chance to put at least 3 points on the scoreboard when Alex Smith threw an ugly interception into the end zone. Smith struggled in the freezing conditions. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-28 for only 163 yards and the interception. Aside from a 44-yard completion to Maclin, he barely tried anything downfield, which is par for the course. He did manage to score a touchdown on the ground, but that was 1 of his few positive plays.    Speaking of Maclin, he finished with a team-high 6 catches for 82 yards, doubling up the next player on the stat sheet, Travis Kelce (3-41). Spencer Ware (3-25) was the only other Chief with more than a dozen receiving yards. "
