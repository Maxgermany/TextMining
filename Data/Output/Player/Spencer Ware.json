Ware nearly scored again, but was stuffed on a goal-line carry.    Going back to the Raiders, Carr looked great at times, finishing 31-of-48 for 283 yards and 2 touchdowns. He endured some drops as well, so he could've had a much better performance. However, those 3 interceptions were absolute killers and single-handedly (triple-handedly?) swung the game in Kansas City's favor.    Both Cooper and Crabtree had games to forget. Cooper, who caught 4 passes for 69 yards, dropped a 4.h-down reception early on and then was responsible for Carr's pick-six. Crabtree, on the other hand, logged 5 catches for 45 yards and a touchdown, but was guilty of several drops.    "

West handled the majority of the workload as a consequence, generating 76 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries, with most of his yardage coming on his 38-yard score.    Moving quickly through Baltimore's numbers, Clausen went 26-of-45 for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Clausen's highlight was launching a 48-yard Hail Mary right before halftime that hilariously landed way short of the end zone. It looked like a terrific punt. The Chiefs seemed surprised by this, allowing Aiken to catch the ball and score. Clausen didn't perform poorly or anything; on the contrary, he was better than expected. His 2 picks came late in desperation time, and he did a decent job of moving the chains. Unfortunately, the team's aforementioned mistakes proved to be too costly.    Speaking of which, Buck Allen didn't get a single carry after halftime, thanks to his early fumble. He gained 18 yards on 4 carries, and he watched "

Watt played much better this week than he did in his pedestrian 2016 debut.    Andy Reid is often guilty of not getting the ball to his best players. That was the case in this game, as Spencer Ware was given just 12 touches. It made no sense after last week's brilliant performance.

He showed excellent burst and strength, and he may have done better against a weaker defense. Ware has made a case to keep the starting job even when Jamaal Charles returns, and he will continue to be a threat in fantasy as a result.    The Chiefs played some terrific defense during the game and really racked up some serious numbers during the game. One of the best stat lines came from the aforementioned Derrick Johnson. Johnson led the team in tackles with 11. In pass defense, he was great as well, recording 2 passes defensed and an interception. Johnson also scored a touchdown and caused another pick off of 1 of his pass defenses. He looked explosive and still has elite instincts. The 33-year-old is showing no signs of dropping off. Marcus Peters also was great for the Chiefs. He grabbed 2 more interceptions to move his season total to 4. Through 18 career games, Peters has 12 interceptions. He is definitely developing into 1 of the best young cornerbacks in the league and should be a force for the Chiefs in years to come.

   "comment":"Ware, the Chiefs were able to set up Cairo Santos with a 37-yard field goal, and the attempt converted. It's really unbelievable how Newton and the rest of the offense unraveled. Newton was on fire in the opening half, going 11-of-19 for 157 passing yards, 43 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns by intermission. Newton looked like his old self, and he even dabbed after scoring. This appeared to be the 2015 Panthers, but the 2016 version reared its ugly head in the second half. Newton never felt comfortable, as his offensive line failed him. He was actually sacked on consecutive plays on 1 drive, as a possession in the red zone turned into a punt. With Michael Oher and Ryan Kalil out, Newton simply didn't have the protection to be successful all game.    Newton ended up finishing 23-of-38 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. He also scrambled 12 times for 54 yards and a touchdown, with his longest run being a 28-yarder off a great play-action fake to open the game. However, once again, Newton ended poorly, and his second-half numbers were pretty ugly, as he went just 12-of-19 for 104 yards and an interception following the break.    Newton should've had better numbers, but Greg Olsen betrayed him with a couple of drops. Olsen finished with 5 catches for 39 yards, trailing 3 players: Benjamin (7-84), Devin Funchess (3-56, TD) and Ted Ginn (5-44).    The Panthers didn't have any running room, as Newton led the team in rushing. Jonathan Stewart managed just 39 yards on 13 attempts. The Chiefs stacked 8 men in the box on most plays, challenging the Carolina receivers to beat 1.on-one coverage, and it didn't happen very often.    Meanwhile, the Chiefs, as mentioned, didn't perform well offensively. Alex Smith had a poor game, and he was bailed out by the secondary. Smith began the contest by throwing an interception into double coverage. He also overthrew Travis Kelce in the end zone for what should've been a touchdown. Smith had an awful sequence in the red zone in the 4.h quarter. He had a wide-open Kelce in the end zone, but checked the ball down instead. He then had an open Chris Conley for a touchdown, but overshot him. Smith followed that up by throwing short of the first-down marker by tossing a meaningless 5-yard completion to Ross Travis. Smith finished 25-of-38 for only 178 yards and a pick. He struggled mightily, though his receivers did hurt him by some drops. Still, Smith had a great matchup against a poor Carolina secondary, but couldn't take advantage of it. Despite the victory, the Chiefs have to feel discouraged about this, as Smith is the 1 holding this team back.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Tyreek Hill was able to lead the team in catches. He racked up 10 receptions for 89 yards. No other Chief accumulated more than 31 yards, as Kelce (3-31) and Albert Wilson (4-25) both dropped passes. Kelce at least hauled in a 2.point conversion.    I mentioned earlier that Ware didn't have many good runs. Ware's burst of 12 at the end gave him 61 yards on 13 carries, but he didn't have much of an opportunity to rush the ball, given that the Chiefs trailed throughout until the very end.   "

   "comment":"Ware off of a wheel route and threw the ball to him. However, he put it too far out in front of the back, who could not reel it in. Had he put it on target, it would have almost certainly gone for a touchdown. Smith needs to make sure that he can make the big throws. Like I said earlier, his deep accuracy was better today, but that was a pass that could have changed the outcome of the game.    Thanks to Smith's solid performance, 3 Chiefs receivers were able to post great days. The best performance came from Travis Kelce (8-140). The tight end was absolutely stellar and created some great mismatches for the Chiefs. By halftime, he had 4 catches for 99 yards, and he could have had a bigger day. Kelce should continue to be the top option for Smith moving forward. The other top receivers were Tyreek Hill (5-53) and Albert Wilson (4-48). Hill is really emerging as a weapon in the Chiefs' offense, and he has done enough to earn a starting job even when Jeremy Maclin comes back. Hill is a must-own in dynasty formats, and he is worth adding in standard leagues as well. Wilson, meanwhile, played well, but he is too inconsistent to be considered in fantasy. He did have a nice 55-yard touchdown run on a fake punt, but he is not likely to score much week in and week out.    Spencer Ware once again was the lead back for the Chiefs. He surprisingly had some issues against the Falcons' run defense, carrying the ball 14 times for 29 yards. The line could not get a lot of push up front, and the team had more success in the passing game. Ware did catch 3 passes for 23 yards and a touchdown, and he could have had more if Smith had hit him on that long pass. Ware is a low-end RB1 in most formats moving forward.    Final Note: Having "

   "comment":"Ware instead. Overall, Smith finished 17-of-26 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and the lost fumble.    The Raiders came into this game struggling against tight ends, so it's no wonder that Kelce went off. Kelce caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 1.handed grab thrown behind him for a gain of 34. Meanwhile, Tyreek Hill (6-66) scored twice; once on offense when he beat Amerson (notice a theme here?), and once via a punt return. Jeremy Maclin (1-16) was barely heard from upon his return. He was targeted on Smith's interception.    Ware had a disappointing evening. He was limited to just 56 yards on 20 carries, and he was vultured in the second quarter by "

   "comment":"Ware was stuffed twice, as Reid eschewed a field-goal chance that ultimately would've made a huge difference. Later on, the Chiefs ruined another chance to put at least 3 points on the scoreboard when Alex Smith threw an ugly interception into the end zone. Smith struggled in the freezing conditions. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-28 for only 163 yards and the interception. Aside from a 44-yard completion to Maclin, he barely tried anything downfield, which is par for the course. He did manage to score a touchdown on the ground, but that was 1 of his few positive plays.    Speaking of Maclin, he finished with a team-high 6 catches for 82 yards, doubling up the next player on the stat sheet, Travis Kelce (3-41). Spencer Ware (3-25) was the only other Chief with more than a dozen receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Ware. Smith later blew a field-goal chance by hurling a poor toss downfield instead of converting a sure thing for about 7 yards or so to give Cairo Santos a chance.    Kelce put together 1 of the best games of his career. He caught 11 of his 12 targets for a whopping 160 yards and a touchdown. In addition of sprinting 80 yards into the end zone, he also had so many key conversions on third down. The Chiefs were 9-of-17 on third downs, compared to Denver's 4-of-15 figure. I know the Broncos have had their issues against tight ends this year, but you'd think Wade Phillips would've devised a scheme to restrict Kelce. Denver will have to find an inside linebacker upgrade this offseason. I have the team doing this in my .    Kansas City's 2 receivers were disappointments in regard to their actual catching stats. Jeremy Maclin caught just 3 passes for 9 yards, and was nearly responsible for an interception when he ran the wrong route on 1 play. Hill, meanwhile, failed to haul in any of his 5 targets. However, Hill was effective on the ground, gaining 95 rushing yards and the aforementioned touchdown on his 70-yard sprint.    Ware had some nice carries as well, gaining 62 yards on 13 attempts.
