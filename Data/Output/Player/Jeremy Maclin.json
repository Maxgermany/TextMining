He was hit as he threw on his second interception, but he held on to the ball way too long in the pocket. The other was a poor pick-six. Speaking of waiting too long in the pocket, the Eagles cost themselves 3 points at the end of the first half. The clock was running out, but QB Dog Killer held on to the ball too long. He fired an incompletion as time expired, so they weren't able to attempt a field goal. Sadly, Philadelphia fans have gotten used to this in the Andy Reid era.

Oh, and speaking of McCoy, he lost a fumble deep in his own territory at the end of the second quarter, giving the Redskins a chip-shot field goal. A good coach might be able to fix this at halftime, but not Reid. The Eagles came out of the tunnel to have their opening drive ruined by a delay of game and a Foles fumble. The Redskins were struggling offensively up until this point, but Robert Griffin and his receivers finally started clicking. Washington would soon extend its lead and never look back.    Foles finished 21-of-46 for 204 yards and the 2 picks. He wasn't terrible, but didn't show any signs that he can be a starter in this league. That stat line is especially disappointing considering how porous Washington had been against the pass all year, though it's worth noting that Brandon Meriweather, who was on the field for the first time all year, was a force in a pedestrian secondary. Unfortunately, Meriweather suffered a knee injury in the second half. He limped off, which is a shame because he just can't stay healthy.    Speaking of injuries, LeSean McCoy was knocked out with a concussion. He was carted off, and it didn't look like he knew where he was at that moment. McCoy rushed for just 45 yards on 15 carries and that aforementioned fumble. The concussion, by the way, occurred when the Eagles were down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Afterward, Reid was asked why McCoy was still on the field at that point. His answer? We were trying to catch up to win the game. They were trying to catch up to win the game... down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Oh OK, that makes sense.    McCoy (6 catches, 67 yards) happened to be the Eagles' leading receiver, as Foles threw tons of screens. DeSean Jackson (2-5) and Jeremy Maclin (0-0) were major disappointments.    Griffin, meanwhile, was nearly perfect, going 14-of-15 for 200 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also scrambled 12 times for 84 rushing yards. One of his best players in terms of running came on a 3rd-and-14 in the third quarter when this was an 11-point game. Despite the long-distance situation, Griffin managed to pick up the first down with a 23-yard scramble. A few plays later, Griffin connected with Maclin were inexplicably on the sidelines.

He threw 2 interceptions, although 1 wasn't his fault because it went right off Josh Huff's hands. However, the second pick was bad, as Sanchez tried to force the issue. He also had another potential interception heaved right at the defender. Having said that, Sanchez wasn't any worse than Foles was, finishing 15-of-22 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. His numbers could've been much better, but Darren Sproles had a bad drop on what looked like a potential long gain.    Both Foles and Sanchez threw 1 score each to Maclin, who once again put together a huge outing. He snagged 6 of his team-leading 7 targets for 158 yards and the 2 touchdowns.

Sanchez was extremely sharp, and his numbers could've even been better; he endured some drops by Maclin for a gain of 59, which featured some of the worst tackling you'll ever see. Dallas' defense as a whole looked gassed and unprepared this game. Countless missed tackles made this extremely easy for Sanchez, who finished 20-of-29 for 217 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) to go along with 7 scrambles for 28 yards on the ground. Sanchez was extremely sharp, and his numbers could've even been better; he endured some drops by Riley Cooper, whom he got into a fight with during the 4.h quarter, as well as a blown touchdown opportunity to Brad Smith on a miscommunication. However, we've seen Sanchez have great outings before, only to revert to his butt-fumbling antics a week or 2 later. Perhaps Sanchez can turn into a careful quarterback - this could be a good start - but remember that we're just 1 week removed from a game in which he single-handedly kept Tennessee hanging around with unforced errors.    Sanchez was outstanding, but the Cowboys had the most issues dealing with LeSean McCoy, who made their bottom-five run defense look silly. McCoy ran with great patience, something he had issues with earlier in the season, and he was rewarded with a 159-yard performance on 25 carries. He also scored once. McCoy lost a fumble deep in his own territory during the third quarter, but the Eagles' defense held Dallas to a field goal, thanks to shoddy protection from Romo's line. McCoy let another ball fall out of his hands later in the game, but he was ruled down by contact following a replay review.    McCoy didn't do anything in the passing attack, leaving the receivers to do all of the work in that regard. Maclin reeled in 8 of his 10 targets for 108 yards. "

Chip Kelly foolishly didn't let them score a touchdown, permitting the Redskins to bleed the clock and nail a chip shot to seal the 27-24 victory. With this loss, the Eagles need to win at New York and then have the Cowboys lose both of their remaining games. That could happen - Dallas has endured worse collapses - but there's no guarantee that Philadelphia will even prevail against the Giants, given the team's issues.    I mentioned the defensive breakdowns; Philadelphia's secondary was primarily responsible for this defeat. The 3 poor defensive backs - Cary Williams, Bradley Fletcher, Nate Allen - all had a big hand in this loss. Williams began the game by being penalized for unnecessary roughness on a third-down stop, pushing Andre Roberts after the play was over. DeSean Jackson torched Fletcher for a 51-yard gain on the following drive. Jackson later haul in a 55-yard bomb and then proceeded to draw what looked like 5 pass-interference flags on Allen in the end zone. Williams then whiffed on a Pierre Garcon tackle, allowing the Redskins to move in for the game-winning kick.    Sanchez didn't help matters. His fantasy numbers were great, but he was guilty of 2 turnovers. The pick at the end was a killer, and he also opened the game with a lost fumble, forced by Ryan Kerrigan, who easily beat Lane Johnson. Sanchez finished 37-of-50 for 374 yards, 2 touchdowns, the interception and the fumble. He looked great at times - he converted a third-and-25 with a 26-yard dart to Jordan Matthews and had several other impressive throws - but as usual with Sanchez, the turnovers proved to be too costly.    Sanchez made it a point to throw to Zach Ertz as much as possible. I'm not exaggerating; Ertz drew a ridiculous 18 targets - twice more than the player who saw the next-most amount of balls thrown his way (Darren Sproles). Ertz hauled in 15 of those passes for 115 yards.    Both of Sanchez's touchdowns went to Riley Cooper (5-53), who dropped a pass. Jeremy Maclin (4-62) and Jordan Matthews (3-58) were big disappointments considering their matchup against Washington's poor secondary.    LeSean McCoy also scored. He managed 88 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and also caught 3 balls for 28 receiving yards. He had a drop, but ran well considering that Washington's defense has been so stout versus ground attacks this season.    As for the Redskins, Robert Griffin had a mixed outing, going 16-of-23 for 220 yards and an interception, which he forced into double coverage. He didn't run nearly enough - 5 scrambles, 11 rush yards - and he was nearly pick-sixed early in the game, but he completed a pair of deep bombs to Jackson. He made some mistakes, showing poor footwork on some attempts and holding on to the ball too long, but he was robbed of a touchdown when Allen tackled Jackson in the end zone prior to the ball arriving.    Jackson talked trash about the Eagles leading up to this game, and he backed up his talk. He caught 4 balls for 126 yards, reeling in receptions of 55 and 51 yards. There's no doubt that Philadelphia missed Jackson's game-breaking ability this year, but it's not like he's done much for the Redskins.    I was surprised to see Maclin.

The Texans' first offensive play from scrimmage saw Hoyer make a terrible pass that was easily intercepted by rookie corner Maclin produced enough points before the half to win the game.    The Texans' first offensive play from scrimmage saw Hoyer make a terrible pass that was easily intercepted by rookie corner Marcus Peters. That set up the Chiefs at the Houston 13-yard line. Two plays later, Smith hit Travis Kelce in the middle of the end zone for a score. Later in the first quarter, Kelce got wide open in busted coverage for a 42-yard touchdown. Hoyer answered with a drive led by passes to Nate Washington, Cecil Shorts, Jonathan Grimes, and a typical great catch by DeAndre Hopkins, who leapt over Peters for the score. The Chiefs responded with a field goal drive thanks to receptions by Kelce, Maclin, and a run by Knile Davis (6-16)."

He had the majority of the workload in the second half, but managed only 33 yards on 9 carries with just 1 catch for 6 receiving yards. West looked slow and sluggish, and he was stopped on a 4.h-down run in the red zone when Sharrif Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    "

Maclin took a crushing helmet-to-helmet hit at the end of regulation and had trouble getting up afterward, but was able to re-take the field after being cleared for a concussion.    Going back to the Chargers, Rivers' stat lines were significantly different pre- and post-Allen. Rivers, in the first half, was 16-of-20 for 151 yards and a touchdown. He was unstoppable, as he had all the time in the world. Without Allen, however, he was 9-of-16 for 82 yards. Considering this dichotomy, it's fair to say that San Diego would've held on for the victory had Allen remained on the field.    With Allen presumably done for the season, Rivers will target "

   "comment":"Jeremy Maclin catch. Mariota was then strip-sacked in his own territory, and then he followed that up with an underthrow that was snatched in the air with 1 hand by Kansas City's Maclin catch. Mariota was then strip-sacked in his own territory, and then he followed that up with an underthrow that was snatched in the air with 1 hand by Kansas City's Ron Parker. At that point in the game, it appeared as though the Titans were going to shoot themselves in the foot enough to ensure a crucial loss. However, they showed resilience and never quit. Despite wasting all of their timeouts - they ran out of stoppages with 7 minutes remaining - they were able to mount a comeback. They scored what appeared to be a game-tying touchdown, but went for 2 and failed to convert. Following a Kansas City punt, the Titans were able to put themselves into field-goal range to get the unlikely victory.    Considering the extremely cold temperatures in Kansas City, the better running game was expected to win. Thus, it's no wonder that the Titans prevailed despite all of their early blunders. They have the superior ground attack, and their run defense is better than what the Chiefs have in that regard. That proved to be the case in this matchup, as DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry combined for nearly 150 rushing yards. Murray had double the amount of carries, 18-9, and he outgained Henry, 89-58, but Henry scored 2 touchdowns. Murray was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 5 balls for 52 yards.    Marcus Mariota had his skeptics entering this afternoon, as this was the coldest game the native Hawaiian would ever start in his football career. Considering the conditions - as well as Kansas City's pass rush - the second-year signal-caller performed relatively well, outside of the 2 aforementioned mistakes. Mariota finished 19-of-33 for 241 yards and the pick. He hit a big play in the early going on a flea-flicker, firing a downfield pass to Matthews for 46 yards. Mariota was a bit lucky the pass didn't get picked off, as it was thrown into double coverage. He did a great job of leading his team on a pair of 4.h-quarter drives to win a crucial game that allowed the Titans to keep the tie with the Texans atop the AFC South.    Speaking of Matthews, he managed to lead the team in receiving yards, accumulating 105 yards on 4 catches. He did more than make up for his early fumble inside the Kansas City 5-yard line. Outside of Matthews, only 4 Titans caught passes: Delanie Walker (6-55), Murray, Kendall Wright (2-19) and Tajae Sharpe (2-10). Sharpe dropped a pass.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, appeared as though they were lucking their way into another win, but they definitely had their part in blowing this victory. They got out to an early lead, but in typical Andy Reid fashion, they went into a conservative shell and hoped to just hold on to the lead. That didn't happen, though it may have been possible if the Chiefs didn't blow opportunities. It started in the second quarter when the Chiefs failed to convert 2 chances at the 1-yard line. Spencer Ware was stuffed twice, as Reid eschewed a field-goal chance that ultimately would've made a huge difference. Later on, the Chiefs ruined another chance to put at least 3 points on the scoreboard when Alex Smith threw an ugly interception into the end zone. Smith struggled in the freezing conditions. He barely completed half of his passes, going 15-of-28 for only 163 yards and the interception. Aside from a 44-yard completion to Maclin, he barely tried anything downfield, which is par for the course. He did manage to score a touchdown on the ground, but that was 1 of his few positive plays.    Speaking of Maclin, he finished with a team-high 6 catches for 82 yards, doubling up the next player on the stat sheet, "
