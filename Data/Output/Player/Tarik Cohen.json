   "comment":"Cohen, whom I praised in my preseason recaps for his dazzling jukes and running ability, made some terrific plays in his professional debut. He didn't see as many carries as Jordan Howard (13-52, TD), but he outgained him, dashing for 66 yards on 5 tries, featuring a 46-yard, field-reserving run. Cohen also caught 8 of his 12 (TWELVE!!!) targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. He ran circles around Atlanta defenders, who had issues tackling him. He also made a crazy, 1-handed diving reception in the second half. Cohen is a freak, and the Bears will almost certainly find ways to get him involved on offense. Cohen isn't built to be an every-down ball-carrier - he's only 5-6, 179 - but he'll be a big-time fantasy producer, especially in PPR formats.    Cohen, with his 47 receiving yards, led the Bears in that category. "

   "comment":"Cohen really reminded me of Walter Payton in this game. Seriously. Well, OK, maybe for only 1 play, when he threw a touchdown pass. Payton had 9 touchdown passes in his career, so it was nice to see a Chicago running back continue the tradition.    The Bears enjoyed their first victory with Mitchell Trubisky at quarterback, but they got the win because their defense played a tremendous game led by cornerback Kyle Fuller, linebacker Danny Trevathan and defensive lineman Akiem Hicks. The only reason this game went to overtime was the Ravens' special teams unit producing 2 touchdowns. If Baltimore narrowly misses the playoffs, the team will look back at this game as 1 it should have won.    Throughout the first half, both offenses struggled to move the ball. The Bears got moving early in the second quarter with a face mask on Tony Jefferson and Trubisky taking off on a 19-yard scramble. The drive stalled inside the 10-yard line, and Chicago settled for a field goal. Late in the second quarter, Ravens wide receiver Breshad Perriman was cleaned out on a hit downfield, and Bears cornerback Bryce Callahan caught the deflected ball for an interception. Callahan returned the interception 52 yards to set up Chicago at the Ravens' 20-yard line. Two plays later, Tarik Cohen took a pitch and then threw to a wide open Zach Miller (2-25-1) for a touchdown after Jefferson lost eye discipline to let Miller run free."
