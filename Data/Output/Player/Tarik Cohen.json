   "comment":"Tarik Cohen, whom I praised in my preseason recaps for his dazzling jukes and running ability, made some terrific plays in his professional debut. He didn't see as many carries as Jordan Howard (13-52, TD), but he outgained him, dashing for 66 yards on 5 tries, featuring a 46-yard, field-reserving run. Cohen also caught 8 of his 12 (TWELVE!!!) targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. He ran circles around Atlanta defenders, who had issues tackling him. He also made a crazy, 1.handed diving reception in the second half. Cohen is a freak, and the Bears will almost certainly find ways to get him involved on offense. Cohen isn't built to be an every-down ball-carrier - he's only 5-6, 179 - but he'll be a big-time fantasy producer, especially in PPR formats.    Cohen, with his 47 receiving yards, led the Bears in that category. "
