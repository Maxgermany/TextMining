One was a wide throw that bounced off Zach Ertz, which subsequently led to a touchdown. Another was underthrown, sealing the victory for Dallas. A Brent Celek lost fumble in between didn't help. Sanchez finished 17-of-28 for 252 yards and the 2 picks. He had some nice moments, but made too many mistakes. In addition to the interceptions, he overthrew LeSean McCoy on a third-and-long and once again passed too high toward Huff. He also took some bad sacks.    There's not much to note from Philadelphia's receiving corps. Maclin led the way with 98 yards off 4 receptions, but 72 of those yards came on the aforementioned big play. Ertz (3-32) disappointed yet again, while Jordan Matthews didn't log a single catch. He dropped a pass in Dallas territory.    My condolences if you're a LeSean McCoy fantasy owner. McCoy averaged 4 yards per carry (16-64), but was vultured a whopping 3 times at the goal line. Chris Polk found the end zone twice, while Darren Sproles ran in on the third occasion."

   "comment":"Polk gashing Buffalo for 20 yards, before Hoyer converted a third down with a pass to offensive lineman Kendall Lamm, and then Jonathan Grimes ran for 18 yards on a third-and-7. The Texans ran a quick play when the Bills defense wasn't even lined up, so Hoyer threw to the flat to Ryan Griffin, who walked into the end zone from a few yards out. Nick Novak missed the extra point. Buffalo came right back as McCoy bounced a run to the outside for 32 yards. More McCoy runs moved the ball inside the 10-yard line. Taylor finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans answered as Hoyer methodically moved the ball down the field before throwing an 11-yard touchdown to Polk. Watkins soon beat Johnson again for a 53-yard bomb inside the Houston 20. On third-and-goal, "
