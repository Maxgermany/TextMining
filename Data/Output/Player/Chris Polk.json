   "comment":"Chris Polk for the score. Following the ensuing, aforementioned Romo fumble, the Eagles took the lead. Sanchez had a meltdown after that. He was picked off twice late. One was a wide throw that bounced off Zach Ertz, which subsequently led to a touchdown. Another was underthrown, sealing the victory for Dallas. A Brent Celek lost fumble in between didn't help. Sanchez finished 17-of-28 for 252 yards and the 2 picks. He had some nice moments, but made too many mistakes. In addition to the interceptions, he overthrew LeSean McCoy on a third-and-long and once again passed too high toward Huff. He also took some bad sacks.    There's not much to note from Philadelphia's receiving corps. Maclin led the way with 98 yards off 4 receptions, but 72 of those yards came on the aforementioned big play. Ertz (3-32) disappointed yet again, while Jordan Matthews didn't log a single catch. He dropped a pass in Dallas territory.    My condolences if you're a LeSean McCoy fantasy owner. McCoy averaged 4 yards per carry (16-64), but was vultured a whopping 3 times at the goal line. Chris Polk found the end zone twice, while Darren Sproles ran in on the third occasion."

   "comment":"Chris Polk gashing Buffalo for 20 yards, before Hoyer converted a third down with a pass to offensive lineman Kendall Lamm, and then Jonathan Grimes ran for 18 yards on a third-and-7. The Texans ran a quick play when the Bills defense wasn't even lined up, so Hoyer threw to the flat to Ryan Griffin, who walked into the end zone from a few yards out. Nick Novak missed the extra point. Buffalo came right back as McCoy bounced a run to the outside for 32 yards. More McCoy runs moved the ball inside the 10-yard line. Taylor finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans answered as Hoyer methodically moved the ball down the field before throwing an 11-yard touchdown to Polk. Watkins soon beat Johnson again for a 53-yard bomb inside the Houston 20. On third-and-goal, Robert Woods beat Johnson for a short touchdown. The Bills took a 21-13 lead into halftime. Late in the third quarter, Watkins burned Jonathan Joseph on a double move to get open for a 52-yard catch. Buffalo missed the field goal, though. DeAndre Hopkins came alive as the Texans moved the ball down the field with passes to their star receiver for catches of 23 and 29 yards. He got away with a push-off on Ronald Darby to haul in a 19-yard touchdown to finish the possession. Grimes ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. McCoy ripped off a 20-yard run to get Buffalo to midfield in response. After the 2-minute warning, Charles Clay got wide open down the field for a 40-yard touchdown in busted coverage. Dan Carpenter missed the extra point, but the Bills' defense slammed the door for the win. Carpenter added a field goal after the Texans went 4.and-out.    Taylor was 11-of-21 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 28 yards and a score as well. Taylor played well against a good Houston defense, but got lucky as interceptions were dropped by Kevin Johnson and Andre Hal in the 4.h quarter. Hal's would have been a pick-six with 3 or 4 minutes remaining.    LeSean McCoy totaled 112 yards on 21 totes, but missed the majority of the second half in the concussion protocal.    Watkins had 109 yards and a score on 3 receptions. His catches were huge. Charles Clay (4-66) made up for a bad drop with his game-winning touchdown.    Brian Hoyer was 26-of-43 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. He missed on a number of opportunities and illustrates why he really is a backup in the NFL; not a starter.    DeAndre Hopkins had 88 yards on 5 receptions with a touchdown. Nate Washington (6-44) and Cecil Shorts (6-91) chipped in, but had some painful dropped passes.    If you're playing a Texans running back in fantasy, you're in big trouble as the coaches spread the ball around. Chris Polk (12-61), Jonathan Grimes (5-28) and Alfred Blue (4-14) spilt the carries."
