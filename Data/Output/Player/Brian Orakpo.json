They simply did not show well against the Titans. One of the main culprits of the team's failure was Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill had a poor outing against the Tennessee defense. Though he was under pressure for most of the day, he was unable to get anything going on offense. He was just 12-of-18 for 191 yards. Tannehill did not throw any touchdowns, but he did toss 2 picks. The first interception was not entirely Tannehill's fault. He threw the ball slightly behind his intended receiver, but the receiver was able to get his hands on it. However, "
