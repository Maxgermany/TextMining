The good news is that Grossman limited himself to just 1 turnover, which was an interception that gave Tennessee the ball on Chicago's 25. I think Lovie would have taken only 1 give-away by Sexy Rexy. The problem was that Grossman threw for just 173 yards and a touchdown on 37 attempts, giving him a YPA of 4.7.    Because Grossman couldn't get the ball down the field, his receivers couldn't really do anything. The only Bears of note were Matt Forte, who rushed for 72 yards, caught 7 balls for 54 more yards and scored a touchdown, and Greg Olsen, who managed 40 yards on 5 receptions."

   "comment":"Matt Forte, who picked up 8 yards. A few plays later, Chicago scored and went up 7-0.    Unfortunately, we also have to talk about Grossman. The good news is that Grossman limited himself to just 1 turnover, which was an interception that gave Tennessee the ball on Chicago's 25. I think Lovie would have taken only 1 give-away by Sexy Rexy. The problem was that Grossman threw for just 173 yards and a touchdown on 37 attempts, giving him a YPA of 4.7.    Because Grossman couldn't get the ball down the field, his receivers couldn't really do anything. The only Bears of note were Matt Forte, who rushed for 72 yards, caught 7 balls for 54 more yards and scored a touchdown, and Greg Olsen, who managed 40 yards on 5 receptions."

At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

Seneca The Backdoor Bandit Wallace actually played pretty well, going 26-of-44 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and a very ugly pick. Unfortunately, his limited arm strength cost Seattle at the end of the game when the Bandit simply couldn't attack Chicago's defense downfield.    Despite those numbers, "

   "comment":"Matt Forte had a 40-yard run that set up a short Marion Barber score. Newton came back down and threw a meaningless score to Greg Olsen with a few seconds remaining in regulation. The touchdown covered the spread. My reaction on the forum as this happened? <i> ohmygodtouchdownpanthersholy**** </i> Like I said, Newton was awesome. He did make a crucial mistake in the first quarter when he tossed a pick-six into double coverage, but was outstanding otherwise. He went 27-of-46 for 374 yards, 1 passing touchdown, 2 rushing touchdowns and that interception.    Even with that late score bringing the deficit down from 34-23 to 34-29, the Panthers should have won this game. They outgained the Bears, 543-317. They had 9 more first downs. But like any young team, they continuously shot themselves in the foot. Here are some examples: - Legedu Naanee dropped an easy catch on what would have been a 30-yard completion on the first drive. - Later in the possession, a long pass to Jeremy Shockey was wiped out by an illegal formation. - The Panthers were guilty of a delay-of-game penalty on a first-and-goal in the middle of the second quarter. - A Jeremy Shockey third-quarter touchdown was called back by a bogus offensive pass interference. - The Bears blocked a 34-yard field goal. - Carolina allowed Devin Hester to return a kickoff 73 yards, which set up a short field for Chicago and a subsequent Matt Forte touchdown. - Minutes later, Hester scored on a punt return touchdown.    An encouraging sign for the Panthers is that they were able to run well. "

   "comment":"Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by "

   "comment":"Matt Forte (12-55). Jeffery (10-218) stepped up with a monster game. He made a superb leaping catch for 31 yards in the first quarter. That would set up a short touchdown toss for the duo. Cutler hit a 48-yard completion to Jeffery in the third quarter and a gain of 18 yards to Martellus Bennett (5-56) set up a field goal. Late in the game, Cutler lofted in a pass to Jeffery for 58 yards after he beat Kenny Vaccaro to the Saints' 2-yard line. A quick out to Brandon Marshall for 6 and a 2.point run by Matt Forte pulled the Bears within 8. but Chicago couldn't get the ball back with enough time. Cutler was 24-of-33 on the afternoon for 358 yards with 2 scores. He also ran for 27 yards on 4 carries.    The Bears' defense did a nice job of holding the Saints to field goals, but Chicago was unable to generate any takeaways. "

   "comment":"Matt Forte, while a strip-sack returned for a touchdown was nullified because it was ruled that Cutler's forward progress was stopped.    More bogus stats: Martellus Bennett (6-95, TD) and Alshon Jeffery (5-59, TD) both pleased their fantasy owners, but they did nothing when this game was in doubt. Jeffery had just 2 grabs for 14 yards at the break, thanks to Darrelle Revis, while Brandon Marshall (3-35) didn't log a single reception by that juncture. Marshall even took himself out of the game on a 4.h down.    Matt Forte was the only truly productive Bear. He rushed for 114 yards on 19 carries and also snagged Cutler's third touchdown, securing 6 catches for 54 receiving yards. Forte had 105 total yards and a touchdown in the first half.    As if this loss wasn't bad enough for the Bears, 2 key players suffered major injuries. "

This tripped up the Lions early on, but they eventually figured things out. The Bears struggled to sustain drives after that for the most part, and penalties and sacks disrupted their possessions.

   "comment":"Matt Forte. Cutler finished 32-of-46 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and a late interception when he underthrew his receiver in the end zone. Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Matt Forte the week before, while pass-rushers flooded the backfield and forced Russell Wilson into some bad throws. The Seahawks also appear to not be completely focused. They opened the game with 12 men on the field, negating a Green Bay punt. Michael Bennett was offsides on multiple occasions, resulting in big gains for the Packers. The Seahawks, on their first possession, held on a kickoff and then had to call a timeout because they had 12 men in the huddle. J.R. Sweezy was flagged for a penalty because he hit a player a minute after the whistle was blown. The Seahawks didn't run the clock down at the end of the first half while punting, giving Aaron Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was "

   "comment":"Matt Forte touchdown that allowed Chicago to hang around, despite the fact that the team wasn't doing much for most of the afternoon. Cousins also scored once on the ground, also thanks to Fuller. The cornerback bit on a play-action fake and wasn't in position to make a tackle on Cousins as a result. Cousins was solid, but was guilty of some mental blunders. In addition to the pick, he had a series in which he had to waste a timeout in the third quarter and then was flagged for a delay of game because the team couldn't get the right personnel on the field. Cousins, for some reason, ran to the sideline, wasting time in the process.    Cousins' 1 aerial score went to Jordan Reed, who caught all 9 of his targets for 120 yards and a touchdown. Reed nearly had a second score when he plowed through 3 defenders and appeared to reach the end zone on the opening drive. He was ruled down at the 1-yard line, however, and Washington scored a rushing touchdown right afterward. This performance is killing me, by the way. I have Reed in 2 leagues, but decided to bench him in 1 in favor of Tyler Eifert. As of this writing, I'm afraid to look at the live scoring of that contest.    As for Cousins' other targets, Pierre Garcon (5-52) and DeSean Jackson (2-43) both had solid outings. Jackson disappointed his fantasy owners, but he was able to draw a deep pass interference that set up Cousins' aforementioned rushing touchdown. He seemed to be banged up at the end of the game, though it didn't appear to be serious.    Alfred Morris had all the early carries. By halftime, he managed 21 yards a touchdown on 9 carries, while Matt Jones (3-6) posted meager numbers. However, Jones handled the majority of the workload after intermission. Morris finished with just 24 yards and the score on 11 attempts, while Jones generated 62 yards on 18 tries. Jones was very fortunate late in the game. He fumbled the ball while trying to run out the clock, but somehow got it back. Fumbling has been Jones' Achilles' heel, which is a shame because he's such a dynamic runner.    Meanwhile, the Bears had a middling performance from their offense. They moved the chains effectively at times, but were guilty of drops as well as a lost fumble. Jay Cutler went 19-of-31 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was guilty of being strip-sacked. He would've enjoyed a better day had his weapons not dropped several passes.    Cutler threw touchdowns to Alshon Jeffery (6-107) and Zach Miller (5-85), who blew kisses to the fans in the stands when he reached the end zone. Miller will continue to be a big factor in the wake of Martellus Bennett's season-ending injury.    Matt Forte and Jeremy Langford split the workload evenly again."

   "comment":"Matt Forte rushed for an even 100 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was a terrific fantasy performance, but Forte accumulated those yards on 30 carries, so his 3.33 YPC isn't very impressive, though he did get stronger as the evening progress. Still, I think the Jets are making a huge mistake by giving him so many touches; turning 31 soon, Forte is going to be run into the ground soon, and I think he'll be ineffective down the stretch if this continues.    Moving back to the Bills, their offense is also problematic. Taylor, as mentioned, hit a couple of big plays, but was otherwise very mediocre. His final stat line of 18-of-30 for 297 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception is very misleading. Take away those 2 deep throws, and Taylor would've gone 16-of-28 for only 142 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and an ugly pick in which he underthrew "

He was able to rip off a few big plays, and he would have done better if the Jets were not trailing. Forte looks good now, but the Jets need to make sure that they do not overwork him early in the season. They need to have him healthy down the stretch if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs.    For the Chiefs, this was a huge win. The way they approached the game was quintessential "
