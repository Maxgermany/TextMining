At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

   "comment":"Forte caught 6 passes for 40 yards, but he struggled to run the ball, posting just 66 yards on 21 carries. Seattle's rush defense isn't very good and the team was missing Lofa Tatupu, so you have to wonder if Forte will ever get going on the ground.    Seneca The Backdoor Bandit Wallace actually played pretty well, going 26-of-44 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and a very ugly pick. Unfortunately, his limited arm strength cost Seattle at the end of the game when the Bandit simply couldn't attack Chicago's defense downfield.    Despite those numbers, "

In fact, 1 sequence pretty much epitomized this contest for St. Louis: Down 10-0, Rams had the ball at midfield. Kyle Boller hit a pass to Danny Amendola to get the team close to the Bears 30. Unfortunately, Alex Barron was called for a holding penalty. One play later, Brandon Gibson fumbled the ball, returned by Chicago to St. Louis' 20. Just blown opportunities for the Rams all afternoon. They began 6 possessions in Chicago territory in this contest, but mustered just 3 field goals. Still, their fans can't be too upset; they're 1 step closer to landing Jimmy Clausen.    Cutler had a pretty weird stat line. He was just 8-of-17, but threw for 143 yards and a touchdown. Cutler collected his yardage on 2 big plays to Devin Hester (48) and Earl Bennett (71). Hester left the game with a calf injury, but should be fine for Week 14.    Forte ran well, compiling 91 yards and a score on 24 carries. However, his fantasy owners may have expected more from him in a matchup against St. Louis at the beginning of the season.    Forte's counterpart was predictably more impressive. "

   "comment":"Forte had a 40-yard run that set up a short Marion Barber score. Newton came back down and threw a meaningless score to Greg Olsen with a few seconds remaining in regulation. The touchdown covered the spread. My reaction on the forum as this happened? ohmygodtouchdownpanthersholy**** Like I said, Newton was awesome. He did make a crucial mistake in the first quarter when he tossed a pick-six into double coverage, but was outstanding otherwise. He went 27-of-46 for 374 yards, 1 passing touchdown, 2 rushing touchdowns and that interception.    Even with that late score bringing the deficit down from 34-23 to 34-29, the Panthers should have won this game. They outgained the Bears, 543-317. They had 9 more first downs. But like any young team, they continuously shot themselves in the foot. Here are some examples: - Legedu Naanee dropped an easy catch on what would have been a 30-yard completion on the first drive. - Later in the possession, a long pass to Jeremy Shockey was wiped out by an illegal formation. - The Panthers were guilty of a delay-of-game penalty on a first-and-goal in the middle of the second quarter. - A Jeremy Shockey third-quarter touchdown was called back by a bogus offensive pass interference. - The Bears blocked a 34-yard field goal. - Carolina allowed Devin Hester to return a kickoff 73 yards, which set up a short field for Chicago and a subsequent Matt Forte touchdown. - Minutes later, Hester scored on a punt return touchdown.    An encouraging sign for the Panthers is that they were able to run well. "

He was mostly bottled up on the afternoon, collecting just 84 yards on 18 touches with a huge chunk (33 yards) coming on 1 carry. Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead. The aforementioned long run by Forte (33 yards) put the Bears in plus territory, but on third down, Hanie threw another interception with Michael Huff on the receiving end."

   "comment":"Forte couldn't contribute much in the running game because the Bears were down by 2 scores early on. He rushed just 13 times, but managed 85 yards. He also chipped in with 6 catches for 34 receiving yards.    Peterson, as indicated, was a beast. Well, he was in the first quarter anyway, finishing the opening period with 100-plus rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. However, the Bears did a great job of clamping down on him after that. Peterson's final numbers were 154 yards and 2 scores on 31 carries.    The Vikings couldn't really move the chains beyond the first drive because "

   "comment":"Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by "

   "comment":"Forte (12-55). Jeffery (10-218) stepped up with a monster game. He made a superb leaping catch for 31 yards in the first quarter. That would set up a short touchdown toss for the duo. Cutler hit a 48-yard completion to Jeffery in the third quarter and a gain of 18 yards to Martellus Bennett (5-56) set up a field goal. Late in the game, Cutler lofted in a pass to Jeffery for 58 yards after he beat Kenny Vaccaro to the Saints' 2-yard line. A quick out to Brandon Marshall for 6 and a 2.point run by Matt Forte pulled the Bears within 8. but Chicago couldn't get the ball back with enough time. Cutler was 24-of-33 on the afternoon for 358 yards with 2 scores. He also ran for 27 yards on 4 carries.    The Bears' defense did a nice job of holding the Saints to field goals, but Chicago was unable to generate any takeaways. "

   "comment":"Forte was inexplicably given just 2 carries in the opening half. Alshon Jeffery had a drop, while Dante Rosario lost a fumble. Perhaps the worst thing Chicago did was show absolutely no sense of urgency despite being in a position to mount a comeback in the 4.h quarter. Down 17 and in Miami territory with 8 minutes left, Cutler lackadaisically ran the offense, letting the clock tick down. It's almost as if he was resigned to losing at that point.    Meanwhile, Chicago's defense struggled once again. Jay Ratliff was a monster with 3.5 sacks - 1 took the Dolphins out of field-goal range at the end of the first half - but barely anyone else performed well. The Bears allowed Ryan Tannehill to fire just 7 incompletions, as the Miami quarterback went 25-of-32 for 277 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 48 rushing yards, which included a 30-yard scamper on a 4.h-down read-option play. Tannehill's only real mistake on the afternoon was holding the ball too long on 1 of his sacks that, as mentioned, put his team out of kicking range prior to intermission. Tannehill's scores went to Mike Wallace (5-46) and Charles Clay (4-58). Rookie Jarvis Landry, who had an impressive showing last week, was the only other Dolphin with more than 3 receptions (4-46).    Lamar Miller couldn't break any long gains, but he had some consistent runs, picking up 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. He also caught 2 balls for 22 receiving yards. He had a second score negated by a hold.    Some stats for the Bears: - Cutler went 21-of-34 for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick and lost fumble. - Forte, as discussed, wasn't given much of an opportunity in the opening half. However, he still scored twice (once rushing, once receiving), gaining 49 yards on the ground (12 carries) and 60 yards through the air (6 catches). The Dolphins have a strong ground defense, but there's no excuse for Forte not rushing the ball more than twice. - Both Jeffery (2-9) and "

   "comment":"Forte, while a strip-sack returned for a touchdown was nullified because it was ruled that Cutler's forward progress was stopped.    More bogus stats: Martellus Bennett (6-95, TD) and Alshon Jeffery (5-59, TD) both pleased their fantasy owners, but they did nothing when this game was in doubt. Jeffery had just 2 grabs for 14 yards at the break, thanks to Darrelle Revis, while Brandon Marshall (3-35) didn't log a single reception by that juncture. Marshall even took himself out of the game on a 4.h down.    Matt Forte was the only truly productive Bear. He rushed for 114 yards on 19 carries and also snagged Cutler's third touchdown, securing 6 catches for 54 receiving yards. Forte had 105 total yards and a touchdown in the first half.    As if this loss wasn't bad enough for the Bears, 2 key players suffered major injuries. "

Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset.   "

   "comment":"Forte the week before, while pass-rushers flooded the backfield and forced Russell Wilson into some bad throws. The Seahawks also appear to not be completely focused. They opened the game with 12 men on the field, negating a Green Bay punt. Michael Bennett was offsides on multiple occasions, resulting in big gains for the Packers. The Seahawks, on their first possession, held on a kickoff and then had to call a timeout because they had 12 men in the huddle. J.R. Sweezy was flagged for a penalty because he hit a player a minute after the whistle was blown. The Seahawks didn't run the clock down at the end of the first half while punting, giving Aaron Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was "

   "comment":"Forte for a loss on short-yardage carry, but melted down toward the end. Making matters worse, Chicago didn't even have Alshon Jeffery or Eddie Royal. Cutler finished 26-of-45 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which occurred in the 4.h quarter. Cutler allowed a score himself when he was strip-sacked in the end zone and then got away with some possible interceptions, but for the second-consecutive week, he engineered a game-winning drive despite missing his top wideout.    Cutler's scores went to Marquess Wilson (6-85) and Matt Forte (5-38). Wilson led the team in receiving, but was actually second on the team in targets. "

   "comment":"Forte touchdown that allowed Chicago to hang around, despite the fact that the team wasn't doing much for most of the afternoon. Cousins also scored once on the ground, also thanks to Fuller. The cornerback bit on a play-action fake and wasn't in position to make a tackle on Cousins as a result. Cousins was solid, but was guilty of some mental blunders. In addition to the pick, he had a series in which he had to waste a timeout in the third quarter and then was flagged for a delay of game because the team couldn't get the right personnel on the field. Cousins, for some reason, ran to the sideline, wasting time in the process.    Cousins' 1 aerial score went to Jordan Reed, who caught all 9 of his targets for 120 yards and a touchdown. Reed nearly had a second score when he plowed through 3 defenders and appeared to reach the end zone on the opening drive. He was ruled down at the 1-yard line, however, and Washington scored a rushing touchdown right afterward. This performance is killing me, by the way. I have Reed in 2 leagues, but decided to bench him in 1 in favor of Tyler Eifert. As of this writing, I'm afraid to look at the live scoring of that contest.    As for Cousins' other targets, Pierre Garcon (5-52) and DeSean Jackson (2-43) both had solid outings. Jackson disappointed his fantasy owners, but he was able to draw a deep pass interference that set up Cousins' aforementioned rushing touchdown. He seemed to be banged up at the end of the game, though it didn't appear to be serious.    Alfred Morris had all the early carries. By halftime, he managed 21 yards a touchdown on 9 carries, while Matt Jones (3-6) posted meager numbers. However, Jones handled the majority of the workload after intermission. Morris finished with just 24 yards and the score on 11 attempts, while Jones generated 62 yards on 18 tries. Jones was very fortunate late in the game. He fumbled the ball while trying to run out the clock, but somehow got it back. Fumbling has been Jones' Achilles' heel, which is a shame because he's such a dynamic runner.    Meanwhile, the Bears had a middling performance from their offense. They moved the chains effectively at times, but were guilty of drops as well as a lost fumble. Jay Cutler went 19-of-31 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was guilty of being strip-sacked. He would've enjoyed a better day had his weapons not dropped several passes.    Cutler threw touchdowns to Alshon Jeffery (6-107) and Zach Miller (5-85), who blew kisses to the fans in the stands when he reached the end zone. Miller will continue to be a big factor in the wake of Martellus Bennett's season-ending injury.    Matt Forte and Jeremy Langford split the workload evenly again."

   "comment":"Forte ripping off an 18-yard run to get across midfield, and then Bilal Powell (6-76) broke up the middle and to the outside for a 35-yard touchdown run. Late before the half, McCown moved the ball into Jets territory, attacking New York's cornerbacks. A Calvin Pryor pass interference in the end zone on Gary Barnidge (3-42) set up a first-and-goal at the 1. Isaiah Crowell promptly plunged into the end zone. The Browns got the ball back and used Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. "

As mentioned, Kaepernick struggled, going 15-of-26 for only 133 yards and a touchdown. He ran just thrice for some reason, picking up 23 rushing yards in the process.

The 49ers also ran the ball well, with Carlos Hyde gashing al lethargic Jet defense for 193 yards on 17 carries. It makes me wonder why Hyde had 10 attempts in the second half and overtime. Chip Kelly once again proved himself to be uttery incompetent.    Speaking of Kelly's follies, he looked stupid again by starting Kaepernick. As mentioned, Kaepernick struggled, going 15-of-26 for only 133 yards and a touchdown. He ran just thrice for some reason, picking up 23 rushing yards in the process. Christian Ponder is the best quarterback on San Francisco's roster.    Only 2 49ers caught multiple passes: "

   "comment":"Forte. This was possible because 1 of the Miami players lazily went for the strip rather than trying to wrap up the running back. New York was eventually up 28-14, and Jay Cutler suffered a rib injury. This normally would've spelled the end for any team, but not for the Dolphins, a team whose backups 10. to be better than the starters. Matt Moore, who was not much of a downgrade from Ryan Tannehill last year, stepped in, and he promptly threw an interception when he forced a throw into coverage. Moore, however, managed to rebound and put together a couple of scoring drives to tie the game. It appeared as though the teams would be headed to overtime, but Josh McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    Kenny Stills was 1 of the heroes during Miami's late-game comeback. He caught both touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, snatching 6 balls for 85 yards overall. On top of that, Stills made an acrobatic catch in the first half. Perhaps Stills will remain a big part of the offense when DeVante Parker returns, though his targets (9) will likely decrease. Jarvis Landry actually led the team in that category, as he reeled in 7 of 11 balls thrown his way for 93 yards and a touchdown. Julius Thomas (3-58) made an impressive, 1.handed grab during Miami's comeback.    I remarked earlier that better players happen to be on Miami's bench, and that was the case with Jake Brendel being on the sideline with Mike Pouncey on the field. The reason the Dolphins ran so well in Atlanta was Brendel providing a huge upgrade over the hobbled Pouncey, who needs hip surgery. I don't know why the Dolphins rushed Pouncey back, as it certainly affected Jay Ajayi's stat line. Ajayi mustered just 51 yards on 23 carries.    The Jets, meanwhile, had some decent quarterbacking from McCown until the very end. McCown was 17-of-27 for 209 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. McCown's first score was an absolutely pefect touch pass to Jermaine Kearse, and he later found Robby Anderson wide open in the end zone, thanks to a blown coverage. A chunk of McCown's yardage came via screens and blown coverages, as Miami's back 7 is an abomination. However, McCown's last pass was atrocious, especially when considering how much experience he has in the NFL.    Forte and Bilal Powell were the leaders for the Jets in receiving yardage."

   "comment":"Forte later was able to benefit from a missed tackle as well, scoring a touchdown because of a Lorenzo Alexander whiff. Despite the long run, Forte outgained Powell, 77-74, doing so on 5 more carries (14-9). Eli McGuire was also mixed in for some reason, though he was far less effective (13-30). Forte also caught 4 passes, but didn't do much with them, generating 19 receiving yards.    "
