At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).

I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage.

He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores.

In fact, 1 sequence pretty much epitomized this contest for St. Louis: Down 10-0, Rams had the ball at midfield. Forte scored touchdowns in the red zone, while the Rams had to settle for field goals. In fact, 1 sequence pretty much epitomized this contest for St. Louis: Down 10-0, Rams had the ball at midfield. Kyle Boller hit a pass to Danny Amendola to get the team close to the Bears 30. Unfortunately, Alex Barron was called for a holding penalty. One play later, Brandon Gibson fumbled the ball, returned by Chicago to St. Louis' 20. Just blown opportunities for the Rams all afternoon. They began 6 possessions in Chicago territory in this contest, but mustered just 3 field goals. Still, their fans can't be too upset; they're 1 step closer to landing Jimmy Clausen.    Cutler had a pretty weird stat line. He was just 8-of-17, but threw for 143 yards and a touchdown. Cutler collected his yardage on 2 big plays to Devin Hester (48) and Earl Bennett (71). Hester left the game with a calf injury, but should be fine for Week 14.    Forte ran well, compiling 91 yards and a score on 24 carries. However, his fantasy owners may have expected more from him in a matchup against St. Louis at the beginning of the season.    Forte's counterpart was predictably more impressive. "

Caleb Hanie mercifully stepped in late and went 2-of-3 for 19 yards.    With Tom Collins unable to complete a pass, Forte actually led the Bears in receiving yardage with 22 off 2 catches. "

But like any young team, they continuously shot themselves in the foot. Here are some examples: - Legedu Naanee dropped an easy catch on what would have been a 30-yard completion on the first drive. - Later in the possession, a long pass to Jeremy Shockey was wiped out by an illegal formation. - The Panthers were guilty of a delay-of-game penalty on a first-and-goal in the middle of the second quarter. - A Jeremy Shockey third-quarter touchdown was called back by a bogus offensive pass interference. - The Bears blocked a 34-yard field goal. - Carolina allowed Devin Hester to return a kickoff 73 yards, which set up a short field for Chicago and a subsequent Matt Forte touchdown. - Minutes later, Hester scored on a punt return touchdown.

He was mostly bottled up on the afternoon, collecting just 84 yards on 18 touches with a huge chunk (33 yards) coming on 1 carry. Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead. The aforementioned long run by Forte (33 yards) put the Bears in plus territory, but on third down, Hanie threw another interception with Michael Huff on the receiving end."

   "comment":"Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by "

   "comment":"Matt Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Forte (17-33) touchdown run. On third-and-goal, Cutler lofted a pass to Jeffery for a leaping touchdown over Chris Houston, but the review of the play took the touchdown away as Jeffery had to re-control the ball when he landed on his back out of bounds. The Bears settled for a field goal and a 14-13 deficit. Conte came back with a clutch breakup covering Johnson in the end zone. David Akers missed the field goal, but it didn't matter as Stafford and Bush (14-105) moved the ball into Chicago territory on Detroit's next possession. Johnson beat Tillman in man coverage for a 14-yard score to give the Lions an 8.point lead with a little more than 2 minutes remaining. Josh McCown came in for the Bears' final drive of the game. Nick Fairley had a unnecessary roughness that gave Chicago a first down, but he recorded a sack. McCown moved the ball with some intermediate passes before hitting Marshall for an 11-yard touchdown. It was a great throw by McCown to get Marshall (7-139) open in the end zone. The 2.point conversion fell incomplete, but Willie Young was hit with a personal foul helmet-to-helmet hit on McCown to give Chicago another attempt. On the retry, a run by Forte was blown up by Fairley for a loss. The Lions recovered the onside kick to clinch the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished completing 18-of-35 for 219 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. The unsung hero was Detroit's offensive line. The Bears' defense that ravaged Green Bay was held without a sack.    Cutler was 21-of-40 for 250 yards with a score and a pick. He played well considering his injuries. The Lions' defense was led by Fairley and Suh as each recorded sacks, but Detroit's secondary really struggled to cover Marshall and Jeffery. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Another occurred on a Josh McCown strip-six in desperation time. Still, Chicago surrendered 406 net yards of offense to the Rams. Even with all of the injuries, this should not happen. The Bears fell behind early, thanks to a Tavon Austin 65-yard fake reverse and the aforementioned Forte turnover. This allowed the Rams to lean heavily on the run, which is 1 area Chicago's defense fails miserably. "

   "comment":"Matt Forte, while a strip-sack returned for a touchdown was nullified because it was ruled that Cutler's forward progress was stopped.    More bogus stats: Martellus Bennett (6-95, TD) and Alshon Jeffery (5-59, TD) both pleased their fantasy owners, but they did nothing when this game was in doubt. Jeffery had just 2 grabs for 14 yards at the break, thanks to Darrelle Revis, while Brandon Marshall (3-35) didn't log a single reception by that juncture. Marshall even took himself out of the game on a 4.h down.    Matt Forte was the only truly productive Bear. He rushed for 114 yards on 19 carries and also snagged Cutler's third touchdown, securing 6 catches for 54 receiving yards. Forte had 105 total yards and a touchdown in the first half.    As if this loss wasn't bad enough for the Bears, 2 key players suffered major injuries.

   "comment":"Matt Forte, leading the back on a wheel route into the flat for an 11-yard touchdown. Clausen played well in the first half, and it have been better as he was hurt by a number of dropped passes by the Bears receivers. The Lions retook the lead with a field goal drive in the third quarter. The Bears receivers continued to hurt Clausen with their fifth dropped pass, which led to a Chicago punt after crossing midfield, but a roughing-the-punter penalty gave the Bears a first down. Clausen took advantage by throwing a rope along the sideline for a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery, who made the catch over Slay. Early in the 4.h quarter, Detroit moved into Chicago territory that was keyed by Stafford converting a 4.h-and-2 with a perfect pass to Tate to beat blanket coverage by Forte, leading the back on a wheel route into the flat for an 11-yard touchdown.

   "comment":"Matt Forte the week before, while pass-rushers flooded the backfield and forced Russell Wilson into some bad throws. The Seahawks also appear to not be completely focused. They opened the game with 12 men on the field, negating a Green Bay punt. Michael Bennett was offsides on multiple occasions, resulting in big gains for the Packers. The Seahawks, on their first possession, held on a kickoff and then had to call a timeout because they had 12 men in the huddle. J.R. Sweezy was flagged for a penalty because he hit a player a minute after the whistle was blown. The Seahawks didn't run the clock down at the end of the first half while punting, giving Aaron Rodgers extra time. Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.

   "comment":"Matt Forte touchdown that allowed Chicago to hang around, despite the fact that the team wasn't doing much for most of the afternoon. Cousins also scored once on the ground, also thanks to Fuller. The cornerback bit on a play-action fake and wasn't in position to make a tackle on Cousins as a result. Cousins was solid, but was guilty of some mental blunders. In addition to the pick, he had a series in which he had to waste a timeout in the third quarter and then was flagged for a delay of game because the team couldn't get the right personnel on the field. Cousins, for some reason, ran to the sideline, wasting time in the process.    Cousins' 1 aerial score went to Jordan Reed, who caught all 9 of his targets for 120 yards and a touchdown. Reed nearly had a second score when he plowed through 3 defenders and appeared to reach the end zone on the opening drive. He was ruled down at the 1-yard line, however, and Washington scored a rushing touchdown right afterward. This performance is killing me, by the way. I have Reed in 2 leagues, but decided to bench him in 1 in favor of Tyler Eifert. As of this writing, I'm afraid to look at the live scoring of that contest.    As for Cousins' other targets, Pierre Garcon (5-52) and DeSean Jackson (2-43) both had solid outings. Jackson disappointed his fantasy owners, but he was able to draw a deep pass interference that set up Cousins' aforementioned rushing touchdown. He seemed to be banged up at the end of the game, though it didn't appear to be serious.    Alfred Morris had all the early carries. By halftime, he managed 21 yards a touchdown on 9 carries, while Matt Jones (3-6) posted meager numbers. However, Jones handled the majority of the workload after intermission. Morris finished with just 24 yards and the score on 11 attempts, while Jones generated 62 yards on 18 tries. Jones was very fortunate late in the game. He fumbled the ball while trying to run out the clock, but somehow got it back. Fumbling has been Jones' Achilles' heel, which is a shame because he's such a dynamic runner.    Meanwhile, the Bears had a middling performance from their offense. They moved the chains effectively at times, but were guilty of drops as well as a lost fumble. Jay Cutler went 19-of-31 for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was guilty of being strip-sacked. He would've enjoyed a better day had his weapons not dropped several passes.    Cutler threw touchdowns to Alshon Jeffery (6-107) and Zach Miller (5-85), who blew kisses to the fans in the stands when he reached the end zone. Miller will continue to be a big factor in the wake of Martellus Bennett's season-ending injury.    Matt Forte and Jeremy Langford split the workload evenly again.Forte touchdown that allowed Chicago to hang around, despite the fact that the team wasn't doing much for most of the afternoon.

   "comment":"Matt Forte ripping off an 18-yard run to get across midfield, and then Bilal Powell (6-76) broke up the middle and to the outside for a 35-yard touchdown run.Forte ripping off an 18-yard run to get across midfield, and then Bilal Powell (6-76) broke up the middle and to the outside for a 35-yard touchdown run. Late before the half, McCown moved the ball into Jets territory, attacking New York's cornerbacks. A Calvin Pryor pass interference in the end zone on Gary Barnidge (3-42) set up a first-and-goal at the 1. Isaiah Crowell promptly plunged into the end zone. The Browns got the ball back and used Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. "

   "comment":"Matt Forte. This was possible because 1 of the Miami players lazily went for the strip rather than trying to wrap up the running back. New York was eventually up 28-14, and Forte. This was possible because 1 of the Miami players lazily went for the strip rather than trying to wrap up the running back. New York was eventually up 28-14, and Jay Cutler suffered a rib injury. This normally would've spelled the end for any team, but not for the Dolphins, a team whose backups 10. to be better than the starters. Matt Moore, who was not much of a downgrade from Ryan Tannehill last year, stepped in, and he promptly threw an interception when he forced a throw into coverage. Moore, however, managed to rebound and put together a couple of scoring drives to tie the game. It appeared as though the teams would be headed to overtime, but Josh McCown made an absolutely bone-headed mistake. He inexplicably forced a late throw when he didn't need to, and the pass was picked off. This set up Miami's game-winning field goal.    Despite Moore's late-game heroics, he had a worse stat line than Jay Cutler, as far as completion percentage is concerned. Moore went 13-of-22 for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, while Cutler went 12-of-16 for 138 yards, 2 scores and a pick. Cutler's interception wasn't his fault, as it was a tipped pass that popped into the air. It's a shame that Cutler got hurt, as he was having a solid game.    Kenny Stills was 1 of the heroes during Miami's late-game comeback. He caught both touchdowns in the 4.h quarter, snatching 6 balls for 85 yards overall. On top of that, Stills made an acrobatic catch in the first half. Perhaps Stills will remain a big part of the offense when DeVante Parker returns, though his targets (9) will likely decrease. Jarvis Landry actually led the team in that category, as he reeled in 7 of 11 balls thrown his way for 93 yards and a touchdown. Julius Thomas (3-58) made an impressive, 1.handed grab during Miami's comeback.    I remarked earlier that better players happen to be on Miami's bench, and that was the case with Jake Brendel being on the sideline with Mike Pouncey on the field. The reason the Dolphins ran so well in Atlanta was Brendel providing a huge upgrade over the hobbled Pouncey, who needs hip surgery. I don't know why the Dolphins rushed Pouncey back, as it certainly affected Jay Ajayi's stat line. Ajayi mustered just 51 yards on 23 carries.    The Jets, meanwhile, had some decent quarterbacking from McCown until the very end. McCown was 17-of-27 for 209 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. McCown's first score was an absolutely pefect touch pass to Jermaine Kearse, and he later found Robby Anderson wide open in the end zone, thanks to a blown coverage. A chunk of McCown's yardage came via screens and blown coverages, as Miami's back 7 is an abomination. However, McCown's last pass was atrocious, especially when considering how much experience he has in the NFL.    Forte and Bilal Powell were the leaders for the Jets in receiving yardage."
