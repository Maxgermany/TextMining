   "comment":"Jacob Hester. Hester didn't realize that it was a lateral, and just stood around with his hands on his hips. The Patriots were much more aware; 3 players pounced on the ball. 3. The Chargers had a chance to kick a game-tying, 45-yard field goal at the end of the game. A false start, however, moved the ball back 5 yards. Backup kicker "
