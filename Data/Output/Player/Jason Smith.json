   "comment":"Smith. Murray tallied 253 rushing yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, eclipsing Emmitt's mark of 236. None of it was fluky; Murray is a very talented runner who was able to show off his tremendous skills against the hapless Rams. His score came on a 91-yard burst in the first quarter.    With Murray ripping off huge chunks of yardage at will, Tony Romo didn't really have to do anything. This, of course, is when Romo is at his best. He went 14-of-24 for 166 yards and 2 touchdowns. He could have thrown a third score, but Dez Bryant dropped a potential touchdown at the end of the first half. Romo's scores went to Dez Bryant (5-90) and Jason Witten (5-35). Only 4 Cowboys caught a pass.    The Rams really had no chance as a bottom-tier team starting a backup quarterback. Even though A.J. Feeley is 1 of the top reserve signal-callers in the NFL, he had issues sustaining drives. The Rams had just 13 first downs and compiled 265 yards, nearly 200 fewer than Dallas (445). Feeley (20-33, 196 yards, INT) definitely wasn't entirely to blame, even though his pick was a bad 1 in Dallas territory down only 7 points. One culprit was Cadillac Williams, who fumbled on a promising drive at Dallas' 33-yard line in the first half. The Cowboys turned the give-away into a touchdown, giving them a 14-0 lead.    Another issue the Rams had in this contest was on the offensive line. This is nothing new, but right tackle Jason Smith suffered a head injury in which he lied motionless on the field and had to be carted off. Fortunately, he was able to give the thumbs-up sign as they wheeled him into the locker room.    Two Rams of note: "
