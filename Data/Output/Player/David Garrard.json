Garrard was 23-of-32, 236 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed 7 times for 41 yards and a score.    Coke-Free "

That doesn't sound like a lot, but remember that the Jaguars had just 5 sacks on the year coming into this contest.    As mentioned, Chambers caught both touchdowns. That was very fluky, as Chambers (3 catches, 70 yards) had only 4 targets, most of which were late in the game.    "

The Jaguars trailed 17-3 at the break, so amazingly, 10 of Jones-Drew's 15 carries came in the second half. Way to run the ball only when you're down. Jones-Drew finished with 75 yards on those 15 attempts. Oh, and you'll be surprised by this 1 - the Jaguars had 5 penalties in the first half. The 49ers had just 1 all game. And note that this frustration comes despite the fact that I won 5 units on San Francisco. It just bothers me that an NFL coaching staff can be this inept week in and week out. It's like Del Rio and Koetter are betting against themselves. It's inexcusable. Rant over.    David Garrard was apparently solid by going 25-of-36 for 307 yards. However, Garrard took 6 sacks and lost 2 fumbles. He leads the NFL in fumbles with 11 (8 lost).    Aside from Jones-Drew's 5 catches, "

   "comment":"David Garrard threw a touchdown to Marcedes Lewis.    Kyle Orton had a decent fantasy day, going 21-of-33 for 295 yards, 1 score and a pick. There was 1 play though that really bothered me. Late in the 4.h quarter, the Broncos were in the red zone. Orton scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to pick up the first down. Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on 4.h down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 passes for 117 yards. Make sure you pick him up in fantasy; Orton really loves throwing to him. Meanwhile, Eddie Royal had 8 grabs for 98 yards, and Jabar Gaffney caught 3 balls for 34 yards and a score. I'm not too confident in Royal yet; he's worth picking up, but he could easily catch 1 pass next week.    Knowshon Moreno had 60 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. More importantly, he didn't fumble like Correll Buckhalter (6-15).    Maurice Jones-Drew, meanwhile, totaled 98 yards on 23 carries, but couldn't find the end zone. David Garrard hogged all the scores, tossing 3 touchdowns to go along with his 16-of-21 passing.    Garrard's favorite target against the Broncos was "

He scored 2 plays later. Jones-Drew finished with 133 rushing yards (23 carries) and 87 receiving yards (3 catches) and the decisive score.    The Jaguars had 6 sacks in this contest.
