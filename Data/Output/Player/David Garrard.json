Despite all of the Aaron Rodgers-Brett Favre talk before this year began, it's been Green Bay's defense that has debacled the team's postseason hopes.    Garrard somehow went 21-of-33 for 238 yards and 2 touchdowns, despite not having Matt Coke Zero Jones at his disposal. An interesting note is that Garrard is now 8-of-8 when running on third-and-one this season.    Northcutt somehow caught 5 passes for 127 yards and a score. I guess that's what happens when you put 2 crappy teams together.    "

   "comment":"David Garrard threw a touchdown to Marcedes Lewis.    Kyle Orton had a decent fantasy day, going 21-of-33 for 295 yards, 1 score and a pick. There was 1 play though that really bothered me. Late in the 4.h quarter, the Broncos were in the red zone. Orton scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to pick up the first down. Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on 4.h down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 passes for 117 yards. Make sure you pick him up in fantasy; Orton really loves throwing to him. Meanwhile, Eddie Royal had 8 grabs for 98 yards, and Jabar Gaffney caught 3 balls for 34 yards and a score. I'm not too confident in Royal yet; he's worth picking up, but he could easily catch 1 pass next week.    Knowshon Moreno had 60 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. More importantly, he didn't fumble like Correll Buckhalter (6-15).    Maurice Jones-Drew, meanwhile, totaled 98 yards on 23 carries, but couldn't find the end zone. David Garrard hogged all the scores, tossing 3 touchdowns to go along with his 16-of-21 passing.    Garrard's favorite target against the Broncos was Garrard threw a touchdown to Marcedes Lewis.

The Texans always seem to find a way to screw themselves. Jacksonville shouldn't have even had the ball; tight end Joel Dresseen fumbled in Jaguars territory to ruin a potential field goal attempt seconds earlier.    Speaking of Quin, he was responsible for 1 of the worst tackling attempts I've ever seen on Jaguar tight end Zach Miller's 52-yard touchdown in the second half. Houston sucked at tackling throughout. On 1 of the most humiliating sequence of events this season, the Jaguars scored on a 9.play, 52-yard drive in the second quarter. Every single play on the possession was a Maurice Jones-Drew or Rashad Jennings rushing attempt. Jones-Drew rushed for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries.    Garrard was the hero of the game. In addition to delivering that Hail Mary, he went 24-of-31 for 342 yards and 2 scores. He also rushed for 35 yards on 7 scrambles. It would have been nice to see Garrard trying hard again, but I had 4 units on Houston.    "
