The Rams' offensive turn-around can be attributed to having a successful running game. Zac Stacy ran well for the second week in a row, gaining 79 yards on 18 carries. Daryl Richardson (3-5) was barely a factor.    No St. Louis player had more than 2 catches. Jared Cook (2-45), Givens (2-20) and Stacy (2-11) led the way in that department.
