   "comment":"Joe Webb, to enter the game and led the team to a victory. Poor Viking fans can kiss Luck and Kalil goodbye. It's unfortunate, but this victory potentially has set Minnesota's franchise back a couple of years. At least Viking fans will always have this win over the Redskins that they can tell their grandchildren about 1 day.    Webb scored 3 touchdowns in the second half. Two came aerially, where Webb was a solid 4-of-5 for 84 yards. The other came on the ground, as he added 34 rushing yards on 5 scrambles to his stats. Ponder, meanwhile, went 8-of-13 for only 68 yards.    Webb's touchdowns went to "

With that in mind, you can imagine my reaction when Ponder left the game in the second quarter with a hip injury. I yelled, S***! It turns out that I overreacted. Webb was better than Ponder, but the former was guilty of 2 interceptions. He went 17-of-32 for 200 yards and the picks. Ponder, meanwhile, was 4-of-10 for 28 yards and an interception of his own.
