   "comment":"Webb was orchestrating an impressive possession, moving his team inside the Detroit 3-yard line. The clock was running down, however, and it looked like the Vikings weren't going to have enough time to do anything. Lions defensive end Cliff Avril took this opportunity to inexplicably jump offsides before Webb could spike the ball, setting up Minnesota at the 1-yard line. The Vikings wouldn't score. Webb fumbled the ball, which was kicked a few times before Detroit mercifully fell on it instead of running it back to cover the spread. The thing is, Minnesota should have had another shot at the 1-yard line; the fumble occurred because Webb was grabbed by the face mask. Unfortunately for the Vikings - or fortunately, because of their draft position - the officials missed the obvious call.    Webb was so much better than "
