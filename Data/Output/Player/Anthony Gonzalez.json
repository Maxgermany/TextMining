While I wouldn't dispute any of Indianapolis' infractions in overtime, it seemed like Ron Winter's crew missed a few San Diego penalties. However, it wasn't completely 1.sided; the Chargers were whistled for a pass interference where the defensive back barely laid a fingernail on the Indianapolis receiver. I think it's more ineptness than larceny concerning Winter's crew.    Something else that must be discussed is Norv Turner. Turner was up to his old tricks when he wasted a timeout on a third-and-10 with 3 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter, with his team down 17-14 on Indianapolis' 44-yard line. Turner was also indecisive on a crucial 4.h down earlier, nearly causing his team to have a delay-of-game penalty. I consider it a miracle that Turner has been able to win 3 playoff games in the past 2 seasons. Forget some mold that looks like the Virgin Mary; people looking for a sign from God should take a trip down to San Diego. ');   "
