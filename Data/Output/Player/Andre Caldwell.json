   "comment":"Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does tend to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. "

   "comment":"Caldwell let 1 go through his hands early, but Demaryius Thomas was the primary culprit. Thomas was guilty of 8 negative plays, which were either drops or passes defensed because he didn't come back for the ball. Thus, Osweiler could've easily completed 32 of his 42 attempts, which would've been extremely impressive against a stellar defense in fierce weather. Also with Osweiler, there were some negatives. He took a couple of bad sacks because he held on to the ball too long. He was bailed out by the hold on Thomas on 1 occasion, but another took his team out of field goal range. Also, Osweiler seemed to have trouble lining his team up sometimes, prompting the Broncos to waste a couple of timeouts early in the second half.    Going back to Thomas, he saw a whopping 13 targets, but was able to reel in just 1 pass for 36 yards. As mentioned, Thomas dropped passes and refused to come back for passes. He also had some miscommunications with Osweiler. I've never seen Thomas play so poorly before; it's as if he spent the entire prior night partying with Johnny Manziel. However, Thomas came up big when it mattered most, as his 36-yard reception came on a late drive in which Denver took the lead.    Denver's leading receiver was "
