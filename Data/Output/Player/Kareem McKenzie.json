   "comment":"Kareem McKenzie sprained his MCL in the second quarter. He didn't return to the game either.    With their victory, the Eagles are now in complete control of the NFC East at 9-4. They have 2 home games coming up against the 49ers and Broncos, while the Cowboys travel to undefeated New Orleans. Philly should be able to lock up its division pretty soon. Meanwhile, the Giants are 7-6, but they're far from out of it because they own the tie-breaker over capsizing Dallas.   "
