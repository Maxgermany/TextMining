   "comment":"Witten for a 1-yard touchdown. With the Lions up 27-3, Romo breathed some life into a Lion defense that was bleeding yards and points. Romo threw a terrible pass short of his receiver, and it was intercepted by Lions linebacker Bobby Carpenter. The former Cowboy first-round pick cut in front of a receiver around the 35-yard line. He zig-zagged his way downfield and returned the interception for a touchdown. The next possession was, as Yogi Berra would say, deja vu all over again. Romo threw a slant pass toward Robinson, but it was off the mark. Houston out-fought Robinson for the ball and made the interception. Houston raced down the sideline 56 yards and dodged a few potential tackles for a touchdown. Romo was aided by a dumb facemask penalty on Ndamukong Suh. The Lions kept Suh blocked for most of the game, but Suh hit Romo hard with a hand to the face of Romo. It turned an incompletion on a third down to a first down around midfield. Romo's next play was a 37-yard pass to Witten. That led to a field goal and a 30-17 lead. After the Lion defense got Stafford back in the game, he returned the favor in the fourth quarter when he finally got the ball into the end zone. Stafford threw a jump ball in the end zone for Johnson, and Megatron out leaped 2 defenders to come down with a 23-yard touchdown catch. After a 3-and-out, the Lions moved the ball, but sloppy play and penalties forced Detroit to settle for a field goal to make it a 3-point game. Detroit put up 10 more points to narrow it to 30-27. With just over 4 minutes remaining, Romo was pressured by Suh. He tossed a ball up for Witten that was short of his tight end. Linebacker "

   "comment":"Witten, to get inside the Giants 20-yard line, but on fourth-and-1, Romo couldn't find an open receiver and threw an interception to Brown. Dallas got 1 more shot and ran out of time with Romo's last pass sailing through the end zone. He finished 36-of-62 for 437 yards, a passing touchdown and 4 interceptions. Witten has had a frustrating season, but he broke out with a super performance to the tune of 18 receptions for 167 yards. New York's linebackers were completely incapable of covering Witten.    The Cowboys' defense was excellent, and if it hadn't been for all the turnovers, the stop unit would have done more than its job to produce a win against the defending champs. "

   "comment":"Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged 7 times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly Cole Beasley (7-68)."

Witten finished with 110 catches on the year, extending his NFL single-season record for tight ends, which he broke last week.    These 2 teams were among the most penalized entering this weekend, so it was surprising that the first yellow flag wasn't thrown until the 8:59 mark of the fourth quarter. Washington and Dallas combined for just 3 infractions.    The Redskins locked up the NFC East and the No. 4 seed with the victory. They'll host the Seahawks next Sunday. Sportsbooks actually have them as a 2.5-point home underdog. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

   "comment":"Witten's drop was also key, as it ruined a drive at the end of the second quarter. - Tony Romo (34-of-51, 337 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) had a decent game overall, but he cost his team some points by taking 2 consecutive sacks in the red zone during the first half. His pick, which came much later, was a terrible 1. - Jason Garrett screwed up a couple of times. He had to waste a timeout on defense, prompting heavy boos from the crowd, and he also failed to challenge a play in which DeMarco Murray seemed to achieve a first down. Murray seemingly hit the ground, but was actually on top of a Minnesota player. Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. Lance Dunbar and Joseph Randle combined for 4 more carries. I have no idea why Dallas didn't bother with its ground attack. - The defense let Christian Ponder look like an elite quarterback on most occasions. He completed 25-of-37 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Ponder also had a 19-yard scramble early on a third-and-9. However, he really cost his team with a late interception and a strip-sack fumble by George Selvie in the end zone, which was recovered by Nick Hayden for a score. Ponder was able to be effective most of the time because of Adrian Peterson, who seemed like he was running with extra motivation. He gained 140 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, as he dragged defenders on many of his attempts. He also caught 3 balls for 37 receiving yards. Peterson was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 in the beginning of the second quarter when the Vikings were in the red zone. I disagreed with the call, as the correct move would've been kicking the field goal to establish a 6-3 lead.    Ponder's sole aerial touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (2-35), thanks to missed tackles by safeties Jeff Heath and Barry Church. Unfortunately, Rudolph injured his foot. It looked like it could be serious. Minnesota's leading receiver was Greg Jennings (6-56).    Minnesota right tackle Phil Loadholt was knocked out of the game with a concussion.    Going back to the Cowboys for a second, Jason Witten (8-102) had a big game despite the prior drop. Cole Beasley (6-68), Bryant and Murray (6-19) all caught 6 balls. "

   "comment":"Witten let a pass pop into the air. The ball landed into the arms of an Eagle, and Philadelphia scored a touchdown 2 plays later. These 2 careless give-aways led to 10 points, which obviously was greater than the margin of victory. Had Dallas remained clean, it may just have won this game.    Having said that, the Eagles deserve credit for this victory. I don't know how Nick Foles does it, but he lobs up these passes that look like they're up for grabs, yet his teammates somehow always come up with improbable catches. Foles went 17-of-26 for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns, though he took a number of bad sacks. Cris Collinsworth did a great job of highlighting the issue; when faced with a tough pass rush, Foles brings his eyes down. Dallas sacked him 5 times (1 of which resulted in a forced fumble) and also forced him into an intentional grounding. There actually should've been a second grounding call, but the officials incorrectly ruled that a Philadelphia receiver was in the area.    As many expected the Eagles ran all over the Cowboys. LeSean McCoy rushed for 131 yards on 27 carries and also scored on his sole reception. McCoy, however, lost a touchdown on the ground to Bryce Brown (2-11).    Foles, who nearly scored on the ground via a failed sneak at the goal line, saw his aerial touchdowns go to Brent Celek (3-71) and McCoy. No Eagle recorded more than 3 receptions, though 5 players on the team managed that distinction: Celek, Jason Avant (3-45), Zach Ertz (3-43), Riley Cooper (3-39) and DeSean Jackson (3-28).    Moving on to the Cowboys, Orton actually began 7-of-7 for 58 yards before misfiring for the first time on a throw that was behind Dez Bryant. Orton finished 30-of-46 for 358 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Again, he played well, but the second pick was an absolute killer. On a potential game-winning drive, Orton threw behind Miles Austin-Jones. Brandon Boykin snatched the interception, which sealed the victory for Philadelphia. Orton's 2 touchdowns went to Dez Bryant (8-99) and Gavin Escobar. Despite the bobbled pass that turned into an interception, Jason Witten paced the team with 12 receptions for 135 yards. Witten got banged up in this game, as he had to limp to the sideline on a couple of occasions.    Murray, who had the aforementioned fumble on the opening drive, was limited to just 51 yards on 17 carries. Though he dropped a pass as well, he did most of his damage as a receiver - and I mean that quite literally. On 1 of his 5 catches (39 receiving yards), he plowed right into "

They sucked nearly 9 minutes off the clock, and when they were up 17-0, it appeared to be a lock that they were going to pull the upset. However, they did plenty to bungle a potential victory. They made numerous mistakes, including: - The defense horribly blew a coverage in the third quarter, leaving Bryant wide open. Romo found him for a 68-yard touchdown. - Jeff Fisher opted to go for it on fourth-and-inches on the Dallas 9-yard line. "

All of his catches came in the first half.    The Redskins, meanwhile, had chances to make this a close game, but lost because of stupidity by both the coach and quarterback. Jay Gruden made a dumb decision when he didn't call timeout at the end of the first half with a Dallas punt upcoming. The Redskins could've tried for a block or a nice return, but Gruden's not capable of this sort of sharp thinking. Griffin, meanwhile, was absolutely terrible. He had some long completions that were actually short or intermediate passes that his receivers took for big gains. That includes "

   "comment":"Witten for a score, but DeMeco Ryans made a great play to break up the pass. Romo also had a long conversion to Terrance Williams negated by an illegal formation. Williams hurt Romo with a drop as well.    Weeden, as mentioned, performed well in Romo's absence. He completed all 7 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. Cowboy fans shouldn't be overly optimistic, however, as Weeden had the luxury of torching a poor defense, featuring Byron Maxwell, who has been brutal through 2 games with the Eagles thus far. Weeden might be able to win some games, but he'll have to lean on the defense, which will be getting back Rolando McClain and Greg Hardy in Week 5.    Williams, despite the drop and nullified completion, led the Cowboys with 84 receiving yards and a touchdown from Weeden. He'll continue to be targeted heavily until Bryant returns, but without Romo, Williams won't be much of a fantasy option. In fact, the only viable fantasy option for the Cowboys for the time being will be Jason Witten, who logged 7 catches for 56 yards. Witten, who saw a team-high 8 targets, was banged up in this game, but fought through what appeared to be an ankle injury.    "

It needs to be emphasized how much of a problem this was, as the light was blinding for the Cowboys in the direction they were moving in during the fourth quarter. The Cowboys need to reconsider ever having a 4 p.m. home start time again in September and October. That, or Jerry Jones needs to throw another billion dollars into his precious monstrosity.    Beasley was next on the receiving chart, catching 8 passes for 65 yards. As mentioned he dropped a touchdown, much like Bryant, who hauled in only 1 ball for 8 yards. Both had drops in the sunlight. It was embarrassing, and it epitomized Jones' ownership in the post-Jimmy Johnson era. Jones likes to think big, but doesn't take care of all the smaller, important details.    OK, that was the last time I'll rip Jones, so let's just begin discussing the Giants. New York's offensive line was seen as a big problem area heading into the year, but I don't think we learned anything. The Cowboys had zero pass rush in this game, though that was to be expected because all of their key players were missing. One of the FOX announcers said it best when he noted that there were drug suspensions all over their defense. With no defenders in his face, "

   "comment":"Witten on a third down that would've moved the chains. His only blemish was a lost fumble in the red zone, which was the first turnover of his young career. Prescott was amazingly precise, finishing 18-of-24 for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). If he had a blank jersey on, you'd think he were some sort of 6-year veteran. He doesn't look like a rookie whatsoever, and he still hasn't thrown an interception. In the wake of Wentz's pick, Prescott now holds the record for most completions by a first-year quarterback without an interception. Elliott, meanwhile, ripped through a Cincinnati ground defense that was supposed to be better because of Vontaze Burfict's return. The Bengals simply had no chance against him, as Elliott galloped for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries. He also caught 3 passes for 37 yards.    Prescott's sole aerial score went to Cole Beasley, who caught all 4 of his targets for 53 yards. Terrance Williams (5-70) led Dallas in receiving, while Witten (3-43) will be itching to redeem himself for the aforementioned drop.    Speaking of redemption, I don't think "

   "comment":"Witten, but it appeared as though there may have been a miscommunication. Prescott finished 18-of-27 for 247 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. Prescott was precise on most of his throws, but he did fumble twice. He was fortunate to recover 1 of those, as he simply dropped the ball without getting hit. It ruined a trip into the red zone, as Dallas ultimately had to settle for a field goal.    The scary thing about all of this for the Cowboys is that Prescott is winning and thriving without Dez Bryant, who sounded like he was close to returning. With Bryant out, Prescott was able to spread the wealth. Terrance Williams led the way with 4 grabs for 75 yards, while Cole Beasley (6-58) scored twice.

   "comment":"Witten for the decisive touchdown. Prescott finished 19-of-39 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception to Hicks. He made up for that horrid completion percentage by moving well on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 38 rushing yards and an additional score. His early struggles at least have to be somewhat worrisome, but his ability to come through in the clutch means so much more.    The Cowboys welcomed Bryant back to the lineup for the first time since Week 3. Bryant caught just 4 of his 14 targets, though that wasn't his fault, as Prescott dealt with accuracy issues. Bryant did have 113 yards and a touchdown, but he really should have found the end zone 3 times. Aside from Bryant, only 2 other Cowboys had more than 25 receiving yards: Elliott (4-52) and Cole Beasley (4-53). Witten, who scored the game-winning touchdown, only snatched 2 balls for 16 yards.    Speaking of Elliot, he was impressive once again, gaining 96 yards on 22 carries. The Eagles have a strong ground defense, so don't read anything into Elliott failing to reach the century mark. Elliott burst for some tremendous runs in this contest, and he had a long gain negated by a shaky holding call.    Before moving on to the Eagles, it's worth noting that 2 important Dallas defensive backs - "

Moving on to the Vikings, the defensive players have to feel extremely frustrated that their offense let them down once again. The special teams did as well, and I'll get to them later, but Bradford was underwhelming. He made some nice plays, including a third-and-16 conversion to Thielen in the early going. However, he was once again Captain Checkdown, going 32-of-45 for only 247 yards and a touchdown. That's a YPA of 5.49, which is trending into Brodie Croyle territory. He was also picked off on 1 occasion, but that was negated by a penalty. Bradford had some ugly checkdowns, where he tossed a 1-yard pass on third-and-6 and then hurled a 6-yard throw on third-and-18 with 7 minutes remaining. Bradford had "

Prescott went 24-of-38 for 302 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, a telegraphed throw snatched by Micah Hyde. There was some question as to how Prescott would perform as a rookie in his first playoff game, and aside from the pick, he passed with flying colors. In fact, his numbers could've been much better had his receivers not dropped a few balls. There's no doubt that Tony Romo will be traded this offseason. The only question is to which team.    Elliott, meanwhile, registered 125 yards on 22 carries. He moved the pile on most of his attempts, and 1 of his best runs featured a sick spin move to avoid Clay Matthews. Elliott also had a gain of about 15 wiped out by a Doug Free holding call.    Bryant was perhaps Dallas' top offensive player in this contest. The Packers had no answer for him, as Bryant hauled in 9 of his 12 targets for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns. Witten (6-59) reeled in Prescott's other score. Bryant and Witten were Prescott's only reliable downfield options. "

   "comment":"Witten (3-35) and Terrance Williams (2-36) led the way. Witten is a fine TE2 and can be used as a streamer in good matchups, but for the most part, Bryant is the only Cowboys pass catcher who is worth owning.    Kirk Cousins had a pretty strong day for the Redskins. Though his stat line may not look like anything more than average - 26-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 pick - he did well in the very rainy conditions. Cousins' ball placement was very good, but he was victimized by drops from his receivers and a couple of throws that were taken by gusts of wind. For the most part, he was able to hit his receivers with accurate passes. Cousins' best throw came on his touchdown pass to Doctson. Cousins showed poise in the pocket and took a hit while delivering a perfect strike to Doctson in the back of the end zone. It was lofted just over the linebacker where only Doctson could get it. Cousins has clutch abilities, and that will help him get a big deal if he hits the open market this offseason.    Though the receivers didn't play particularly well for the Redskins on Sunday, they finally got 1 of their top guys going. "

He can be a streamer at tight end most weeks, but is likely limited to being a TE2. Meanwhile, Bryant's potential will be capped as long as the offensive line struggles. He has had a tough season as it is, so he is only an average WR2 at this point in time.    With Elliott out, the Cowboys' running game was led by "
