   "comment":"Jason Witten scored, and handed the ball to teammate Marc Colombo. Colombo spiked the ball, which drew a yellow flag because 2 players were involved on a celebration (a B.S. rule, but the right call). The Cowboys were pushed back to their 15 on the kickoff, which helped Marc Mariani set up the Titans in the red zone thanks to a 73-yard kickoff and a face mask penalty. Chris Johnson scored the game-winning touchdown 3 plays later.    Tony Romo went 31-of-46 for 406 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions (1 came in desperation mode). Believe it or not, Romo became the first Cowboys 400-yard passer since Troy Aikman in 1998.    Romo went to Miles Austin-Jones early and often. Austin-Jones had 9 catches for 166 yards and a score. Roy Williams (6-87) and Jason Witten (5-84) also caught touchdowns. As for "

He dropped numerous passes, including a potential touchdown, hurting Dallas' ability to move the chains. Romo, as a result, went just 23-of-40 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick.

   "comment":"Jason Witten had 3 dropped passes. He had a terrible drop inside the 10 that could've set up a touchdown. The 10-year veteran looks like he is declining.    The other biggest headline from this game is that Freeman is still deeply in regression mode. He was pathetically ineffective for Tampa Bay, and this kind of performance is inexcusable in his 4.h season. The vast majority of his passes were off the mark and wildly inaccurate. Freeman completed only 10-of-28 attempts for 110 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. "

Dallas got 1 more shot and ran out of time with Romo's last pass sailing through the end zone. He finished 36-of-62 for 437 yards, a passing touchdown and 4 interceptions. Witten has had a frustrating season, but he broke out with a super performance to the tune of 18 receptions for 167 yards. New York's linebackers were completely incapable of covering Witten.    The Cowboys' defense was excellent, and if it hadn't been for all the turnovers, the stop unit would have done more than its job to produce a win against the defending champs. "

   "comment":"Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged 7 times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly Cole Beasley (7-68)."

   "comment":"Jason Witten was second to Bryant in receiving, snagging 7 balls for 56 yards and a touchdown. Witten finished with 110 catches on the year, extending his NFL single-season record for tight ends, which he broke last week.    These 2 teams were among the most penalized entering this weekend, so it was surprising that the first yellow flag wasn't thrown until the 8:59 mark of the 4.h quarter. Washington and Dallas combined for just 3 infractions.    The Redskins locked up the NFC East and the No. 4 seed with the victory. They'll host the Seahawks next Sunday. Sportsbooks actually have them as a 2.5-point home underdog.   "

   "comment":"Jason Witten's drop was also key, as it ruined a drive at the end of the second quarter. - Tony Romo (34-of-51, 337 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) had a decent game overall, but he cost his team some points by taking 2 consecutive sacks in the red zone during the first half. His pick, which came much later, was a terrible 1. - Jason Garrett screwed up a couple of times. He had to waste a timeout on defense, prompting heavy boos from the crowd, and he also failed to challenge a play in which DeMarco Murray seemed to achieve a first down. Murray seemingly hit the ground, but was actually on top of a Minnesota player. Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. Lance Dunbar and Joseph Randle combined for 4 more carries. I have no idea why Dallas didn't bother with its ground attack. - The defense let Christian Ponder look like an elite quarterback on most occasions. He completed 25-of-37 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Ponder also had a 19-yard scramble early on a third-and-9. However, he really cost his team with a late interception and a strip-sack fumble by George Selvie in the end zone, which was recovered by Nick Hayden for a score. Ponder was able to be effective most of the time because of Adrian Peterson, who seemed like he was running with extra motivation. He gained 140 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, as he dragged defenders on many of his attempts. He also caught 3 balls for 37 receiving yards. Peterson was stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 in the beginning of the second quarter when the Vikings were in the red zone. I disagreed with the call, as the correct move would've been kicking the field goal to establish a 6-3 lead.    Ponder's sole aerial touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (2-35), thanks to missed tackles by safeties Jeff Heath and Barry Church. Unfortunately, Rudolph injured his foot. It looked like it could be serious. Minnesota's leading receiver was Greg Jennings (6-56).    Minnesota right tackle Phil Loadholt was knocked out of the game with a concussion.    Going back to the Cowboys for a second, Jason Witten (8-102) had a big game despite the prior drop. Cole Beasley (6-68), Bryant and Murray (6-19) all caught 6 balls. "

   "comment":"Jason Witten let a pass pop into the air. The ball landed into the arms of an Eagle, and Philadelphia scored a touchdown 2 plays later. These 2 careless give-aways led to 10 points, which obviously was greater than the margin of victory. Had Dallas remained clean, it may just have won this game.    Having said that, the Eagles deserve credit for this victory. I don't know how Nick Foles does it, but he lobs up these passes that look like they're up for grabs, yet his teammates somehow always come up with improbable catches. Foles went 17-of-26 for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns, though he took a number of bad sacks. Cris Collinsworth did a great job of highlighting the issue; when faced with a tough pass rush, Foles brings his eyes down. Dallas sacked him 5 times (1 of which resulted in a forced fumble) and also forced him into an intentional grounding. There actually should've been a second grounding call, but the officials incorrectly ruled that a Philadelphia receiver was in the area.    As many expected the Eagles ran all over the Cowboys. LeSean McCoy rushed for 131 yards on 27 carries and also scored on his sole reception. McCoy, however, lost a touchdown on the ground to Bryce Brown (2-11).    Foles, who nearly scored on the ground via a failed sneak at the goal line, saw his aerial touchdowns go to Brent Celek (3-71) and McCoy. No Eagle recorded more than 3 receptions, though 5 players on the team managed that distinction: Celek, Jason Avant (3-45), Zach Ertz (3-43), Riley Cooper (3-39) and DeSean Jackson (3-28).    Moving on to the Cowboys, Orton actually began 7-of-7 for 58 yards before misfiring for the first time on a throw that was behind Dez Bryant. Orton finished 30-of-46 for 358 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Again, he played well, but the second pick was an absolute killer. On a potential game-winning drive, Orton threw behind Miles Austin-Jones. Brandon Boykin snatched the interception, which sealed the victory for Philadelphia. Orton's 2 touchdowns went to Dez Bryant (8-99) and Gavin Escobar. Despite the bobbled pass that turned into an interception, Jason Witten paced the team with 12 receptions for 135 yards. Witten got banged up in this game, as he had to limp to the sideline on a couple of occasions.    Murray, who had the aforementioned fumble on the opening drive, was limited to just 51 yards on 17 carries. Though he dropped a pass as well, he did most of his damage as a receiver - and I mean that quite literally. On 1 of his 5 catches (39 receiving yards), he plowed right into "

They sucked nearly 9 minutes off the clock, and when they were up 17-0, it appeared to be a lock that they were going to pull the upset. However, they did plenty to bungle a potential victory. They made numerous mistakes, including: - The defense horribly blew a coverage in the third quarter, leaving Bryant wide open. Romo found him for a 68-yard touchdown. - Jeff Fisher opted to go for it on 4.h-and-inches on the Dallas 9-yard line. "

   "comment":"Jason Witten for a score, but DeMeco Ryans made a great play to break up the pass. Romo also had a long conversion to Terrance Williams negated by an illegal formation. Williams hurt Romo with a drop as well.    Weeden, as mentioned, performed well in Romo's absence. He completed all 7 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. Cowboy fans shouldn't be overly optimistic, however, as Weeden had the luxury of torching a poor defense, featuring Byron Maxwell, who has been brutal through 2 games with the Eagles thus far. Weeden might be able to win some games, but he'll have to lean on the defense, which will be getting back Rolando McClain and Greg Hardy in Week 5.    Williams, despite the drop and nullified completion, led the Cowboys with 84 receiving yards and a touchdown from Weeden. He'll continue to be targeted heavily until Bryant returns, but without Romo, Williams won't be much of a fantasy option. In fact, the only viable fantasy option for the Cowboys for the time being will be Jason Witten, who logged 7 catches for 56 yards. Witten, who saw a team-high 8 targets, was banged up in this game, but fought through what appeared to be an ankle injury.    "

He made up for that horrid completion percentage by moving well on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 38 rushing yards and an additional score. His early struggles at least have to be somewhat worrisome, but his ability to come through in the clutch means so much more.    The Cowboys welcomed Bryant back to the lineup for the first time since Week 3. Bryant caught just 4 of his 14 targets, though that wasn't his fault, as Prescott dealt with accuracy issues. Bryant did have 113 yards and a touchdown, but he really should have found the end zone 3 times. Aside from Bryant, only 2 other Cowboys had more than 25 receiving yards: Elliott (4-52) and "
