Rivers connected with Antonio Gates later in the first half for 33-yard gain against Mark Barron. The veteran duo took advantage of the rookie again for a 13-yard touchdown. Gates had Barron beaten for another touchdown, but Rivers had a poorly underthrown pass to let Barron recover for the pass breakup. The Chargers took the lead just before halftime with Rivers throwing a fastball for a short touchdown pass to Malcolm Floyd.    The Bucs' defense held Rivers to only 3 second-half points. He had the opportunity for more scores, but shaky pass protection and improved play from the Tampa Bay secondary kept him from capitalizing. Rivers completed 29-of-37 passes for 337 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.    Alexander led the Chargers in receiving with 134 yards on 5 catches. Floyd (6-63), Gates (4-57), "
