   "comment":"Danario Alexander. St. Louis almost has to draft Julio Jones or Justin Blackmon this April. <b> B) Sam Bradford: </b> Bradford was abysmal and may have lost his Offensive Rookie of the Year award. He went 19-of-36 for 155 yards and a pick, and had numerous balls batted down at the line of scrimmage. Bradford eventually looked rattled and made a terrible read on his costly interception. Immediately afterward, Awesome Kelly in Arizona texted me: Sam Bradford just looked retarded after that pick.. he showed no emotion indicating he had any idea that he did anything wrong. Write that down. When a hot chick who likes football tells you to write something down, you write it down. <b> C) Steve Spagnuolo: </b> Someone must have stolen Spagnuolo's red flags because he should have called for a challenge on a potential catch along the sidelines and a horrific spot that I'll discuss later.
