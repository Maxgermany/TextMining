  "comment":"Donald Butler had a great tackle on third-and-1 for a loss of 2. Manuel threw the ball to nobody on 4.h down. Buffalo's offensive line played like garbage in the 4.h quarter, including allowing a safety in the final minutes.    Rivers completed 18-of-25 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. "
