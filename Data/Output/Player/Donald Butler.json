   "comment":"Donald Butler at the Broncos 11-yard line. Rivers turned that into 7 points with a short pass to Danny Woodhead (6-27 rushing, 4-17 receiving). The Chargers' comeback attempt continued as Rivers dropped in a 24-yard pass to Gates and a pass of 30 yards to Eddie Royal (2-36) on a third-and-13. On third-and-goal, Mathews (14-59) dived over the pile for a score. That cut the Denver lead to 28-20. After getting a Denver punt, Rivers converted a third-and-12 with a pass to Vincent Brown before the Broncos forced a punt via a furious pass rush. Manning ended the game with some completions to Demaryius Thomas. However, Denver paid a price as Corey Liuget fell on Manning's knees and ankles. Manning was hobbling around the field, but finished the kneel downs. He completed 25-of-36 passes for 330 yards and 4 touchdowns.    Rivers was 19-of-29 for 218 yards with a score. His supporting cast let him down with some dropped passes and poor pass blocking. The Denver pass rush really got aggressive late as Shaun Philips, Von Miller and Terrance Knighton joined Wolfe in recording sacks for the Broncos.    Defensively, Donald Butler played well for San Diego. "

Buffalo's offensive line played like garbage in the 4.h quarter, including allowing a safety in the final minutes.    Rivers completed 18-of-25 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. "
