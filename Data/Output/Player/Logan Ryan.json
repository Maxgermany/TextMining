The second-year signal-caller followed it up with another nice drive featuring some good runs from Daniel Thomas (9-47). On third-and-3 at the 5.yard line, Tannehill threw a bullet to Thomas for a touchdown and a 17-3 halftime lead. The Dolphins were moving well in the third quarter before Rob Ninkovich came with a pressure that set up a sack for Dont'a Hightower. That pushed Miami back and led to a 46-yard missed field goal by Caleb Sturgis. After that miss, it was all Patriots the rest of the way. New England moved the ball down the field with Brady hitting Aaron Dobson (4-60) for a 14-yard touchdown. The ensuing possession saw Logan Ryan (2 sacks) come unblocked on a blind-side blitz and hit Tannehill for a forced fumble. The ball was recovered by Ninkovich. A pass to "

He had only a couple of misfires, including 1 pass where he missed an open Jordan Cameron downfield. He also had a dropped interception that Jamie Collins let slip through his hands. However, Tannehill ended the year on an excellent note. The Dolphins need to improve his blocking this offseason.    Another positive sign for the Dolphins: DeVante Parker went off, catching 5 balls for 106 yards and a touchdown. His best reception was a 46-yard grab he made over Logan Ryan. "
