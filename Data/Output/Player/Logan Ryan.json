   "comment":"Logan Ryan made a great deal of tackles as well. Ryan totaled a ridiculous 17 tackles, though part of that was due to some completions that he allowed. Still, it is rare to see a corner have so many tackles in any NFL game.    One final note: there was a pregame shoving match featuring Bills safety "
