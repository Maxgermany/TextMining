   "comment":"Montgomery on the opening offensive drive - but was otherwise very mediocre. A big part of the problem was that Rodgers dealt with a ton of pressure. The Rams' ferocious defensive line hounded him, and it didn't help that guard T.J. Lang was carted into the locker room. This is the second straight week that Rodgers has been rushed heavily, so this has to be a concern for the team going forward.    Jones and Montgomery, who had the 2 scores, led the team in receiving yardage. The former caught 2 balls for 77 yards, while Montgomery snared 4 balls for 59 yards. If you want to own Montgomery, that's fine, but keep in mind that he was fourth on the team in targets despite his output. He saw just 5 balls go his way, and if you take away the 31-yard score, his final numbers would've been 3 receptions for 28 yards. I'm not going to add him to my fantasy roster.    "

   "comment":"Montgomery left with an injury (carted off), and Randall Cobb isn't 100 percent, and his offensive line is iffy, but Rodgers still missed some throws he ordinarily makes. At the end of the game, Rodgers had Richard Rodgers open in the end zone twice, but overthrew him on both occasions. As a consequence, Rivers had a chance to tie at the very end, but came up just a bit short. Rodgers finished 16-of-29 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those aren't bad numbers, by any means, but Rodgers simply didn't look right. His receiving corps and offensive line need to improve. The Packers have a bye week to get their act together.    Panic time for Eddie Lacy owners? Lacy was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 3 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Lacy had a tender ankle, which begs the question, why did he even play? Lacy looked slow and sluggish. He also fumbled, but was fortunate to have a teammate fall on the ball. James Starks, on the other hand, gained 112 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries, with most of his production coming on a 65-yard sprint to the end zone early on. Starks also caught a 5-yard touchdown on his only catch.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb is hurting. That was apparent, as he was able to catch just 2 balls for 38 yards. He also was guilty of a drop. James Jones had even fewer yards (2-30), but at least caught a touchdown. With Montgomery getting knocked out, Jeff Janis led the team with 79 receiving yards on 2 catches."

   "comment":"Montgomery, as Jordy Nelson did nothing. Adams caught a ridiculous 13 passes for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is remarkable because he wasn't even expected to play, given that he was going through concussion protocol on a short work week. Cobb snatched 11 balls for 95 yards and a late score, though he dropped an early touchdown on the opening drive. Montgomery, meanwhile, played running back, yet was still able to catch 10 passes for 66 yards. He also rushed for 60 yards on 9 carries. The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy. As for Nelson, it's clear that he's not 100 percent. "

   "comment":"Montgomery. In the first half, the dual-threat player only had 4 carries. He had a big burst on the opening play, where he slipped through the offensive line and followed his blockers for a big gain, but he was not used for a while afterward. The team insisted on giving Don Jackson carries. He only managed 8 yards on 4 attempts. Montgomery was able to rush for 53 yards on 7 carries and caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He caught a screen pass late where he ducked away from defenders, and that is where many of his receiving yards came from. Moving forward, the team should give him a few more touches each week. Granted, Montgomery may not be able to handle a full workload, but he is a greatly talented player. The more touches he gets, the better the offense will be.    Final Note: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was very strong in today's game. In addition to the 2 picks, he notched half of a sack on a blitz. He continues to develop into 1 of the better safeties in the league.

The Bears then took the lead thanks to Barkley, throwing some ropes down the field. He threw a quick pass to the flat to Josh Bellamy, who ran over Damarious Randall with a stiff arm to get into end zone from 10 yards out. Rodgers responded with a field-goal drive to tie the game at 10. Chicago tried a Hail Mary in the final seconds of the first half, but Micah Hyde picked off the deflection. On the first play of the third quarter, Julius Peppers burned Charles Leno Jr. for a blind-side strip-sack of Barkley. Peppers recovered the ball to set up the Packers inside the Bears' 20-yard line. Davante Adams had his second dropped touchdown of the game though, and Rodgers was tackled at the 1-yard line on third-and-goal to force a field goal. Green Bay's defense continued to get the job done, with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix picking off Barkley to set up the Packers near midfield. A chunk completion to Adams and then a 26-yard run by Montgomery moved the ball to the 1-yard line before Montgomery plunged into the end zone. Clinton-Dix quickly picked off Barkley again, as wideout "

Montgomery also got hurt, while Ripkowski was guilty of a second uncalled fumble, but coughed up the rock late when the game was out of hand. Dan Quinn, however, did the honorable thing and opted not to challenge.    Green Bay going on a great run to close out the year saved Mike McCarthy's job, so he won't be fired for this defeat. However, his poor coaching was on display in this contest. McCarthy failed to make any sort of appropriate adjustments, and his team simply didn't look prepared to play. Perhaps that was because several of their players were stricken with the flu this past week, but that doesn't excuse Green Bay's delay-of-game penalty on a kickoff. Let me repeat that. They had a delay of game on a kickoff. The only time I've ever seen that was in a Madden game.   "

It's mind-boggling that Green Bay would use Montgomery over Jones, especially when considering that the former is injured.    As for the Vikings, their chances of winning the NFC North have greatly increased in the wake of Rodgers' injury. Even better, it sounds like Teddy Bridgewater will have a chance to play next week.

   "comment":"Montgomery (4 carries, 6 yards), but that proved to be a predictable waste of time.    As for Hundley, his final stat line was atrocious, as he was 12-of-25 for 87 yards and late interception that he carelessly tossed into heavy coverage. Hundley did manage to scramble thrice for 44 yards and a touchdown. It's nice that he can be potent on the ground, but Hundley's passing skills are incredibly lackluster, and it takes him eons to process information in the pocket. Hundley was so much worse in the second half, going 5-of-10 for only 21 yards and a pick following intermission. He also was stripped, but the Packers managed to recover the fumble.    Thanks to Hundley's miserable passing, "
