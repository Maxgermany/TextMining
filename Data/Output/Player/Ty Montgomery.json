The Rams' ferocious defensive line hounded him, and it didn't help that guard Montgomery on the opening offensive drive - but was otherwise very mediocre. A big part of the problem was that Rodgers dealt with a ton of pressure. The Rams' ferocious defensive line hounded him, and it didn't help that guard T.J. Lang was carted into the locker room. This is the second straight week that Rodgers has been rushed heavily, so this has to be a concern for the team going forward.    Jones and Montgomery, who had the 2 scores, led the team in receiving yardage. The former caught 2 balls for 77 yards, while Montgomery snared 4 balls for 59 yards. If you want to own Montgomery, that's fine, but keep in mind that he was 4.h on the team in targets despite his output. He saw just 5 balls go his way, and if you take away the 31-yard score, his final numbers would've been 3 receptions for 28 yards. I'm not going to add him to my fantasy roster.    "

At the end of the game, Rodgers had Richard Rodgers open in the end zone twice, but overthrew him on both occasions. As a consequence, Rivers had a chance to tie at the very end, but came up just a bit short. Rodgers finished 16-of-29 for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those aren't bad numbers, by any means, but Rodgers simply didn't look right. His receiving corps and offensive line need to improve. The Packers have a bye week to get their act together.    Panic time for Eddie Lacy owners? Lacy was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 3 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Lacy had a 10.er ankle, which begs the question, why did he even play? Lacy looked slow and sluggish. He also fumbled, but was fortunate to have a teammate fall on the ball. James Starks, on the other hand, gained 112 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries, with most of his production coming on a 65-yard sprint to the end zone early on. Starks also caught a 5-yard touchdown on his only catch.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb is hurting. That was apparent, as he was able to catch just 2 balls for 38 yards. He also was guilty of a drop. James Jones had even fewer yards (2-30), but at least caught a touchdown. With Montgomery getting knocked out, Jeff Janis led the team with 79 receiving yards on 2 catches."

The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy.

He had a big burst on the opening play, where he slipped through the offensive line and followed his blockers for a big gain, but he was not used for a while afterward. The team insisted on giving Don Jackson carries. He only managed 8 yards on 4 attempts. Montgomery was able to rush for 53 yards on 7 carries and caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He caught a screen pass late where he ducked away from defenders, and that is where many of his receiving yards came from. Moving forward, the team should give him a few more touches each week. Granted, Montgomery may not be able to handle a full workload, but he is a greatly talented player. The more touches he gets, the better the offense will be.    Final Note: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was very strong in today's game. In addition to the 2 picks, he notched half of a sack on a blitz. He continues to develop into 1 of the better safeties in the league.

The Bears answered as Barkley moved the ball with some nice completions to set up Connor Barth for a short field goal. The Bears then took the lead thanks to Barkley, throwing some ropes down the field. He threw a quick pass to the flat to Josh Bellamy, who ran over Damarious Randall with a stiff arm to get into end zone from 10 yards out. Rodgers responded with a field-goal drive to tie the game at 10. Chicago tried a Hail Mary in the final seconds of the first half, but Micah Hyde picked off the deflection. On the first play of the third quarter, Julius Peppers burned Charles Leno Jr. for a blind-side strip-sack of Barkley. Peppers recovered the ball to set up the Packers inside the Bears' 20-yard line. Davante Adams had his second dropped touchdown of the game though, and Rodgers was tackled at the 1-yard line on third-and-goal to force a field goal. Green Bay's defense continued to get the job done, with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix picking off Barkley to set up the Packers near midfield. A chunk completion to Adams and then a 26-yard run by Montgomery moved the ball to the 1-yard line before Montgomery plunged into the end zone. Clinton-Dix quickly picked off Barkley again, as wideout "

Montgomery predictably struggled, mustering only 28 yards on 10 carries, and he also dropped a touchdown. Jones, meanwhile, tallied 41 yards on 13 attempts. Jones is clearly the better runner over Montgomery, who is a natural receiver. It's mind-boggling that Green Bay would use Montgomery over Jones, especially when considering that the former is injured.    As for the Vikings, their chances of winning the NFC North have greatly increased in the wake of Rodgers' injury. Even better, it sounds like Teddy Bridgewater will have a chance to play next week.

It's nice that he can be potent on the ground, but Hundley's passing skills are incredibly lackluster, and it takes him eons to process information in the pocket.
