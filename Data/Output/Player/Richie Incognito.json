That was it for the first half, but nothing changed after the break. The kickoff to start the second half was almost housed by Clyde Gates, really deflating any hopes of a turnaround by Oakland. A deep pass to rookie back Charles Clay resulted in a 20-yard penalty setting up a 1-yard plunge from Bush for a 20-0 lead. At this point, all Miami had to do was run the ball, while the Raiders were forced to pass. Still, nothing changed. The Radiers' next possession produced just a single first down, and when the Dolphins got the ball back, they delivered a soul crushing 91-yard journey down the field for a clinching touchdown. At 1 point, they ran 6 times in a row with 3 different players right up the middle and managed 20 yards, while keeping the chains moving. Richard Seymour was ejected for punching Incognito, and the drive concluded with Moore running 6 yards for the score. If that didn't end it, 2 plays later, "
