He was actually impressive early, as his second pass was a bomb down the sideline to Robby Anderson for a gain of 52. This was part of a 99-yard drive, capped off by a Jalin Marshall reception and a hook and lateral to Bilal Powell, who scampered into the end zone. The Jets went up 6-3 - the extra point was missed - and that was all they did during the afternoon. The Jets mustered just 197 total yards outside of that possession. Petty finished 19-of-32 for 163 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception late in the game on an inaccurate throw. Petty had that bomb to Anderson, but spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking. He looked like a poor-man's Ryan Fitzpatrick, which is just sad. Granted, he didn't have Nick Mangold blocking for him against the Rams' ferocious defensive front, but he appears to be just a backup at best in this league.    "

It seemed like this was going to be a blowout. And then, the second half happened. The 49ers suddenly couldn't sustain any drives, thanks to Colin Kaepernick's incompetence.
