The rest of the first half was pretty much the same, as the 49ers outgained the Jets by intermission, 279-118. They were averaging 9.3 yards per play compared to the Jets' 3.7. It seemed like this was going to be a blowout. And then, the second half happened. The 49ers suddenly couldn't sustain any drives, thanks to Colin Kaepernick's incompetence. Kaepernick had a solid first half, but was just 4-of-11 for 17 yards following intermission. The 49ers tallied just 85 net yards in the second half and overtime as a result. Bryce Petty, meanwhile, came through in the clutch. Petty looked completely incapable of throwing for first downs throughout the opening half, as he held on to the ball too long and took countless sacks, but he made some solid throws toward the end of the game.
