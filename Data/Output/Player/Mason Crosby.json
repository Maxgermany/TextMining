He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Crosby field goal. The Packers muffed the punt on the Titans' next drive, giving Mariota a short field. He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (2-8-1). The Packers scored quickly in response, as Rodgers used Adams to move the ball and set up a screen touchdown pass to James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "

Rodgers completed 19-of-31 passes for 252 yards, but he had a lot of dropped passes from Nelson and Adams that took points away from Green Bay's offense. Nelson led the Packers with 7 receptions for 124 yards. He had some bad drops on deep balls downfield, but redeemed himself in the clutch.    On the ground, wide receiver-turned-running back Montgomery had 16 carries for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Barkley was 30-of-43 for 362 yards with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He played much better than the numbers illustrate, as 1 pick was a Hail Mary and the other was the fault of Daniel Braverman.    Howard had 17 carries for 90 yards with a touchdown. "
