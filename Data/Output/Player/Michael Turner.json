   "comment":"Turner ran for 220 yards, as the Lions surrendered 8.7 yards per carry. Detroit's secondary also yielded a depressing 12.4 YPA to Matt Ryan. If William Clay Ford Darth Sidious doesn't fire Millen this week, he never will. Sorry, Lions fans. It looks like you're stuck with Millen until he retires on his own accord.    On that note, someone please shoot me with a tranquilizer the next time I pick the Lions as a favorite. I know it was for only 1 unit, and I said I wouldn't recommend betting on it, but still. What was I thinking?    I wouldn't vote Matt Ryan into the Hall of Fame just yet. Before Falcons fans get excited, remember that a blind, 1-legged old woman could dominate Detroit's secondary. Still, there's nothing to complain about. Ryan's first throw as a 62-yard bomb to Michael Jenkins. The Boston College product finished just 9-of-13 for 161 yards and a touchdown. Ryan didn't need to throw the ball, as Michael Turner broke the franchise rushing record. Turner totaled 220 yards on only 22 carries and 2 scores. In fact, Turner was on pace to break the NFL single-game mark of 296. Turner had 117 yards in the first quarter, putting him on pace for 468. Matt Millen? Genius.    Not much from "

Seriously, were Doug Pederson, Vinny Testaverde and Akili Smith unavailable?    The 1 bright spot for Kansas City's offense was Larry Johnson's 121-yard performance on 24 carries. Looks like he won't have to be taken out to pasture just yet.    Michael Turner had less yardage than Johnson (104) but he scored 3 touchdowns against Kansas City's Cottonelle defense. "

Forget all the penalties his team was responsible for; Turner had his team punt with 2 minutes remaining despite being down by 6. San Diego never got the ball back. Turner also foolishly punted the ball earlier in the second half in a fourth-and-1, down multiple scores. Fortunately for the inept coach, an Atlanta holding penalty gave his squad a first down.

   "comment":"Turner (27 carries for 122 yards) had a big run for 50 yards, leaving his average for the rest at 2.77. Running so much while moving the chains, allowed them to control the ball and the momentum. Meanwhile, Detroit could only convert 1-of-12 third-down attempts. It looked like the Lions would capitalize on home field advantage when Eric Wright intercepted Matt Ryan, setting them up at the Atlanta 15-yard line just minutes into the game. Immediately, John Abraham abused Jeff Backus and sacked Matthew Stafford. After that, linebacker Sean Weatherspoon blitzed and got his own sack. A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference. Two innocuous penalties on Detroit later, Ryan snuck in the ball for a 10-3 lead. It was an exchange they were never able to overcome. The rest of the game was pretty mundane, actually. The Lions immediately answered with a field goal drive, getting the aforementioned long run from Keiland Williams (18 yards) for the pivotal play. An exchange of punts later, with time running out in the first half, the Falcons had a drive getting all their playmakers involved with big plays. Gonzalez, who moved to second on the NFL's all-time receptions list, picked up a 30-yard gain. Turner had a 19-yard run, and Roddy White finished it off with an 18-yard touchdown catch."

After a false start on left tackle Will Svitek, starting for the injured Sam Baker, the drive was doomed. Offense was expected in this game, and the Saints went right to work getting the ball down the field. They were undone when tight end Jimmy Graham, a heavily targeted player all afternoon, dropped a pass on third down. John Kasay's 52-yard field goal tied the game. After Atlanta went 3-and-out, Graham (7 receptions for 82 yards, TD) again dropped what would have converted a third down as the second quarter began. The Falcons were poised to gain control of the game, and started the next drive with a 17-yard pass to Roddy White after a great play fake to Turner. Stalling in the red zone led to another field goal and a 6-3 lead. An exchange of punts left New Orleans in business at midfield. They took advantage hitting Graham for 29 yards, missing Sproles on a screen pass and then going back to Graham for the 21-yard score. I joked on Twitter that Graham's plan was to drop passes on third down to set up the defense. It sure looked that way considering how open he was. Another exchange of punts left the Falcons stuck at their own 1-yard line. At first, the Saints were trying to get the ball back, calling timeout after a quick screen was completed to Jones, who would not play down the stretch after his hamstring flared up. However, Turner rumbled 10 yards around the edge to flip the script and put them on the offensive. After a penalty, slot receiver "

He ran into the end zone on a fourth-and-goal to put Atlanta up 28-0. The Buccaneers got the ball back for less than a minute since Falcons linebacker Curtis Lofton intercepted Freeman (31-of-45, 274 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) on the drive's third play, returning the pick 26-yards for a touchdown. It was an ugly play where Tampa Bay running back Kregg Lumpkin got blasted by teammate, Kellen Winslow, leaving Lofton as the only player in position to catch the ball. On Atlanta's next possession, Turner capped the Falcons' collection of 42 unanswered points, with an 81-yard touchdown run. The Buccaneers finally got on the board with a short touchdown from Freeman to Briscoe on the next drive. At halftime Falcons were up 42-7, and Ryan had already been replaced by backup Chris Redmond.    Ryan was 6-of-9 for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns.

   "comment":"Turner was stuffed on 3rd-and-1 on the ensuing possession. The Falcons had to punt, and New York would find the end zone a few minutes later. The 2 New York scores put the game out of reach, but you have to wonder what would have happened if Atlanta opted for the field goals. With 2 successful kicks, the team would have trailed 10-8, and the players wouldn't have been sulking on the bench.    While you could argue that Mike Smith made the right decision in being aggressive and going for it, no 1 can defend his antics at the end of the first half. Following an odd New York possession that featured a terrible spot by the officials, the Falcons were doing a decent job of moving the chains. They advanced to their own 45, but after being tackled inbounds, Smith inexplicably refused to take a timeout. The Falcons ran out of time and had to attempt a Hail Mary, and they went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. Remember when I said that Atlanta could have been down 10-8 with 2 kicks? Well, if Smith used a timeout and his team was able to drive down to field-goal range, the Falcons could have led 11-10 at the end of the third quarter. It's amazing how significant inept coaching decisions can be in an NFL game.    Regardless of the bad coaching, Matt Ryan was simply awful. He went 24-of-41 for just 199 yards, now owning an 0-3 playoff record. He suffered through some Roddy White drops, but he was pretty inaccurate all afternoon. He also looked shaky in the pocket. Despite the drops, White still caught 5 balls for 52 yards. Julio Jones was better statistically (7-64). Poor Tony Gonzalez, who still hasn't won a playoff game in his Hall-of-Fame career, had just 4 grabs for 44 yards.    The FOX announcers and studio analysts were shocked that the Falcons couldn't run the ball, as Michael Turner mustered just 41 yards on 15 carries. This shouldn't have been a surprise, as Turner really wore down during the stretch, averaging 3.6 YPC or worse in all but 1 game beginning in Week 12. The Giants have also improved against the rush lately.    New York, meanwhile, ran the ball really well. "
