   "comment":"Michael Turner ran for 220 yards, as the Lions surrendered 8.7 yards per carry. Detroit's secondary also yielded a depressing 12.4 YPA to Matt Ryan. If William Clay Ford Darth Sidious doesn't fire Millen this week, he never will. Sorry, Lions fans. It looks like you're stuck with Millen until he retires on his own accord.    On that note, someone please shoot me with a tranquilizer the next time I pick the Lions as a favorite. I know it was for only 1 unit, and I said I wouldn't recommend betting on it, but still. What was I thinking?    I wouldn't vote Matt Ryan into the Hall of Fame just yet. Before Falcons fans get excited, remember that a blind, 1.legged old woman could dominate Detroit's secondary. Still, there's nothing to complain about. Ryan's first throw as a 62-yard bomb to Michael Jenkins. The Boston College product finished just 9-of-13 for 161 yards and a touchdown. Ryan didn't need to throw the ball, as Michael Turner broke the franchise rushing record. Turner totaled 220 yards on only 22 carries and 2 scores. In fact, Turner was on pace to break the NFL single-game mark of 296. Turner had 117 yards in the first quarter, putting him on pace for 468. Matt Millen? Genius.    Not much from "

LaDainian Tomlinson did nothing on the ground, gaining just 24 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries versus an Atlanta defense ranked 26th against the run going into this contest. It should be noted that Tomlinson had 5 catches for 42 receiving yards.    Philip Rivers was a pedestrian 17-of-30 for 149 yards, giving him an awful YPA of 4.97. His leading receiver was Malcolm Floyd, who had 5 catches for 59 yards. Chris Chambers caught 1 pass. Vincent Jackson had no receptions.

White kept up the heat on the Titans' defense with a 32-yard wide receiver screen that led to another Matt Bryant field goal. In the third quarter, Matt Hasselbeck left the game with a sprained right elbow. Rookie quarterback Jake Locker came in the game with his team down 23-3. He quickly got the Titans in the end zone. Locker threw a deep out to Nate Washington about 20 yards downfield on the sideline. He cut back to the middle of the field and ran by a couple defenders for a 40-yard touchdown pass. In the 4.h quarter, rookie linebacker Colin McCarthy forced a fumble from Turner when Tennessee was backed up deep in their own territory. That helped keep the Titans in the game. Locker made a big play downfield after scrambling to buy time. He tossed a ball deep for "

   "comment":"Michael Turner was stuffed on 3rd-and-1 on the ensuing possession. The Falcons had to punt, and New York would find the end zone a few minutes later. The 2 New York scores put the game out of reach, but you have to wonder what would have happened if Atlanta opted for the field goals. With 2 successful kicks, the team would have trailed 10-8, and the players wouldn't have been sulking on the bench.    While you could argue that Mike Smith made the right decision in being aggressive and going for it, no 1 can defend his antics at the end of the first half. Following an odd New York possession that featured a terrible spot by the officials, the Falcons were doing a decent job of moving the chains. They advanced to their own 45, but after being tackled inbounds, Smith inexplicably refused to take a timeout. The Falcons ran out of time and had to attempt a Hail Mary, and they went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. Remember when I said that Atlanta could have been down 10-8 with 2 kicks? Well, if Smith used a timeout and his team was able to drive down to field-goal range, the Falcons could have led 11-10 at the end of the third quarter. It's amazing how significant inept coaching decisions can be in an NFL game.    Regardless of the bad coaching, Matt Ryan was simply awful. He went 24-of-41 for just 199 yards, now owning an 0-3 playoff record. He suffered through some Roddy White drops, but he was pretty inaccurate all afternoon. He also looked shaky in the pocket. Despite the drops, White still caught 5 balls for 52 yards. Julio Jones was better statistically (7-64). Poor Tony Gonzalez, who still hasn't won a playoff game in his Hall-of-Fame career, had just 4 grabs for 44 yards.    The FOX announcers and studio analysts were shocked that the Falcons couldn't run the ball, as Michael Turner mustered just 41 yards on 15 carries. This shouldn't have been a surprise, as Turner really wore down during the stretch, averaging 3.6 YPC or worse in all but 1 game beginning in Week 12. The Giants have also improved against the rush lately.    New York, meanwhile, ran the ball really well. "
