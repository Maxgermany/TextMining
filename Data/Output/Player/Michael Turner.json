   "comment":"Michael Turner ran for 220 yards, as the Lions surrendered 8.7 yards per carry. Detroit's secondary also yielded a depressing 12.4 YPA to Matt Ryan. If William Clay Ford Darth Sidious doesn't fire Millen this week, he never will. Sorry, Lions fans. It looks like you're stuck with Millen until he retires on his own accord.    On that note, someone please shoot me with a tranquilizer the next time I pick the Lions as a favorite. I know it was for only 1 unit, and I said I wouldn't recommend betting on it, but still. What was I thinking?    I wouldn't vote Matt Ryan into the Hall of Fame just yet. Before Falcons fans get excited, remember that a blind, 1.legged old woman could dominate Detroit's secondary. Still, there's nothing to complain about. Ryan's first throw as a 62-yard bomb to Michael Jenkins. The Boston College product finished just 9-of-13 for 161 yards and a touchdown. Ryan didn't need to throw the ball, as Michael Turner broke the franchise rushing record. Turner totaled 220 yards on only 22 carries and 2 scores. In fact, Turner was on pace to break the NFL single-game mark of 296. Turner had 117 yards in the first quarter, putting him on pace for 468. Matt Millen? Genius.    Not much from "

In fact, Tyler Thigpen completed his first pass 1 minute into the second quarter. The pass was for minus-one yard. Thigpen began the game 1-of-11 for -1 yards and an interception. Seriously, were Doug Pederson, Vinny Testaverde and Akili Smith unavailable?    The 1 bright spot for Kansas City's offense was Larry Johnson's 121-yard performance on 24 carries. Looks like he won't have to be taken out to pasture just yet.    Michael Turner had less yardage than Johnson (104) but he scored 3 touchdowns against Kansas City's Cottonelle defense. "

Ryan later managed a 26-yard pass on second-and-25. Late in the game, he found Michael Jenkins 26 yards downfield to set up Jason Elam's 48-yard game-winning field goal. Ryan, who looks like a seasoned veteran, was 22-of-30 for 301 yards and a touchdown versus Chicago's defense, though it should be noted that Nathan Vasher was out and Charles Tillman left the game with an injury. Still, Ryan was able to perform well despite the fact that Michael Turner was limited to 54 yards on 25 carries. More importantly, Ryan has the Falcons at 4-2. The same Falcons who were picked by many to finish at the bottom of the NFC South.    We all know about Roddy White, who was once again a force, catching 9 balls for 112 yards and a touchdown. But rookie Harry Douglas is beginning to emerge as a solid secondary option for Ryan. Douglas compiled 5 receptions and 96 yards.    Though the Bears couldn't score against the Falcons, "

   "comment":"Michael Turner fumble.    While San Diego's defense completely sucked, the offense couldn't do anything either. The Chargers were just 3-of-12 on third downs. They committed 9 penalties to Atlanta's 3.    It's official: Norv Turner has absolutely no idea what he's doing. Forget all the penalties his team was responsible for; Turner had his team punt with 2 minutes remaining despite being down by 6. San Diego never got the ball back. Turner also foolishly punted the ball earlier in the second half in a 4.h-and-one, down multiple scores. Fortunately for the inept coach, an Atlanta holding penalty gave his squad a first down.    Turner's offense had just 201 net yards. LaDainian Tomlinson did nothing on the ground, gaining just 24 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries versus an Atlanta defense ranked 26th against the run going into this contest. It should be noted that Tomlinson had 5 catches for 42 receiving yards.    Philip Rivers was a pedestrian 17-of-30 for 149 yards, giving him an awful YPA of 4.97. His leading receiver was Malcolm Floyd, who had 5 catches for 59 yards. Chris Chambers caught 1 pass. Vincent Jackson had no receptions.    Meanwhile, Matt Ryan continued to amaze, finishing 17-of-23 for 207 yards and 2 touchdowns. Ryan went to Roddy White 6 times for 112 yards.    Playing against his old team, Michael Turner trampled the Chargers for 120 yards on 31 carries. Given the choice between Turner and Tomlinson, you'd be crazy not to select the former, whether in fantasy or reality.   "

Though he did intercept Ryan in the end zone, Nakamura would be relegated to special teams on a team that didn't have a crappy defense. That, or he could be told he has to save the world by stopping time.    "

Rodgers got the drive started with a 42-yard kick return and then added a 32-yard reception to move the ball deep into the Buccaneers' territory. Atlanta should've given the majority of Turner's carries to Rodgers (10-49 on the ground, 2-30 in the air), since he was giving Tampa Bay's defense problems. Ryan completed 26-of-32 passes for 353 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Freeman was 19-of-30 for 256 yards but left points on the field. "
