   "comment":"Michael Turner ran for 220 yards, as the Lions surrendered 8.7 yards per carry. Detroit's secondary also yielded a depressing 12.4 YPA to Matt Ryan. If William Clay Ford Darth Sidious doesn't fire Millen this week, he never will. Sorry, Lions fans. It looks like you're stuck with Millen until he retires on his own accord.    On that note, someone please shoot me with a tranquilizer the next time I pick the Lions as a favorite. I know it was for only 1 unit, and I said I wouldn't recommend betting on it, but still. What was I thinking?    I wouldn't vote Matt Ryan into the Hall of Fame just yet. Before Falcons fans get excited, remember that a blind, 1.legged old woman could dominate Detroit's secondary. Still, there's nothing to complain about. Ryan's first throw as a 62-yard bomb to Michael Jenkins. The Boston College product finished just 9-of-13 for 161 yards and a touchdown. Ryan didn't need to throw the ball, as Michael Turner broke the franchise rushing record. Turner totaled 220 yards on only 22 carries and 2 scores. In fact, Turner was on pace to break the NFL single-game mark of 296. Turner had 117 yards in the first quarter, putting him on pace for 468. Matt Millen? Genius.    Not much from "

Forget all the penalties his team was responsible for; Turner had his team punt with 2 minutes remaining despite being down by 6. San Diego never got the ball back. Turner also foolishly punted the ball earlier in the second half in a 4.h-and-one, down multiple scores. Fortunately for the inept coach, an Atlanta holding penalty gave his squad a first down.    Turner's offense had just 201 net yards. LaDainian Tomlinson did nothing on the ground, gaining just 24 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries versus an Atlanta defense ranked 26th against the run going into this contest. It should be noted that Tomlinson had 5 catches for 42 receiving yards.    Philip Rivers was a pedestrian 17-of-30 for 149 yards, giving him an awful YPA of 4.97. His leading receiver was Malcolm Floyd, who had 5 catches for 59 yards. Chris Chambers caught 1 pass. Vincent Jackson had no receptions.

He gashed Carolina's pathetic defense for 103 yards on only 13 carries, and he also had 68 receiving yards on 3 catches. The bulk of Turner's receiving yardage came on a 60-yard catch, thanks to an awful angle by safety Hiro Nakamura. Nakamura also had poor coverage on 1 of Atlanta's passing touchdowns. Though he did intercept Ryan in the end zone, Nakamura would be relegated to special teams on a team that didn't have a crappy defense. That, or he could be told he has to save the world by stopping time.    "
