The officials missed tons of penalties on Philadelphia, including some late hits, face masks and throat grabs. There was also a blown call on a Roethlisberger safety.    Though the Steelers managed only 3 sacks of their own, both quarterbacks had to leave the game with injuries. Roethlisberger's shoulder exploded on 1 of his 50,000 sacks, while McNabb hurt his chest on a first-quarter tackle. Neither signal caller threw for more than 200 yards, though McNabb completed his first 15 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Westbrook also had to leave the Broken Bone Bowl. He'll have an MRI on his ankle on Monday. Awful news for Philadelphia's offense. Westbrook couldn't really do anything versus Pittsburgh's stout front while he was in the game; he carried the ball 5 times for 12 yards.    Like Westbrook, "

Same dumb coach. Andy Reid once again ran the ball on every opportunity inside the red zone. Reid called 2 runs on second-and-one at the 2. and Westbrook failed to gain a single yard. Luckily, Westbrook lost a good amount of yardage on third down, forcing Reid to go for a field goal. If Westbrook was held to a minimal loss, Reid would have called yet another hopeless run, and the Eagles wouldn't have even scored 3 points.    Speaking of Eagles field goals, "

In order to get his son back, Delhomme had to throw the game against Arizona. Five interceptions and a fumble later, we all assumed Delhomme's kid would be returned safely. Not so fast! Turns out the kidnappers parlayed that contest with Carolina's Week 1 opponent! Delhomme went on to toss 4 interceptions and fumble once in this contest. Hopefully this was just a 2-team parlay. In all seriousness, Delhomme (7-of-17, 73 yards) is arguably the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. In his last 2 games, Delhomme has NINE picks and 2 fumbles. Nine freaking picks! I'd advise John Fox to start his backup, but the Panthers don't believe in drafting signal-callers, so their top backups are "
