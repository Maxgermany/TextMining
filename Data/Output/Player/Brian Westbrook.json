He'll have an MRI on his ankle on Monday. Awful news for Philadelphia's offense.

Same dumb coach. Andy Reid once again ran the ball on every opportunity inside the red zone. Reid called 2 runs on second-and-one at the 2. and Westbrook failed to gain a single yard. Luckily, Westbrook lost a good amount of yardage on third down, forcing Reid to go for a field goal. If Westbrook was held to a minimal loss, Reid would have called yet another hopeless run, and the Eagles wouldn't have even scored 3 points.    Speaking of Eagles field goals, "

   "comment":"Westbrook was stuffed twice on a goal-to-go situation in the 4.h quarter, I could have sworn that the Eagles and Giants switched jerseys. Philadelphia's short-yardage woes seemed to transfer over to New York; the team was stuffed twice on 4.h-and-one in the final quarter. Another reason the Eagles were able to win this contest by double digits was New York's inability to register a single sack on Donovan McNabb. It's really amazing. The Giants have zero sacks in 3 games against Philadelphia. In the other 14 contests this season, they accumulated 42 sacks.    Because he didn't take a sack, McNabb was able to put together a solid performance against a very tough Giants defense. McNabb was 22-of-40 for 217 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 rushing, 1 passing) and 2 picks. One of McNabb's interceptions was on a tipped ball, while the other came on a desperate throw on third-and-long, which basically ended up being a long punt. Perhaps McNabb's best play was rolling out of the pocket and hooking up for a 21-yard gain with Jason Avant on a third-and-20.    The Giants managed to bottle up Brian Westbrook (18 carries, 36 yards), but they had no answer for the Eagle wideouts. "

   "comment":"Westbrook: 64 rush yards) because the team barely had the ball.    Back in January, Jake Delhomme's son was kidnapped. In order to get his son back, Delhomme had to throw the game against Arizona. Five interceptions and a fumble later, we all assumed Delhomme's kid would be returned safely. Not so fast! Turns out the kidnappers parlayed that contest with Carolina's Week 1 opponent! Delhomme went on to toss 4 interceptions and fumble once in this contest. Hopefully this was just a 2-team parlay. In all seriousness, Delhomme (7-of-17, 73 yards) is arguably the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. In his last 2 games, Delhomme has NINE picks and 2 fumbles. Nine freaking picks! I'd advise John Fox to start his backup, but the Panthers don't believe in drafting signal-callers, so their top backups are "

The Eagles as a whole were unfocused. The defense's tackling was pathetic. McNabb, meanwhile, tried to pull a Chris Webber by signaling for a timeout in the first half when he didn't have any in reserve. It was clear that the Eagles showed up to Oakland to just see the sights and play a football game in the hours in between. 4. The Raiders actually showed some signs of life for the first time since Week 2, so they must be given credit. No, scratch that. The Raiders deserve no accolades because for 4 weeks, they didn't put forth any effort.    As noted, Westbrook's carries were limited, but he still had a great game, catching 9 balls for 91 receiving yards. At least Reid was smart enough to involve Westbrook in the passing attack.    "
