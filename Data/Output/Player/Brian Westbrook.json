   "comment":"Brian Westbrook face mask penalties in the Cowboys game (though they had a right to do so before this contest). The officials missed tons of penalties on Philadelphia, including some late hits, face masks and throat grabs. There was also a blown call on a Roethlisberger safety.    Though the Steelers managed only 3 sacks of their own, both quarterbacks had to leave the game with injuries. Roethlisberger's shoulder exploded on 1 of his 50,000 sacks, while McNabb hurt his chest on a first-quarter tackle. Neither signal caller threw for more than 200 yards, though McNabb completed his first 15 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Westbrook also had to leave the Broken Bone Bowl. He'll have an MRI on his ankle on Monday. Awful news for Philadelphia's offense. Westbrook couldn't really do anything versus Pittsburgh's stout front while he was in the game; he carried the ball 5 times for 12 yards.

Same dumb coach. Andy Reid once again ran the ball on every opportunity inside the red zone. Reid called 2 runs on second-and-one at the 2. and Westbrook failed to gain a single yard. Luckily, Westbrook lost a good amount of yardage on third down, forcing Reid to go for a field goal. If Westbrook was held to a minimal loss, Reid would have called yet another hopeless run, and the Eagles wouldn't have even scored 3 points.    Speaking of Eagles field goals, "

Another reason the Eagles were able to win this contest by double digits was New York's inability to register a single sack on Donovan McNabb. It's really amazing. The Giants have zero sacks in 3 games against Philadelphia. In the other 14 contests this season, they accumulated 42 sacks.    Because he didn't take a sack, McNabb was able to put together a solid performance against a very tough Giants defense. McNabb was 22-of-40 for 217 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 rushing, 1 passing) and 2 picks. One of McNabb's interceptions was on a tipped ball, while the other came on a desperate throw on third-and-long, which basically ended up being a long punt. Perhaps McNabb's best play was rolling out of the pocket and hooking up for a 21-yard gain with Jason Avant on a third-and-20.
