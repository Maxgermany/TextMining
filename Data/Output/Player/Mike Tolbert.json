   "comment":"Tolbert coughing it up in the red zone). They screw up on special teams (Leon Washington scored twice on kickoffs with 101- and 99-yard returns). And their final drive in an attempt to either tie the contest or take the lead ends up badly.    In a losing effort, Philip Rivers set the single-game passing record for the Chargers, as he went 29-of-53 for 455 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Rivers' scores went to Antonio Gates (7 catches, 109 yards) and Malcom Floyd (6-97).    Aside from the aforementioned fumble, Mike Tolbert ran the ball well at Seattle. He totaled 73 yards on 17 carries. The Chargers just couldn't keep the ball on the ground as much as they wanted to because they were trailing throughout.    "

To start the third quarter, Glennon threw a deep ball up for grabs and it was picked off my Mike Mitchell. Newton hit Olsen (5-85) on the run for 28 yards and dropped in a beautiful 36-yard touchdown to Ted Ginn (2-47), who burned Revis for the score. After Tampa Bay missed a field goal, Revis dropped an interception and injured his chest/shoulder on the play. He left the game and went into the locker room. The Panthers moved the ball into Bucs territory before Newton made a terrible throw off his back foot for an interception to Lavonte David.    Newton finished 18-of-29 for 263 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He rushed for 68 yards and a score. Jonathan Stewart ran for 39 yards on 14 carries.

I have to mention something annoying that Panthers' head coach Commander Adama did during this contest.

Adama wasted no time in throwing the challenge flag. I don't know why he would waste everyone's time by asking for a review of such an insignificant, 4-yard play. There weren't even any Cylons involved, so it's not like Adama had an alternative reason for challenging.   "

   "comment":"Tolbert and Fozzy Whittaker. The latter was a bit fluky in terms of Newton's stat line, as Whittaker caught a short pass and went 39 yards into the end zone because of some of the worst tackling you'll ever see.    The Panthers were able to pick up some big runs in this game, as Arizona's defense had tackling issues throughout the evening. I mentioned Newton's scrambles - he had 35 yards on 7 attempts - but Jonathan Stewart picked up most of the yardage on the ground. He gained 123 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Tolbert vultured a score away in the second half, but those who used Stewart in daily formats weren't disappointed, as the big back has been tremendous since the team's Week 12 bye. The Cardinals will need to spend some early-round picks on defensive players, including a pass-rusher and a cornerback if Cromartie leaves via free agency.    Other Carolina stats: "

   "comment":"Tolbert pounded the ball into the end zone from there to give the Panthers a quick lead. Philadelphia promptly set up another score as Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving "

What is a huge deal is that Newton has now failed to complete half of his passes in 3 consecutive games. It's impossible to completely blame Newton though, as Carolina's offensive line is a mess, with Ryan Kalil and Michael Oher both out. Still, Newton is not performing on a high level right now, and it's definitely fair to ask if his head is in the game in the wake of this wardrobe nonsense.
