   "comment":"Mike Tolbert coughing it up in the red zone). They screw up on special teams (Leon Washington scored twice on kickoffs with 101- and 99-yard returns). And their final drive in an attempt to either tie the contest or take the lead ends up badly.    In a losing effort, Philip Rivers set the single-game passing record for the Chargers, as he went 29-of-53 for 455 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Rivers' scores went to Antonio Gates (7 catches, 109 yards) and Malcom Floyd (6-97).    Aside from the aforementioned fumble, Mike Tolbert ran the ball well at Seattle. He totaled 73 yards on 17 carries. The Chargers just couldn't keep the ball on the ground as much as they wanted to because they were trailing throughout.    "

Tolbert also fumbled at the goal line, which has to make you wonder why Norv Turner won't give the ball to the guy he moved all the way up to No. 12 for in the 2010 NFL Draft.    Having said all that, congratulations must be given to the Oakland Raiders, who beat the San Diego Chargers for the first time in 14 tries. The last time Oakland beat San Diego was 2003... ...And the Raiders didn't even do it with their Polish Point-Shaver! "

A screen to Greg Olsen went for 30 yards inside the 10, and Newton dived over the top on 4.h-and-goal. To start the third quarter, Glennon threw a deep ball up for grabs and it was picked off my Mike Mitchell. Newton hit Olsen (5-85) on the run for 28 yards and dropped in a beautiful 36-yard touchdown to Ted Ginn (2-47), who burned Revis for the score. After Tampa Bay missed a field goal, Revis dropped an interception and injured his chest/shoulder on the play. He left the game and went into the locker room. The Panthers moved the ball into Bucs territory before Newton made a terrible throw off his back foot for an interception to Lavonte David.    Newton finished 18-of-29 for 263 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He rushed for 68 yards and a score. Jonathan Stewart ran for 39 yards on 14 carries. Mike Tolbert was Carolina's leading back as he gained 48 yards on 9 carries with 3 receptions for 41 yards.    Glennon was 14-of-21 for 180 yards with a fumble and an interception. "

   "comment":"Mike Tolbert was used in short-yardage situations, but he constantly failed to convert.    I have to mention something annoying that Panthers' head coach Commander Adama did during this contest. The Buccaneers completed a 4-yard pass in the third quarter that looked a bit shaky (it was 1 of the times when McCown threw a pass while going down). Adama wasted no time in throwing the challenge flag. I don't know why he would waste everyone's time by asking for a review of such an insignificant, 4-yard play. There weren't even any Cylons involved, so it's not like Adama had an alternative reason for challenging.   "

Still, Newton is not performing on a high level right now, and it's definitely fair to ask if his head is in the game in the wake of this wardrobe nonsense. Newton finished 14-of-32 for only 182 yards and a touchdown. A big chunk of his yardage came on a 55-yard bomb to "
