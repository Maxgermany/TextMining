Adama wasted no time in throwing the challenge flag. I don't know why he would waste everyone's time by asking for a review of such an insignificant, 4-yard play. There weren't even any Cylons involved, so it's not like Adama had an alternative reason for challenging.   "

The latter was a bit fluky in terms of Newton's stat line, as Whittaker caught a short pass and went 39 yards into the end zone because of some of the worst tackling you'll ever see.    The Panthers were able to pick up some big runs in this game, as Arizona's defense had tackling issues throughout the evening. I mentioned Newton's scrambles - he had 35 yards on 7 attempts - but Jonathan Stewart picked up most of the yardage on the ground. He gained 123 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Tolbert vultured a score away in the second half, but those who used Stewart in daily formats weren't disappointed, as the big back has been tremendous since the team's Week 12 bye. The Cardinals will need to spend some early-round picks on defensive players, including a pass-rusher and a cornerback if Cromartie leaves via free agency.    Other Carolina stats: "
