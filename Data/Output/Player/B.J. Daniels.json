   "comment":"Daniels seeing action against Tennessee. The Texans hope that Brian Hoyer will return to the field in Week 17.    On the first drive of the game, Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on Coty Sensabaugh to move the ball down the field. To end the drive, he went over Sensabaugh for a 15-yard touchdown. Texans safety Eddie Pleasant soon ripped the ball from Antonio Andrews for an interception at Tennessee's 34-yard line. A few plays later, Weeden threw a well-placed pass to Nate Washington for a 16-yard touchdown. A field goal drive expanded the Texans lead to 34. In the 4.h quarter, on a third-and-goal, J.J. Watt strip-sacked Zach Mettenberger and Houston recovered.    Hopkins caught 7 passes for 117 yards and a score. What he's done this year with Houston's 4 different starting quarterbacks is truly remarkable.    Weeden was 15-of-24 for 200 yards with 2 touchdowns and a running score. Daniels was used as a read-option quarterback with 6 carries for 6 yards and 1 completion for 7 yards on 2 pass attempts.    "
