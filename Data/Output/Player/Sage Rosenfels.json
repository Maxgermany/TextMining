Rosenchoker (I will refer to him as Rosenchoker until further notice), replacing Matt Schaub who went to the hospital with a stomach virus, played extremely well and error-free for the first 56 minutes of this game. Unfortunately for my sanity, Rosenchoker committed 3 turnovers in the final 4 minutes. One was a fumble which was returned for a touchdown by "

  "comment":"Sage Rosenfels (a.k.a. Sage Rosenchoker) would commit numerous errors against the Colts. But would it be enough to cost Houston an all-important cover? Thankfully, no. Rosenchoker predictably tossed a pick, down 33-27 late in the 4.h quarter. Luckily, the Colts didn't return the ball for a touchdown this time. Amusingly, the man who came up with the interception was Bob Sanders' replacement, ",
