   "comment":"Brown's fumble. The former Eagle was about to run into the end zone, when the ball was slapped out of his hands. It dribbled forward, and Scott Chandler looked like he was going to pick it up, but it took a weird bounce out of the back of the end zone for a touchback. The Chiefs were then able to take the lead with an Alex Smith touchdown run because Leodis McKelvin muffed a punt. The Bills were still in position to win the game despite those 2 errors, but Chandler was flagged for offensive pass interference, which negated a key third-down conversion. The crowd let the officials have it for what they thought was an awful call - there were several shady penalties, including an early ticky-tack roughness on Smith that gave the Chiefs a field goal - but it ultimately allowed Kansas City to prevail. Kyle Orton, meanwhile, was also responsible for leaving some points off the board. He was very inaccurate in crucial moments, missing multiple touchdowns to open players. He had Chandler and Robert Woods available for scores at various points of the game, but he just completely whiffed on his throws. Orton finished 29-of-48 for 259 yards and a touchdown to Chris Hogan. He had some issues with the Kansas City pass rush, and it was evident at times that he was concerned with his protection. Orton was brought down only once, but that's not even close to being indicative of the amount of pressure he was under.    Both Sammy Watkins and Fred Jackson were game-time decisions, but both played. Neither did much, however. Watkins saw 10 targets come his way, but snared only 4 of them for just 27 yards. He didn't look completely healthy and probably should have rested. Jackson, meanwhile, didn't get much of a workload, carrying the ball just 3 time for 10 yards. He was a bigger contributor in the passing game, hauling in 4 balls for 39 receiving yards.    Brown and Anthony Dixon shouldered most of the carries."
