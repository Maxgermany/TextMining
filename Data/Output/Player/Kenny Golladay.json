   "comment":"Golladay drops. The Cardinals, on the other hand, continued to kill themselves. J.J. Nelson dropped a deep touchdown, then a score to Jermaine Gresham was wiped out by a hold. David Johsnon then lost a fumble and got hurt in the process. And if that wasn't enough, Palmer was pick-sixed to end Arizona's chances.    This was an ugly loss for the Cardinals, but the silver lining is that the X-rays on David Johnson's wrist came back negative. Johnson struggled as a runner, gaining 23 yards on 11 carries, though he did catch 6 passes for 68 receiving yards. His fantasy owners missed out on a touchdown because Kerwynn Williams (5-10) vultured 1 after Johnson left the game. However, they have to be thankful that Johnson might be able to play next week.    As for Palmer, his final numbers were 27-of-48 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He could've been picked on a couple more occasions, so this was an ugly start to his 2017 campaign, especially considering the sort of defense he was playing. The Lions are projected to have 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL, so if Palmer struggled against them, what's going to happen against tougher defenses?    Larry Fitzgerald saw 13 targets, but could reel in only 6 of them for 74 yards. Nelson (5-43) scored a garbage-time touchdown. John Brown trailed only Fitzgerald in targets (9), but could only convert 4 of them for 32 yards.    Adding injury to insult and injury for the Cardinals, they lost tackle D.J. Humphries, who was carted into the locker room in the early going. This was a huge loss, as Arizona struggled to block without him. His replacement, John Wetzel, looked like he didn't belong in the NFL.    While the Cardinals can't feel optimistic about their offense, Haason Reddick at least looked great. He made numerous great plays, and he always seemed to be in the correct place at the right time. Fellow rookie linebacker Jarrad Davis did well overall for Detroit, but was guilty of a couple of dumb penalties.    Stafford deserves a ton of credit for keeping the Lions in the game. He rebounded from the early pick-6 and some drops to finish the afternoon on a torrid pace. His final numbers were 29-of-41 for 292 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but in the second half, he was 12-of-16 for 180 yards and 3 scores. It's nice that he was able to pick up where he left off last year prior to injuring his finger.    Reports said before the game that Patrick Peterson would cover Golden Tate, but Tate was still able to catch 10 passes for 107 yards. Marvin Jones, who actually saw Peterson's coverage, managed just 2 receptions for 37 yards, but he was able to score to salvage his fantasy day. However, the story of the game was Golladay, who was the third receiver on most snaps. He made some errors early by dropping the ball on a couple of instances. However, he had a terrific fourth quarter. He scored twice, with 1 touchdown being an incredible, diving catch. Golladay hauled in 4 balls for 69 yards and 2 touchdowns. He's very talented, and he's worth picking up in fantasy leagues if he's available.    The Lions didn't have much luck running the ball, as "

   "comment":"Golladay on the same drive. Stafford tore up the Bears after that, taking advantage of a Chicago squad missing the heart, soul and brains of its defense in Danny Trevathan. The Bears did well against Stafford in the opening quarter, but he was unstoppable after that. Stafford finished 21-of-31 for 299 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had a great drive in the fourth quarter to move the team into Matt Prater field-goal range, with the key play being a 26-yard completion to Eric Ebron, who needed to do something like that to make up for all of the mistakes he's made over the years. That includes earlier in this contest, as Stafford spent some time yelling at Ebron on the sidelines following a miscommunication in the opening half.    Ebron's 26-yard completion gave him a respectable stat line of 4-49. He was fourth on the receiving list, trailing Marvin Jones (4-85), who scored a touchdown, T.J. Jones (4-55) and Golladay (2-52).
