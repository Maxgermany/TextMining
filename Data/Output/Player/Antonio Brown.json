   "comment":"Antonio Brown scored on a punt return touchdown just prior to halftime, thanks in part to a missed block-in-the-back penalty.    It was a different story in the second half though. The Bengals mustered just 63 total yards after the break and were able to convert only 2-of-11 third downs overall. Dalton (11-of-24, 135 yards, TD) was knocked out of the game in the 4.h quarter because of a hip injury he incurred after a sack. It didn't appear to be serious; Marvin Lewis may have held him out because his team was trailing by 4 touchdowns.    Dalton struggled, but at least A.J. Green had a solid fantasy outing. The dynamic rookie wideout had more than half of Dalton's yardage, as he hauled in 6 grabs for 87 yards and a touchdown.    There was some concern about Ben Roethlisberger's fractured thumb entering this contest, but it didn't appear to be a factor, as he went 15-of-23 for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns, both to Mike Wallace (3-38). Antonio Brown (2-67) paced the Steeler receivers in yardage, thanks to a 45-yard reception in the first half.    "

More officiating ineptness: The refs called for the 2.minute warning prior to an extra-point attempt following a Denver touchdown. The point-after try should have occurred first. An even worse error occurred when Mike Tomlin was allowed to challenge after the Broncos ran a play. Tomlin threw the red flag just as the Broncos snapped the ball. It ultimately screwed the Steelers over because they lost the challenge and Denver would end up finding the end zone anyway.   "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown committed illegal procedure penalties. The defense, perhaps feeling the frustration of being shorthanded, were flagged for dual personal foul penalties during 1 of Philadelphia's 2 touchdown drives. One of the penalties would have almost certainly forced a punt because the Eagles would have been stuck with a third-and-long. Philadelphia's other scoring drive was amusing. The Eagles had a 4th-and-1 deep in their own territory at the beginning of the final quarter. Andy Reid inexplicably sent his players out to go for it. He then decided to challenge the prior play. As always when coaches attempt to review a spot, Reid was denied, costing him a precious timeout. Reid still decided to go for it, despite the pleas of Troy Aikman, and barely converted. Later on the drive, Reid asked for yet another useless timeout and went for it again on a 4th-and-1. Philadelphia somehow scored a touchdown out of this, but in typical Reid fashion, the team didn't have any stoppages at the end of the game to prevent the Steelers from running the clock out and kicking the decisive field goal.    Ben Roethlisberger won this matchup on his own. He went 21-of-37 for 207 yards, but was masterful on third downs. Big Ben should have had a touchdown added to his stats, but Antonio Brown dropped a ball in the end zone. Brown did catch 7 passes for 86 yards.    No other Steeler wideout did very much. "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, who dropped the ball. Roethlisberger was unfazed by this, finishing 23-of-30 for 264 yards and a score. He took just 2 more sacks the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Roethlisberger's counterpart came into this contest with some momentum, but there were reports Sunday morning that the Jets had some concerns that he wasn't handling the accolades very well. Sure enough, Smith struggled and New York as a whole was completely out of sorts. Smith went 19-of-34 for 201 yards and 2 interceptions. He wasn't bad early on, but struggled immensely following the break (11-of-22, 140 yards, 2 INTs). He completed just 1 pass longer than 20 yards. One of his picks was brutal, as it was heaved carelessly into triple coverage. All of this shouldn't have been a surprise, by the way, as the Jets' concerns about Smith's arrogance were highly warranted. Also, it must be noted that only 2 rookie quarterbacks have beaten Dick LeBeau. The legendary defensive coordinator doesn't have the same type of talent he used to, but he can still confuse the hell out of raw signal-callers.    Both teams struggled to run the ball. Le'Veon Bell had the opportunities (16 carries) but simply couldn't find any holes behind a poor offensive line and against a stout Jet front, as he was able to muster only 34 yards, though he did chip in with 3 catches for 22 receiving yards. Bilal Powell, meanwhile, turned 9 attempts into 30 yards. He also had 3 snags for 20 yards. New York trailed for most of the way, so the coaching staff had to ask Smith to air the ball out 34 times.    The only touchdown in this contest came on a 55-yard Roethlisberger pass to Emmanuel Sanders (3-70). Meanwhile, just 2 Steelers had more than 3 receptions. Antonio Brown (9-86) had the most yardage, but as mentioned, he screwed himself out of a touchdown reception. Miller (6-84) looked good, and Big Ben has to be thrilled that his favorite security blanket is back.    "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown (9-82) dropped a deep pass on a third-and-15 in the 4.h quarter that would've moved the chains. This forced Pittsburgh to punt, allowing the Raiders to bleed more time off the clock.    The Steelers also struggled to run the ball. This isn't totally surprising because the Raiders have a surprisingly good run defense, but I thought Bell would have more success than gaining just 24 yards on 13 carries. Luckily for his fantasy owners, he was able to find the end zone.    The Raiders, meanwhile, ran all over Pittsburgh until late in the game when Dick LeBeau's defense stacked the box. "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, returning a punt, jumped in the air and karate kicked Cleveland's punter in the head on what turned out to be a big gain that set up an eventual touchdown. The score put the Steelers up 27-3 in a game that was completely dominated by Pittsburgh. The Browns, who look like the worst team in the NFL, were absolutely humiliated. </i> I guess the Steelers simulated to their Thursday night game because Cleveland were just as dominant in the second half as Pittsburgh was in the first. The Steelers were completely gassed defensively, as they had no answer for Brian Hoyer. The Cleveland quarterback couldn't do anything to open the game. He was 4-of-11 for 57 yards by the break, and I wondered if Mike Pettine would bench him in favor of Johnny Manziel. However, Hoyer was 15-of-20 for 173 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 19-of-31 for 230 yards and a touchdown. Hoyer did have a dropped interception by Ike Taylor, but the Steelers otherwise were helpless to stop him, as he constantly moved the chains. There were some exceptions - rookie linebacker Ryan Shazier had a great afternoon - but it's a very dubious sign that most of the Pittsburgh defenders were so exhausted by the end of the game. It's not a good sign going forward, especially with a game coming up on Thursday.    You might be wondering whom Hoyer threw to, considering that his receiving corps is so depleted. Jordan Cameron, the only prominent name, caught only 2 balls for 47 yards, though he would've scored a touchdown in the first half if he didn't stumble over his own 2 feet. Cameron left the game in the third quarter because he aggravated his AC joint. Andrew Hawkins actually dominated the targets and receptions. He saw 10 balls thrown his way, and he snagged 8 of them for 87 yards. No other Brown recorded more than 2 catches.    While Hawkins is worth an add, the No. 1 player who should be picked up in Week 1 is rookie running back Terrance West. Ben Tate was running well early - 6 carries, 41 yards - but he hurt his knee and left the game. Shocker. West took over and was dominant, tallying 100 yards on just 16 carries. He has lots of talent, so he needs to be added in all formats.    Ben Roethlisberger had a great stat line - 23-of-34, 365 yards, touchdown and an interception - but those numbers are slightly misleading because some of Roethlisberger's big, first-half gains came on screens. For instance, an Antonio Brown 41-yarder on the opening drive came on a slip screen. Roethlisberger also struggled in the second half, going just 7-of-12 for 87 yards following intermission. Having said that, Roethlisberger made several great plays to lead his team to victory, which was capped off by a game-winning drive at the very end when Cleveland had all of the momentum. What stood out most was when he escaped out of 2 potential sacks and found Brown in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. It should be noted that part of the reason Roethlisberger struggled after the break was because the offensive line couldn't block Cleveland at all.    Brown paced the Steelers in receiving yardage with 116 on 5 catches. "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown conversion on third-and-14. Unfortunately, Brown took a big hit on that play, and he had to leave the field temporarily to get tested for a concussion. While gone, backup wideout Justin Brown lost a fumble in the red zone. Pittsburgh's offense and defense took turns screwing up. The Ravens were able to score on the ensuing drive, thanks to a Cortez Allen pass interference on Torrey Smith inside the 5-yard line. Darrius Heyward-Bey - yes, he's still in the league - then held on a big gain on an end-round by Markus Wheaton. Roethlisberger followed that up by throwing way behind Justin Brown on a third down, which would've been a big play because Brown was wide open. The Steelers had multiple chances to get back into the game in the second half, but committed way too many personal foul penalties. One was bogus, but the infractions allowed the Ravens to register touchdowns, allowing them to put this contest away. The scores were to Owen Daniels, who was wide open on both occasions, thanks to blown coverages. You'd think Pittsburgh would've learned the second time, but its defense is so anemic that it can't really do anything correctly. The nail in the coffin was a Heath Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated. Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with Bernard Pierce and Justin Forsett in the first half, but Pierce ended up with way more carries. Pierce gained 96 yards on 22 attempts, while Forsett managed 56 yards on just 8 tries. Most of Forsett's yardage came on 1 41-yard burst when the game was out of hand. Forsett appeared to land in the end zone, but was ruled inches short. John Harbaugh considered challenging, but opted against it. Forsett was a bigger factor in the passing game - 4 catches, 16 receiving yards - but it was disappointing to see Pierce utilized much more. It should be noted that Pierce (1 catch, 7 rec. yards) also dropped a pass.    As for the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 22-of-37 for 217 yards and a garbage-time interception off a tip by Haloti Ngata. The Ravens were able to put considerable pressure on him, which was a bit of a surprise because Andy Dalton was hit only once last week. It's not nearly all Roethlisberger's fault, but the Steelers have just 9 points in their previous 6 quarters. That's just awful. Roethlisberger targeted Antonio Brown more than anyone despite the fact that the speedy wideout missed about a quarter of action. Brown hauled in 7 balls for 90 yards. Wheaton (5-38) and Miller (4-35) also contributed.    The only Steeler offensive player who played a great full game was "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown downfield. He hit his hand on a helmet on the throw, and he just wasn't the same after that. It was evident when he had to give the ball to Le'Veon Bell with his opposite hand. Roethlisberger's passes weren't even close. He overthrew Bell. He was almost pick-sixed by Patrick Robinson. He flung an interception on a deep shot toward the end zone. He was nearly picked on another high attempt. In the second half, he missed an open Heath Miller for a touchdown and then made a terrible decision to throw late across his body for another near-interception, and he was picked off on a second occasion when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on Drew Brees that allowed the Saints to keep a drive alive. Give the Saints credit for taking advantage of the Steelers' injuries and errors. They didn't have a promising start though, as Marques Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson. Despite all of that, New Orleans snapped out of its funk, and Brees was able to torch Pittsburgh's sorry secondary by going 19-of-27 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns.    All of Brees' touchdowns went to different players, with Stills (5-162) leading the team in receiving. Stills' score was a 69-yarder in which he beat Ike Taylor, who was making his return from injury, with a double move. Marques Colston (3-16), Nick Toon, Ben Watson and Erik Lorig all found the end zone, with the former atoning for 2 drops. Jimmy Graham inexplicably didn't draw a single target. He didn't get hurt; the Steelers just made sure he wouldn't beat them, double- and triple-teaming him on every single play.    The Steelers couldn't stop the run at all. Mark Ingram made up for a couple of poor outings by gashing Pittsburgh for 122 yards on 23 carries.    Some random notes for the Steelers: - Le'Veon Bell was outgained on the ground by Ingram - 21 carries, 95 rushing yards, 1 touchdown - but he atoned for it by catching 8 balls for a whopping 159 receiving yards. With Roethlisberger limited, he had no choice but to dump the ball off to Bell. - Antonio Brown scored twice, though both touchdowns came in garbage time. He finished with 8 receptions for 97 yards. - Heath Miler drew 14 targets. He snatched 8 of them for 82 yards. - Brett Kiesel is believed to have torn his tricep in this loss. He's done for the season if his Monday MRI confirms it.   "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown managed to jump on the ball and keep the possession alive. Harris (9-25) saw most of the workload after that, but save for 1 8.yard burst, he didn't do much with his opportunities.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, had a mixed outing. He finished 31-of-45 for 334 yards and a touchdown, but also threw 2 interceptions. He was under pressure more than he's used to, and he made some nice plays, including 1 in which he muscled out of sack and found Heath Miller (6-76) for a big gain on third-and-10. However, Roethlisberger was brought down 5 times, and 1 Baltimore defender was able to hit him as he was releasing the ball, which resulted in a tipped pick by Suggs, who somehow caught the ball in between his legs. On the very next Pittsburgh drive, Suggs forced a hold that nullified a Roethlisberger touchdown to Dri Archer. Roethlisberger appeared to be concussed late in the 4.h quarter when he took a big hit, and he had to miss a few plays. Mike Tomlin put him back in, which I thought was a big mistake. Roethlisberger naturally threw an interception on the first play. Miller, meanwhile, also got knocked out with a head injury. Like Roethlisberger, he reentered the game and made an error, losing a fumble. The game was pretty much decided at that point, but Tomlin shouldn't have risked the longevity of 2 of his key players, especially considering the game was in doubt.    Antonio Brown was his usual dominant self, catching 9 of 14 targets for 117 yards. He picked up an early first down with a great spin move on Lardarius Webb. He also appeared to score a 45-yard touchdown, but the replay review showed that he was down inches short of the goal line. That wasn't the first time Brown just missed out on a score; he hauled in a Roethlisberger pass in the second quarter, but was pushed out and could get only 1 foot inbounds. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Roethlisberger completed 77.8 percent of his passes and averaged 13.7 yards per attempt while taking no sacks. It was a masterful display helped out by the 49ers' defensive line's ineptitude at putting much pressure on him.    Roethlisberger's No. 1 target was, surprise, surprise, Antonio Brown. He caught big passes all day long and piled up 9 receptions on 11 targets for 195 yards and a touchdown. This of course, is nothing new, but 195 yards is nothing to sneeze at. It was Brown's second-best career total; his first was 196 yards against Chicago in 2013. Brown now hasn't caught fewer than 5 receptions in a game since 2012.    The 49ers took too long to get their offense moving, but they did put up plenty of yardage when trying to make up the 27-point deficit. Kaepernick was the biggest beneficiary as he threw the ball 46 times, completing 33 for 335 yards and 2 touchdowns, while leading the team in rushing with 8 carries for 51 yards. He also had 1 touchdown run overturned by review.    Kaepernick's 71.7 completion percentage on 46 pass attempts makes for a nice stat and also shows you just how bad the Steelers' pass defense is. His completions were pretty spread out with "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.    After that initial drive, this game was a defensive struggle, with interceptions and field goals dominating until the 4.h quarter. Andy Dalton had his worst game of the season, completing 23-of-38 passes (60.5 percent) for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.    The only real connection Dalton was on target with all game was A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, DeAngelo Williams took over and had some nice numbers, rushing 9 times for 71 yards, including a 55-yard run that Panthers fans would recognize. He also caught 4 passes for 39 yards. If Bell is out for a while, Williams should be a capable backup, especially with the Steelers' usually good passing game.    The leading target for the Steelers this week wasn't Antonio Brown, but tight end Heath Miller, who had zero receptions last week for the first time since 2007."

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, Heath Miller and Markus Wheaton, while feeding DeAngelo Williams, ending in a 1-yard Williams touchdown run.    That 7-0 lead expanded to 13-0 after 2 Boswell field goals, but McCarron fired back by hitting A.J. Green for a 66-yard touchdown pass to bring it to 13-7 Steelers. McCarron went on to finish the game with a decent 280 yards passing for 2 touchdowns, but 2 interceptions as well.    One of McCarron's interceptions came in the third quarter with the score 16-7. It was an extremely poor decision as he floated a pass to the sideline that was easily intercepted and returned for a touchdown by William Gay, putting the score at 23-7 Pittsburgh. And by the time McCarron threw his second touchdown, the game was already over.    Roethlisberger, despite completing 30-for-39 passes for 282 yards, did not throw a touchdown and was intercepted once. But he did look sharp all game and led his team into Bengals' territory over and over again. Williams was the beneficiary, with 2 touchdown runs, as he rushed 23 times for 76 yards and caught 2 passes for 15 more.    Heath Miller returned from his rib injury and was the chain mover all game, as he caught 10-of-10 targets for 66 yards. That's not much in yards per catch, but it is the definition of a quarterback's security blanket. That left the team's 2 most explosive players, finishing with not-so explosive numbers, with Antonio Brown totaling 87 yards and no touchdowns on 7 receptions and Martavis Bryant also catching 7 passes, but for just 49 yards."

   "comment":"Antonio Brown dog-walking Chris Harris around the field and foreshadowed what would happen in the second half.    Coming into this game, the Broncos had allowed 115 completions on 204 wide receiver targets for 1,316 yards and 2 touchdowns to wide receivers. That's in 13 games, so entire opposing wide receiver groups had averaged barely over 100 yards receiving, and you can barely see the number that happens after you divide 2 by 13. That is some dominance. But then Mr. Antonio Brown walked onto the field. The second half was the Antonio Brown show, as he took his initial dominance of Chris Harris to a new level. Brown was consistently open and open quickly. Roethlisberger pelted him with targets, and after a third-quarter touchdown to get the Steelers within 7 points, Brown finished the scoring with a beautiful pass from Roethlisberger for the receiver's second touchdown of the game, to make it 34-27.    That's right, the Broncos didn't score a single point in the second half, as Pittsburgh's pass rush started getting to Osweiler, causing him to hurry his throws. He threw 1 interception, but had 2 others bounce off Steelers defensive backs' hands. But Demaryius Thomas and "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown owners were robbed of a touchdown because of a horrible call in this game. My condolences if it ended up costing you the title.    The Pittsburgh Steelers came into this game with a 9-5 record, having won 5 of their last 6. while the Ravens had dropped their last 3. giving up 69 points over the last 2 games. But when these 2 AFC North rivals meet, there are few easy wins, and this game was no different. The Steelers only needed to beat the Ravens and the Browns to make the playoffs. Instead, Pittsburgh lost to Ryan Mallett, who had been dumped by the Houston Texans and signed by Baltimore just 12 days ago. How did the Ravens do it? First, they dared the Steelers to run on them, which they did and did well, but as poor as the Steelers' pass defense has been this season, Mallett and company were able to move the ball easily and get a lead, while the Steelers were rendered 1.dimensional. Mallett moved the Ravens into Pittsburgh territory early and often. He played within his skill set and didn't force the ball or try to hit the long pass very often. Running back "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown putting up big numbers once again. An early fumble by Brown and 2 interceptions by Roethlisberger kept this 1 close.    By halftime, Brown had 10 receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown, which is a career game for most wide receivers. There was inkling at that point, that Brown could make a push for Marvin Harrison's reception record, which Brown was 20 behind coming into the game. He managed just 3 more receptions, but for the season, a year in which Landry Jones and the other backup were his quarterbacks for a time, Brown finished with 136 receptions for 1,834 yards and 10 touchdowns. Those numbers broke his own Steelers' records.    Early in the 4.h quarter, the Steelers were up just 5 points, 17-12. The Browns had the ball on their own 20-yard line, when "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown's helmet. It was 1 of the most obvious unnecessary roughness calls you'll ever see. If this occurred in the second quarter, it'd be bad enough, but the penalty helped move the ball into kicking range. Brown, by the way, was down on the ground for a while, and he appeared to sustain a concussion. That will be important going forward, but this game was still in doubt because the Steelers would have to try a 50-yard kick. That changed when the Bengals were flagged for yet another personal foul for pushing an official. The thing is, Pittsburgh assistant coach Joey Porter ran onto the field. How he wasn't penalized for this was mystifying, to say the least. There should have been offsetting penalties. The officiating in this game was completely 1.sided and horrible. It's absolutely embarrassing for the NFL that they had John Parry, who had no control of the previous Pittsburgh-Cincinnati meeting, officiate this particular matchup again. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. At any rate, Chris Boswell drilled a 35-yard field goal to end the game. Steelers win, 18-16. Can't wait for Broadway's version. Epilogue: - I'm going to use the epilogue to post some stats. Roethlisberger went 18-of-31 for 229 yards and a touchdown. It's unclear how healthy he is, but Roethlisberger has an extensive history of playing well when hurt. - Speaking of injured players, Antonio Brown snatched 7 balls for 119 yards. He's questionable at best heading into next week's game in Denver. Bryant (5-29) caught Roethlisberger's sole score. - Replacing "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, Sammie Coates and company.    The Jets' pass defense really was the weak link in this game, as they had no answer for Roethlisberger. And even though the defensive line held Bell to 66 yards, New York only got to Roethlisberger 1 time, which makes it even tougher on the secondary. Anyway you look at it, the Jets are giving up chunk yardage through the air and don't have the offense to match their opponents.    The worst coaching decision of the day goes to Todd Bowles, who, with 7:36 left in the game and his team down by 2 scores on a 4.h-and-two at midfield, elected to punt. This against a team that had no trouble moving the ball on his defense for most of the day. Predictably, the Steelers took that possession and went 79 yards in 12 plays, ending the Jets' chances with Sammie Coates' second touchdown of the day.    The Steelers have now blown out their last 2 opponents at home after being blown out themselves in Philadelphia 3 weeks ago, while the Jets have now lost their last 3 by a total score of 82-33.   "

Had Brown been tackled in the field of play, the clock would've expired, but Brown was able to reach the ball over the goal line for the decisive touchdown. Roethlisberger struggled in the early going, but was simply amazing in the 4.h quarter. How does 14-of-17 for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns sound? Oh, and 2 of his 3 incompletions happened to be spikes to stop the clock on the final possession! The Ravens had no chance of restricting the red-hot Roethlisberger, especially without top cornerback Jimmy Smith to cover Brown. Overall, Roethlisberger finished 24-of-33 for 279 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. If you don't feel like doing the math, Roethlisberger was 10-of-16 for 115 yards, 1 score and 2 interceptions entering the final frame. There were some things that weren't his fault, such as a long pass to Brown being negated by obvious offensive pass interference, but Roethlisberger was definitely to blame for his dual picks.

   "comment":"Antonio Brown was the receiver to draw that pass interference, but he was held in check for much of the game by Rhodes. Brown saw 11 targets, catching 5 for 62 yards; a thoroughly un-Brown-y stat line. That focus on Brown did help Bryant, who ended up with only 4 targets, but caught 3 for 91 yards and a touchdown. He also got a 51-yard pass interference call on his defender late in the game.    For Bryant, this must have been a satisfying game, as he was suspended all last season and was held in check in Week 1 against the Browns. He no doubt adds a dimension to this Steelers' offense that they were missing last season.    Minnesota rookie running back "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown had his worst statistical game, as he caught just 4-of-9 targets for 34 yards. The Ravens weren't going to let Brown beat them, so it all turned to Bell as the offense took the easier road. Brown has had trouble in Baltimore just like the whole team, so this isn't a shocking result. He'll continue to pace the league in yards and receptions.    Baltimore's top receiver was Mike Wallace, who led the team in targets, receptions and yards to go along with his touchdown. He also dropped what would have been a long touchdown pass. Not much went right for Baltimore this week.    Next week, the Ravens will head to Oakland, where they should have a bit more luck offensively, but we can't count on that with the way Flacco has played of late. The Steelers will take on another tough defense as they host the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they will be home, where they usually play much better. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

That made the stat line look nice, but there were 9 missed opportunities, 2 of which were tipped and returned for touchdowns in the third quarter. The third quarter also had the Steelers ahead 9-7 before those 2 pick-sixes occurred.    The Steelers have always gone as Roethlisberger goes, and now he's playing some of his worst football. They will need to take a look at limiting him, as a more conservative approach would have likely won this game. They will head to Kansas City next week, which, with the way they look right now, doesn't feel like a place they can win. The Jaguars, on the other hand, have now beaten the Texans, Ravens and Steelers rather easily, with great defensive play and strong running by their rookie running back. It looks as though it still is possible to hide your quarterback and win games in today's NFL, and Jacksonville will keep trying to do just that next week at home against the Rams.   "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown was a monster in this game. The Titans had no answer for him, as he caught 10 of his 13 targets for 144 yards and a whopping 3 touchdowns. One of his scores was ridiculous; Brown snatched the ball with 1 hand and pinned it to his helmet as he was falling out of bounds. "
