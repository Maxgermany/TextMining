Walt Coleman was the official in this contest, so naturally there were a number of awful calls on both sides. Against the Ravens: - Smith's hold to negate an 80-yard Rice touchdown on the opening play was completely bogus. Cris Collinsworth nearly had an aneurysm yelling about it. - Rice ran into the end zone in the first quarter, but the play was blown dead extremely early. - Smith was held a bit later, which prevented a long reception. The hold wasn't called. Against the Steelers: - Brown was interfered with in the end zone, but no penalty was called. - "

   "comment":"Brown to move the ball into Cincinnati territory. A second touchdown pass to Cotchery was called back due to an offensive pass interference penalty on Miller. The Bengals' defensive line came through with their third sack of the first half on third down to force a field goal. Pittsburgh was up 17-10 at halftime. Unfortunately, Hall suffered a ruptured Achilles' 10.on against the Steelers and will miss the rest of the season. It is a devastating injury for the Bengals. He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with Jermaine Gresham and Colin Cochart for good gains to get inside the 10-yard line. Dalton finished the drive with a 1.yard scoring pass to Gresham. Pittsburgh answered on their next possession for what would be the game-winning score. Roethlisberger threw the ball down the field with some short passes to his receivers. At the 9-yard line, Mendenhall made an impressive run where he shed 2 tackles to fall over the goal line for the score. After that both defenses shored up. Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons caught a deflected pass for an interception early in the 4.h quarter. The Bengal defense played well also and totaled 5 sacks in the game. Late in the 4.h quarter, Cincinnati was moving into Pittsburgh territory. The comeback attempt ended when cornerback William Gay saw a slant route coming in zone coverage and intercepted the pass around the Steelers' 20-yard line. Pittsburgh controlled the ball and ran the clock out. For the game, Roethlisberger completed 21-of-33 passes for 245 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Mendenhall ran for 44 yards on 16 carries with 2 scores. Brown led the Steelers in receiving with 86 yards on 5 receptions. Wallace caught 5 for 54 yards with 2 runs for 31 yards. Dalton played better than his numbers indicate. He was 15-of-30 for 170 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Benson had 57 yards on 15 carries. "

   "comment":"Brown scored on a punt return touchdown just prior to halftime, thanks in part to a missed block-in-the-back penalty.    It was a different story in the second half though. The Bengals mustered just 63 total yards after the break and were able to convert only 2-of-11 third downs overall. Dalton (11-of-24, 135 yards, TD) was knocked out of the game in the 4.h quarter because of a hip injury he incurred after a sack. It didn't appear to be serious; Marvin Lewis may have held him out because his team was trailing by 4 touchdowns.    Dalton struggled, but at least A.J. Green had a solid fantasy outing. The dynamic rookie wideout had more than half of Dalton's yardage, as he hauled in 6 grabs for 87 yards and a touchdown.    There was some concern about Ben Roethlisberger's fractured thumb entering this contest, but it didn't appear to be a factor, as he went 15-of-23 for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns, both to Mike Wallace (3-38).

   "comment":"Brown committed illegal procedure penalties. The defense, perhaps feeling the frustration of being shorthanded, were flagged for dual personal foul penalties during 1 of Philadelphia's 2 touchdown drives. One of the penalties would have almost certainly forced a punt because the Eagles would have been stuck with a third-and-long. Philadelphia's other scoring drive was amusing. The Eagles had a 4th-and-1 deep in their own territory at the beginning of the final quarter. Andy Reid inexplicably sent his players out to go for it. He then decided to challenge the prior play. As always when coaches attempt to review a spot, Reid was denied, costing him a precious timeout. Reid still decided to go for it, despite the pleas of Troy Aikman, and barely converted. Later on the drive, Reid asked for yet another useless timeout and went for it again on a 4th-and-1. Philadelphia somehow scored a touchdown out of this, but in typical Reid fashion, the team didn't have any stoppages at the end of the game to prevent the Steelers from running the clock out and kicking the decisive field goal.    Ben Roethlisberger won this matchup on his own. He went 21-of-37 for 207 yards, but was masterful on third downs. Big Ben should have had a touchdown added to his stats, but Antonio Brown dropped a ball in the end zone. Brown did catch 7 passes for 86 yards.    No other Steeler wideout did very much. "

   "comment":"Brown then had a deep pass fall through his hands. - The defense surrendered a converted first down on a 3rd-and-13 run when the Chargers were just trying to get into better field goal position. - San Diego scored a defensive touchdown when Ben Roethlisberger carelessly threw a lateral pass that doinked off a player's rear end.    The Steelers lost by only 10 points, but don't be fooled by that. As mentioned, the score was 27-3 at 1 point, but Pittsburgh padded its stats with meaningless junk-time numbers. For example, Roethlisberger finished 22-of-42 for 285 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 9-of-20 for 105 yards, no scores and no picks at halftime.

   "comment":"Brown to hit a 43-yard field goal with only seconds remaining. This was the second straight week Roethlisberger choked in crunch time and threw a bad interception to set up the game-winning field goal for the opposition. As a result, the Steelers will miss out on the playoffs, and Cincinnati clinched a wild-card berth for the second-straight season.    The Bengals were all defense, as their stop unit carried them to a win with little help from the offense. Geno Atkins was just awesome. All day, he dominated guards David DeCastro and Ramon Foster. Atkins had 2.5 sacks and forced a fumble on a punishing hit on Roethlisberger. Atkins' sack-fumble came close to knocking Big Ben out of the game as he had to be helped off the field. Michael Johnson and Cincinnati's secondary had an impressive games as well.    As for the scoring, the Bengals' stop unit took the lead late in the first quarter. Leon Hall made a great read of Roethlisberger to jump in front of Heath Miller (3-45) for an interception. Hall returned the pick 17 yards for a touchdown. The Steelers answered with a drive but missed a gimme 24-yard field goal in the second quarter thanks to a bad snap. Dalton engineered a drive for a field goal near the end of the first half. Roethlisberger answered as he got the Steelers on the board with a 60-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown (5-97) after he burned Adam Jones on a go route."

   "comment":"Brown, acquired during the bye from Arizona, injured his triceps during warmups. The other tackle, Mike Adams, was inactive, so the Steelers were presumed to be in a world of trouble. That seemed to be the case when the Steelers had 2 3.and-outs and then Roethlisberger was sacked twice on the third drive. However, Big Ben caught fire after that. He completed a 31-yard pass to Heath Miller and then nearly lofted a touchdown to Antonio Brown, who dropped the ball. Roethlisberger was unfazed by this, finishing 23-of-30 for 264 yards and a score. He took just 2 more sacks the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Roethlisberger's counterpart came into this contest with some momentum, but there were reports Sunday morning that the Jets had some concerns that he wasn't handling the accolades very well. Sure enough, Smith struggled and New York as a whole was completely out of sorts. Smith went 19-of-34 for 201 yards and 2 interceptions. He wasn't bad early on, but struggled immensely following the break (11-of-22, 140 yards, 2 INTs). He completed just 1 pass longer than 20 yards. One of his picks was brutal, as it was heaved carelessly into triple coverage. All of this shouldn't have been a surprise, by the way, as the Jets' concerns about Smith's arrogance were highly warranted. Also, it must be noted that only 2 rookie quarterbacks have beaten Dick LeBeau. The legendary defensive coordinator doesn't have the same type of talent he used to, but he can still confuse the hell out of raw signal-callers.    Both teams struggled to run the ball. "

   "comment":"Browns are 3-4, and yet everyone says they're overachieving.    This ended up a typical Steelers-Ravens contest featuring 2 physical teams slugging it out for 4 quarters. Pittsburgh looked like it had turned back the clock as they rediscovered their running game. Some clutch 4.h-quarter throws by Ben Roethlisberger led them to their second win of the season. While Pittsburgh won ugly, Baltimore dropped a critical game to fall to 3-4 on the season. The Ravens' offense just doesn't look playoff-caliber. In the first half, Pittsburgh had a good drive that ended with a short shovel pass to Heath Miller (2-17) for a touchdown. Miller then had a nice gain on a crossing route, but Daryl Smith smacked the ball out of his hands and Matt Elam recovered it for Balitmore in Pittsburgh territory. That spotted the Ravens their second field goal and cut the Steelers' lead to 10-6. Roethlisberger had 1 of his trademark plays in the third quarter after Terrell Suggs had missed a tackle on a potential sack and Roethlisberger took off on a 19 yard run. Suggs came back to get a sack a few plays later, but a Elvis Dumervil face mask took away a Haloti Ngata sack on a third down. That drive ended in a Pittsburgh field goal. Joe Flacco responded by hitting a 41-yard bomb to Torrey Smith after he got a step on Ike Taylor. Baltimore tacked on 3 more and then tried a surprise onside kick, but the Steelers recovered. That ended up spotting Pittsburgh a field goal. Flacco got going with some big third-down conversions on a long 16-play drive. He hit Dallas Clark on third-and-goal from the 1 to tie the game at 16 with 2 minutes remaining. The ensuing kickoff saw Emmanuel Sanders (1-7) race down the sideline for a touchdown, but he stepped out at the 35-yard line. The Steelers moved the ball with a penalty on Lardarius Webb and completions to Antonio Brown (6-50) to set up a 42-yard field goal from Shawn Suisham on the final play of the game.    Roethlisberger completed 17-of-23 passes for 160 yards and a score. Bell ran for 93 yards on 19 carries.    The real star of the game was Pittsburgh's defense. The unit contained Smith (3-61) and "

   "comment":"Brown (9-82) dropped a deep pass on a third-and-15 in the 4.h quarter that would've moved the chains. This forced Pittsburgh to punt, allowing the Raiders to bleed more time off the clock.    The Steelers also struggled to run the ball. This isn't totally surprising because the Raiders have a surprisingly good run defense, but I thought Bell would have more success than gaining just 24 yards on 13 carries. Luckily for his fantasy owners, he was able to find the end zone.    The Raiders, meanwhile, ran all over Pittsburgh until late in the game when Dick LeBeau's defense stacked the box. Darren McFadden gained 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 attempts. Pryor, meanwhile, scrambled 9 times for 106 yards and a score, most of which came on that 93-yard scamper. Pryor actually didn't have a very good performance if that long run is excluded. He went 10-of-19 for only 88 yards and 2 interceptions. He did endure a drop and did a good job of avoiding some sacks, but 1 of his picks was awful. He showed terrible mechanics, failing to set his feet as he threw across his body. The result was an overthrow that sailed right to Troy Polamalu. Pryor completed just 3 passes after halftime, as the Raiders were stuck on 21 points in the final 2 quarters.    Only 1 Raider had more than 2 receptions. That would be Rod Streater (4-45). Denarius Moore had just 2 catches for 32 yards.    As for the Steeler wideouts, Emmanuel Sanders actually outgained Brown, catching 7 balls for 88 yards and Roethlisberger's only touchdown. "

They had a chance to end up with a tie with the Dolphins and Jets (and other 4-6 victors) for the final wild-card spot by the end of the day. Considering that Cleveland fans had some reason for optimism, it was only natural that not only would the team lose; it would see its quarterback leave the game with an injury. Jason Campbell was actually injured twice in this contest. He left the game briefly in the first half, but was ultimately knocked out on a fierce hit in the third quarter. The Browns were driving near midfield, but Campbell was strip-sacked by Troy Polamalu, and Pittsburgh returned it to the 4-yard line and ultimately scored a touchdown."

   "comment":"Brown (5-66, TD), Le'Veon Bell (5-50), Emmanuel Sanders (5-38) and Heath Miller (4-35).    Bell did most of his damage as a receiver, as he had trouble finding running lanes behind an offensive line that was missing its second-string center and saw both tackles, Kelvin Beachum and Marcus Gilbert, suffer injuries. Bell managed just 57 yards on 24 carries, though he did make up for it with a touchdown.    Both Steeler tackles got hurt, but the Bengals sustained way more injuries. James Harrison (making his first return to Pittsburgh), Jermaine Gresham, Dre Kirkpatrick and even punter Kevin Huber left the game with various maladies.    Andy Dalton played poorly for most of this contest. He may have finished 25-of-44 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, but most of that came in garbage time. Just as Roethlisberger completed his 12th-consecutive pass to open the game, Dalton was a pathetic 2-of-10 for 15 yards. He was under tremendous pressure all evening, taking 8 sacks. Dalton's scores went to Marvin Jones (5-48), who had a drop, and Tyler Eifert (3-33). A.J. Green didn't find the end zone, but he snagged 9 catches for 93 yards. Ike Taylor, who has been torched by nearly everyone this year, inexplicably did a good job covering Green. Taylor also played well against Green in their Week 2 tilt.    Giovani Bernard handled most of the workload, but mustered just 33 yards on 13 carries. Bernard at least scored a touchdown. BenJarvus Green-Ellis, meanwhile, had just 4 yards on 4 carries. He spent most of the game standing on the sideline.    I mentioned earlier that the Steelers outplayed the Bengals in every facet. This includes special teams. In the first quarter, the Bengals botched a punt as the wind blew away a snap heading toward Huber, who picked up the ball and was tackled at his own 1-yard line. Later on, Brown returned a punt for a touchdown. Huber suffered a crushing hit after that, so he had to leave the game with a jaw injury. Kicker "

Still though, it's a shame the Chiefs couldn't be victorious against the lackluster Chargers to help Pittsburgh clinch the final spot in the conference. Despite the victory, Ben Roethlisberger did not play well. He went 19-of-31 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He also fumbled, but was lucky enough to recover it. The rain definitely played a factor, as he didn't seem to have complete control of the football on his first interception. He also severely underthrew Antonio Brown downfield for what would've been a long score. Roethlisberger actually should've had a second touchdown, but "

Roethlisberger targeted Wheaton a team-high 11 times, but the second-year wideout hauled in only 4 balls for 33 yards.    With Phil Taylor out and Armonty Bryant carted off early, Pittsburgh had a great opportunity to establish the run. Le'Veon Bell gained 82 yards on just 18 carries, but he didn't get the appropriate volume because his team was behind throughout.    As for the actual winners, Brian Hoyer continued his magic. He led the team to victory despite completing just 8 passes, as he went 8-of-17. However, his yardage total (217) more than made up for it, as Hoyer hit passes of 51, 31, 31, 24 and 17, thanks to the Steelers leaving many of his receivers wide open. Hoyer did this without Alex Mack, who suffered a serious leg injury. The Browns already think he could be out an extended period of time. Hoyer's sole score went to "

In the second half, he missed an open Heath Miller for a touchdown and then made a terrible decision to throw late across his body for another near-interception, and he was picked off on a second occasion when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on Drew Brees that allowed the Saints to keep a drive alive. Give the Saints credit for taking advantage of the Steelers' injuries and errors. They didn't have a promising start though, as Marques Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson. Despite all of that, New Orleans snapped out of its funk, and Brees was able to torch Pittsburgh's sorry secondary by going 19-of-27 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns.    All of Brees' touchdowns went to different players, with Stills (5-162) leading the team in receiving. Stills' score was a 69-yarder in which he beat Ike Taylor, who was making his return from injury, with a double move. Marques Colston (3-16), Nick Toon, Ben Watson and Erik Lorig all found the end zone, with the former atoning for 2 drops. Jimmy Graham inexplicably didn't draw a single target. He didn't get hurt; the Steelers just made sure he wouldn't beat them, double- and triple-teaming him on every single play.    The Steelers couldn't stop the run at all. Mark Ingram made up for a couple of poor outings by gashing Pittsburgh for 122 yards on 23 carries.    Some random notes for the Steelers: - Le'Veon Bell was outgained on the ground by Ingram - 21 carries, 95 rushing yards, 1 touchdown - but he atoned for it by catching 8 balls for a whopping 159 receiving yards. With Roethlisberger limited, he had no choice but to dump the ball off to Bell. - Antonio Brown scored twice, though both touchdowns came in garbage time. He finished with 8 receptions for 97 yards. - Heath Miler drew 14 targets. He snatched 8 of them for 82 yards. - Brett Kiesel is believed to have torn his tricep in this loss. He's done for the season if his Monday MRI confirms it.   "

The Steelers ultimately scored on the drive in which Miller screwed up with a Le'Veon Bell run, but Roethlisberger's fantasy owners may have lost their championship because of Miller and Brown's miscues. The 1 potential dark cloud over this victory was that Roethlisberger injured his knee on his touchdown to Brown, but that may not be much of a big deal because he ran into the locker room to get treated. Roethlisberger was also nearly guilty of a fumble, but the call was turned into an incompletion after replay, though it appeared as though he indeed lost the ball.    I mentioned that Brown eventually reached the end zone. He tied Miller for the team in lead in receptions, barely outgaining the tight end, 72-68. Brown and Miller were the only Steelers to record more than 2 receptions.    I was shocked that Bell didn't expose Kansas City's league-worst run defense. I thought there was a chance he'd eclipse 200 yards and perhaps challenge for the single-game record. Instead, he mustered only 63 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. He didn't have a run longer than 7 yards.    Meanwhile, the Chiefs, as mentioned, struggled in the red zone, but "

The Steelers got their act together after that, as Roethlisberger was 8-of-12 for 126 yards, a touchdown and an interception following halftime. His pick occurred because of a miscommunication, but Roethlisberger made up for it with a 63-yard bomb to Brown with a few minutes remaining in regulation, which helped cover the spread. It appeared as though Pittsburgh was trying its hardest to beat the number, as Tomlin was unusually aggressive at the end of the contest, even trying an unnecessary fake punt that was intercepted. Roethlisberger finished 24-of-38 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He would've had an even bigger day if it wasn't for those drops. Roethlisberger had a clean pocket for most of the night, as the Cincinnati pass rush was a big disappointment.    Brown once again had a monstrous game, catching seen balls for 128 yards and a touchdown. He nearly had another score, but Roethlisberger missed him in the end zone. It seemed like he and Big Ben had trouble getting in rhythm early on, but the 63-yard score to clinch the cover made things right. "

Harris (9-25) saw most of the workload after that, but save for 1 8.yard burst, he didn't do much with his opportunities.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, had a mixed outing. He finished 31-of-45 for 334 yards and a touchdown, but also threw 2 interceptions. He was under pressure more than he's used to, and he made some nice plays, including 1 in which he muscled out of sack and found Heath Miller (6-76) for a big gain on third-and-10. However, Roethlisberger was brought down 5 times, and 1 Baltimore defender was able to hit him as he was releasing the ball, which resulted in a tipped pick by Suggs, who somehow caught the ball in between his legs. On the very next Pittsburgh drive, Suggs forced a hold that nullified a Roethlisberger touchdown to Dri Archer. Roethlisberger appeared to be concussed late in the 4.h quarter when he took a big hit, and he had to miss a few plays. Mike Tomlin put him back in, which I thought was a big mistake. Roethlisberger naturally threw an interception on the first play. Miller, meanwhile, also got knocked out with a head injury. Like Roethlisberger, he reentered the game and made an error, losing a fumble. The game was pretty much decided at that point, but Tomlin shouldn't have risked the longevity of 2 of his key players, especially considering the game was in doubt.    Antonio Brown was his usual dominant self, catching 9 of 14 targets for 117 yards. He picked up an early first down with a great spin move on "

   "comment":"Brown. As expected, he dominated, catching 9 balls for 133 yards and a touchdown. The second was DeAngelo Williams, who was running like it was 2008. Williams found big holes through a Vince Wilfork-less defensive line, gaining 127 yards on 21 carries. Rookie Malcom Brown struggled, while Dominique Easley was sent into the locker room with a hip injury."

   "comment":"Brown. Williams ended up with a whopping 3 touchdowns, all within 2 yards of the goal line.    Roethlisberger completed 77.8 percent of his passes and averaged 13.7 yards per attempt while taking no sacks. It was a masterful display helped out by the 49ers' defensive line's ineptitude at putting much pressure on him.    Roethlisberger's No. 1 target was, surprise, surprise, Antonio Brown. He caught big passes all day long and piled up 9 receptions on 11 targets for 195 yards and a touchdown. This of course, is nothing new, but 195 yards is nothing to sneeze at. It was Brown's second-best career total; his first was 196 yards against Chicago in 2013. Brown now hasn't caught fewer than 5 receptions in a game since 2012.    The 49ers took too long to get their offense moving, but they did put up plenty of yardage when trying to make up the 27-point deficit. Kaepernick was the biggest beneficiary as he threw the ball 46 times, completing 33 for 335 yards and 2 touchdowns, while leading the team in rushing with 8 carries for 51 yards. He also had 1 touchdown run overturned by review.    Kaepernick's 71.7 completion percentage on 46 pass attempts makes for a nice stat and also shows you just how bad the Steelers' pass defense is. His completions were pretty spread out with "

However, he managed just 2 receptions in the second half, thanks to Roethlisberger's injury. Brown's production is going to drop considerably, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. In fact, I consider him as a buy-low option right now because of the assumption that he'll completely drop off. If you can get him at a huge discount, I'd pull the trigger.    "

   "comment":"Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.    After that initial drive, this game was a defensive struggle, with interceptions and field goals dominating until the 4.h quarter. Andy Dalton had his worst game of the season, completing 23-of-38 passes (60.5 percent) for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.    The only real connection Dalton was on target with all game was A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, DeAngelo Williams took over and had some nice numbers, rushing 9 times for 71 yards, including a 55-yard run that Panthers fans would recognize. He also caught 4 passes for 39 yards. If Bell is out for a while, Williams should be a capable backup, especially with the Steelers' usually good passing game.    The leading target for the Steelers this week wasn't Antonio Brown, but tight end Heath Miller, who had zero receptions last week for the first time since 2007."

   "comment":"Brown, Heath Miller and Markus Wheaton, while feeding DeAngelo Williams, ending in a 1-yard Williams touchdown run.    That 7-0 lead expanded to 13-0 after 2 Boswell field goals, but McCarron fired back by hitting A.J. Green for a 66-yard touchdown pass to bring it to 13-7 Steelers. McCarron went on to finish the game with a decent 280 yards passing for 2 touchdowns, but 2 interceptions as well.    One of McCarron's interceptions came in the third quarter with the score 16-7. It was an extremely poor decision as he floated a pass to the sideline that was easily intercepted and returned for a touchdown by William Gay, putting the score at 23-7 Pittsburgh. And by the time McCarron threw his second touchdown, the game was already over.    Roethlisberger, despite completing 30-for-39 passes for 282 yards, did not throw a touchdown and was intercepted once. But he did look sharp all game and led his team into Bengals' territory over and over again. Williams was the beneficiary, with 2 touchdown runs, as he rushed 23 times for 76 yards and caught 2 passes for 15 more.    Heath Miller returned from his rib injury and was the chain mover all game, as he caught 10-of-10 targets for 66 yards. That's not much in yards per catch, but it is the definition of a quarterback's security blanket. That left the team's 2 most explosive players, finishing with not-so explosive numbers, with Antonio Brown totaling 87 yards and no touchdowns on 7 receptions and Martavis Bryant also catching 7 passes, but for just 49 yards."

Coming into this game, the Broncos had allowed 115 completions on 204 wide receiver targets for 1,316 yards and 2 touchdowns to wide receivers. That's in 13 games, so entire opposing wide receiver groups had averaged barely over 100 yards receiving, and you can barely see the number that happens after you divide 2 by 13. That is some dominance. But then Mr. Antonio Brown walked onto the field. The second half was the Antonio Brown show, as he took his initial dominance of Chris Harris to a new level. Brown was consistently open and open quickly. Roethlisberger pelted him with targets, and after a third-quarter touchdown to get the Steelers within 7 points, Brown finished the scoring with a beautiful pass from Roethlisberger for the receiver's second touchdown of the game, to make it 34-27.    That's right, the Broncos didn't score a single point in the second half, as Pittsburgh's pass rush started getting to Osweiler, causing him to hurry his throws.

The Pittsburgh Steelers came into this game with a 9-5 record, having won 5 of their last 6. while the Ravens had dropped their last 3. giving up 69 points over the last 2 games. But when these 2 AFC North rivals meet, there are few easy wins, and this game was no different. The Steelers only needed to beat the Ravens and the Browns to make the playoffs. Instead, Pittsburgh lost to Ryan Mallett, who had been dumped by the Houston Texans and signed by Baltimore just 12 days ago. How did the Ravens do it? First, they dared the Steelers to run on them, which they did and did well, but as poor as the Steelers' pass defense has been this season, Mallett and company were able to move the ball easily and get a lead, while the Steelers were rendered 1.dimensional. Mallett moved the Ravens into Pittsburgh territory early and often. He played within his skill set and didn't force the ball or try to hit the long pass very often. Running back "

If this occurred in the second quarter, it'd be bad enough, but the penalty helped move the ball into kicking range. Brown, by the way, was down on the ground for a while, and he appeared to sustain a concussion. That will be important going forward, but this game was still in doubt because the Steelers would have to try a 50-yard kick. That changed when the Bengals were flagged for yet another personal foul for pushing an official. The thing is, Pittsburgh assistant coach Joey Porter ran onto the field. How he wasn't penalized for this was mystifying, to say the least. There should have been offsetting penalties. The officiating in this game was completely 1.sided and horrible. It's absolutely embarrassing for the NFL that they had John Parry, who had no control of the previous Pittsburgh-Cincinnati meeting, officiate this particular matchup again. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. At any rate, "

Anyway you look at it, the Jets are giving up chunk yardage through the air and don't have the offense to match their opponents.    The worst coaching decision of the day goes to Todd Bowles, who, with 7:36 left in the game and his team down by 2 scores on a 4.h-and-two at midfield, elected to punt. This against a team that had no trouble moving the ball on his defense for most of the day. Predictably, the Steelers took that possession and went 79 yards in 12 plays, ending the Jets' chances with Sammie Coates' second touchdown of the day.    The Steelers have now blown out their last 2 opponents at home after being blown out themselves in Philadelphia 3 weeks ago, while the Jets have now lost their last 3 by a total score of 82-33.   "

   "comment":"Brown, making the score 30-29 with 42 seconds left. Oh, and another missed conversion. Prescott used his 42 seconds well, but the play that set up the game-winning play was a facemask that pushed the Cowboys within Dan Bailey's field goal range. But, the Cowboys wouldn't need that field goal, because Ezekiel Elliott would finish off the day with a 32-yard burst up the middle for the game-winning touchdown and his third touchdown of the day.    Elliott finished the day with 114 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries while adding 2 catches for 95 yards and a touchdown on 2 targets. He's now eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards on the year and has 10 total touchdowns through 9 games. He's your rookie of the year unless things go south fast.    The Cowboys are rolling. They've now won their last 8 games after losing their season opener, and they should be favored in every game going forward. Oh, and they have an extremely good backup quarterback if their hot rookie is hurt or forgets how to play football.    The Steelers aren't doing nearly as well, as they now have a losing record at 4-5. Fortunately for them, they also are only 1 game back of Baltimore for the division lead. Add in the facts that the Ravens play the Cowboys next week and the Steelers take on the winless Browns, and there's a decent shot the Steelers are feeling better about their long-term chances by this time next week.

Had Brown been tackled in the field of play, the clock would've expired, but Brown was able to reach the ball over the goal line for the decisive touchdown. Roethlisberger struggled in the early going, but was simply amazing in the 4.h quarter. How does 14-of-17 for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns sound? Oh, and 2 of his 3 incompletions happened to be spikes to stop the clock on the final possession! The Ravens had no chance of restricting the red-hot Roethlisberger, especially without top cornerback Jimmy Smith to cover Brown. Overall, Roethlisberger finished 24-of-33 for 279 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. If you don't feel like doing the math, Roethlisberger was 10-of-16 for 115 yards, 1 score and 2 interceptions entering the final frame. There were some things that weren't his fault, such as a long pass to Brown being negated by obvious offensive pass interference, but Roethlisberger was definitely to blame for his dual picks. The first was an overthrow in his own territory, while the second was telegraphed, allowing "

   "comment":"Brown. The stud receiver struggled to do much as a result of constant double teams, forcing Ben Roethlisberger to target some horrible receivers - Sammie Coates, Cobi Hamilton, Darrius Heyward-Bey - far too often. The end result happened to be tons of dropped passes and missed opportunities. New England's offense, meanwhile, did enough to get the victory. Thirty-six points isn't indicative of their overall performance, as they scored a free, quick touchdown following an Eli Rogers lost fumble, and they were very fortunate to retain possession following a Tom Brady lost fumble that should've been rewarded to Pittsburgh. However, the Steelers struggled to stop the Patriots on too many drives, and they probably would've lost to the Patriots regardless. This game would've been a lot closer with Bell on the field, though.    Tom Brady finished 32-of-42 for 384 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also fumbled, but despite the Steelers getting a clear recovery, incompetent officiating ruled New England possession without any sort of explanation. That was Brady's sole mistake of the afternoon, and his numbers would've been better if it weren't for a couple of drops. It really helped that Brady was seldom hit this evening. He took a sack early, but was barely touched after that. Brady will be heading to his 7.h Super Bowl, and if he gets the win, he'll have the most championships of any quarterback in NFL history, breaking the current tie he has with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw.    Despite Brady's high yardage total, only 3 Patriots accumulated more han 13 receiving yards. They were Chris Hogan (9-180), Julian Edelman (8-118) and Martellus Bennett (5-32). Hogan secured 2 of Brady's 3 touchdowns, while Edelman snatched the other. Both made big plays in this game, obviously, but Edelman really sparked the team with a 12-yard conversion on a third-and-10 between 2 defenders, ultimately leading to a score.    The Patriots tried to run with LeGarrette Blount in the early going, but weren't very successful; his 5 first-half carries went for just 4 yards. However, the flu-stricken Steelers wore down in the second half, and Blount finished with 47 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. His best run was when he managed to carry what appeared to be the entire Pittsburgh defense down to the 1-yard line. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    Back to the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 31-of-47 for 314 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. While Roethlisberger accumulated a bulk of his numbers in garbage time, it's still amazing that he was competent when factoring in the utter trash he was throwing to. With Bell injured and Brown constantly double teamed, he had to resort to working with the aforementioned Coates, Hamilton and Heyward-Bey. The first drive saw Roethlisberger curiously take a deep shot to Coates on a third-and-1, which fell incomplete. Hamilton dropped a touchdown in the second quarter. Coates then did the same thing right after halftime. Heyward-Bey was responsible for Roethlisberger's interception, as he wasn't even aware the ball was heading in his direction. The Steelers could have Martavis Bryant back next year, but he needs to be reinstated. It's difficult for the Steelers to trust him, so they may target 1 of the in the early rounds. Roethlisberger desperately needs someone reliable to throw to outside of Brown.    Pittsburgh's 2 leading receivers were predictably Brown (7-77)and Rogers (7-66). However, Brown didn't do much when this game was in doubt, while Rogers was responsible for a lost fumble that gave the Patriots a quick touchdown, putting this game completely out of reach.    With Bell limited to just 6 carries (20 yards), "

   "comment":"Brown was the receiver to draw that pass interference, but he was held in check for much of the game by Rhodes. Brown saw 11 targets, catching 5 for 62 yards; a thoroughly un-Brown-y stat line. That focus on Brown did help Bryant, who ended up with only 4 targets, but caught 3 for 91 yards and a touchdown. He also got a 51-yard pass interference call on his defender late in the game.    For Bryant, this must have been a satisfying game, as he was suspended all last season and was held in check in Week 1 against the Browns. He no doubt adds a dimension to this Steelers' offense that they were missing last season.    Minnesota rookie running back "

The Ravens weren't going to let Brown beat them, so it all turned to Bell as the offense took the easier road. Brown has had trouble in Baltimore just like the whole team, so this isn't a shocking result. He'll continue to pace the league in yards and receptions.    Baltimore's top receiver was Mike Wallace, who led the team in targets, receptions and yards to go along with his touchdown. He also dropped what would have been a long touchdown pass. Not much went right for Baltimore this week.    Next week, the Ravens will head to Oakland, where they should have a bit more luck offensively, but we can't count on that with the way Flacco has played of late. The Steelers will take on another tough defense as they host the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they will be home, where they usually play much better. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

They will need to take a look at limiting him, as a more conservative approach would have likely won this game. They will head to Kansas City next week, which, with the way they look right now, doesn't feel like a place they can win. The Jaguars, on the other hand, have now beaten the Texans, Ravens and Steelers rather easily, with great defensive play and strong running by their rookie running back. It looks as though it still is possible to hide your quarterback and win games in today's NFL, and Jacksonville will keep trying to do just that next week at home against the Rams.   "
