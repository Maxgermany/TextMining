Rashard Mendenhall (13-52, TD) and Heath Miller (5-73) also pleased their fantasy owners.    Walt Coleman was the official in this contest, so naturally there were a number of awful calls on both sides. Against the Ravens: - Smith's hold to negate an 80-yard Rice touchdown on the opening play was completely bogus. Cris Collinsworth nearly had an aneurysm yelling about it. - Rice ran into the end zone in the first quarter, but the play was blown dead extremely early. - Smith was held a bit later, which prevented a long reception. The hold wasn't called. Against the Steelers: - Brown was interfered with in the end zone, but no penalty was called. - "

He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with Jermaine Gresham and Colin Cochart for good gains to get inside the 10-yard line. Dalton finished the drive with a 1.yard scoring pass to Gresham. Pittsburgh answered on their next possession for what would be the game-winning score. Roethlisberger threw the ball down the field with some short passes to his receivers. At the 9-yard line, Mendenhall made an impressive run where he shed 2 tackles to fall over the goal line for the score. After that both defenses shored up. Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons caught a deflected pass for an interception early in the 4.h quarter. The Bengal defense played well also and totaled 5 sacks in the game. Late in the 4.h quarter, Cincinnati was moving into Pittsburgh territory. The comeback attempt ended when cornerback William Gay saw a slant route coming in zone coverage and intercepted the pass around the Steelers' 20-yard line. Pittsburgh controlled the ball and ran the clock out. For the game, Roethlisberger completed 21-of-33 passes for 245 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Mendenhall ran for 44 yards on 16 carries with 2 scores. Brown led the Steelers in receiving with 86 yards on 5 receptions. Wallace caught 5 for 54 yards with 2 runs for 31 yards. Dalton played better than his numbers indicate. He was 15-of-30 for 170 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Benson had 57 yards on 15 carries. "

The Bengals mustered just 63 total yards after the break and were able to convert only 2-of-11 third downs overall. Dalton (11-of-24, 135 yards, TD) was knocked out of the game in the 4.h quarter because of a hip injury he incurred after a sack. It didn't appear to be serious; Marvin Lewis may have held him out because his team was trailing by 4 touchdowns.    Dalton struggled, but at least A.J. Green had a solid fantasy outing. The dynamic rookie wideout had more than half of Dalton's yardage, as he hauled in 6 grabs for 87 yards and a touchdown.    There was some concern about Ben Roethlisberger's fractured thumb entering this contest, but it didn't appear to be a factor, as he went 15-of-23 for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns, both to Mike Wallace (3-38).

Well, it's easy for anyone with interest to buy off the backup running back, and that's exactly what seemed to happen.

The Eagles had a 4th-and-1 deep in their own territory at the beginning of the final quarter. Andy Reid inexplicably sent his players out to go for it. He then decided to challenge the prior play. As always when coaches attempt to review a spot, Reid was denied, costing him a precious timeout. Reid still decided to go for it, despite the pleas of Troy Aikman, and barely converted. Later on the drive, Reid asked for yet another useless timeout and went for it again on a 4th-and-1. Philadelphia somehow scored a touchdown out of this, but in typical Reid fashion, the team didn't have any stoppages at the end of the game to prevent the Steelers from running the clock out and kicking the decisive field goal.    Ben Roethlisberger won this matchup on his own. He went 21-of-37 for 207 yards, but was masterful on third downs. Big Ben should have had a touchdown added to his stats, but Antonio Brown dropped a ball in the end zone. Brown did catch 7 passes for 86 yards.    No other Steeler wideout did very much.

This was the second straight week Roethlisberger choked in crunch time and threw a bad interception to set up the game-winning field goal for the opposition. As a result, the Steelers will miss out on the playoffs, and Cincinnati clinched a wild-card berth for the second-straight season.    The Bengals were all defense, as their stop unit carried them to a win with little help from the offense. Geno Atkins was just awesome. All day, he dominated guards David DeCastro and Ramon Foster. Atkins had 2.5 sacks and forced a fumble on a punishing hit on Roethlisberger. Atkins' sack-fumble came close to knocking Big Ben out of the game as he had to be helped off the field. Michael Johnson and Cincinnati's secondary had an impressive games as well.    As for the scoring, the Bengals' stop unit took the lead late in the first quarter. Leon Hall made a great read of Roethlisberger to jump in front of Heath Miller (3-45) for an interception. Hall returned the pick 17 yards for a touchdown. The Steelers answered with a drive but missed a gimme 24-yard field goal in the second quarter thanks to a bad snap. Dalton engineered a drive for a field goal near the end of the first half. Roethlisberger answered as he got the Steelers on the board with a 60-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown (5-97) after he burned Adam Jones on a go route."

Meanwhile, Roethlisberger's counterpart came into this contest with some momentum, but there were reports Sunday morning that the Jets had some concerns that he wasn't handling the accolades very well. Sure enough, Smith struggled and New York as a whole was completely out of sorts. Smith went 19-of-34 for 201 yards and 2 interceptions. He wasn't bad early on, but struggled immensely following the break (11-of-22, 140 yards, 2 INTs). He completed just 1 pass longer than 20 yards. One of his picks was brutal, as it was heaved carelessly into triple coverage. All of this shouldn't have been a surprise, by the way, as the Jets' concerns about Smith's arrogance were highly warranted. Also, it must be noted that only 2 rookie quarterbacks have beaten Dick LeBeau. The legendary defensive coordinator doesn't have the same type of talent he used to, but he can still confuse the hell out of raw signal-callers.    Both teams struggled to run the ball. Le'Veon Bell had the opportunities (16 carries) but simply couldn't find any holes behind a poor offensive line and against a stout Jet front, as he was able to muster only 34 yards, though he did chip in with 3 catches for 22 receiving yards. Bilal Powell, meanwhile, turned 9 attempts into 30 yards. He also had 3 snags for 20 yards. New York trailed for most of the way, so the coaching staff had to ask Smith to air the ball out 34 times.    The only touchdown in this contest came on a 55-yard Roethlisberger pass to Emmanuel Sanders (3-70). Meanwhile, just 2 Steelers had more than 3 receptions. Antonio Brown (9-86) had the most yardage, but as mentioned, he screwed himself out of a touchdown reception. Miller (6-84) looked good, and Big Ben has to be thrilled that his favorite security blanket is back.    Brown, acquired during the bye from Arizona, injured his triceps during warmups. The other tackle, Mike Adams, was inactive, so the Steelers were presumed to be in a world of trouble. That seemed to be the case when the Steelers had 2 3.and-outs and then Roethlisberger was sacked twice on the third drive. However, Big Ben caught fire after that. He completed a 31-yard pass to Heath Miller and then nearly lofted a touchdown to Antonio Brown, who dropped the ball. Roethlisberger was unfazed by this, finishing 23-of-30 for 264 yards and a score. He took just 2 more sacks the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Roethlisberger's counterpart came into this contest with some momentum, but there were reports Sunday morning that the Jets had some concerns that he wasn't handling the accolades very well.

Bell ran for 93 yards on 19 carries.    The real star of the game was Pittsburgh's defense. The unit contained Smith (3-61) and Browns are 3-4, and yet everyone says they're overachieving.    This ended up a typical Steelers-Ravens contest featuring 2 physical teams slugging it out for 4 quarters. Pittsburgh looked like it had turned back the clock as they rediscovered their running game. Some clutch 4.h-quarter throws by Ben Roethlisberger led them to their second win of the season. While Pittsburgh won ugly, Baltimore dropped a critical game to fall to 3-4 on the season. The Ravens' offense just doesn't look playoff-caliber. In the first half, Pittsburgh had a good drive that ended with a short shovel pass to Heath Miller (2-17) for a touchdown. Miller then had a nice gain on a crossing route, but Daryl Smith smacked the ball out of his hands and Matt Elam recovered it for Balitmore in Pittsburgh territory. That spotted the Ravens their second field goal and cut the Steelers' lead to 10-6. Roethlisberger had 1 of his trademark plays in the third quarter after Terrell Suggs had missed a tackle on a potential sack and Roethlisberger took off on a 19 yard run. Suggs came back to get a sack a few plays later, but a Elvis Dumervil face mask took away a Haloti Ngata sack on a third down. That drive ended in a Pittsburgh field goal. Joe Flacco responded by hitting a 41-yard bomb to Torrey Smith after he got a step on Ike Taylor. Baltimore tacked on 3 more and then tried a surprise onside kick, but the Steelers recovered. That ended up spotting Pittsburgh a field goal. Flacco got going with some big third-down conversions on a long 16-play drive. He hit Dallas Clark on third-and-goal from the 1 to tie the game at 16 with 2 minutes remaining. The ensuing kickoff saw Emmanuel Sanders (1-7) race down the sideline for a touchdown, but he stepped out at the 35-yard line. The Steelers moved the ball with a penalty on Lardarius Webb and completions to Antonio Brown (6-50) to set up a 42-yard field goal from Shawn Suisham on the final play of the game.    Roethlisberger completed 17-of-23 passes for 160 yards and a score. Bell ran for 93 yards on 19 carries.    The real star of the game was Pittsburgh's defense. The unit contained Smith (3-61) and "

Darren McFadden gained 73 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 attempts. Pryor, meanwhile, scrambled 9 times for 106 yards and a score, most of which came on that 93-yard scamper. Pryor actually didn't have a very good performance if that long run is excluded. He went 10-of-19 for only 88 yards and 2 interceptions. He did endure a drop and did a good job of avoiding some sacks, but 1 of his picks was awful. He showed terrible mechanics, failing to set his feet as he threw across his body. The result was an overthrow that sailed right to Troy Polamalu. Pryor completed just 3 passes after halftime, as the Raiders were stuck on 21 points in the final 2 quarters.    Only 1 Raider had more than 2 receptions. That would be Rod Streater (4-45). Denarius Moore had just 2 catches for 32 yards.    As for the Steeler wideouts, Emmanuel Sanders actually outgained Brown, catching 7 balls for 88 yards and Roethlisberger's only touchdown. "

Jason Campbell was actually injured twice in this contest. He left the game briefly in the first half, but was ultimately knocked out on a fierce hit in the third quarter.

Bell did most of his damage as a receiver, as he had trouble finding running lanes behind an offensive line that was missing its second-string center and saw both tackles, Kelvin Beachum and Marcus Gilbert, suffer injuries. Bell managed just 57 yards on 24 carries, though he did make up for it with a touchdown.    Both Steeler tackles got hurt, but the Bengals sustained way more injuries. James Harrison (making his first return to Pittsburgh), Jermaine Gresham, Dre Kirkpatrick and even punter Kevin Huber left the game with various maladies.    Andy Dalton played poorly for most of this contest. He may have finished 25-of-44 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, but most of that came in garbage time. Just as Roethlisberger completed his 12th-consecutive pass to open the game, Dalton was a pathetic 2-of-10 for 15 yards. He was under tremendous pressure all evening, taking 8 sacks. Dalton's scores went to Marvin Jones (5-48), who had a drop, and Tyler Eifert (3-33). A.J. Green didn't find the end zone, but he snagged 9 catches for 93 yards. Ike Taylor, who has been torched by nearly everyone this year, inexplicably did a good job covering Green. Taylor also played well against Green in their Week 2 tilt.    Giovani Bernard handled most of the workload, but mustered just 33 yards on 13 carries. Bernard at least scored a touchdown. BenJarvus Green-Ellis, meanwhile, had just 4 yards on 4 carries. He spent most of the game standing on the sideline.    I mentioned earlier that the Steelers outplayed the Bengals in every facet. This includes special teams. In the first quarter, the Bengals botched a punt as the wind blew away a snap heading toward Huber, who picked up the ball and was tackled at his own 1-yard line. Later on, Brown returned a punt for a touchdown. Huber suffered a crushing hit after that, so he had to leave the game with a jaw injury. Kicker "

As I noted in the Giants-Redskins capsule, Brown became the second player (Browns, though perhaps both Baltimore and Miami would've pulled through had they enjoyed the luxury of battling this inept Cleveland squad. Still though, it's a shame the Chiefs couldn't be victorious against the lackluster Chargers to help Pittsburgh clinch the final spot in the conference. Despite the victory, Ben Roethlisberger did not play well. He went 19-of-31 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He also fumbled, but was lucky enough to recover it. The rain definitely played a factor, as he didn't seem to have complete control of the football on his first interception.

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, returning a punt, jumped in the air and karate kicked Cleveland's punter in the head on what turned out to be a big gain that set up an eventual touchdown. The score put the Steelers up 27-3 in a game that was completely dominated by Pittsburgh. The Browns, who look like the worst team in the NFL, were absolutely humiliated. </i> I guess the Steelers simulated to their Thursday night game because Cleveland were just as dominant in the second half as Pittsburgh was in the first. The Steelers were completely gassed defensively, as they had no answer for Brian Hoyer. The Cleveland quarterback couldn't do anything to open the game. He was 4-of-11 for 57 yards by the break, and I wondered if Mike Pettine would bench him in favor of Johnny Manziel. However, Hoyer was 15-of-20 for 173 yards the rest of the way, ultimately finishing 19-of-31 for 230 yards and a touchdown. Hoyer did have a dropped interception by Ike Taylor, but the Steelers otherwise were helpless to stop him, as he constantly moved the chains. There were some exceptions - rookie linebacker Ryan Shazier had a great afternoon - but it's a very dubious sign that most of the Pittsburgh defenders were so exhausted by the end of the game. It's not a good sign going forward, especially with a game coming up on Thursday.    You might be wondering whom Hoyer threw to, considering that his receiving corps is so depleted. Jordan Cameron, the only prominent name, caught only 2 balls for 47 yards, though he would've scored a touchdown in the first half if he didn't stumble over his own 2 feet. Cameron left the game in the third quarter because he aggravated his AC joint. Andrew Hawkins actually dominated the targets and receptions. He saw 10 balls thrown his way, and he snagged 8 of them for 87 yards. No other Brown recorded more than 2 catches.    While Hawkins is worth an add, the No. 1 player who should be picked up in Week 1 is rookie running back Terrance West. Ben Tate was running well early - 6 carries, 41 yards - but he hurt his knee and left the game. Shocker. West took over and was dominant, tallying 100 yards on just 16 carries. He has lots of talent, so he needs to be added in all formats.    Ben Roethlisberger had a great stat line - 23-of-34, 365 yards, touchdown and an interception - but those numbers are slightly misleading because some of Roethlisberger's big, first-half gains came on screens. For instance, an Antonio Brown 41-yarder on the opening drive came on a slip screen. Roethlisberger also struggled in the second half, going just 7-of-12 for 87 yards following intermission. Having said that, Roethlisberger made several great plays to lead his team to victory, which was capped off by a game-winning drive at the very end when Cleveland had all of the momentum. What stood out most was when he escaped out of 2 potential sacks and found Brown in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. It should be noted that part of the reason Roethlisberger struggled after the break was because the offensive line couldn't block Cleveland at all.    Brown paced the Steelers in receiving yardage with 116 on 5 catches. "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown conversion on third-and-14. Unfortunately, Brown took a big hit on that play, and he had to leave the field temporarily to get tested for a concussion. While gone, backup wideout Justin Brown lost a fumble in the red zone. Pittsburgh's offense and defense took turns screwing up. The Ravens were able to score on the ensuing drive, thanks to a Cortez Allen pass interference on Torrey Smith inside the 5-yard line. Darrius Heyward-Bey - yes, he's still in the league - then held on a big gain on an end-round by Markus Wheaton. Roethlisberger followed that up by throwing way behind Justin Brown on a third down, which would've been a big play because Brown was wide open. The Steelers had multiple chances to get back into the game in the second half, but committed way too many personal foul penalties. One was bogus, but the infractions allowed the Ravens to register touchdowns, allowing them to put this contest away. The scores were to Owen Daniels, who was wide open on both occasions, thanks to blown coverages. You'd think Pittsburgh would've learned the second time, but its defense is so anemic that it can't really do anything correctly. The nail in the coffin was a Heath Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated. Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with Bernard Pierce and Justin Forsett in the first half, but Pierce ended up with way more carries. Pierce gained 96 yards on 22 attempts, while Forsett managed 56 yards on just 8 tries. Most of Forsett's yardage came on 1 41-yard burst when the game was out of hand. Forsett appeared to land in the end zone, but was ruled inches short. John Harbaugh considered challenging, but opted against it. Forsett was a bigger factor in the passing game - 4 catches, 16 receiving yards - but it was disappointing to see Pierce utilized much more. It should be noted that Pierce (1 catch, 7 rec. yards) also dropped a pass.    As for the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 22-of-37 for 217 yards and a garbage-time interception off a tip by Haloti Ngata. The Ravens were able to put considerable pressure on him, which was a bit of a surprise because Andy Dalton was hit only once last week. It's not nearly all Roethlisberger's fault, but the Steelers have just 9 points in their previous 6 quarters. That's just awful. Roethlisberger targeted Antonio Brown more than anyone despite the fact that the speedy wideout missed about a quarter of action. Brown hauled in 7 balls for 90 yards. Wheaton (5-38) and Miller (4-35) also contributed.    The only Steeler offensive player who played a great full game was Brown conversion on third-and-14. Unfortunately, Brown took a big hit on that play, and he had to leave the field temporarily to get tested for a concussion. While gone, backup wideout "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown downfield. He hit his hand on a helmet on the throw, and he just wasn't the same after that. It was evident when he had to give the ball to Le'Veon Bell with his opposite hand. Roethlisberger's passes weren't even close. He overthrew Bell. He was almost pick-sixed by Patrick Robinson. He flung an interception on a deep shot toward the end zone. He was nearly picked on another high attempt. In the second half, he missed an open Heath Miller for a touchdown and then made a terrible decision to throw late across his body for another near-interception, and he was picked off on a second occasion when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on Drew Brees that allowed the Saints to keep a drive alive. Give the Saints credit for taking advantage of the Steelers' injuries and errors. They didn't have a promising start though, as Marques Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson. Despite all of that, New Orleans snapped out of its funk, and Brees was able to torch Pittsburgh's sorry secondary by going 19-of-27 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns.    All of Brees' touchdowns went to different players, with Stills (5-162) leading the team in receiving. Stills' score was a 69-yarder in which he beat Ike Taylor, who was making his return from injury, with a double move. Marques Colston (3-16), Nick Toon, Ben Watson and Erik Lorig all found the end zone, with the former atoning for 2 drops. Jimmy Graham inexplicably didn't draw a single target. He didn't get hurt; the Steelers just made sure he wouldn't beat them, double- and triple-teaming him on every single play.    The Steelers couldn't stop the run at all. Mark Ingram made up for a couple of poor outings by gashing Pittsburgh for 122 yards on 23 carries.    Some random notes for the Steelers: - Le'Veon Bell was outgained on the ground by Ingram - 21 carries, 95 rushing yards, 1 touchdown - but he atoned for it by catching 8 balls for a whopping 159 receiving yards. With Roethlisberger limited, he had no choice but to dump the ball off to Bell. - Antonio Brown scored twice, though both touchdowns came in garbage time. He finished with 8 receptions for 97 yards. - Heath Miler drew 14 targets. He snatched 8 of them for 82 yards. - Brett Kiesel is believed to have torn his tricep in this loss. He's done for the season if his Monday MRI confirms it.   Brown downfield. He hit his hand on a helmet on the throw, and he just wasn't the same after that.

The 1 potential dark cloud over this victory was that Roethlisberger injured his knee on his touchdown to Brown, but that may not be much of a big deal because he ran into the locker room to get treated. Roethlisberger was also nearly guilty of a fumble, but the call was turned into an incompletion after replay, though it appeared as though he indeed lost the ball.    I mentioned that Brown eventually reached the end zone. He tied Miller for the team in lead in receptions, barely outgaining the tight end, 72-68.

His pick occurred because of a miscommunication, but Roethlisberger made up for it with a 63-yard bomb to Brown with a few minutes remaining in regulation, which helped cover the spread. It appeared as though Pittsburgh was trying its hardest to beat the number, as Tomlin was unusually aggressive at the end of the contest, even trying an unnecessary fake punt that was intercepted. Roethlisberger finished 24-of-38 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He would've had an even bigger day if it wasn't for those drops. Roethlisberger had a clean pocket for most of the night, as the Cincinnati pass rush was a big disappointment.    Brown once again had a monstrous game, catching seen balls for 128 yards and a touchdown. He nearly had another score, but Roethlisberger missed him in the end zone. It seemed like he and Big Ben had trouble getting in rhythm early on, but the 63-yard score to clinch the cover made things right. "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown managed to jump on the ball and keep the possession alive. Harris (9-25) saw most of the workload after that, but save for 1 8.yard burst, he didn't do much with his opportunities.    Roethlisberger, meanwhile, had a mixed outing. He finished 31-of-45 for 334 yards and a touchdown, but also threw 2 interceptions. He was under pressure more than he's used to, and he made some nice plays, including 1 in which he muscled out of sack and found Heath Miller (6-76) for a big gain on third-and-10. However, Roethlisberger was brought down 5 times, and 1 Baltimore defender was able to hit him as he was releasing the ball, which resulted in a tipped pick by Suggs, who somehow caught the ball in between his legs. On the very next Pittsburgh drive, Suggs forced a hold that nullified a Roethlisberger touchdown to Dri Archer. Roethlisberger appeared to be concussed late in the 4.h quarter when he took a big hit, and he had to miss a few plays. Mike Tomlin put him back in, which I thought was a big mistake. Roethlisberger naturally threw an interception on the first play. Miller, meanwhile, also got knocked out with a head injury. Like Roethlisberger, he reentered the game and made an error, losing a fumble. The game was pretty much decided at that point, but Tomlin shouldn't have risked the longevity of 2 of his key players, especially considering the game was in doubt.    Antonio Brown was his usual dominant self, catching 9 of 14 targets for 117 yards. He picked up an early first down with a great spin move on Lardarius Webb. He also appeared to score a 45-yard touchdown, but the replay review showed that he was down inches short of the goal line. That wasn't the first time Brown just missed out on a score; he hauled in a Roethlisberger pass in the second quarter, but was pushed out and could get only 1 foot inbounds. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Brown managed to jump on the ball and keep the possession alive.

He might have done a bit more if Jones would have been at the helm, but more than anything, Brown needs Ben Roethlisberger back - and soon.    Brown's fumble, yet it wasn't called. Martavis Bryant was out of bounds before the second foot landed in the end zone, yet the play was never reviewed. Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal. It's not a matter of whether or not this game was fixed; it's only a question of who happened to pay off Hochuli. </i>    Bruce Arians' homecoming looked like it would be an inevitable win, even though the Cardinals' offense wasn't getting into the end zone, because Mike Vick was so unbelievably bad. At halftime, the Steelers had totaled just 59 yards, while the Cardinals had 279, but astonishingly, the score was 10-3 Cardinals (Editor's Note: Read the previous editor's note to understand why).    Carson Palmer and company were moving the ball with ease through the air, and he and Michael Floyd connected in the first quarter for a 3-yard touchdown. But that was the only touchdown Arizona would score all day. Floyd was called for offensive pass interference, which wiped away what would have been his second touchdown. The Steelers' defense played the epitome of bend, but don't break defense, picking Palmer off twice and stopping the Cardinals on 58 percent of third downs.    Palmer was not his usual, accurate self and relied on some big receptions from his receivers, especially John Brown, who continues to show his immense ability. Brown made catches all over the field on his way to a big day, finishing with 10 receptions on 14 targets for 198 yards. All 3 were career highs for him. The only blemish, and it was an ugly 1. was a fumble which set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Steelers.    Vick was stuck on negative passing yards for most of the first half, and by the time he left in the third quarter, he was 3-for-8 for 6 yards. He ended up leaving due to a hamstring strain or possibly was just benched for Oklahoma Sooners product "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown. Peterson coupled with Vick for over a half, led to Brown having his third down game in a row. He might have done a bit more if Jones would have been at the helm, but more than anything, Brown needs Ben Roethlisberger back - and soon.    Brown's fumble, yet it wasn't called. Martavis Bryant was out of bounds before the second foot landed in the end zone, yet the play was never reviewed. Carson Palmer was hit late, yet no roughing-the-passer was called. A defensive pass interference on Pittsburgh was nullified mysteriously. There were other shady things going on, but I'm getting tired of typing. It was unreal.

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Antonio Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.    After that initial drive, this game was a defensive struggle, with interceptions and field goals dominating until the 4.h quarter. Andy Dalton had his worst game of the season, completing 23-of-38 passes (60.5 percent) for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.    The only real connection Dalton was on target with all game was A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, DeAngelo Williams took over and had some nice numbers, rushing 9 times for 71 yards, including a 55-yard run that Panthers fans would recognize. He also caught 4 passes for 39 yards. If Bell is out for a while, Williams should be a capable backup, especially with the Steelers' usually good passing game.    The leading target for the Steelers this week wasn't Antonio Brown, but tight end Heath Miller, who had zero receptions last week for the first time since 2007.Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.

There was inkling at that point, that Brown could make a push for Marvin Harrison's reception record, which Brown was 20 behind coming into the game.

Brown, by the way, was down on the ground for a while, and he appeared to sustain a concussion. That will be important going forward, but this game was still in doubt because the Steelers would have to try a 50-yard kick. That changed when the Bengals were flagged for yet another personal foul for pushing an official. The thing is, Pittsburgh assistant coach Joey Porter ran onto the field. How he wasn't penalized for this was mystifying, to say the least. There should have been offsetting penalties. The officiating in this game was completely 1.sided and horrible. It's absolutely embarrassing for the NFL that they had John Parry, who had no control of the previous Pittsburgh-Cincinnati meeting, officiate this particular matchup again. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. At any rate, Chris Boswell drilled a 35-yard field goal to end the game. Steelers win, 18-16. Can't wait for Broadway's version. Epilogue: - I'm going to use the epilogue to post some stats. Roethlisberger went 18-of-31 for 229 yards and a touchdown. It's unclear how healthy he is, but Roethlisberger has an extensive history of playing well when hurt. - Speaking of injured players, Antonio Brown snatched 7 balls for 119 yards. He's questionable at best heading into next week's game in Denver. Bryant (5-29) caught Roethlisberger's sole score. - Replacing Brown's helmet.

I bring up these nice throws because I have rarely seen Landry Jones put more than 1 good throw together on a drive. If you had Brown on your fantasy team last season, you knew that he was toast if Jones was in there, but amazingly, Brown pulled down 7-of-11 passes for 106 yards and added a 13-yard rush. Of course, Brown still hasn't caught a touchdown pass from anyone other than Roethlisberger, but this was a great step forward for Jones. Unfortunately for the Steelers, the Patriots had on their big-boy pants and didn't have nearly as much trouble getting into the end zone as the Steelers, who continually settled for field goals or field goal attempts.    The Patriots did let the Steelers get within 1.point, as the game was 14-13 midway through the third quarter, but 2 strong runs by Blount picked up 36 yards and then Brady hit "

Oh, and another missed conversion. Prescott used his 42 seconds well, but the play that set up the game-winning play was a facemask that pushed the Cowboys within Dan Bailey's field goal range. But, the Cowboys wouldn't need that field goal, because Ezekiel Elliott would finish off the day with a 32-yard burst up the middle for the game-winning touchdown and his third touchdown of the day.    Elliott finished the day with 114 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries while adding 2 catches for 95 yards and a touchdown on 2 targets. He's now eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards on the year and has 10 total touchdowns through 9 games. He's your rookie of the year unless things go south fast.    The Cowboys are rolling. They've now won their last 8 games after losing their season opener, and they should be favored in every game going forward. Oh, and they have an extremely good backup quarterback if their hot rookie is hurt or forgets how to play football.    The Steelers aren't doing nearly as well, as they now have a losing record at 4-5. Fortunately for them, they also are only 1 game back of Baltimore for the division lead. Add in the facts that the Ravens play the Cowboys next week and the Steelers take on the winless Browns, and there's a decent shot the Steelers are feeling better about their long-term chances by this time next week.

Starting from their own 9-yard line, Roethlisberger keyed in on Antonio Brown, who caught 3 consecutive passes for 80 yards, setting up a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jesse James to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead heading into halftime.Browns quarterback Seneca Wallace was the original back-door bandit, so perhaps Cleveland's coaching staff can develop Kizer into becoming Back-Door Bandit 2.0. That would be pretty cool for the Browns, who would finally have something to cheer for. On a more serious note, we'll see if "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown was the receiver to draw that pass interference, but he was held in check for much of the game by Rhodes. Brown saw 11 targets, catching 5 for 62 yards; a thoroughly un-Brown-y stat line. That focus on Brown did help Bryant, who ended up with only 4 targets, but caught 3 for 91 yards and a touchdown. He also got a 51-yard pass interference call on his defender late in the game.    For Bryant, this must have been a satisfying game, as he was suspended all last season and was held in check in Week 1 against the Browns. He no doubt adds a dimension to this Steelers' offense that they were missing last season.    Minnesota rookie running back "

   "comment":"Antonio Brown had his worst statistical game, as he caught just 4-of-9 targets for 34 yards. The Ravens weren't going to let Brown beat them, so it all turned to Bell as the offense took the easier road. Brown has had trouble in Baltimore just like the whole team, so this isn't a shocking result. He'll continue to pace the league in yards and receptions.    Baltimore's top receiver was Mike Wallace, who led the team in targets, receptions and yards to go along with his touchdown. He also dropped what would have been a long touchdown pass. Not much went right for Baltimore this week.    Next week, the Ravens will head to Oakland, where they should have a bit more luck offensively, but we can't count on that with the way Flacco has played of late. The Steelers will take on another tough defense as they host the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they will be home, where they usually play much better. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

That made the stat line look nice, but there were 9 missed opportunities, 2 of which were tipped and returned for touchdowns in the third quarter. The third quarter also had the Steelers ahead 9-7 before those 2 pick-sixes occurred.    The Steelers have always gone as Roethlisberger goes, and now he's playing some of his worst football. They will need to take a look at limiting him, as a more conservative approach would have likely won this game. They will head to Kansas City next week, which, with the way they look right now, doesn't feel like a place they can win. The Jaguars, on the other hand, have now beaten the Texans, Ravens and Steelers rather easily, with great defensive play and strong running by their rookie running back. It looks as though it still is possible to hide your quarterback and win games in today's NFL, and Jacksonville will keep trying to do just that next week at home against the Rams.   "
