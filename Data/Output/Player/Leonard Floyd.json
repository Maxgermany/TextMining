   "comment":"Leonard Floyd's blind-side pressure and was strip-sacked. The ball trickled into the end zone, and the Bears recovered the touchdown, giving them the lead. Lambeau Field was completely quiet at that point, as the Packer supporters were stunned. Moments later, Rodgers drove down the field and helped get the team into the end zone with some clutch third-down conversions. Rodgers did the same thing on the next couple of possessions, and before anyone knew it, the Packers were up 16. Rodgers finished 39-of-556 for 326 yards and 3 touchdowns. The stats look great, and everyone on NFL Network and CBS will tell you that there's nothing wrong with Rodgers. There definitely is something wrong, however. The Rodgers of old would've thrown for at least 450 yards on 56 attempts, and he wouldn't have missed so many throws. His receivers were covered tightly for the most part, but Rodgers has always been able to hit them on impressive back-shoulder throws. That's still happening on occasion, but it's not nearly as consistent as it once was.    Rodgers' 3 star receivers were Davante Adams, Randall Cobb and Ty Montgomery, as Jordy Nelson did nothing. Adams caught a ridiculous 13 passes for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is remarkable because he wasn't even expected to play, given that he was going through concussion protocol on a short work week. Cobb snatched 11 balls for 95 yards and a late score, though he dropped an early touchdown on the opening drive. Montgomery, meanwhile, played running back, yet was still able to catch 10 passes for 66 yards. He also rushed for 60 yards on 9 carries. The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy. As for Nelson, it's clear that he's not 100 percent. Tracy Porter had coverage on Nelson, yet the wideout couldn't get open. Nelson would've laughed at Porter in the past, but he can't get open now. Nelson was limited to just 1 catch for 9 yards.    As for the Bears, you have to feel for Brian Hoyer. The former Texan had been playing relatively well for his new team, but he broke his arm in the second quarter after falling hard on his shoulder. Hoyer wasn't playing that well (4-of-11, 49 yards), missing an open Josh Bellamy for a long touchdown on the second drive. However, he was light years better than Matt Barkley, who was a disaster. Barkley went 6-of-15 for 81 yards and 2 interceptions. The first pick was a tipped pass by Morgan Burnett into the arms of rookie linebacker Blake Martinez. The second interception occurred when the ball popped into the air as Barkley was hit. Barkley would be a horrible option as a starter, but Jay Cutler could be back in Week 8.    With Barkley under center for more than half the game, none of Chicago's play-makers could post significant numbers. Zach Miller (2-40), Alshon Jeffery (3-33) and Cameron Meredith (1-12) were all silenced.    The 1 major surprise on Chicago's side was what happened at running back. Rookie Jordan Howard, who has dazzled in relief of Jeremy Langford, didn't have as many carries as Ka'Deem Carey. Both running backs had half of their yardage come on their longest burst. Howard (7-22) had a gain of 11, while Carey (10-48) made a burst of 24. I wouldn't cut Howard in fantasy just yet, though the declining usage is worrisome.    The silver lining for Chicago is that Leonard Floyd was terrific. The first-round rookie put together a strong performance, as he was a nuisance for Rodgers all evening. Floyd registered 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss Phil Simms and some of the strange things he said during the telecast. Simms opened the evening by saying that the Packers, due to a lack of their running game, were going to get the ball to Aaron Rodgers. Am I missing something, or were the Packers just planning on direct snapping to their running backs? What does he mean by getting the ball to Rodgers? Doesn't Rodgers always have the ball? Perhaps even more confusing, there was this: He was trying to go across the middle and it was not a person. If anyone can decipher what the hell that possibly means, you should probably be hired by the government as someone who can decript alien languages. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
