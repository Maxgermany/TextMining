   "comment":"Mike Sellers. Sellers scored, but the call was overturned, as the officials said Sellers stalled just short of the end zone. On the next play, Zorn ran Sellers again, who fumbled into the end zone. Congratulations, Zorn! You're now in a class with Brad Clueless as coaches who refuse to give the ball to your best player. At 7-7, Washington is pretty much done after such a promising start.    Speaking of Portis, he rushed for 77 yards on 25 carries. One has to wonder if he didn't get those all-important goal-line carries because of his feud with Zorn during the week. If Zorn wanted to penalize Portis by not giving him a touchdown as revenge for his comments, Zorn is a complete idiot.    Sellers.
