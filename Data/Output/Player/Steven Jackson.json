Give credit to Buffalo's defense though. After gaining 99 yards on 16 carries in the first half, Jackson managed only 11 yards on 8 attempts in the final 30 minutes. That allowed the Bills to overcome an odd 14-6 deficit and establish control of the game.    It also shocked me that "

   "comment":"Jackson in the second quarter.    The Rams had the last laugh though, somehow pulling the upset on the road despite the fact that Washington was the largest favorite this week. St. Louis' 19-17 victory was very inexplicable, especially considering that the team failed to score an offensive touchdown. The only time the Rams reached the end zone was on a 75-yard O.J. Atogwe fumble recovery on a Jason Campbell tipped pass that landed in the arms of offensive lineman Pete Kendall. Instead of falling on the ground, Kendall started running and was subsequently stripped.    No overly impressive numbers from anyone on St. Louis' offense, though Donnie Avery had 4 catches and 73 yards, including a great, 1.handed, 43-yard grab that set the Rams up for their winning field goal. Torry Holt had 5 catches for 23 yards. Jackson finished with 79 yards on 22 carries. Bulger was 15-of-26 for 136 yards.    Entering this game, the Redskins' offense had no turnovers on the season, which would explain their impressive and unexpected 4-1 record. Well, they had 3 on Sunday, which would explain this loss. This was a tough spot for Washington, coming off 2 consecutive divisional victories on the road. I can't really blame them for being unfocused. That said, there's no excuse for losing to the awful Rams. I thought this game would be close, but allowing Jim Haslett, a makeshift offensive line, a crippled Bulger and a Swiss cheese defense to beat you is inexcusable.    "

Jackson helped St. Louis win the time-of-possession battle, and allowed the team to convert 7-of-14 third downs. As a comparison, the Dolphins were 4-of-12 on third down.

   "comment":"Jacksonville dominated this game, out-gaining St. Louis 492-262, and beat them in terms of accumulating first downs, 33-13. The Jaguars were also 11-of-16 on third down. So, what happened? Why was this decided in overtime? Well, the Jaguars had 3 turnovers, all of which were huge. Maurice Jones-Drew fumbled at the Rams 19. David Garrard's first interception was tipped and picked off by James Laurinaitis inside the Rams 15. Garrard's second pick was a weird play where Leonard Little caught an attempted screen and was able to return it for a touchdown. Jacksonville should have won this contest by double digits.    Aside from the 2 interceptions, Garrard played very well, going 30-of-43 for 335 yards. And take away the costly fumble, and you'll see that Maurice Jones-Drew dominated this contest, rushing for 133 yards and 3 touchdowns on 33 carries. Drew-Jones also chipped in with 5 grabs for 45 more yards.    Both "

It's clear that the Saints really miss stud defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis. They'll continue to struggle versus the run until he returns.    While the Rams played well throughout this contest, their final 2-minute drive was very amusing. Bulger was horrible, hitting Saints defenders in the back, throwing short passes over the middle with no timeouts and wasting tons of time in other situations. Bulger basically had to go 80 yards with 2:21 in regulation and no timeouts. Despite that dilemma, Bulger had completions of just 7, 6, 9, 11, 4 and 5 yards.

Instead, they lost, and Bradford didn't look much better than Adam Joshua Feeley did the past 2 weeks; the second-year signal-caller had several overthrows in this contest. Bradford finished 23-of-36 for 255 yards and an interception. He showed an OK rapport with Brandon Lloyd, who hauled in 5 grabs for 80 yards. Lloyd drew a key pass interference at the end of regulation to set up what should have been a Josh Brown game-winning field goal. However, Calais Campbell blocked the kick, which would eventually allow Patrick Peterson to return yet another punt for a touchdown for what would be the decisive score.    Jackson, as mentioned, performed pretty well. He had 130 yards on 29 carries. Chris Wells, meanwhile, had just 20 yards on 10 attempts. The Rams were ranked 31st against the rush going into the contest, but the Rams were selling out against the run because they didn't respect Skelton.

The Rams had just 185 total yards of offense.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a score. He and Bradford have only had about 7 practices together, so that chemistry will continue to improve. But that won't matter as long as Bradford is poorly protected in the pocket; he was sacked 5 times in this contest, thanks to the plethora of injuries to the tackle position. Chris Clemons had 3 of those sacks with 2 forced fumbles.    This was a pretty mixed performance for Tarvaris Jackson. He maneuvered pretty well around the pocket and was able to avoid St. Louis' pass rushers effectively at times. At other times, however, he was really reckless and took big losses on sacks. Jackson finished 14-of-24 for 148 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Ironically, top receiver "

San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs. Then Alex Smith dropped a 52-yard bomb to Crabtree for a touchdown and the 16-0 lead. If St. Louis had any hope, it was extinguished right there. San Francisco overcame a penalty to open their next drive and ended up with a field goal to extend its advantage, leaving it 19-0 at the end of the third quarter. At the start of the 4.h quarter, Alex Smith hit Kyle Williams who did all the work for a 56-yard touchdown to make the final margin 26-0. It was another ho-hum day for Smith (17-of-23, 274 yards, 2 TDs), although he was sacked 4 times. Gore was contained (21 rushes for 73 yards) and a lot of the rushing yardage for San Francisco came on gimmick plays to receiving threats who picked up 55 yards on 3 attempts. Most importantly, the 49ers did not turn the ball over and played smothering defense. The Rams' running back Steven Jackson and his backup, Jerious Norwood, each had just 19 yards rushing on a combined 21 attempts for a 1."

   "comment":"Jackson (16-76) picked up 20 yards on 3 straight carries to put St. Louis in the red zone. Two plays later, the Rams were forced to third down, and with Clemens scrambling out of trouble, it looked like a field goal attempt was coming due. That is, until he kept running towards the end zone for the 7-0 lead and rare rushing score against this 49ers' defense. Both offenses followed with 3.and-outs, but the field position exchange went heavily in favor of San Francisco, which got a huge 66-yard punt out of Andy Lee and wound up starting from the St. Louis 33-yard line. Unlike a lot of occurrences this season, the 49ers actually finished the drive. Alex Smith (21-of-31, 219 yards, TD) completed a couple of short passes and ran for the tying touchdown as the first quarter came to a close. The Rams repeatedly started drives at their own 20-yard line or worse field position (8 times to be exact) but on this possession, worked out of it with a 19-yard pass to rookie tight end Lance Kendricks. However, after 2 Jackson runs created a third-down situation, Clemens was intercepted by Tarrell Brown. Smith wasted no time finishing this second-consecutive drive and putting San Francisco on top, completing 2 passes to "

The officials whistled him for a personal-foul penalty. Making matters worse, they didn't give him the score, and they didn't let Jeff Fisher challenge for some strange reason. It was so bizarre, and Roger Goodell needs to be embarrassed that he's allowing these shenanigans to continue. - The Rams ran a promotion called Jeff Fisher Mustache Day, where they handed out fake mustaches to the 50 people who went to the game. Fisher was asked about this, but responded, Can we talk about football, please?    Despite all of the ineptness, both quarterbacks played really well. "

   "comment":"Jackson (19-81) touchdown run.  - A few plays after St. Louis' touchdown that opened the third quarter, Freeman dialed up the Rams up for points with an interception to Trumaine Johnson. Bradford tossed a short touchdown pass to Austin Pettis. Those 21 points off of turnovers were the difference in the game.    Offensively, St. Louis got what it needed on the first play of the third quarter when Tampa Bay was caught in busted coverage. Tight end Lance Kendricks (4-119) was wide open and was hit in stride by Bradford. Danny Amendola (2-5) got 2 great blocks downfield to spring Kendricks for an 80-yard touchdown. Other than that play, the Bucs' defense shut down Bradford and the Rams' offense in the final 2 quarters. Bradford finished 13-of-27 for 196 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.    Freeman hit a 61-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams after some missed tackles and angles from the St. Louis secondary. That play got Freeman back on track as he had a good drive with Williams (7-132) to move the ball to the 5-yard line. On 4.h-and-1, down 28-13 late in the third, the Bucs went for it and were stuffed short by Michael Brockers. A 50-yard pass to Vincent Jackson (7-108) set up the Bucs inside the Rams' 5-yard line, but once again the defense made a stop on 4.h-and-goal to take away points from Tampa Bay. Freeman's 4.h interception came after Brockers batted a pass and "

All he was able to do was catch an 8.yard touchdown and carry the ball 3 times for no yards. Despite missing 2 key weapons, Matt Ryan was still unstoppable. He misfired on just 10 attempts, going 33-of-43 for 373 yards and 2 touchdowns despite having tons of pressure in his face. Ryan heavily favored Julio Jones, who hauled in 11 passes for 182 yards, including an 81-yarder in the first quarter, beating Janoris Jenkins, to give Atlanta a 14-0 lead. The Falcons, who were up 24-3 at the half, nearly blew this contest because they had trouble running the ball and consequently couldn't bleed the clock out. Jacquizz Rodgers proved to be a poor substitute for Jackson, managing just 17 yards on 11 attempts. Once the Rams drew to within 7 in the 4.h quarter, Ryan had to start throwing again - and the Rams had no answer for him.    Other Atlanta stats: "

   "comment":"Jackson, meanwhile, found the end zone twice with his 42 rushing yards (11 carries) and 36 receiving yards (4 catches).    E.J. Manuel had a decent performance, though it probably should have been better considering his opponent. He went 18-of-32 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Manuel appeared to suffer an injury in the first half on a play that saw Atlanta commit a roughing-the-passer penalty, but he obviously remained in the game.    I mentioned Johnson and Chandler as the 2 players who helped ruin a potential victory. They happened to lead the team in receiving; Johnson had 5 catches for 55 yards, while Chandler's 4 receptions went for 63 yards.    The Falcons struggled to move the chains early, mustering just 189 net yards of offense in the first half compared to 234 afterward. Matt Ryan went 28-of-47 for 311 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble despite a slow start. Ryan also had to deal with a ridiculous amount of pressure, as his offensive line struggled to protect against the Bills, who notched 6 sacks. Hughes was responsible for a pair. Ryan's score went to Tony Gonzalez (4-42), who logged 3 of his 4 receptions following intermission. Roddy White, meanwhile, led the Falcons with 10 catches for 143 yards.    Harry Douglas collected 6 receptions for 73 yards. Douglas drew that pass interference on Roby to set up Atlanta's tying touchdown, though again, there shouldn't have been a call.    Steven Jackson showed some rare life against the Bills. He still looked a bit slow, but he pummeled his way for 84 yards and 2 touchdown on 23 carries.   "

   "comment":"Jackson. Stafford's scores went to Riddick and Golden Tate, both of whom had huge outings. Tate reeled in 7 of 15 targets for 151 yards and his touchdown, which was a 59-yard bomb on third-and-long, while Riddick had 8 grabs for 74 receiving yards. He didn't run very much - 3 carries, 5 rushing yards - but he did a good job of replacing Bush as the pass-catching back.    Detroit had a rough time running the ball despite battling a struggling Atlanta defense. Joique Bell managed just 39 yards on 14 carries. He also nearly lost a fumble when he didn't expect to get an attempt. Bell has been a huge disappointment, as Megatron's absence allowed the Falcons to put 8 men in the box.    Going into this affair, many wondered how the Falcons would protect Matt Ryan against Detroit's ferocious pass rush. They did so quite easily, apparently. The Lions had absolutely no pass rush without blitzing early on. When they brought extra defenders, Ryan did a great job of releasing the ball quickly. He was absolutely flawless in the first half, and it was apparent he would be so effective when he found Roddy White on a tough third-and-8 on the opening drive. This ultimately led to a passing score to Devonta Freeman. By halftime, he was 14-of-17 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns. He heaved a pick-six toward Rashean Mathis, but the play was negated by defensive pass interference. Ryan, however, struggled following intermission. He was just 6-of-10 for 68 yards and an interception in the second half. The pick was terrible, as it sailed right to a Detroit defensive back with no Atlanta player in the area. Ryan finished 20-of-27 for 228 yards, 2 touchdowns and that interception. He saw much more pressure following the break. He also fumbled twice, but his linemen recovered both loose balls.    Roddy White also recovered a fumble, making fortunate Atlanta 3-of-3 on loose balls. White led the team with 5 grabs for 66 yards. Julio Jones (4-58) had a disappointing outing. His drop at the end of the game was an absolute killer.    The Lions strangely struggled against the run. Steven Jackson ran like it was 2006, gaining 60 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Detroit couldn't stop Jackson on Atlanta's final drive, which is why it was curious why the Falcons even attempted a pass.    Detroit suffered a potential serious injury in this contest. "

   "comment":"Jackson hit. Brady was nearly picked on a couple of other occassions, all of which was the result of Denver's incredible pressure. Manning, meanwhile, barely completed half of his passes, but he didn't really turn the ball over. He was better than Brady, but didn't play great. He missed some throws he could've made in his sleep 5 years ago, overthrowing a couple of his targets in the end zone for easy touchdowns. However, Manning did some nifty things, including a scramble for a first down when he somehow picked up 12 yards on a third-and-10 early in the second half.    Manning's touchdowns both went to Daniels, whose only catches were in the end zone. Daniels was just 1 of 2 Broncos to accumulate more than 20 receiving yards, with the other being Emmanuel Sanders (5-62), who made a ridiculous 34-yard reception over Malcolm Butler that brought Ward off the bench in celebration. Demaryius Thomas, meanwhile, made just 2 catches for 12 yards. He dropped a pass, of course.    It continues to be a mystery why the Broncos continue to waste downs giving Ronnie Hillman the ball. Hillman (11-16) was outgained by C.J. Anderson (16-72) by a wide margin once again. Hillman also lazily didn't try to pick up the ball on Manning's apparent backward pass.    As bad as Hillman was, I'm sure Belichick would've killed to have him on his roster, given how incompetent his running backs were. It was so bad that Brady was the Patriots' leading rusher with 13 yards on 3 scrambles. James White (5-11) caught 5 passes for 45 receiving yards, but was very inefficient, being targeted 16 times. Steven Jackson scored, but gained just 8 yards on 4 carries.    As for Brady's aerial targets, Gronkowski predictably led the way with 8 catches for 144 yards and a touchdown. However, most of his production came after Ward left the game, as he caught just 2 balls in the opening half. Julian Edelman (7-53) was next on the receiving list.    One final note: I think Belichick screwed up big time in the 4.h quarter. He eschewed 2 field goals, opting to go for it on a pair of 4.h downs. His offense failed on both occasions. Had he kicked the ball, the score would've been 20-18 when Gronkowski caught his initial 4.h-down pass on the final drive. A short field goal would have won the game, 21-20. The Patriots had 6 minutes and 3 timeouts remaining when Belichick eschewed his first kick, so there was still plenty of time.   "
