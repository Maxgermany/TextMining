That allowed the Bills to overcome an odd 14-6 deficit and establish control of the game.    It also shocked me that "

   "comment":"Steven Jackson once again was amazing. He rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries. He also caught a whopping 9 balls for 45 yards. It's clear that the Saints really miss stud defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis. They'll continue to struggle versus the run until he returns.    While the Rams played well throughout this contest, their final 2-minute drive was very amusing. Bulger was horrible, hitting Saints defenders in the back, throwing short passes over the middle with no timeouts and wasting tons of time in other situations. Bulger basically had to go 80 yards with 2:21 in regulation and no timeouts. Despite that dilemma, Bulger had completions of just 7, 6, 9, 11, 4 and 5 yards. Not exactly what you're looking for when you need a very quick score. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs. Then Alex Smith dropped a 52-yard bomb to Crabtree for a touchdown and the 16-0 lead. If St. Louis had any hope, it was extinguished right there. San Francisco overcame a penalty to open their next drive and ended up with a field goal to extend its advantage, leaving it 19-0 at the end of the third quarter. At the start of the 4.h quarter, Alex Smith hit Kyle Williams who did all the work for a 56-yard touchdown to make the final margin 26-0. It was another ho-hum day for Smith (17-of-23, 274 yards, 2 TDs), although he was sacked 4 times. Gore was contained (21 rushes for 73 yards) and a lot of the rushing yardage for San Francisco came on gimmick plays to receiving threats who picked up 55 yards on 3 attempts. Most importantly, the 49ers did not turn the ball over and played smothering defense. The Rams' running back Steven Jackson and his backup, Jerious Norwood, each had just 19 yards rushing on a combined 21 attempts for a 1."

That is, until he kept running towards the end zone for the 7-0 lead and rare rushing score against this 49ers' defense.

The officials whistled him for a personal-foul penalty. Making matters worse, they didn't give him the score, and they didn't let Jeff Fisher challenge for some strange reason. It was so bizarre, and Roger Goodell needs to be embarrassed that he's allowing these shenanigans to continue. - The Rams ran a promotion called Jeff Fisher Mustache Day, where they handed out fake mustaches to the 50 people who went to the game. Fisher was asked about this, but responded, Can we talk about football, please?    Despite all of the ineptness, both quarterbacks played really well. "
