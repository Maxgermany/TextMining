   "comment":"Braylon Edwards first-down conversion on third-and-12. This forced a Cleveland punt. On Denver's next possession, Edwards first-down conversion on third-and-12. This forced a Cleveland punt. On Denver's next possession, Jay Cutler hit Eddie Royal on a 93-yard bomb to Eddie Royal, thanks to completely inept coverage by completely inept corner Brandon McDonald. On Cleveland's next drive, Winslow once again did his best to ruin his team's chances of winning, fumbling on Denver's 38-yard line. Denver took over and scored another touchdown 8 plays later to take the lead, despite the fact that the Browns dropped about 4 would-be interceptions in the final quarter. After the teams exchanged touchdowns, Winslow let a ball sail right through his hands in Denver territory on 4.h-and-six. Game over. I really should stop handicapping Cleveland contests and just ask Edwards and Winslow whom they're betting on. Those 2 clowns have blown so many games this year, it's really disgusting. I'm convinced Winslow had the Browns -2 in the first half and the Broncos +3 for the game. There is no other explanation for his Jekyll-and-Hyde performance. Winslow, McDonald and the other drop-happy defensive backs weren't the only 1. trying to blow it for the Browns. Romeo Crennel did some ridiculously stupid things himself, including accepting a 10-yard penalty on the Broncos that brought up third down instead of 4.h down.    At any rate, tons of credit has to be given to Denver. Despite its multiple injuries, the Broncos won to improve to 5-4. Cutler was 24-of-42 for 447 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, though the Browns dropped about half-a-dozen sure-fire interceptions in this contest. Because he didn't have a running game by his side - Torain and "

With 1st-and-goal on the 6-yard line early in the game, the Browns eschewed running a regular offense and instead used a Wildcat formation twice. Those 2 plays gained a whopping 1 yard. With the Dolphins seemingly transitioning away from the Wildcat (read the Miami-Atlanta analysis), I find it funny that Eric Mangini is trying to use it as much as possible.

   "comment":"Braylon Edwards, giving Folk an easy kick.    Edwards, giving Folk an easy kick.    LaDainian Tomlinson looked great. He was exceptional at the beginning of the year, but appeared to wear down as the season went on. But he looked like the old LT at Indianapolis, rushing for 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries. Shonn Greene (19-70) was also effective.    Ryan's defense did a great job limiting Peyton Manning and his offense to 312 total yards. The Colts had just 1 big play, a 56-yard bomb to Pierre Garcon (5-112, TD), who beat Antonio Cromartie. Outside of that, Indianapolis moved the chains, but couldn't get into the end zone. Manning went 18-of-26 for 225 yards and a touchdown. He remarkably attempted just 1 pass inside the red zone, which was an incompletion to Jacob Tamme. Manning simply didn't have many options at his disposal; Darrelle Revis completely erased Reggie Wayne, who caught 1 ball for 1 measly yard.    The Colts ran the ball efficiently out of shotgun draws on third-and-long, as Joseph Addai (13-60) and Dominic Rhodes (14-33) each achieved an unexpected first down in that situation. Unfortunately for Indianapolis, the team went to the well 1 too many times. They failed on their final attempt, forcing to settle for a field goal. Speaking of a poor coaching decision, what was Jim Caldwell doing when he called a timeout with 29 seconds remaining in regulation amid a running clock? Instead of being forced into an unfavorable 50-yard field goal, the Jets were able to run another play - which is when Sanchez hit Edwards for 18 yards along the sideline. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Braylon Edwards along the way. Crabtree had a huge game (7 receptions for 120 yards) and abused rookie cornerback Patrick Peterson in the process. Edwards never did get his hands on a ball, apparently more troubled by the soaked conditions than his fellow receivers. At the end of the drive, David Akers, who was having a terrific season entering this game, got his field goal attempt blocked by Calais Campbell. The Cardinals' next drive ended quickly with Patrick Willis recording an interception on the second play, collecting the ball on a deflection from cornerback Tarrell Brown. The 49ers' offense did nothing and the field goal from 49 yards out was wide right. After forcing a quick punt, they finally got on the board, sparked by a 27-yard pass to Vernon Davis followed by a 14-yard run by Frank Gore. The back was not the punishing force he is when completely healthy and fresh, but did log 24 carries for 88 yards. When the lead was in hand, Anthony Dixon (7 carries for 32 yards) and rookie Kendall Hunter (11 carries for 27 yards) took over, allowing Gore to rest up on a short week for the Harbaugh Bowl. A short field goal from Akers capped the drive and made it 3-0. Yet another opportunity opened up for San Francisco to blow this game open in the first half when the first play by Arizona resulted in a fumble by Beanie Wells, who had just 8 carries for 33 yards. Arizona only ran the ball a total of 11 times, never holding the ball on sustained drives to get the running game in a rhythm against a stout defense. The field position resulted in just 3 points after Alex Smith threw behind Braylon Edwards on third down and Akers connected from 43 yards out. I got a good laugh when Brian Billick referred to him as Fred while making a golf analogy about him getting his swing back. Maybe he thought he was covering Fred Couples at the Masters. The Cardinals had another unsuccessful drive as the first quarter wrapped up, but the 49ers were having trouble putting them away. Smith missed Crabtree for what should have been an easy touchdown and Akers had another field goal blocked, this time by Peterson who did not make his presence felt otherwise on special teams because he only got his hands on a punt return twice. San Francisco quickly got the ball back and drove down the field yet again. This march was highlighted by wide receiver Edwards along the way. Crabtree had a huge game (7 receptions for 120 yards) and abused rookie cornerback Patrick Peterson in the process. Edwards never did get his hands on a ball, apparently more troubled by the soaked conditions than his fellow receivers. At the end of the drive, "

   "comment":"Braylon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the 4.h quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the 4.h quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Aldon Smith registered a sack to force a 3rd-and-15. Jackson almost bailed Seattle out, hitting Obomanu a yard short of the marker. Carroll resisted the urge to go for it against a stout defense and wisely chose to play field position. It looked like a bad decision when the punt went out of the end zone and Smith hit Davis for 17 yards on the first play of the drive. Just like that, all the Seahawks had gained from the kick was 8 yards of field position. However, the defense stood tall from there, forcing a punt that was blocked by Heath Farwell. Seattle took over at the 49ers' 4-yard line and Lynch delivered the first rushing touchdown of the season against San Francisco to put the Seahawks up 17-16. Suddenly trailing, the 49ers caught a break when Robinson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after hitting defenseless kickoff returner Kyle Williams. Set up at their own 39-yard line, everything was looking good for San Francisco, and then Edwards was flagged for pass interference to start the drive. However, 2 plays later, Smith (14-of-26, 179 yards) connected on a deep ball good for 41 yards to Michael Crabtree. It was a huge play for Smith, who did what he has all season - protect the football and not screw it up. A ready and able Seattle defense held tough on 3 consecutive rushing plays, including a straight run on 3rd-and-6 that didn't exactly ooze confidence in Smith's arm. Yet another field goal from Akers put the 49ers ahead, 19-17. It looked like the Seahawks would respond. Lynch alternated rushing and receiving on the next 4 plays for a total of 33 yards, putting them just past midfield with 1:07 to play. Then Tarvaris Jackson did what bad quarterbacks do in tough spots. On 3rd-and-3, he was trying to scramble for a first down and had the ball knocked out from behind by linebacker "
