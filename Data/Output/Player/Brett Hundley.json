   "comment":"Brett Hundley quarterbacked the Packers the rest of the way, and Green Bay didn't stand much of a chance with him. Hundley barely completed half of his passes, going 18-of-33 for only 157 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One of the picks was tipped, but Hundley simply didn't look like he should be an NFL starter. He didn't even appear as though he was ready to play at all, as he was flagged for a delay of game on a third down during his first full drive. Green Bay had to waste a timeout, only to see Hundley get picked off immediately afterward. Perhaps the Packers can do a good job of preparing him with a whole week of practice, but the early returns aren't promising.    With Rodgers gone, the Packer receivers had their stats suppressed. "
