   "comment":"Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary."
