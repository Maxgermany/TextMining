I'm sure you were all grateful to hear Bob Costas' public-service announcement during halftime. Costas, in his latest attempt to save the world, suggested that neither Jovan Belcher nor his girlfriend would have died had Belcher not owned a gun. Way to go, douche. Nice job using a tragedy to promote your own political agenda. @stevenlourie said it best: F*** you Bob Costas, you are not fit to talk about the Jovan Belcher situation, go back to sniffing your own farts.

The Cowboys are going to regret not being more balanced because they moved the chains well on the ground.    What hurt Dallas' chances for a come-from-behind victory - besides a shaky defense that couldn't get off the field - was a 4.h-quarter Williams lost fumble inside the red zone while he was trying to reach for the goal line. Williams was too far away from the end zone, so while the effort should be applauded, he needs better awareness; regardless of a field goal or a touchdown, the Cowboys would've drawn to within 1 score. Williams made 7 catches for 71 yards, filling in for the injured Miles Austin-Jones. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. "

The Cowboys couldn't run the ball in the second half, but that didn't have much of an impact on Romo because he was just 3-of-9 for 20 yards in the opening half. He simply had no success against the Saints' improved pass rush and aerial defense, as Ryan had a perfect game plan for his former quarterback.

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray was strip-sixed on the opening drive. Tony Romo then took over as the player who ruined Dallas' offense. Romo made some nice throws throughout the contest - he went 23-of-37 for 281 yards and a touchdown - but he was responsible for 3 interceptions, and he easily could've had several more. Romo's first pick was carelessly thrown in triple coverage. He then tossed a pick in the end zone. He had someone open, but threw the ball late. This ended up being a poor decision because he forced it in, and Patrick Willis easily snatched ball out of the air. Romo's final pick was also late, and he sailed it into double coverage. A potential 4.h pick was dropped by a San Francisco defensive back in the second half. Romo has been careless with the football before, but this was much different. He didn't seem like he was prepared for this game. He constantly made late throws and didn't appear to see the field clearly. Thus, I don't know if I can suggest if his second back procedure had to do with his poor performance. I'm sure it was somewhat of a factor, but Romo's issues seemed more mental than anything.    It didn't help Romo's cause that Dez Bryant missed some time on a couple of occasions. He took a big hit and had to briefly exit the contest during Romo's first pick. He came back but then had to leave again because of dehydration. Bryant ultimately finished with 4 catches for 55 yards.    Romo's sole score went to Terrance Williams, who saw a team-high 7 targets go his way. Williams hauled in 4 of those balls for 50 yards.    Thanks to a depleted front 7. DeMarco Murray ran well. He gained 118 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries, but he did have that aforementioned fumble returned for a score.    As mentioned earlier, San Francisco's offense clicked despite looking very sluggish in the preseason. "

Murray was successful on the ground, but he didn't dominate in that regard despite what the final stats may say, as the Bears are surprisingly not inept versus ground attacks. In fact, Murray became the first running back to gain 100-plus rushing yards versus Chicago this season. The Bears had Murray limited to less than a 4 yards-per-carry average - 22 attempts, 83 rush yards - before this game got out of hand in the third quarter. Murray was able to boost his stats by breaking free for a few big gains late in the evening, which is why he was able to finish with 179 yards and a touchdown. He would've posted even better numbers had he not taken a strange loss of 14 yards in the final quarter.    As for Romo, he misfired on an early, high throw to "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray and was flagged. Instead of punting, the Cowboys were able to score a touchdown a few plays later. On the Colts' initial possession, the team went 3.and-out on a trio of awful runs, and then attempted a fake punt. It was a perfect pass, but dropped by someone named Dewey McDonald. Tony Romo fired a touchdown to Dez Bryant on the ensuing snap, and just like that, the Cowboys were up 14-0 and had the game in hand. With this victory, as well as Philadelphia's inexplicable loss to Washington, the Cowboys were able to clinch their division. They might even have a chance at the No. 1 seed depending on what occurs next week, so they won't be resting their starters against the Redskins.    Romo was near-perfect. He misfired just twice, though 1 of those passes was a dropped pick-six in the second half. Still, Romo was an impressive 18-of-20 for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Colts, who have struggled against elite quarterbacks this year, had absolutely no answer for him.    The big, non-playoff-related story entering this game, of course, was DeMarco Murray's status off hand surgery. Murray didn't look all that great outside of an 11-yard run, tallying 58 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He seemed to be favoring his surgically repaired hand at times, and when the Cowboys went up 14-0, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms wondered if the coaching staff would sit Murray. That did not happen, as Murray played into the second half, which I thought was pretty foolish. Murray didn't suffer a setback, but he easily could have, and he would've done so senselessly because Dallas had the game in hand. Besides, "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray and all of his other first-stringers to stay on the field throughout the entire afternoon. I'm all about keeping momentum going, but Garrett and Jones took a major risk by keeping Romo and Murray on the field for the entire game. They're extremely fortunate that they came out of this game unscathed in what ultimately proved to be a blowout victory. Revenge for the Monday night loss apparently served as Dallas' motivation. The Cowboys were so hyped up to win this game that they attempted (and successfully recovered) an onside kick while leading 20-7 in the second quarter.    Murray looked great, which is the big take-away from this game. Murray didn't play well against the Colts last week, as he was favoring his hand while averaging fewer than 3 yards per carry. He looked like a completely different player in this contest, gashing a normally strong Washington ground defense for 100 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. Murray, who broke Emmitt Smith's single-season rushing record with the Cowboys, was robbed of even more yardage when the officials incorrectly blew a play dead because they thought he was down.    Tony Romo was also sharp, though he made a couple of mistakes. He finished 22-of-34 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He also nearly threw a second pick, but "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray also added a 14-yard run, but the Titans had to settle for a field goal. The Raiders answered with a 25-yard completion to Amari Cooper. Carr moved the chains on third-and-10 with a 13-yard pass to Jalen Richard (6-28 rushing), and then Latavius Murray (10-37) went untouched on a 22-yard touchdown run straight up the middle. After trading a few punts, Mariota took off on a run and ended up fumbling the ball away after getting hit by Bruce Irvin. Oakland recovered at the Tennessee 24-yard line, and on the next play, Carr hit Clive Walford (2-27) for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Donald Penn took the score away. The Raiders settled for a 52-yard field goal from Sebastian Janikowski. That play rewrote NFL record books, as Janikowski became the kicker with the most field goals of 50-plus yards in NFL history, breaking the record held by former Lion Jason Hansen. The Raiders got moving again with a pass to Cooper, while DeAndre Washington (6-57) exploded downfield on runs of 30 and 14 yards. Carr finished the drive by throwing a quick out to Seth Roberts (2-27), and Brice McCain took a terrible angle to let Roberts get the sideline as he darted down the field for a 19-yard touchdown. With only seconds remaining before the half, Mariota forced a pass to a covered receiver, and it was deflected to Reggie Nelson for an interception. Luckily for the Titans, the clock ran out and the Raiders couldn't kick another field goal as they were in Janikowski's range. Oakland took a 17-3 lead into the half. The Titans' offense finally started moving in the third quarter thanks to DeMarco Murray ripping off a run of 36 yards. Mariota then got away with a dangerous pass to Amaro for 26 yards. Murray ran the ball in from 5 yards out to cut the Raiders lead to 17-10. Early in the 4.h quarter, "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray before taking into the end zone untouched. On several instances, Mariota scrambled to get critical third downs, and that kept the Titans' drives going. Most importantly, Mariota's dual-threat ability allowed him to move around the pocket and make the best play for his team. If he saw a running lane, he took it. If not, he looked for Delanie Walker or another receiver open down the field. It was a solid game overall for the second-year pro, and it looks like Mariota may have put his early-season struggles behind him.    Though the Titans were efficient in the passing game, their performance in terms of their ground attack was absolutely phenomenal. They totaled a whopping 225 yards on the day, while the Dolphins only recorded 51 yards. Mariota's impact was already mentioned, but the team's top 2 running backs really had a big impact. DeMarco Murray is continuing to have the best season of his career, and he got another 27 carries during Sunday's game. On those carries, he totaled 121 yards and really led the offense for the team. He ripped off numerous 8-to-9-yard chunks plays, and that allowed the team to move the ball efficiently. When Murray was not carrying the ball, rookie "

Mariota converted a third-and-14 to Tajae Sharpe (3-68-1) and then hit Delanie Walker for 41 yards after he beat Kentrell Brice to get open and shed the tackle. A few plays later, Tennessee went into its bag of tricks as Murray took a handoff and sold a run to convince safety Morgan Burnett to move up; Murray then threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Walker. The Titans quickly got the ball back thanks to a sack from rookie safety Kevin Byard, and Mariota kept torching Green Bay with passes to Walker. To finish the drive, Mariota hit Anthony Fasano, who was wide open, for a short touchdown, which put the Titans up 21-0 at the end of the first quarter. Green Bay got moving with a few receptions to Davante Adams and a pass to Randall Cobb (4-31) to get to the 1-yard line. To end the drive, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson on a slant for the touchdown. Mariota quickly responded by lofting in a beautiful 32-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews (3-63-1). Green Bay responded with 46-yard pass to Adams set up a Mason Crosby field goal. The Packers muffed the punt on the Titans' next drive, giving Mariota a short field. He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (2-8-1). The Packers scored quickly in response, as Rodgers used Adams to move the ball and set up a screen touchdown pass to James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray was then stuffed on a 4.h down because he curiously opted to bounce the run outside rather than attack the interior of the defense. The Colts took over on downs, and Luck was able to move the chains by buying time and finding T.Y. Hilton in between 2 defenders. That completion allowed Indianapolis to kneel down in victory formation.    Mariota got off to a shaky start, but had a strong performance overall. He finished 25-of-38 for 290 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 5 times for 29 rushing yards. Perhaps a bit more was expected against the Colts, but Indianapolis was able to get stud safety Mike Adams back from injury. Still, Mariota engineered some great drives that started deep in his own territory.    Mariota's top target was once again Rishard Matthews, who had a monstrous afternoon, catching 9 of his 13 targets for 122 yards. He didn't score, however. Mariota's touchdowns went to Tajae Sharpe (4-68) and DeMarco Murray. "

   "comment":"DeMarco Murray continued to lead the backfield and showed no signs of the hamstring injury that had made him questionable in the leadup to the contest. Overall, Murray totaled 115 yards on 14 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run that saw him follow his blockers perfectly and cut into open space all across the field. He is a low-end RB1 right now, though Henry could take some opportunities away from him in the future. Speaking of Henry, he started the game poorly, and at 1 point, had 4 carries for minus-6 yards. By the end of the day, Henry had racked up 54 yards on 13 carries, and he looked good in the second half. Henry has RB1 potential for the future, but that won't happen this year unless Murray misses time.    Tennessee's offensive line also deserves credit for this performance. The team's line is 1 of the top units in the league and will continue to provide quality blocking for Mariota and the backs all season, provided that the linemen can stay healthy. Speaking of Mariota, he had an impressive performance against a stout Seattle defense. Early on, Mariota was under pressure, but he was able to scramble away from sacks and make plays outside the pocket. He used his mobility to his advantage, and that helped to take away the effectiveness of the Seahawks' defensive line, which is their strongest part of the defensive unit. Mariota was very accurate per usual, and he was able to spread the ball around and find the open man. Overall, Mariota went 20-of-32 for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he helped the Titans to control the game. Mariota has a great grasp of the offense, and his ability to analyze defenses and find effective matchups will be a major weapon for the Titans.    With Corey Davis out, Mariota focus on targeting "
