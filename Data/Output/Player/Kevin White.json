   "comment":"Kevin White, he was dead last with 2 grabs for 6 yards. At 1 point, the FOX color analyst said something along the lines of, Now is the time for Mike Glennon to go to Kevin White. I shook my head, as such a time should never exist. Alas, White suffered a fractured collarbone and will be out for the year.    Mike Glennon went 26-of-40 for 213 yards and a touchdown. It wasn't a very impressive debut, but Glennon neither had adequate protection nor viable threats downfield. Plus, he should've thrown a second score at the very end, but Howard dropped the ball. It would probably be best for the Bears to move on to Mitchell Trubisky, though I wouldn't blame Glennon for this defeat. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
