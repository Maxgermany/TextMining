   "comment":"White ran the wrong route, and that let Andre Hal pick off a pass to set up the Texans in Chicago territory. Houston had to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, Fuller caught a 27-yard pass to get into Bears territory. He finished the drive by making a shoestring catch on a wide receiver screen before using his speed to dart down the field for an 18-yard touchdown. Shortly later on a third down, Fuller made a superb leaping grab of about 30 yards and set up a short field goal for Nick Novak. Houston's defense then slammed the door for the win.    Brock Osweiler completed 22-of-35 for 231 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He threw the ball better than the numbers illustrate, and he easily could have had a couple more touchdown passes.    Lamar Miller ran for 106 yards on 28 carries with 4 receptions for 11 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins had 5 catches for 54 yards with a score. Will Fuller (5-107-1) had a great debut aside from his drop. Chicago's corners couldn't run with Fuller, especially in the second half. Osweiler targeted Fuller heavily, at times more than Hopkins, and if you need a wideout for your fantasy team, Fuller could be an adept pickup.    Jay Cutler was 16-of-29 for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He played better than the numbers illustrate as well. The Bears' offensive tackles got whipped in the second half.    Jeremy Langford ran for 57 yards on 17 carries, but bailed out his fantasy owners with a score.    Alshon Jeffery had 4 catches for 105 yards. Eddie Royal (4-57-1) chipped well in the first half, and Kevin White (3-34) flashed at times.    Chicago's front 7 played well overall, but the secondary struggled. "

   "comment":"White nor Alshon Jeffery. Eddie Royal caught 7 balls for 111 yards and a touchdown, with 64 of those yards coming on 1 reception. Jordan Howard, meanwhile, was excellent in his initial start, gaining 111 yards on 23 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 21 receiving yards. He also drew a pass-interference flag near the goal line. Howard thrived in the preseason, so it's hardly a surprise that he looked so dynamic in his first start. If he keeps performing like this, Jeremy Langford won't be getting his job back.    As for the Bears' dynamic receivers, both are dealing with injuries, which would explain the meager stat totals. Jeffery caught 3 balls for 46 yards and didn't look like quite himself. White, meanwhile, had been enjoying a solid afternoon - 6 grabs, 55 yards - but left the game with an ankle injury and never returned.    It needs to be mentioned that "

I shook my head, as such a time should never exist. Alas, White suffered a fractured collarbone and will be out for the year.    Mike Glennon went 26-of-40 for 213 yards and a touchdown. It wasn't a very impressive debut, but Glennon neither had adequate protection nor viable threats downfield. Plus, he should've thrown a second score at the very end, but Howard dropped the ball. It would probably be best for the Bears to move on to Mitchell Trubisky, though I wouldn't blame Glennon for this defeat.   "
