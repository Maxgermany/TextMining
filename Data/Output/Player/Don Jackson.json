   "comment":"Jackson carries. He only managed 8 yards on 4 attempts. Montgomery was able to rush for 53 yards on 7 carries and caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He caught a screen pass late where he ducked away from defenders, and that is where many of his receiving yards came from. Moving forward, the team should give him a few more touches each week. Granted, Montgomery may not be able to handle a full workload, but he is a greatly talented player. The more touches he gets, the better the offense will be.    Final Note: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was very strong in today's game. In addition to the 2 picks, he notched half of a sack on a blitz. He continues to develop into 1 of the better safeties in the league.
