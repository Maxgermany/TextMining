   "comment":"Turbin. The drive stalled out for a 44-yard field goal. St. Louis answered with a screen to Tavon Austin for 11 yards. He had a great block on the next play to help spring Gurley for a 48-yard run. The drive was killed by a sack from Randy Starks, and Greg Zuerlein missed a 35-yard field goal. Barnidge climbed the ladder to make a 33-yard reception down the middle of the field. A Joe Thomas holding on Robert Quinn took away a great 36-yard catch by Travis Benjamin, and once again, Cleveland punted away after starting a drive well. Foles threw a beautiful 41-yard pass to Kenny Britt to the Browns' 1-yard line. Gurley finished the drive with his first NFL touchdown. In the 4.h quarter, the Rams' defense struck again. T.J. McDonald dislodged the ball from Benjamin, while Nick Fairley recovered the ball. Hilariously, Fairley ran the wrong direction with the fumble for a loss of 5 yards on his return, but at least, he secured the turnover. The St. Louis offense moved the ball from midfield before Gurley charged through 3 tackles from 16 yards out for the final score of the game. The Rams' defense did the rest. William Hayes beat right tackle Mitchell Schwartz to strip McCown of the ball, and Eugene Sims recovered the fumble. After McCown was pummeled by St. Louis' defense, Johnny Manziel came in for the final drive and moved the Browns about 30 yards before Cleveland stalled out.    Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards on 19 carries with 2 touchdowns. His combination of power and speed is tremendous.    Nick Foles completed 15-of-23 passes for 163 yards, while Tavon Austin led the Rams' receivers with 43 yards on 4 receptions.    Josh McCown completed 26-of-32 pass for 270 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and 2 fumbles. He actually didn't play poorly, but his offensive line was destroyed by the Rams.    St. Louis' run defense has been vulnerable this year, but shut down the Cleveland ground attack. Robert Turbin had 30 yards on 5 carries.    Cleveland was led through the air by tight end Gary Barnidge. He had 6 receptions for 101 yards. Running back "

   "comment":"Turbin. Having said that, Romo had more positives than negatives. He showed off his great elusive ability early on when he avoided a sack and flipped a left-handed pass to Darren McFadden, escaping the back of his own end zone amid a sudden monsoon. He made a number of terrific throws, including a 31-yard touchdown to Terrance Williams. Romo finished 18-of-28 for 227 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Romo nearly had a third score, but Cole Beasley dropped the ball in the end zone.    Romo's scores were thrown to Williams (4-79) and Bryant (4-45). Williams drew a taunting penalty following his touchdown and that allowed the Dolphins to drive the field when they were struggling, but they didn't really have many successful drives other than that, so it didn't matter.    With Romo back under center, things opened up for Darren McFadden, who was able to gash the Dolphins for 129 yards on 29 carries. Robert Turbin was mixed in with 7 attempts for 35 yards. McFadden converted a big 4.h down in the opening quarter when Dallas was on its side of midfield, which was a big statement that established the tempo of the game.    As for the Dolphins, they had yet another ugly showing. "

Luck then moved the ball down the field before running a short touchdown into the end zone and converting a 2.point conversion to Hilton. At 33-22, the Colts got the ball back and promptly Luck hit Hilton on the run for 39 yards. The Colts settled for a field goal to make it 33-25 with 2:30 remaining. McGloin made a great throw to Cooper to get a first down on a third-and-long conversion just before the 2-minute warning. That allowed the Raiders to run out the clock on the Colts.
