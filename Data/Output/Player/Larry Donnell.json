   "comment":"Larry Donnell fumble in the red zone in the middle of the first quarter. The Giants then botched a snap on a field goal attempt after a big Donnell fumble in the red zone in the middle of the first quarter. The Giants then botched a snap on a field goal attempt after a big Victor Cruz gain. Damontre Moore followed that up by holding on a nice punt return. The Giants tried their best to lose this game, but Fitzpatrick wouldn't let them. Fitzpatrick was disgraceful. Don't let the final stats fool you. He finished 20-of-34 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions, but almost all of that positive yardage came in garbage time. By halftime, Fitzpatrick was just 4-of-13 for 39 yards and 2 picks. He couldn't do anything when this game was still in doubt, as the Texans mustered just 83 yards of offense by the time the third quarter began. One of his interceptions was laughable; he heaved a dying ball to no 1 in particular, and the Giants were able to take possession on a short field and score more points. If Fitzpatrick keeps playing like this, we'll be seeing Ryan Mallett quite soon.    It hurt Fitzpatrick that he didn't have Arian Foster at his disposal. Bill O'Brien gave Foster too much of a workload in the first couple of weeks, so he wasn't able to go. Alfred Blue posted solid numbers in his absence - 13 carries, 78 yards - but as with Fitzpatrick, most of his yardage came after halftime.    Fitzpatrick couldn't connect at all with Andre Johnson. He threw the ball to Johnson 11 times, but the veteran wideout came away with just 4 catches for 24 yards. DeAndre Hopkins (6-116) paced Houston in both grabs and receiving yardage.    Eli Manning was the far superior quarterback in this matchup. Shaking off his preseason struggles, Manning went 21-of-28 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He targeted Rueben Randle more than anyone else, but the former LSU product managed just 5 catches for 27 receiving yards. Meanwhile, Manning's scores went to Victor Cruz (5-107) and Daniel Fells. Donnell, who screwed up early on, snagged all 6 of his targets for 45 yards.    Houston's inability to stop "

Manning's top options on the evening were Cruz (6-108) and Randle (8-89), who saw 10 targets each. Both committed errors that would've cost their team in a close game, but the Redskins just weren't competitive.    Rashad Jennings fantasy owners had to be frustrated. Jennings was given just 13 carries for 55 yards, and he flat-out dropped a receiving touchdown. He was then pulled when the game was out of hand, allowing rookie Andre Williams (14-64) to vulture a touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Williams was responsible for a drop in the first half.    The Redskins, as mentioned, continuously shot themselves in the foot. It began when Mathias Kiwanuka beat Tyler Polumbus to strip-sack an oblivious Kirk Cousins. A short field set up a Manning touchdown to Donnell. After that, a hold negated a 16-yard reception to "

   "comment":"Larry Donnell (5-55) for a 32-yard pass to the goal line. Manning threw a short touchdown to Donnell (5-55) for a 32-yard pass to the goal line. Manning threw a short touchdown to Preston Parker (2-6) to cap it. A 29-yard pass to Odell Beckham, Jr. got the Giants moving again. To end the drive, Jennings burst up the middle and banged into the end zone from 17 yards out. The Jaguars responded with a drive into New York's territory. A holding call on Luke Joeckel took away a touchdown pass to Cecil Shorts, so the Jaguars settled for a field goal before intermission.    The Giants melted down in the second half. It started when Manning was sacked by Geno Hayes. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Jennings tried to get up and run with the ball around the leg of a teammate, but J.T. Thomas was able to dive on the ball for a touchdown. Jennings should have just accepted a safety. New York moved the ball into Jacksonville territory before Josh Brown had a costly missed a field goal. The Jaguars took advantage with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Marqise Lee (6-75). It was a pretty pass by Bortles to pull Jacksonville within 5 points (the 2.point conversion attempt was batted by Jason Pierre-Paul). Early in the 4.h quarter, Donnell caught a pass in the flat, but fumbled the ball on a hard hit by Dwayne Gratz."
