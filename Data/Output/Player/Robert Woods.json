   "comment":"Woodson, which was a forced pass. He then nearly had another interception, but the ball hit the ground. Following that, Orton hurled a potential pick-6 that was dropped, and then almost had another 1 in a careless heave into double coverage. Orton was extremely fortunate that he didn't toss 5 interceptions in the first half. As he was getting away with possible turnovers, he was heaving inaccurate passes that missed his targets. The Bills, consequently, had numerous 3-and-outs, and it didn't get any better until the Raiders were up 2 scores. Orton had yet another near-pick in the second half and then fired an actual interception on a high pass. He was even lucky on a late touchdown, as Eric Wood got away with a holding penalty, which enraged Justin Tuck. The Bills desperately need to find a quarterback this offseason. Alas, there aren't many realistic options. The 1 possibility is Jay Cutler, who will be available via trade for a mere mid-round pick.    The other reason for Buffalo's defeat was that the team lost Marcell Dareus and Stephon Gilmore, 2 of the team's best defenders, to various injuries. With Dareus out, the Raiders were able to run the ball effectively with both Latavius Murray and Darren McFadden. Murray gained 86 yards on 23 carries, while McFadden (9-54) had a big 25-yard burst, getting tackled inches short of the goal line.    Derek Carr had a solid performance. Making strides with Greg Olson's tutelage, Carr went 17-of-34 for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns. The completion percentage isn't pretty, and some of his passes were off the mark, but keep in mind that he was battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL. He was under heavy pressure at times, yet had some spectacular throws, including a perfect bomb to Kenbrell Thompkins for 50 yards early on. Carr was almost pick-sixed a bit later, but he had way fewer near-interceptions than his counterpart. He had a clutch 51-yard completion to Andre Holmes on a third-and-22 in the second half. Speaking of pick-sixes, Matt Schaub entered the game briefly in the second half when Carr hurt his ankle. The crowd booed him, and the Raiders had to take a timeout because they couldn't line up properly. Carr was able to reenter the game after the stoppage. Instead of an inevitable pick-6 - Schaub seemed poised to throw 1 - the Raiders were able to preserve the field goal.    Oakland's leading receiver was Thompkins, who caught 5 balls for 90 yards. Only 2 other Raiders had 3 or more receptions: Holmes (3-73), who made a great, leaping catch over a defender, and Murray (3-22). Mychal Rivera caught only 1 pass for 5 yards.    Some Buffalo stats: - The Bills couldn't run the ball at all. Fred Jackson led the team with 10 rushing yards on 6 carries, though he made up for it in the passing game, catching 9 balls for 93 receiving yards. - Making his return from an extensive injury, C.J. Spiller lost 4 yards on 4 attempts. Spiller will probably be playing his final game for the Bills next week. - Watkins, who caught the aforementioned 42-yard bomb, finished with 3 grabs for 75 yards and the touchdown. Robert Woods (7-52) and Scott Chandler (4-37) also scored."

He looked terrible without his dominant tight end, though the immense pressure he had in his face didn't help. The pass rush forced Brady into many errant passes, which would explain why he went just 8-of-16 for 80 yards. "

This game was different in that the Bengals beat them legitimately with superior talent, with the help of a key injury. Cincinnati, despite having great field position on many drives in the first half, sputtered early on, but accumulated 234 net yards following intermission. The Bengals put together multiple touchdown drives even though they began starting inside their own 20 for a change.    "

   "comment":"Woods. Clay caught all 5 of his targets for 73 yards and looked to be Taylor's favorite weapon. As long as Sammy Watkins is out, Clay will be the best receiver on the Bills. As for Woods, he was a major disappointment. He caught only 2 passes for 26 yards; however, he was guilty of numerous drops. He is simply too inefficient to be relied on in any fantasy format.    For the Rams, this game was another black mark on the tenure of Jeff Fisher. The team had problems converting red-zone opportunities and had to settle too often. Case Keenum was a part of the problem today as well. Though his 21-of-31 completion rate and 271 passing yards were good on paper, his performance left a lot to be desired. Keenum tossed the 2 aforementioned picks and was unable to throw a touchdown. In the red zone, he was unable to do anything as the team only got 1 touchdown and 4 field goals during the game. Keenum did not help the cause as he struggled to get the ball to his receivers and was unable to deal with the pressure that the Bills were putting on him. After this performance, it is fair to wonder if the Rams will be able to win many games with Keenum as quarterback. He simply is too limited to be more than a stop-gap starter. If the team continues to lose, then the staff should strongly consider giving No. 1-overall pick Jared Goff some playing time just to speed up his development.    On the ground, "

Clay is a high-end TE2 in fantasy at this point, and I would consider picking up Woods at this point as well. Woods does have issues with drops at times, but he is going to catch 5 passes most days. He is worthy of a bench spot in most 12-team leagues.    For the 49ers, this game was actually not all that bad. The final score is actually less lopsided than the scoreboard indicates. In fact, the 49ers were down 24-16 early in the fourth quarter. A lot of this was thanks to the early play of Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick was nowhere close to perfect, but the veteran was an upgrade over Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick's numbers do not look all that good - 13-of-29 for 187 yards and 1 touchdown - but he played better than they indicate. He hit some downfield passes that Gabbert would not have made.

   "comment":"Woods to an injury early in the game, so he did not have much to work with. Still, Taylor looked indecisive in the pocket and too often tried to scramble for first downs. It seemed like he was not fully going through his progressions; he just ran if his first option was not open. Taylor also was guilty of staring down his receivers, and that almost resulted in a couple of picks. Taylor's final stat line was as follows: 19-of-27 for 166 yards and an interception. He also scrambled 9 times for 39 yards. Moving forward, Taylor needs to improve his accuracy and hope that his receiving corps can improve in the coming weeks. Otherwise, Taylor could continue to have more issues.    In terms of the Bills' receivers, Woods (3-41) would have posted a big stat line had he not gotten hurt. Woods had a good first quarter and was able to make some nice moves against the Bengals' defenders. After he went down, "

   "comment":"Woods. On the penultimate play for the Rams, they were on the 20 and took a shot at the end zone. Cooper Kupp was streaking to the end zone and had gotten open. Somehow, the Seahawks had missed him in coverage. Goff threw a bullet to Kupp that hit him in the hands. Kupp had to dive for the pass, and it would have been an incredible catch. Kupp couldn't secure it, however, and the Rams couldn't punch the ball in. That essentially ended the game. Despite the positive final drive, Goff had his share of struggles against the Seahawks, and they were prevalent in the fourth quarter. Before the final drive, Goff made a few bad mistakes. He threw an awful interception that can only be described as a dying quail. It fluttered over the middle of the field and wobbled like crazy before Earl Thomas came away with it. Later in the quarter, Goff would hold onto the ball too long and get strip sacked from behind. He had trouble feeling the strong Seattle rush, and that cost him a bit. Overall, Goff went 22-of-47 for 288 yards and 2 picks. This was not an entirely negative performance for Goff. He had his share of nice throws that were accurate and well-thrown. And of course, he had a chance to get the Rams a win late. Goff is still a work in progress, so there will be more games like this for him as he battles tough defenses.    Goff's top targets were Tyler Higbee (4-98), Cooper Kupp (3-44) and Robert Woods (5-66). Goff tends to prefer to throw to good route runners, which explains why these 3 were his top targets. "

   "comment":"Woods, and that was just 1 of Goff's many terrific throws. Goff had some issues with pressure early, but the Rams made the appropriate adjustments at halftime to help Goff finish 25-of-37 for 355 yards and the trio of scores.    Woods continued his terrific play, catching 8 passes for 171 yards and 2 scores. Despite "

Watkins was a disappointment once again, catching just 3 balls for 36 yards to go along with the aforementioned offensive pass interference. Watkins will need to step up if Woods is out; Woods suffered a shoulder injury late in this contest, but reports indicate it's not very serious.   "
