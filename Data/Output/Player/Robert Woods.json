   "comment":"Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and Charles Clay (3-19)."

   "comment":"Robert Woods along the sideline and then scored on a touchdown run. It was 7-0, Bills, and they appeared primed to pull the upset. And then, the rest of the game went like the New England contest. The Bills lost to the Patriots because they absolutely killed themselves with horrible penalties. This game was different in that the Bengals beat them legitimately with superior talent, with the help of a key injury. Cincinnati, despite having great field position on many drives in the first half, sputtered early on, but accumulated 234 net yards following intermission. The Bengals put together multiple touchdown drives even though they began starting inside their own 20 for a change.    "

   "comment":"Robert Woods. Clay caught all 5 of his targets for 73 yards and looked to be Taylor's favorite weapon. As long as Sammy Watkins is out, Clay will be the best receiver on the Bills. As for Woods, he was a major disappointment. He caught only 2 passes for 26 yards; however, he was guilty of numerous drops. He is simply too inefficient to be relied on in any fantasy format.    For the Rams, this game was another black mark on the 10.re of Jeff Fisher. The team had problems converting red-zone opportunities and had to settle too often. Case Keenum was a part of the problem today as well. Though his 21-of-31 completion rate and 271 passing yards were good on paper, his performance left a lot to be desired. Keenum tossed the 2 aforementioned picks and was unable to throw a touchdown. In the red zone, he was unable to do anything as the team only got 1 touchdown and 4 field goals during the game. Keenum did not help the cause as he struggled to get the ball to his receivers and was unable to deal with the pressure that the Bills were putting on him. After this performance, it is fair to wonder if the Rams will be able to win many games with Keenum as quarterback. He simply is too limited to be more than a stop-gap starter. If the team continues to lose, then the staff should strongly consider giving No. 1-overall pick Jared Goff some playing time just to speed up his development.    On the ground, "

   "comment":"Robert Woods (5-44-1) were each targeted heavily by Taylor. Both players have been solid since Sammy Watkins was placed on the injured reserve. Clay is a high-end TE2 in fantasy at this point, and I would consider picking up Woods at this point as well. Woods does have issues with drops at times, but he is going to catch 5 passes most days. He is worthy of a bench spot in most 12-team leagues.    For the 49ers, this game was actually not all that bad. The final score is actually less lopsided than the scoreboard indicates. In fact, the 49ers were down 24-16 early in the 4.h quarter. A lot of this was thanks to the early play of Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick was nowhere close to perfect, but the veteran was an upgrade over Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick's numbers do not look all that good - 13-of-29 for 187 yards and 1 touchdown - but he played better than they indicate. He hit some downfield passes that Gabbert would not have made.

   "comment":"Robert Woods to an injury early in the game, so he did not have much to work with. Still, Taylor looked indecisive in the pocket and too often tried to scramble for first downs. It seemed like he was not fully going through his progressions; he just ran if his first option was not open. Taylor also was guilty of staring down his receivers, and that almost resulted in a couple of picks. Taylor's final stat line was as follows: 19-of-27 for 166 yards and an interception. He also scrambled 9 times for 39 yards. Moving forward, Taylor needs to improve his accuracy and hope that his receiving corps can improve in the coming weeks. Otherwise, Taylor could continue to have more issues.    In terms of the Bills' receivers, Woods (3-41) would have posted a big stat line had he not gotten hurt. Woods had a good first quarter and was able to make some nice moves against the Bengals' defenders. After he went down, "

   "comment":"Robert Woods. On the penultimate play for the Rams, they were on the 20 and took a shot at the end zone. Cooper Kupp was streaking to the end zone and had gotten open. Somehow, the Seahawks had missed him in coverage. Goff threw a bullet to Kupp that hit him in the hands. Kupp had to dive for the pass, and it would have been an incredible catch. Kupp couldn't secure it, however, and the Rams couldn't punch the ball in. That essentially ended the game. Despite the positive final drive, Goff had his share of struggles against the Seahawks, and they were prevalent in the 4.h quarter. Before the final drive, Goff made a few bad mistakes. He threw an awful interception that can only be described as a dying quail. It fluttered over the middle of the field and wobbled like crazy before Earl Thomas came away with it. Later in the quarter, Goff would hold onto the ball too long and get strip sacked from behind. He had trouble feeling the strong Seattle rush, and that cost him a bit. Overall, Goff went 22-of-47 for 288 yards and 2 picks. This was not an entirely negative performance for Goff. He had his share of nice throws that were accurate and well-thrown. And of course, he had a chance to get the Rams a win late. Goff is still a work in progress, so there will be more games like this for him as he battles tough defenses.    Goff's top targets were Tyler Higbee (4-98), Cooper Kupp (3-44) and Robert Woods (5-66). Goff 10.s to prefer to throw to good route runners, which explains why these 3 were his top targets. "
