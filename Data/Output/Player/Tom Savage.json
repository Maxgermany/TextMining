   "comment":"Tom Savage to help them decide what to do at quarterback this offseason.    The Colts' 13th-straight home victory over the Texans gave Indianapolis the crown of the AFC South and ended the slim playoff hopes for Houston. Indianapolis' offense was held in check by Houston's defense, but the Texans' flaccid offense was unable to produce points as it lost Ryan Fitzpatrick in the first half and was already playing without Andre Johnson (concussion). This wasn't an impressive victory for the Colts, but they got the job done and were the first team in the AFC, along with the Patriots, to clinch a postseason berth.    After trading some punts, the Texans got on the board first when Andrew Luck threw a pick-six on a third-and-9. Luck thought Coby Fleener was going to sit down in a hole in zone, but Fleener (2-32) kept running, and the pass flew to Kendrick Lewis returned it 27 yards for a score. Luck tied it up on the first play of the second quarter when he hit Hakeem Nicks (2-44), who was open in zone, and he darted into the end zone with a 26-yard touchdown. About 90 seconds later, Fitzpatrick injured his leg on a run and rookie backup Tom Savage had to enter the game as Fitzpatrick was carted off the field. "

With the Ravens and Jaguars getting wins, the Texans' loss to the Colts puts their postseason hopes on life support. As expected, the season-ending injury to Deshaun Watson was a death blow to Houston after losing J.J. Watt and Whitney Mercilus, but that was given further evidence as backup quarterback Tom Savage was awful for 3 quarters. The Texans look poised to produce some high picks for Cleveland after sustaining those injuries. The Colts were finally able to finish off a game, and got a close win, their third of the season. However, Indianapolis has no playoff hopes with Andrew Luck out for the year, so each victory just hurts the team's draft position.    The Colts struck first, as "
