That would totally work, right? </i>    Finally, someone found a way to slow down Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. The Texans threw all sorts of coverage at Jones and held him to 4 catches for 38 yards. It didn't matter. The 4-0 Falcons still hammered the Texans with running back Devonta Freeman, showing last week's effort wasn't a flash in the pan. For the second straight week, Freeman scored 3 rushing touchdowns. Freeman became the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score 3 rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. He also became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to have 7 rushing touchdowns in the first 4 games of a season. Freeman has made himself into a must-start in any fantasy league. He finished with 68 yards on 14 carries and also caught 5 passes for 81 yards. Freeman's numbers could have been even higher, but the Falcons replaced him with Terron Ward (19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown) once the game got out of hand.    Even with Jones being held quiet, quarterback Matt Ryan had an efficient day. Ryan completed 19-of-27 passes for 256 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions on a day when the Falcons didn't really need to throw the ball.    Atlanta wide receiver Roddy White continued his very quiet season. He had 2 catches for 8 yards. If you still have White on your fantasy team, it's time to consider letting him go. Age clearly is catching up to White, and his best days are behind him. If you're looking for a replacement, you might want to grab Leonard Hankerson. He could start to cut into White's playing time after producing 6 catches for 103 yards.    Atlanta's defense continues to play well. The Falcons forced 2 early turnovers that helped them build a quick 21-0 lead. Linebacker Paul Worrilow tipped a pass that was intercepted by defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux, and cornerback Desmond Trufant scored a touchdown after scooping up an Arian Foster fumble.    For the Texans (1-3), the big story entering the game was the return of Foster from an injury. However, Foster ended up having almost no impact. Foster had 8 carries for 10 yards. His longest run of the day went for 5 yards. Foster also had 3 catches for 25 yards. His backup, Alfred Blue, who had a big week last week, also was held in check. Blue was limited to 17 yards on 6 carries.    Ryan Mallett may have played his way out of a starting job. He completed 12-of-27 passes for 150 yards with an interception. Backup Brian Hoyer entered the game after it was out of control and fared much better than Mallett. Hoyer completed 17-of-30 passes for 232 yards with 2 touchdowns. The Texans could decide to make a switch at quarterback.    Wide receiver Mallett, he sucks.

   "comment":"Ryan Mallett had more passing yards and touchdowns and fewer interceptions than Ben Roethlisberger. In other words, you should've started Mallett over Roethlisberger in your fantasy championship. Blegh. Fantasy is great, but does suck sometimes. And speaking of which, Antonio Brown owners were robbed of a touchdown because of a horrible call in this game. My condolences if it ended up costing you the title.    The Pittsburgh Steelers came into this game with a 9-5 record, having won 5 of their last 6. while the Ravens had dropped their last 3. giving up 69 points over the last 2 games. But when these 2 AFC North rivals meet, there are few easy wins, and this game was no different. The Steelers only needed to beat the Ravens and the Browns to make the playoffs. Instead, Pittsburgh lost to Ryan Mallett, who had been dumped by the Houston Texans and signed by Baltimore just 12 days ago. How did the Ravens do it? First, they dared the Steelers to run on them, which they did and did well, but as poor as the Steelers' pass defense has been this season, Mallett and company were able to move the ball easily and get a lead, while the Steelers were rendered 1.dimensional. Mallett moved the Ravens into Pittsburgh territory early and often. He played within his skill set and didn't force the ball or try to hit the long pass very often. Running back Mallett had more passing yards and touchdowns and fewer interceptions than Ben Roethlisberger. In other words, you should've started Mallett over Roethlisberger in your fantasy championship. Blegh. Fantasy is great, but does suck sometimes. And speaking of which, "

It helped that the Ravens began making mistakes, but the Bengals looked like a different squad. A.J. McCarron barely let any of his passes hit the ground (7-of-10 in second half), though A.J. Green definitely helped him out. Green made 2 spectacular catches on the same drive, both of which involved improbably tapping his toes onto the field of play right near the sideline. The second catch resulted in a touchdown. McCarron finished 17-of-27 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns overall, while Green snatched 4 passes for 34 yards and the score. Green barely did anything outside of that 1 drive, but that's all the Bengals needed from him.    McCarron's other score was thrown to Tyler Eifert, who hauled in all 4 of his targets for 51 yards. Outside of Eifert and Green, the only other Bengal with more than 20 receiving yards was Marvin Jones (5-38).    Jeremy Hill looked great for the second week in a row. He just missed the century mark, gaining 96 yards and a touchdown on just 16 carries. His dropped pass was his only blemish. Giovani Bernard (6-36) wasn't much of a factor.    As for the Ravens, they definitely wanted to see what they had in Ryan Mallett, as they asked him to throw 56 times despite taking a lead into the third quarter. Mallett had a mixed outing overall.
