   "comment":"Garrett Gilkey kept snapping the ball poorly, and he was whistled for a ridiculous 4 penalties, including a painful hold on the final drive that helped move the team out of field-goal range. Of course, the infraction for 12 men was the nail in the coffin.    McCown had a hand in this loss. He was inaccurate throughout the afternoon, going 15-of-29 for 190 yards and an interception, which was a careless forced pass. What the stats don't show is that McCown was guilty for holding the ball too long at times. He took a sack in the red zone on 1 occasion because of his poor pocket awareness.    The top offensive player for the Buccaneers in this contest was "

McCown, who had happy feet throughout the entire afternoon, failed to complete half of his passes. He went 12-of-26 for 147 yards and a late interception in garbage time.    Though "
