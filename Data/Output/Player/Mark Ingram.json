The Saints failed on a 4.h-and-inches try in the first half because Ingram was stuffed in the backfield. With Brees matched up versus 2 rookie corners, the Saints should have exploited that advantage.    The Falcons, meanwhile, didn't run the ball enough. "

He opened the game with a drop, prompting boos from the crowd, but he was so explosive after that. In fact, he was so happy about his performance that he was flagged for a delay-of-game penalty for doing too much celebrating following a big gain. Some may argue that Ingram was able to do this because Dallas' injury-ravaged defense was so inept, but Ingram legitimately looked awesome.

   "comment":"Mark Ingram lost a fumble in the first quarter. He gained 43 yards on 10 carries.    I mentioned Walt Coleman earlier. He had a performance for the ages. On top of losing control amid that scrum, he screwed up tremendously at the end of the first half. Olsen made a great, 1.handed, diving catch and rolled out of bounds. It was automatically reviewed, and Coleman surprisingly correctly overturned it. However, Coleman ignored the fact that Olsen went out of bounds and forced the clock to run, even wiping 10 seconds off. Coleman also didn't spot the ball correctly, putting it 3 yards behind where the line of scrimmage should've been. Coleman is the worst official in any sport, and it's embarrassing that the NFL keeps trotting him out every week when his time would be better spent in a Bingo hall.   "

The Saints moved the ball before the half, and Kai Forbath hit a 57-yard field goal to cut the Texans lead to 14-6 at the intermission. In the third quarter, Houston's offense got back on track thanks to a 37-yard pass to Griffin after he was left uncovered by New Orleans' defense. Alfred Blue finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans quickly tacked on a field goal to expand their lead to 24-6. The Saints put a good drive together with Brees hitting Ben Watson for gains of 15 and 26 yards. However, Kareem Jackson made a diving interception at the 1-yard line and got up to return the ball to midfield. Another New Orleans drive moved the ball deep into Houston territory, but Quinton Demps broke up a 4.h-down pass in the end zone. That ended the game for the Texans.    Drew Brees completed 25-of-44 for 228 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. The Saints were led through the air by tight end Ben Watson with 4 catches for 53 yards. Willie Snead (4-50), Marques Colston (3-38) and Brandin Cooks (5-35) were held in check.    Mark Ingram had 52 yards on 9 carries and 6 receptions for 45 yards. The Saints had to abandon the run because they were way behind so early.    Brian Hoyer was 21-of-27 for 205 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He was yet another quarterback who torched New Orleans' defense.    "

   "comment":"Mark Ingram. Surprisingly, the 49ers answered with Kapernick throwing a dump off to DuJuan Harris, who ran untouched down the sideline for a 47-yard touchdown. Just seconds later though, Ingram took off on a 75-yard touchdown run to put the Saints up 28-10. The 49ers' next drive saw a 31-yard pass to Garrett Celek set up another Dawson field goal. Just before the half, Kaerpernick hit Vance McDonald on a short crossing route, and McDonald turned down the field to run 65 yards for a touchdown. The Saints had completely busted coverage as they forgot to account for McDonald. In the final minute before the half, Brees ripped the ball down the field to get a field goal and a 31-20 lead at intermission. The 49ers opened the third quarter by moving the ball quickly down the field, but Nate Stupar forced a fumble from Mike Davis at the 1.yard line and New Orleans recovered the loose ball. The 49ers got the ball back after forcing a 4.and-out, however, and produced a field goal drive. Late in the third quarter, the Saints missed a long field goal, but Brees threw some beautiful passes, including a 32-yard touchdown to Thomas. It was a tremendous juggling catch by Thomas along the sideline. New Orleans added a field goal and then stopped the 49ers on a 4.h down in the red zone as Kaepernick fumbled the snap away. In garbage time, Kenny Vaccaro forced another fumble that was recovered by the Saints.    Brees completed 28-of-39 passes for 323 yards with 3 touchdowns. Thomas led the Saints with 5 receptions for 73 yards and 2 scores. Brandin Cooks (5-66) chipped in as well for New Orleans.    Tim Hightower (23-87-1) and Mark Ingram (15-158-1 rushing, 2-13-1 receiving) ran wild on the 49ers. It was good for Ingram to get back on track after being demoted for fumbling issues.    Kapernick was 24-of-39 for 398 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. His touchdowns were lucky plays and the result of terrible defense by the Saints.    DuJuan Harris (10-59 rushing, 5-83-1 receiving) was San Francisco's best offensive weapon with Carlos Hyde out. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Mark Ingram on a simple dump-off pass.    Brees finished a nearly flawless 28-of-36 for 310 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Again, he was guilty of 2 early mistakes, but he recovered and was completely unstoppable after that. He misfired on just 3 occasions after halftime!    Two of Brees' 4 aerial touchdowns went to Michael Thomas, who reeled in 9 of his 10 targets for 108 yards. Thomas was a monster, as he was able to rebound off of 2 poor performances. The dynamic rookie made only 1 mistake on the afternoon, failing to run out of bounds in the 2-minute drill, which negated a scoring opportunity. Brees, meanwhile, didn't throw at all to Brandin Cooks. He was definitely on the field a bunch, but he inexplicably didn't see a single target. It's impossible to criticize this, however, as the Saints scored 49 points. Brees' other scores were thrown to Mark Ingram and Brandon Coleman."

However, he drew the ire of Sean Payton for fumbling in the red zone late in the game when the Saints were up just 17-12. The Saints ended up kicking the middling field goal anyway because of the Bears turning the ball over on downs. Still, Ingram needs to take care of the ball because Payton is more than eager to give Kamara more touches. Kamara had 28 yards and a touchdown on 8 carries. He also snatched 3 catches for 48 receiving yards.    "
