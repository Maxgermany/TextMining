The Buccaneers had no answer for tight end Jimmy Graham. He totaled 124 yards on 7 catches. Colston also had 7 receptions for 118 yards. Freeman completed 23-of-41 passes for 303 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. It was a good bounce-back performance for the Buccaneers' signal caller after a horrible game a week ago against the 49ers. Earnest Graham ran for 109 yards on 17 carries.

He made the most of it, bulldozing his way for 172 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Travaris Cadet, meanwhile, handled the Thomas aspect of the offense. He caught 4 balls for 40 receiving yards.    Before I move on to the Packers, there are 2 things that bothered me about the Saints. The first was Brees' clock management at the end of the first half. For whatever reason, he refused to spike the ball to stop the clock, and as a consequence, things got dicey. Brees threw a pass over the middle of the field without any timeouts, and the clock would have expired if there wasn't a defensive penalty. Brees did the same exact thing at the end of the Detroit loss. He would be so much better off spiking the ball, so I have no idea why he won't do that. Also, Sean Payton made a poor decision in the third quarter. Stationed just past midfield, Payton called for a run with his fullback on third-and-1. He was unsuccessful, but Payton opted to go for it on 4.h down. He had Ingram run, but the former first-rounder was stuffed. It was strange that Payton didn't even try a pass with 1 of the NFL's top quarterbacks on 1 of these crucial plays. Fortunately for Payton, it didn't hurt him, as the Packers didn't score on the short field because Rodgers proceeded to hurt his hamstring on the very next drive.    Some notes on the Packers: - Rodgers' sole aerial score went to "

   "comment":"Mark Ingram touchdown run, it appeared as though the Saints would run away with a victory to potentially clinch the NFC South. I would've never imagined that New Orleans wouldn't even put another point on the scoreboard until about the 6-minute mark of the 4.h quarter, but that's exactly what happened. It's amazing that Ingram touchdown run, it appeared as though the Saints would run away with a victory to potentially clinch the NFC South. I would've never imagined that New Orleans wouldn't even put another point on the scoreboard until about the 6-minute mark of the 4.h quarter, but that's exactly what happened. It's amazing that Drew Brees, Jimmy Graham and the rest of Sean Payton's offense were completely locked down by a defense as inept as Atlanta's. The Saints, as they have been all year, were discombobulated for most of the afternoon. On an early 4.h-and-2 in Atlanta territory, the Saints' backup left tackle, starting for the injured Terron Armstead, was guilty of a false start. New Orleans still opted to go for it, but Brees was picked off by Desmond Trufant. Brees, who was constantly under pressure, then failed to connect with Jimmy Graham on numerous occasions. On 1 instance, Graham actually had to break up a potential interception on a high throw. Graham, who had no catches in the first half, was at fault on other plays, however. He dropped a pass and then lost a fumble just inches short of the goal line, though it appeared as though he crossed into the end zone. The call was reviewed, but the officials let the play stand.    Brees and Graham didn't disappoint their fantasy owners as much as their fans. The former threw for 313 yards on 30-of-47 passes, but had 2 interceptions compared to only 1 touchdown, which came with 5:46 remaining in regulation. He also was strip-sacked for a touchdown on the final play of the game. The score was thrown to Graham, who snagged 6 balls for 53 yards, all of which came in the second half.    Ingram, as mentioned, found the end zone early on. He didn't have much success overall though, tallying 38 yards on 13 carries.    As for the Falcons, this victory will allow them to win the division with a win over Carolina next week. With "

Just before the half, Kaerpernick hit Vance McDonald on a short crossing route, and McDonald turned down the field to run 65 yards for a touchdown. The Saints had completely busted coverage as they forgot to account for McDonald. In the final minute before the half, Brees ripped the ball down the field to get a field goal and a 31-20 lead at intermission. The 49ers opened the third quarter by moving the ball quickly down the field, but Nate Stupar forced a fumble from Mike Davis at the 1.yard line and New Orleans recovered the loose ball. The 49ers got the ball back after forcing a 4.and-out, however, and produced a field goal drive. Late in the third quarter, the Saints missed a long field goal, but Brees threw some beautiful passes, including a 32-yard touchdown to Thomas. It was a tremendous juggling catch by Thomas along the sideline. New Orleans added a field goal and then stopped the 49ers on a 4.h down in the red zone as Kaepernick fumbled the snap away. In garbage time, Kenny Vaccaro forced another fumble that was recovered by the Saints.    Brees completed 28-of-39 passes for 323 yards with 3 touchdowns.

The rookie is such a special talent, and he's the best fit for what the Saints want to do offensively. New Orleans has a bye coming up, so I expect Kamara to be an even bigger part of the offense in Week 6 and beyond. Ingram (14-45) will still be in the mix), but Peterson (4-4) should be completely phased out, or even cut.    The dark cloud over the Saints' victories was a pair of injuries they suffered.

   "comment":"Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara.Ingram and Alvin Kamara. Ingram gained 131 yards and 3 touchdowns on 21 carries. He easily bulldozed the Bills, and he was clutch on an early play as well, picking up a 4.h-and-1 on the team's initial drive. Ingram wasn't a factor in the aerial attack, but Kamara was, catching all 5 of his targets for 32 receiving yards. Like Ingram, Kamara eclipsed the century mark on the ground, gashing the Bills for 106 yards and a touchdown on only 12 attempts. As with Ingram, Kamara moved the chains on a third down, but he did it after catching a pass. Kamara is probably the overall superior back, but the 2 will trample opposing defenses down the stretch as long as the offensive line remains intact. Of course, teams can't stack the line of scrimmage, or "

In overtime, he had 2 massive gains on toss plays to set up the Ingram. The veteran running back was able to gash the beat-up Washington defense for most of the day. He finished with just 11 carries, due to the fact that the Saints were trailing most of the afternoon, but he put up a whopping 134 yards and a touchdown. In overtime, he had 2 massive gains on toss plays to set up the Wil Lutz game-winner, and he also ripped off a very nice 36-yard touchdown that saw him follow his blockers through a massive hole in the Redskins' front. Ingram is an RB1 for the rest of the year, though the timeshare with Kamara, who got 42 yards on 8 carries, could frustrate some owners.    As for the Redskins, this loss was humiliating. They had a huge lead with just half of the 4.h quarter to play. They blew it, and now they are extremely unlikely to make the playoffs. It's hard to blame "
