   "comment":"Sen'Derrick Marks give San Diego a first down on what would've been a third-and-33 because of a personal foul. Later on, Royal fumbled in the red zone, and the Jaguars recovered what should've been a touchback. However, senile official Walt Coleman overturned the call after reviewing it despite the fact that it was painfully obvious that Royal wasn't down by contact. I'll repeat, Coleman is way too old and way too inept to have a high-profile officiating job like this. He needs to be removed. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Sen'Derrick Marks to clinch the win for Jacksonville.    Bortles completed 21-of-35 passes for 194 yards with 1 score. The Jaguars' 2 defensive scores were the reason the team made the comeback. Denard Robinson (11-44) never got going on the ground.    Manning was 24-of-34 for 247 yards with a touchdown. He played well, but his offensive line gave him no help. Jennings (26-91) left the game with an ankle injury.    Both teams featured terrible offensive line play. The Jaguars allowed Bortles to be sacked 7 times, while New York allowed 4 sacks of Manning. Jameel McClain (9 tackles, 1 sack), Devon Kennard (2 sacks) and Jason Pierre-Paul (1.5 sacks) played well for the Giants. Sen'Derrick Marks (2 sacks, 1 TFL) and Telvin Smith (10 tackles) stood out for the Jaguars."
