   "comment":"Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski had some contact with each other, but no flag was thrown as the pass fell incomplete. Seattle held on to the victory this time. While it wouldn't make up for the Super Bowl loss, it was still sweet revenge. While the defense came up big at the end, Seattle's MVP in this victory was clearly Russell Wilson. The MVP canadate struggled earlier in the year because of multiple injuries, but his performance against the Bills on Monday night was an indication that he was close to 100 percent. While he isn't quite there yet in terms of making scrambles for long gains, he's close enough to where he can be completely dominant. Wilson finished 25-of-37 for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns. He threw some absolute dimes in this contest, including a perfectly placed pass to "

That seemed to shake Wentz's confidence, and from there, he had more problems. Still, Wentz was not altogether terrible. He had a below-average game against a tough defense. The contest will be a learning experience for the rookie, and it will be interesting to see if he improves following this contest.
