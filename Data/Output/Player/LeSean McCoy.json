   "comment":"LeSean McCoy.    This was a pretty chippy game, laden with injuries, angry players and horrible officiating. The former is key, as the Eagles were going down like flies. Center McCoy.    This was a pretty chippy game, laden with injuries, angry players and horrible officiating. The former is key, as the Eagles were going down like flies. Center Jason Kelce suffered a knee injury and will have an MRI. Left tackle King Dunlap was pulled because of a hamstring. Jeremy Maclin, who only played due to coaching and player arrogance, aggravated his hip malady. Jason Babin and DeSean Jackson were also knocked out, but their injuries weren't serious. As for the other 2 elements, a fight broke out following Vontae Leach's first-quarter touchdown. This occurred because Kurt Coleman earlier tried to pry the ball out of Anquan Boldin's hands long after the play was over. Jackson and Cary Williams then had a war of words (and shoves) throughout the entire contest. Toward the end of the contest, the Ravens were robbed of a game-winning Jacoby Jones touchdown. Jones was called for a bogus offensive pass interference, prompting Joe Flacco to lash out at the officials in his post-game press conference.    Flacco was outplayed by QBDK overall, going just 22-of-42 for 232 yards, 1 score and an interception. He actually threw a touchdown to Jacoby Jones in the second quarter. Flacco's 2 leading targets were Dennis Pitta (8-65) and Ray Rice (6-53). Rice also rushed for 99 yards on 16 carries. Torrey Smith disappointed with only 2 catches for 51 yards.    QBDK, meanwhile, went 23-of-32 for 371 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and a pair of picks. He also had 34 rushing yards and found the end zone once on the ground. His 1 score was fired to Maclin, making his only grab of the game. The bigger story was all of the fierce hits QBDK took. As Michael Strahan tweeted afterward, Vick definitely isn't gonna last the whole season taking these hits.    Brent Celek (8-157) and Jackson (7-114) both dominated Baltimore's defense. It's been refreshing to see Celek actually being utilized in the passing game.    It was pretty surprising to see Andy Reid call 25 runs for McCoy, given that he is notorious for passing the ball way too much. Aside from the fumble, McCoy did pretty well against Baltimore's tough defense, collecting 81 rushing yards and a touchdown.   "

They tied the game on a short screen pass from McCoy (16-82 rushing, 4-20 receiving).    The Cowboys answered an early Vick touchdown with a nice drive. They tied the game on a short screen pass from Tony Romo to Felix Jones (16-71) where Nate Allen, Nnamdi Asomugha and others missed tackles on Jones. Romo later set up a field goal after Dez Bryant (3-87) burned Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie on a double move for a gain of 49 yards.    Romo played well, but his offensive line stunk. Nate Livings and Doug Free were really struggling. The interior of the line was getting whipped by Eagles defensive tackles Fletcher Cox and Cullen Jenkins. Romo made an insane play during the third quarter on which he dodged 3 defenders to make a throw downfield for a 25-yard completion to Miles Austin (2-32). Romo threw for the end zone on the drive, and Bryant laid out for the ball. It was a bad call and ruled a 30-yard touchdown, as the ball had clearly rolled on the ground. There also was a pass interference penalty called on Rodgers-Cromartie. However, the officials botched the review and kept it a Dallas touchdown to tie the score at 17 entering the 4.h quarter. Dwayne Harris gave the Cowboys the lead with a 78-yard punt return for a touchdown just a bit later. Romo finished the game completing 19-of-26 passes for 209 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Jason Witten (8-47) had a modest contribution.    Defensively, there were a number of standouts for each team. Cowboys' linebacker Bruce Carter was excellent defending the run with some hard hits. Victor Butler and Spencer recorded sacks and both played well. Eagles' linebackers Mychal Kenricks and DeMeco Ryans played well along with the rest of the Philadelphia defensive line.    There were some meltdown performances. Cowboys' rookie corner Morris Claiborne was flagged a total of 4 times, twice for pass interference penalties in the third quarter and 2 offside penalties. A holding penalty by Claiborne took away an interception by Spencer that would've set the ball up at the Eagles 18-yard line. Dallas also had 5 offside penalties. Eagles right tackle King Dunlap had some costly penalties with a hold to negate a good run by McCoy and a facemask that wiped out a good pass from Foles that would've set up a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Dunlap added another hands to the face penalty in the 4.h quarter. As if the penalties weren't enough, Dunlap was getting abused by Dallas.   "

Oh, and speaking of McCoy, he lost a fumble deep in his own territory at the end of the second quarter, giving the Redskins a chip-shot field goal. A good coach might be able to fix this at halftime, but not Reid. The Eagles came out of the tunnel to have their opening drive ruined by a delay of game and a Foles fumble. The Redskins were struggling offensively up until this point, but Robert Griffin and his receivers finally started clicking. Washington would soon extend its lead and never look back.    Foles finished 21-of-46 for 204 yards and the 2 picks. He wasn't terrible, but didn't show any signs that he can be a starter in this league. That stat line is especially disappointing considering how porous Washington had been against the pass all year, though it's worth noting that Brandon Meriweather, who was on the field for the first time all year, was a force in a pedestrian secondary. Unfortunately, Meriweather suffered a knee injury in the second half. He limped off, which is a shame because he just can't stay healthy.    Speaking of injuries, LeSean McCoy was knocked out with a concussion. He was carted off, and it didn't look like he knew where he was at that moment. McCoy rushed for just 45 yards on 15 carries and that aforementioned fumble. The concussion, by the way, occurred when the Eagles were down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Afterward, Reid was asked why McCoy was still on the field at that point. His answer? We were trying to catch up to win the game. They were trying to catch up to win the game... down 25 with 1:45 remaining. Oh OK, that makes sense.    McCoy (6 catches, 67 yards) happened to be the Eagles' leading receiver, as Foles threw tons of screens. DeSean Jackson (2-5) and Jeremy Maclin (0-0) were major disappointments.    Griffin, meanwhile, was nearly perfect, going 14-of-15 for 200 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also scrambled 12 times for 84 rushing yards. One of his best players in terms of running came on a 3rd-and-14 in the third quarter when this was an 11-point game. Despite the long-distance situation, Griffin managed to pick up the first down with a 23-yard scramble. A few plays later, Griffin connected with McCoy, DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin were inexplicably on the sidelines. Oh, and speaking of McCoy, he lost a fumble deep in his own territory at the end of the second quarter, giving the Redskins a chip-shot field goal.

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy downfield for some strange reason. The Redskin defenders couldn't tackle or cover at all, as DeSean Jackson and Riley Cooper were able to gain separation with ease, while Brent Celek had a long reception because Washington couldn't bring him down. Much of the same was expected from Philadelphia's stop unit, but the Eagles were inexplicably dominant on the defensive side of the ball. They put a massive amount of pressure on Robert Griffin, who often didn't have any time to throw whatsoever. This was particularly prevalent on a trip to the red zone when Griffin was hit as he was about to release the ball. He lost a fumble as a result, negating Washington's best scoring chance of the day until a late touchdown in the 4.h quarter. Griffin struggled to get anything going for most of the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - a high number considering that he scrambled out of some tackles - and as a result, he was just 7-of-15 for 57 yards and an interception on a tipped screen that was overturned before Philadelphia's defense eased up a bit. Griffin finished 17-of-35 for 264 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick along with 44 rushing yards on 10 scampers, but don't be fooled; the Eagles smothered him, prompting many poor throws, including 1 where he missed an open Logan Paulsen to set up the offense in the red zone. This was all thanks to outstanding performances by Fletcher Cox, Connor Barwin, DeMeco Ryans and others.    The Eagles were guilty of some pretty poor prevent defense in the 4.h quarter, allowing Griffin to make this result a lot closer than it really was. Griffin actually had a chance to tie the game, as he reached the end zone with less than a minute remaining in regulation, but he was once again under pressure, forcing an incredibly dumb throw in which he heaved the ball off his back foot. The pass was easily intercepted, ending the game.    Nick Foles, chosen way after Griffin in the 2012 NFL Draft, was the better quarterback on the field. He continuously torched Washington's helpless stop unit, going 17-of-26 for 298 yards along with 47 rushing yards and a touchdown on 9 scrambles. Foles would've had an even greater statistical day had the Redskins been able to keep up; he had 217 yards on 9-of-15 passing at intermission. Foles had been targeting Riley Cooper frequently over the past few weeks, but he spread the ball around evenly in this contest. No Eagle had more than 4 catches, as DeSean Jackson led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 82 yards. Cooper managed only 3 catches for 37 yards.    LeSean McCoy also had 4 receptions (73 receiving yards) to go along with 77 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. McCoy went down and grabbed his hamstring in the second quarter. It appeared to be serious, but he was able to take the field after intermission.    Some Washington numbers: - McCoy downfield for some strange reason.

He gained 38 yards on just 8 carries, though he did have 5 catches for 68 receiving yards.    As for the winning team, Cassel finished with outstanding numbers, going 26-of-35 for 382 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception that wasn't his fault because the ball was deflected. Cassel endured some drops, so his stats could've even looked better. Again, Cassel was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. Or, perhaps, Philadelphia's defense was just bad.    Cassel's touchdowns went to "

The Saints were porous against the run during the weeks heading into this matchup, so McCoy's struggles were shocking.    Chip Kelly made a couple of mistakes in his first playoff game. He carelessly burned a timeout in the second half. I also thought he made an error by kicking a field goal on 4.h-and-1 at the 7-yard line, down 20-14 in the 4.h quarter. Kelly had to know that Brees would score again, so going for it would've been the right move.    Foles' touchdowns went to Cooper (6-68) and Ertz (3-22). Cooper's score came immediately following an Ertz drop in the end zone, so the rookie tight end was very close to snatching 2 touchdowns.    Some other notes/stats for the Saints: - Sproles led New Orleans in receptions with 4 for 31 receiving yards. He was 1 of the heroes, as he had a nice return prior to the final drive, which was aided by a McCoy so limited. He gained just 77 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries.

McCoy lost a fumble deep in his own territory during the third quarter, but the Eagles' defense held Dallas to a field goal, thanks to shoddy protection from Romo's line. McCoy let another ball fall out of his hands later in the game, but he was ruled down by contact following a replay review.    McCoy didn't do anything in the passing attack, leaving the receivers to do all of the work in that regard. Maclin reeled in 8 of his 10 targets for 108 yards. "

After some defensive breakdowns - more on that later - Mark Sanchez threw an interception on a pass behind Jeremy Maclin. A Vinny Curry roughing-the-passer infraction - this 1 was actually legit - allowed Washington to move into field-goal range, and they got even closer on a Connor Barwin offsides penalty (which was Philadelphia's 13th infraction of the game). Chip Kelly foolishly didn't let them score a touchdown, permitting the Redskins to bleed the clock and nail a chip shot to seal the 27-24 victory. With this loss, the Eagles need to win at New York and then have the Cowboys lose both of their remaining games. That could happen - Dallas has endured worse collapses - but there's no guarantee that Philadelphia will even prevail against the Giants, given the team's issues.    I mentioned the defensive breakdowns; Philadelphia's secondary was primarily responsible for this defeat. The 3 poor defensive backs - Cary Williams, Bradley Fletcher, Nate Allen - all had a big hand in this loss. Williams began the game by being penalized for unnecessary roughness on a third-down stop, pushing Andre Roberts after the play was over. DeSean Jackson torched Fletcher for a 51-yard gain on the following drive. Jackson later haul in a 55-yard bomb and then proceeded to draw what looked like 5 pass-interference flags on Allen in the end zone. Williams then whiffed on a Pierre Garcon tackle, allowing the Redskins to move in for the game-winning kick.    Sanchez didn't help matters. His fantasy numbers were great, but he was guilty of 2 turnovers. The pick at the end was a killer, and he also opened the game with a lost fumble, forced by Ryan Kerrigan, who easily beat Lane Johnson. Sanchez finished 37-of-50 for 374 yards, 2 touchdowns, the interception and the fumble. He looked great at times - he converted a third-and-25 with a 26-yard dart to Jordan Matthews and had several other impressive throws - but as usual with Sanchez, the turnovers proved to be too costly.    Sanchez made it a point to throw to Zach Ertz as much as possible. I'm not exaggerating; Ertz drew a ridiculous 18 targets - twice more than the player who saw the next-most amount of balls thrown his way (Darren Sproles). Ertz hauled in 15 of those passes for 115 yards.    Both of Sanchez's touchdowns went to Riley Cooper (5-53), who dropped a pass. Jeremy Maclin (4-62) and Jordan Matthews (3-58) were big disappointments considering their matchup against Washington's poor secondary.    LeSean McCoy also scored. He managed 88 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and also caught 3 balls for 28 receiving yards. He had a drop, but ran well considering that Washington's defense has been so stout versus ground attacks this season.    As for the Redskins, Robert Griffin had a mixed outing, going 16-of-23 for 220 yards and an interception, which he forced into double coverage. He didn't run nearly enough - 5 scrambles, 11 rush yards - and he was nearly pick-sixed early in the game, but he completed a pair of deep bombs to Jackson. He made some mistakes, showing poor footwork on some attempts and holding on to the ball too long, but he was robbed of a touchdown when Allen tackled Jackson in the end zone prior to the ball arriving.    Jackson talked trash about the Eagles leading up to this game, and he backed up his talk. He caught 4 balls for 126 yards, reeling in receptions of 55 and 51 yards. There's no doubt that Philadelphia missed Jackson's game-breaking ability this year, but it's not like he's done much for the Redskins.

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy completion. A defensive hold negated a punting situation for the Patriots, which ultimately led to another New England score, thanks to a 40-yard catch by Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, LeGarrette Blount was barely used. He was given 2 carries, which he turned into 4 yards. This obviously has to be very disconcerting for Blount owners, but I wouldn't drop him just yet.    Speaking of disappointing players, Watkins had a miserable afternoon. Sure, he caught 6 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown, but most of that came in garbage time. Watkins made a number of mistakes (drops, penalties) that resulted in failed drives and turnovers. I have no idea why he's struggling so much, but he's worth unloading if you can get close to equal value for him. I'm not sure how realistic that is, however.    Another player who had misleading stats, Tyrod Taylor went 23-of-30 for 242 yards, 3 touchdowns and a trio of interceptions. He also scored a 4.h time on the ground with 5 scrambles for 43 rushing yards. Taylor's interceptions were all terrible, as Belichick appeared to confuse him. Most of his yardage came in meaningless action, and once the Bills were somehow within 1 possession, he fired a high pass to Watkins that was picked off. Taylor's other touchdowns were thrown to Robert Woods (3-60) and Charles Clay (3-19). The former isn't worth rostering in 12-team leagues. Clay is an OK tight end, but you can usually do better.    LeSean McCoy had a decent outing overall, but it was disappointing after what DeAngelo Williams did to New England's stop unit in the season opener.McCoy completion.

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and 1 of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was Jordan Matthews, who caught 3 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came very late in garbage time. Matthews dropped a pass in the third quarter, but that was a result of a brutal, but legal hit.    Excluding Matthews and someone named Trey Burton (2-49), no other Eagle had more than 21 receiving yards. Cooper (2-16) was barely a factor, while disappointing rookie Nelson Agholor (2-15) was flagged at 1 point for taking off his helmet following a first-down conversion.    It wasn't surprising to see DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. "

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and 1 of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was Jordan Matthews, who caught 3 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came very late in garbage time. Matthews dropped a pass in the third quarter, but that was a result of a brutal, but legal hit.    Excluding Matthews and someone named Trey Burton (2-49), no other Eagle had more than 21 receiving yards. Cooper (2-16) was barely a factor, while disappointing rookie Nelson Agholor (2-15) was flagged at 1 point for taking off his helmet following a first-down conversion.    It wasn't surprising to see DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. "

Three plays later, Sammy Watkins went over Kevin Johnson for a short touchdown catch. The Texans got going with Chris Polk gashing Buffalo for 20 yards, before Hoyer converted a third down with a pass to offensive lineman Kendall Lamm, and then Jonathan Grimes ran for 18 yards on a third-and-7. The Texans ran a quick play when the Bills defense wasn't even lined up, so Hoyer threw to the flat to Ryan Griffin, who walked into the end zone from a few yards out. Nick Novak missed the extra point. Buffalo came right back as McCoy bounced a run to the outside for 32 yards. More McCoy runs moved the ball inside the 10-yard line. Taylor finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans answered as Hoyer methodically moved the ball down the field before throwing an 11-yard touchdown to Polk. Watkins soon beat Johnson again for a 53-yard bomb inside the Houston 20. On third-and-goal, Robert Woods beat Johnson for a short touchdown. The Bills took a 21-13 lead into halftime. Late in the third quarter, Watkins burned Jonathan Joseph on a double move to get open for a 52-yard catch. Buffalo missed the field goal, though. DeAndre Hopkins came alive as the Texans moved the ball down the field with passes to their star receiver for catches of 23 and 29 yards. He got away with a push-off on Ronald Darby to haul in a 19-yard touchdown to finish the possession. Grimes ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. McCoy ripped off a 20-yard run to get Buffalo to midfield in response. After the 2-minute warning, Charles Clay got wide open down the field for a 40-yard touchdown in busted coverage. Dan Carpenter missed the extra point, but the Bills' defense slammed the door for the win. Carpenter added a field goal after the Texans went 4.and-out.    Taylor was 11-of-21 for 211 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 28 yards and a score as well. Taylor played well against a good Houston defense, but got lucky as interceptions were dropped by Kevin Johnson and Andre Hal in the 4.h quarter. Hal's would have been a pick-six with 3 or 4 minutes remaining.    LeSean McCoy totaled 112 yards on 21 totes, but missed the majority of the second half in the concussion protocal.

He was virtually untouched and got great blocking on the play. On his second touchdown, McCoy ran to the edge and eluded several defenders before diving into the endzone.

He absolutely gashed the 49ers, carrying the ball 19 times for 140 yards and a whopping 3 touchdowns. It was his second straight week of averaging more than 7.4 yards per carry. That is absolutely ridiculous. As great as the numbers were for McCoy, he actually outperformed them. Nobody could keep track of McCoy on the field. He had numerous runs where he waited for his blockers to set up a lane, and then he was able to burst through. Arguably his best run came on a third-and-20 situation. He started running to the right before cutting back and running around multiple defenders to get the first down. He also was explosive on his touchdowns, bursting through the holes in the line with great speed and going in untouched almost every time. There is no question that McCoy is currently the best running back in the NFL. The change to Anthony Lynn as an offensive coordinator has done wonders for McCoy, and he should continue to be great for the rest of the season.    "

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy knocked out, well, you finally had your answer after watching this beauty.    This was a game that neither team really deserved to win. Both teams blew opportunities to pull away from 1 another, but neither was able to do it. At the end of the day, the Bills emerged victorious because they were able to make fewer mistakes than the Bengals. Andy Dalton was mediocre for the entire day. His numbers may not look bad at a glance, as he went 24-of-43 for 207 yards, a touchdown and 2 picks, but he really did not do much. Dalton spent a majority of the day dinking and dunking to his receivers. He rarely threw more than 10 yards down the field, and that really hurt the Bengals during the contest. That said, Dalton did have some nice throws. In particular, his touchdown to Tyler Boyd was a pretty pass. Dalton lofted it to the perfect spot in the back of the end zone where only his rookie receiver could grab it. That was Dalton's best play of the day. However, his interceptions were both brutal. The first was underthrown, and it was wobbling like crazy. On the second, he threw well behind Tyler Eifert, and it was tipped to Stephon Gilmore. Overall, Sunday was a tough day for Dalton, and the loss can partially be blamed on him.    Of course, there was another major reason for Dalton's struggles today. On the second offensive play of the day for the Bengals, A.J. Green left the game with a hamstring injury. He would not return. The stud receiver was writhing around in pain, and it frankly did not look good. The Bengals are fearing that Green tore his hamstring. With Green bound to miss time, look for Tyler Boyd to pick up some extra catches. The rookie looked fairly solid during the contest and emerged as Dalton's top target with Green out. Boyd ended up catching 6 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. This could be the beginning of a strong stretch for the second-round pick. Elsewhere, Brandon LaFell (4-32) and Eifert (3-37) were both decent. LaFell is still just a middling fantasy option at best. If Green is out longer term, LaFell could be a valuable bench asset.    In the running game, Jeremy Hill looked strong for the Bengals. Hill got 16 carries for 62 yards, but he performed better than those numbers. He ripped off a few nice gains and was able to move the pile in short-yardage and red-zone situations. Hill had a nice 20-yard burst that reminded many that he can be explosive when he needs to be. Hill should continue to be the starter for the Bengals. Meanwhile, Giovani Bernard put together a good game as well. He only got 21 yards on 7 carries, but he made an impact in the receiving attack. Bernard was Dalton's top checkdown, recording 5 catches for 40 yards. Unfortunately, Bernard tore his ACL.    The late-game clock management from Marvin Lewis and Andy Dalton was not too good. Dalton had just over 2 minutes to drive the ball down the field without any timeouts. Dalton was able to get the ball moving, but he constantly threw checkdowns over the middle of the field. The team needed a touchdown to have a chance at winning, but as a result of the play-calling, the Bengals were only able to have enough time to try a 30-yard Hail Mary. They were unable to convert as time expired.    Sunday was a bad day for kickers, and Mike Nugent was no exception. He missed both extra points, which were crucial to the outcome. Had Nugent made even 1. the Bengals may have had a chance to kick a game-winning field goal at the end.    For the Bills, this was a big win. However, their offense suffered a blow when they lost their top running back, LeSean McCoy. Late in the second half, McCoy took a carry out of bounds and got hit in the thumb. He grabbed at his hand and headed to the locker room early. He would not return with what was determined a dislocated thumb. Sources are saying that he will be OK and that the injury should not keep him out long. In limited action, McCoy had 5 carries for 33 yards and a touchdown. He waltzed into the end zone untouched on his score as the blocking was perfect. McCoy also had a 20-yard carry where he demonstrated his elusive ability. He is still 1 of the better runners in the league and is the catalyst for the Bills' offense. In McCoy's stead, McCoy knocked out, well, you finally had your answer after watching this beauty.

   "comment":"LeSean McCoy. Many expected the strong lead back to have a terrific day against the hapless Browns, but he was really able to outdo himself. From the get-go, McCoy was absolutely stellar. He seemingly broke off 10-yard runs every single time he touched the ball and did a great job of following his blockers. McCoy is the poster child for patience at the NFL level, as he allows his blockers to open up lanes for him. That was apparent today, and it really helped McCoy to put up some huge numbers. Overall, McCoy saw 19 carries on the day and turned them into a whopping 153 yards. He also scored 2 very impressive touchdowns. On the first 1. it was a 3-yard plunge where he followed his blockers straight into the end zone. He was virtually untouched. The second 1 was 1 of the best plays of the day for the Bills, as he stutter-stepped and then ran to the outside. He used his speed to get outside of 5 Cleveland defenders and walk in. That play helped to seal the deal for Buffalo. Mike Gillislee also saw a good deal of action on the ground. He got 9 carries for 37 yards and got an early touchdown as well. He continues to see some goal-line work, but he is not a recommended start in any fantasy formats.    In the passing game, the Bills had a fairly strong performance. The performance of Tyrod Taylor was pretty solid, and he made a case to keep his starting job for next season. Taylor was near-perfect statistically, going 17-for-24 with 174 yards and a touchdown. Taylor displayed some great accuracy, and he really has the potential to be a better player. Despite playing with only a couple of legitimate receiving options, Taylor was able to help the offense put up 33 points. He had a very nice throw on his touchdown pass, where he had gotten crushed by 3 Browns, but was still able to get the ball to Charles Clay down the field. Once again, Taylor's biggest asset was his mobility. Taylor had 7 scrambles on the day and turned them into 49 yards. He had 1 very nice run where he rounded the corner and worked his way down the sideline before being shoved out. The play netted the team 28 yards. The Bills need to consider starting Taylor next year. He is still a work in progress, but he has proven at times to be a solid option. Even if the franchise parts way with Rex Ryan, Taylor should begin 2017 as the quarterback.    Thanks to Taylor's success, the Bills were able to support some solid receiving performances. The leader on the day was Charles Clay (7-72, 1 TD), and it was definitely the tight end's best game of the year. Clay was able to matchup well against the Browns' linebackers and was Taylor's favorite target. Most weeks, Clay is nothing more than a TE2. However, he could fare well in the team's matchup with the Jets next week. The other top receivers on the day were Marquise Goodwin (3-43) and LeSean McCoy (3-16). Both McCoy. Many expected the strong lead back to have a terrific day against the hapless Browns, but he was really able to outdo himself. From the get-go, McCoy was absolutely stellar. He seemingly broke off 10-yard runs every single time he touched the ball and did a great job of following his blockers. McCoy is the poster child for patience at the NFL level, as he allows his blockers to open up lanes for him. That was apparent today, and it really helped McCoy to put up some huge numbers. Overall, McCoy saw 19 carries on the day and turned them into a whopping 153 yards. He also scored 2 very impressive touchdowns. On the first 1. it was a 3-yard plunge where he followed his blockers straight into the end zone. He was virtually untouched. The second 1 was 1 of the best plays of the day for the Bills, as he stutter-stepped and then ran to the outside. He used his speed to get outside of 5 Cleveland defenders and walk in. That play helped to seal the deal for Buffalo. "
