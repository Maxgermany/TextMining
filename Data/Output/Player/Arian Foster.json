   "comment":"Foster on his first carry as part of a 65-yard march for a quick 7-0 lead. Little did they know his rushes would be stuffed from that point forward, as he gained only 48 more yards on his 21 additional attempts. You don't need a calculator to figure out how low the average was on those plays. The Houston defense again stood up, forcing a 3.and-out for Oakland, but after converting their 4.h consecutive third down to open the game, Schaub was intercepted by Lamarr Houston on a pass deflected by John Henderson. Tipped passes would be a theme on the day with the Raiders finishing with 6 by my count. This was a turning point when it came to converting third downs. Houston would go just 4-for-16 the rest of the way after having converted their first 4. Even though the defense moved the Raiders back a yard, Janikowski's long field goal made it a 7-3 game. Houston had a 3.and-out, setting up another field goal drive for Oakland of minus-2 yards because Bruce Davis (no relation obviously, but fitting) blocked the punt. Then, Schaub hit tight end Owen Daniels, who had a solid game (7 receptions for 89 yards), for a pickup of 28, but the drive died when Gary Kubiak did not have the confidence to go for it on 4.h down, needing just 2 yards from the Oakland 45. The move paid off with a punt pinning the Raiders at the 2. Campbell immediately threw deep and was intercepted by Jason Allen. On Houston's first play, Schaub found Joel Dreessen wide open for a 56-yard touchdown, taking advantage of linebacker Rolando McClain missing coverage. It appeared McClain was running gingerly and suffering from some sort of injury. At 14-6, with a huge advantage in total yards, and the crowd behind them and things were going very smoothly early in the second quarter for the home team. Two punts on each side later, Oakland's offense woke up starting on their own 25 at the 2.minute warning. Campbell hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for 18 yards twice and then for 34 yards and a touchdown on an eye-popping drive. Heyward-Bey, 1 of the picks Al Davis was criticized heavily for making because Texas Tech's more-heralded Michael Crabtree was on the board, finished with 7 receptions for 99 yards and that score. A missed 2.point conversion left Houston ahead 14-12, which remained the score at halftime.    At the break, the Raiders had an opportunity to take advantage of Mario Williams, who left the game in the first quarter, being out of the lineup. Rookie Brooks Reed did not do a bad job stepping in, but the front 7 was not nearly as effective the rest of the way. On the other hand, Oakland's front made Schaub uneasy. He was only sacked 3 times, but looked out of it at times, and was an erratic 24-for-51, with the aforementioned tipped passes a huge problem.    After a punt from each side to start the second half, Houston found a way to involve Foster. He took a screen 60 yards and would finish with a game-high 116 yards receiving on 5 catches. Needless to say, Andre Johnson was missed, but 4 Texans had at least 81 yards receiving. The drive immediately stalled, and it was wasted when "

Colt McCoy didn't threaten the secondary, and it didn't help that Chris Ogbonnaya (13-28), starting in place of Peyton Hillis and Montario Hardesty, coughed up the ball right away. Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. If it wasn't obvious before, Cleveland has to look for a new quarterback this offseason.    Only 1 Cleveland receiver (Josh Cribbs) had more than 2 receptions (5-50, TD). Greg Little (2-33) was not a factor, outside of the fact that he spent some time arguing with McCoy on the sideline.    None of the Houston wideouts did much either, only because Matt Schaub (14-23, 119 yards, 1 INT) didn't have to throw much. Owen Daniels (3-32) had the most yardage, while Foster actually led the team in receptions (5-26).    Speaking of Foster, he barely had more rushing yardage (19-124, TD) than Tate (12-115, TD).

   "comment":"Foster fumbled the ball on the opening drive. Carolina quickly scored afterward when Cam Newton hit Steve Smith for a 26-yard touchdown, beating top cornerback Johnathan Joseph. After another Carolina touchdown, Owen Daniels dropped a routine catch past the first-down marker on a 3rd-and-7. T.J. Yates then had an awful interception on the next drive The Panthers, meanwhile, went up 21-0 on a crazy Fumblerooski play that caught the Texans completely unawares.    Houston's defense sucked the entire afternoon, but I'm not sure if it's because this game meant nothing to them, or if it was because Phillips was missing. Cam Newton basically did what he wanted, finishing 13-of-23 for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 55 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The Texans brought him down just twice.    DeAngelo Williams (15-61, TD) and Jonathan Stewart (11-43) combined to rush for about 4 yards per carry. Prior to this contest, the Texans hadn't allowed more than 100 rushing yards to an opponent since Week 6.    Newton's scores went to Steve Smith (5-82) and Jeremy Shockey (2-35). When the latter scored, he did a little too much celebrating. As this happened, I posted on the forum, Shockey TD. Begins trash talking. Forgets that he sucks.    The Panthers were up 21-0 at the break, but given how terrible they've been at maintaining leads, this contest was far from over. T.J. Yates' ineptness made the victory possible for Carolina, however. Yates (19-of-30, 212 yards, 2 INTs) made a few good throws and was betrayed by his receivers at times, but 2 mistakes really cost him. I already mentioned the first pick. The second occurred when the score was 28-13 with 8 minutes remaining. Houston was in the red zone with a chance to draw within 1 score. Yates felt phantom pressure, scrambled right and tossed a hideous pick late across his body. Yates still has talent and has the supporting cast to win a playoff game, but this game was a reminder for Houston fans that he's just a fifth-round rookie with only a handful of starts.    Most of Yates' completions were of the short variety to his running backs. Foster paced the team with 5 catches and 58 receiving yards. Daniels (2-29) had a poor outing.    Foster was great outside of that initial fumble, rushing for 109 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries to go along with the aforementioned receiving yardage. I'd say it's a shame the Texans couldn't run more because they were in a hole early, but they screwed themselves with dumb mistakes. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Foster managed to rush for 132 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. This made things easier for T.J. Yates. Of course, Yates' turnovers made things easier for the Ravens. Yates went 17-of-35 for 184 yards and 3 interceptions. He could have been picked off on 5 occasions, but Ed Reed dropped 2 interceptions in the first half. Yates' problem wasn't accuracy; in fact, most of his throws were on the money. The issue was that he predetermined where he wanted to go on some of his attempts. He stared down Andre Johnson far too often, including the last real drive of the contest when he foolishly heaved a ball downfield despite being at midfield and having ample time remaining on the clock.    Yates wasn't the only player giving the ball up. Jacoby Jones made 1 of the dumbest plays in NFL history when he picked up a bouncing punt amid traffic. He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy. He was understandably dejected afterward, and Foster looked even more frustrated. You have to feel for the Texans, who would probably be the Super Bowl favorites if Matt Schaub were still healthy. Having Schaub in the lineup would make Houston the most balanced team in the league.    As for the Raven wideouts, Flacco was glad to have "

   "comment":"Foster (28 carries, 110 yards, 1 touchdown) and Ben Tate (12-74, 2 TDs) both gashed the defense. Matt Schaub, meanwhile, completed a high percentage of his passes (26-of-35, 195 yards), though he didn't throw for much yardage. He didn't need to though with his 2 runners trampling the opposing stop unit. Jacksonville will be better defensively once it gets several of its key players back (linebacker Daryl Smith, cornerback Derek Cox), but Gabbert simply doesn't give this team a chance to win. Gene Smith needs to be fired for taking a homoclitic approach to his quarterbacking situation this offseason.    The Texans had a really clean game, but screwed up just before halftime. They didn't have any timeouts, and the clock was ticking down on what would have been a 4th-and-5. Gary Kubiak hesitated in terms of making his decision, and by the time he called the play in to Schaub, it was too late. The play clock expired, and Houston was whistled for a delay of game. This sort of sloppiness needs to be cleaned up if Houston wants to make a deep playoff run.    Some fantasy players of note: - Maurice Jones-Drew rushed for 60 yards on 12 carries, but saved his fantasy owners with a weird, short touchdown reception in the third quarter. - Andre Johnson barely did anything, catching just 3 balls for 21 yards. Houston's leading receiver was tight end Owen Daniels (6-47). - I mentioned earlier that Tate scored twice. He nearly found the end zone a third time. A run of his was ruled a touchdown, but was overturned by replay. He was stuffed at the 1-yard line on the next carry. Foster then entered the contest and waltzed into the end zone on the ensuing play. I'd say Tate owners were cheated, but he did have 2 touchdowns. - "

   "comment":"Foster broke a couple of big gains in the final couple of minutes to give Houston a bulls*** front-door cover on a successful chip-shot field goal.    Luck handled himself well. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes, going 13-of-27 for 186 yards, but he threw 2 touchdowns. The impressive thing is that he didn't turn the ball over despite battling heavy pressure all afternoon. The Texans sacked Luck 5 times, including once at the end of the first quarter when he was hit so hard that I didn't think he'd be able to get up. J.J. Watt got to Luck on 3 occasions, giving him 19.5 sacks on the year.    While the offensive line couldn't pass protect, it did a good job of opening up running lanes. Vick Ballard posted great numbers, gaining 105 yards on 18 carries. With that in mind, it makes you wonder what the hell Moore (4-6) was doing on the goal line.    As previously mentioned, Wayne missed out on a touchdown. He would end up disappointing his fantasy owners with just 3 catches for 14 yards. Luck's scores were thrown to TY Hilton (3-78) and Dwayne Allen (3-36).    As for the Texans, they opened up impressively with a Matt Schaub 52-yard bomb to Andre Johnson. The veteran wideout would end up with 11 grabs for 151 yards and a touchdown. The Colts simply had no answer for him.    Schaub finished 23-of-31 for 261 yards and a touchdown. The lack of misfires was impressive considering that the Colts did a decent job of pressuring him. They brought him down 3 times.    Foster was bottled up for most of the afternoon until he started breaking big gains in the second half. He had bursts of 31, 10, 27 (negated by hold), 26 and 25, all after intermission.

Making matters worse, Foster lost a fumble in the first half and later exited the contest in the second half with an irregular heartbeat. Foster called it a very minor situation. Meanwhile, Ponder had some brilliant moments, as indicated earlier. He also made several terrible throws. It was crazy how inconsistent he was. He'd make an awful-looking pass and then come back and convert a long-yardage situation. In all, Minnesota was 9-of-18 on third down, as Ponder went 16-of-30 for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also had 7 scrambles for 48 rushing yards.    Adrian Peterson still was great though. The Texans loaded the box on every play, so Peterson had many losses. However, he broke loose for several impressive gains, ultimately finishing with 86 yards on 25 carries. Peterson now has 1,898 rushing yards. He needs 208 yards to break Dickerson's record, which is feasible, though the Packers, who happen to be next week's opponent, just limited "

   "comment":"Foster posted a picture of a Boston Globe article as his Twitter avatar this week. This article discussed how the Patriots were extremely fortunate to have 2 byes in the playoffs. Foster and his team used this as motivation. No 1 was giving them a chance despite their 12-4 record, so they were geared up for this rematch. Well, it turns out the Boston Globe was absolutely correct. The Patriots were granted 2 byes this January after all. The Texans offered very little resistance, and this final score isn't indicative of how much of a blowout this was. New England was up 38-13 at 1 point, and if the team didn't take the foot off the gas, it probably could have won by 40. This game was all about great plays by "

   "comment":"Foster picked up big chunks on the ground, Ryan Fitzpatrick actually completed some passes, while J.J. Watt dominated the line of scrimmage on the other side of the ball. Watt was an animal, finishing with 7 tackles, 2 sacks, several passes batted down and a fumble recovery for a touchdown that finally put the game in reach for the Texans. Watt, who is the first player in the NFL since 1961 to have a receiving touchdown, a pick-six and a fumble returned for a score in the same season - and it's only Week 6 - cut the deficit to 5. Houston had 2 possessions after that to potentially come away with a victory, but simply couldn't make it happen. Andre Johnson screwed up the first time, getting called for offensive pass interference and then losing a fumble. The second drive ended quickly, as former first-rounder Bjoern Werner strip-sacked Fitzpatrick. The Colts recovered, clinching a victory.    Both Andrew Luck and Watt didn't disappoint in their latest of many epic battles to come. Watt, as mentioned, was awesome, but Luck was a bit better. The former No. 1 pick generated 300-plus yards for the 4.h-straight contest, going 25-of-44 for 370 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped by Jared Crick. Luck's performance was exemplary, especially considering that he was dealing with 2 backup guards and a center making his second career start. The center screwed up on 1 play, snapping the ball before Luck was ready. This was when Watt scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown. Luck targeted T.Y. Hilton early and often. The speedy wideout hauled in all 9 of the passes thrown his way for a whopping 223 yards and a touchdown. His yardage total was just 1 shy of Hall of Famer Raymond Berry's single-game record for the Colts. Dwayne Allen (3-49) and Reggie Wayne (4-35) were next on the receiving list.    I'm a bit perplexed about Indianapolis' decision to feature Trent Richardson more than Ahmad Bradshaw once again. Bradshaw garnered more of a workload last week and was once again the superior runner in this contest. However, Richardson was given 17 carries compared to 11 for Bradshaw. Richardson barely outgained Bradshaw, 41-34, but had that aforementioned touchdown. Bradshaw had the best run of the night, a 13-yarder, in which he leapt over Johnathan Joseph and hurdled Brian Cushing to pick up a key first down. He also caught 3 balls for 25 receiving yards and a touchdown. Richardson, meanwhile, spent too much time dancing around, searching for holes that just weren't going to open up.    Foster, as mentioned, had a huge outing. He started slowly, like all of the other Texans, but he ultimately finished with 109 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 20 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 32 receiving yards.    Fitzpatrick also got hot late, and the loss wasn't on him because he would've been in position to win had Johnson not coughed up the ball late in the game. Fitzpatrick misfired on just 8 attempts, going 15-of-23 for 212 yards, 1 touchdown and the lost fumble. He had to deal with lots of pressure in the pocket, as the Colts mustered 5 sacks and hit him on many other plays. Fitzpatrick's sole score went to Johnson, who had a big game outside of that 1 fateful drive. Johnson logged 7 receptions for 99 yards. Hopkins, meanwhile, never rebounded from that early drop. He managed just 1 catch for 12 yards on the evening. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Watt snuffed out the drive by drawing a holding penalty on Anthony Castanzo and getting his second sack of the game. If it weren't for some big plays by Watt and the pick-six, the Texans wouldn't have been in the game. The Texans got going in the second half with a 30-yard pass to DeVier Posey (1-30).

How can a quarterback lead a team when he's actually visibly upset that his own team is winning?    Speaking of Foster, he had a very mixed game. He looked good early on, but was partly to blame for an early pick. He then took some negative plays. For example, he reversed field and was swallowed up for a loss of 4. Foster then appeared to be concussed, but somehow snuck onto the field. The coaching staff finally noticed and took his helmet away. Foster was eventually cleared in the third quarter, but by then, the Colts were way ahead. Foster managed just 41 yards on 19 carries, as rookie nose tackle "

   "comment":"Foster returned this week from his hamstring injury, so the prevailing thought was that he would be the lead back, but instead it was Ajayi, who fended off the committee to take over as the bell-cow back in the second half. Ajayi looked strong all game, but as the Steelers had trouble moving the ball, their defense spent too much time on the field, allowing Ajayi and Miami's offensive line beat them down to the tune of 25 carries for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 62-yard scoring scamper that iced the game.    The Dolphins played inspired ball at times, but you can't devalue the injury to Roethlisberger. After returning to the field, he quickly floated a pass right to the Dolphins and just never looked right without his mobility. The Steelers are no doubt a much better team than the way they played in Miami, but they also very much need Roethlisberger healthy, much like last season. That begs the question, why is Landry Jones still Pittsburgh's backup? He is awful and should be on a scout team at best. I understand there is a huge dearth of quality quarterbacks in the league, but a decent backup should have been a major priority after their offense tanked when Roethlisberger was out last season.    This was a weird game. It's hard to tell how much better the Dolphins were due to Roethlisberger's injury, but 222 yards on the ground at 6.2 yards per carry against the Steelers, who had allowed just 70 yards per game to running backs. And to heap some more crazy statistical insults, the Dolphins had come into this game averaging 58 yards rushing per game.    Roethlisberger will get an MRI on his knee, and then the Steelers take on the red-hot Patriots at home. Pittsburgh will need Roethlisberger healthy, or it will be a massacre. The Dolphins, on the other hand, also face a red-hot team as the Buffalo Bills head into Miami, coming off 4 straight wins.   "
