Little did they know his rushes would be stuffed from that point forward, as he gained only 48 more yards on his 21 additional attempts. You don't need a calculator to figure out how low the average was on those plays. The Houston defense again stood up, forcing a 3.and-out for Oakland, but after converting their 4.h consecutive third down to open the game, Schaub was intercepted by Foster on his first carry as part of a 65-yard march for a quick 7-0 lead. Little did they know his rushes would be stuffed from that point forward, as he gained only 48 more yards on his 21 additional attempts. You don't need a calculator to figure out how low the average was on those plays. The Houston defense again stood up, forcing a 3.and-out for Oakland, but after converting their 4.h consecutive third down to open the game, Schaub was intercepted by Lamarr Houston on a pass deflected by John Henderson. Tipped passes would be a theme on the day with the Raiders finishing with 6 by my count. This was a turning point when it came to converting third downs. Houston would go just 4-for-16 the rest of the way after having converted their first 4. Even though the defense moved the Raiders back a yard, Janikowski's long field goal made it a 7-3 game. Houston had a 3.and-out, setting up another field goal drive for Oakland of minus-2 yards because Bruce Davis (no relation obviously, but fitting) blocked the punt. Then, Schaub hit tight end Owen Daniels, who had a solid game (7 receptions for 89 yards), for a pickup of 28, but the drive died when Gary Kubiak did not have the confidence to go for it on 4.h down, needing just 2 yards from the Oakland 45. The move paid off with a punt pinning the Raiders at the 2. Campbell immediately threw deep and was intercepted by Jason Allen. On Houston's first play, Schaub found Joel Dreessen wide open for a 56-yard touchdown, taking advantage of linebacker Rolando McClain missing coverage. It appeared McClain was running gingerly and suffering from some sort of injury. At 14-6, with a huge advantage in total yards, and the crowd behind them and things were going very smoothly early in the second quarter for the home team. Two punts on each side later, Oakland's offense woke up starting on their own 25 at the 2.minute warning. Campbell hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for 18 yards twice and then for 34 yards and a touchdown on an eye-popping drive. Heyward-Bey, 1 of the picks Al Davis was criticized heavily for making because Texas Tech's more-heralded Michael Crabtree was on the board, finished with 7 receptions for 99 yards and that score. A missed 2.point conversion left Houston ahead 14-12, which remained the score at halftime.    At the break, the Raiders had an opportunity to take advantage of Mario Williams, who left the game in the first quarter, being out of the lineup. Rookie Brooks Reed did not do a bad job stepping in, but the front 7 was not nearly as effective the rest of the way. On the other hand, Oakland's front made Schaub uneasy. He was only sacked 3 times, but looked out of it at times, and was an erratic 24-for-51, with the aforementioned tipped passes a huge problem.    After a punt from each side to start the second half, Houston found a way to involve Foster. He took a screen 60 yards and would finish with a game-high 116 yards receiving on 5 catches. Needless to say, Andre Johnson was missed, but 4 Texans had at least 81 yards receiving. The drive immediately stalled, and it was wasted when "

Colt McCoy didn't threaten the secondary, and it didn't help that Chris Ogbonnaya (13-28), starting in place of Peyton Hillis and Montario Hardesty, coughed up the ball right away. Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. If it wasn't obvious before, Cleveland has to look for a new quarterback this offseason.    Only 1 Cleveland receiver (Josh Cribbs) had more than 2 receptions (5-50, TD). Greg Little (2-33) was not a factor, outside of the fact that he spent some time arguing with McCoy on the sideline.    None of the Houston wideouts did much either, only because Matt Schaub (14-23, 119 yards, 1 INT) didn't have to throw much. Owen Daniels (3-32) had the most yardage, while Foster actually led the team in receptions (5-26).    Speaking of Foster, he barely had more rushing yardage (19-124, TD) than Tate (12-115, TD). It's amazing how easily they both ran the ball against Cleveland.   "

   "comment":"Arian Foster and Andre Johnson who screwed up early on. Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands. The Texans recovered and were able to establish a 20-10 lead at halftime, but now there's a different question: Can they win with T.J. Yates? Leinart suffered a broken collarbone just prior to intermission. He finished 10-of-13 for 57 yards and a touchdown. Leinart was used in many bootlegs and tossed mostly checkdowns. The offense was just really limited with him. A penalty forced them into a 1st-and-20 at some point, and it was evident that they didn't stand a chance to convert the first down. Not that it matters though because Leinart is likely out for the year. Yates looked great on his first drive in the 2-minute drill, but was dreadful after the break. Finishing 8-of-15 for 70 yards, Yates converted only 1 first down in the second half. With Houston unable to run the ball, the team just hung on for its life. Fortunately for them, the Jaguars were so inept on offense that it didn't matter.    Blaine Gabbert was so bad in this contest that he was benched in favor of Luke McCown. Gabbert went 13-of-29 for 136 yards and an interception that looked like a punt. Once again, he had major issues with pocket awareness. He also has a terrible habit of not looking downfield amid a pass rush, and shows terrible body language when things aren't going well (which is often the case). Gabbert's inaccuracy doesn't help matters. It was so bad that the CBS announcers made fun of him. After a poor pass, the color analyst (I think it was Rich Gannon) said: You have throw the ball to the receiver; not close to the receiver. Gabbert actually should have thrown a touchdown, but Marcedes Lewis had a really bad drop. This was actually hilarious because a minute earlier, the CBS announcers were pleading for Gabbert to go to Lewis more often.    The Jaguars were able to stay competitive because of Maurice Jones-Drew, who rushed for 99 yards on 18 carries. He also paced the team in receptions (4) and receiving yards (67) because many of Gabbert's completions were checkdowns.    Speaking of checkdowns, Arian Foster hauled in 7 balls for 24 yards to go along with his mediocre rushing numbers (22-65, TD). Andre Johnson, meanwhile, had just 2 receptions for 22 yards because his quarterbacks couldn't get him the football. His first catch came with 2 minutes to go in the third quarter.    As for Houston's defense, Wade Phillips' unit compiled 7 sacks. Four of those came from Foster and Andre Johnson who screwed up early on. Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands. The Texans recovered and were able to establish a 20-10 lead at halftime, but now there's a different question: Can they win with "

   "comment":"Arian Foster fumbled the ball on the opening drive. Carolina quickly scored afterward when Foster fumbled the ball on the opening drive. Carolina quickly scored afterward when Cam Newton hit Steve Smith for a 26-yard touchdown, beating top cornerback Johnathan Joseph. After another Carolina touchdown, Owen Daniels dropped a routine catch past the first-down marker on a 3rd-and-7. T.J. Yates then had an awful interception on the next drive The Panthers, meanwhile, went up 21-0 on a crazy Fumblerooski play that caught the Texans completely unawares.    Houston's defense sucked the entire afternoon, but I'm not sure if it's because this game meant nothing to them, or if it was because Phillips was missing. Cam Newton basically did what he wanted, finishing 13-of-23 for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 55 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The Texans brought him down just twice.    DeAngelo Williams (15-61, TD) and Jonathan Stewart (11-43) combined to rush for about 4 yards per carry. Prior to this contest, the Texans hadn't allowed more than 100 rushing yards to an opponent since Week 6.    Newton's scores went to Steve Smith (5-82) and Jeremy Shockey (2-35). When the latter scored, he did a little too much celebrating. As this happened, I posted on the forum, Shockey TD. Begins trash talking. Forgets that he sucks.    The Panthers were up 21-0 at the break, but given how terrible they've been at maintaining leads, this contest was far from over. T.J. Yates' ineptness made the victory possible for Carolina, however. Yates (19-of-30, 212 yards, 2 INTs) made a few good throws and was betrayed by his receivers at times, but 2 mistakes really cost him. I already mentioned the first pick. The second occurred when the score was 28-13 with 8 minutes remaining. Houston was in the red zone with a chance to draw within 1 score. Yates felt phantom pressure, scrambled right and tossed a hideous pick late across his body. Yates still has talent and has the supporting cast to win a playoff game, but this game was a reminder for Houston fans that he's just a fifth-round rookie with only a handful of starts.    Most of Yates' completions were of the short variety to his running backs. Foster paced the team with 5 catches and 58 receiving yards. Daniels (2-29) had a poor outing.    Foster was great outside of that initial fumble, rushing for 109 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries to go along with the aforementioned receiving yardage. I'd say it's a shame the Texans couldn't run more because they were in a hole early, but they screwed themselves with dumb mistakes. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

He could have been picked off on 5 occasions, but Ed Reed dropped 2 interceptions in the first half. Yates' problem wasn't accuracy; in fact, most of his throws were on the money. The issue was that he predetermined where he wanted to go on some of his attempts. He stared down Andre Johnson far too often, including the last real drive of the contest when he foolishly heaved a ball downfield despite being at midfield and having ample time remaining on the clock.    Yates wasn't the only player giving the ball up. Jacoby Jones made 1 of the dumbest plays in NFL history when he picked up a bouncing punt amid traffic. He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy. He was understandably dejected afterward, and Foster looked even more frustrated. You have to feel for the Texans, who would probably be the Super Bowl favorites if "

   "comment":"Arian Foster left Thursday's practice and didn't do anything Friday because of a knee injury. He was a game-time decision, and ESPN's Chris Mortensen said that he would be limited. Well, Foster had 26 carries to Ben Tate's 5. F*** you, Mort. </i> The biggest take-away from this game is that the Texans' defense is the real deal. It made the Dolphins' offense look incapable of moving the ball and didn't allow a touchdown. Defensive end J.J. Watt deflected 2 passes into interceptions in the first half, and, the Houston defense produced a turnover in 4 straight possessions to basically win the game before halftime. The Texans' offense played flat throughout the early going, but the team's defense was so dominant, the offense didn't have to do much to have 24 points at the half. Houston controlled the ball in the third quarter. The defense played prevent to drain the clock in the 4.h quarter, and stopped Miami twice on 4.h-and-goal. Watt was an absolute animal for the Texans. He was a dominant force for 4 quarters and looks like he could be a NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate. All of Houston's defensive starters had good plays, including the secondary.    Houston entered this season having lost its 2011 starters on the right side of the offensive line, but right guard Antoine Caldwell and right tackle Derek Newton played very well in their debut for the Texans. They were solid in run defense and in pass protection. There was no visible drop off against the Dolphins.    There was speculation that Houston running back Arian Foster wouldn't play due to a calf injury, but the fantasy football superstar answered the bell for the Texans, among others. He was held mostly in check in the first half and had a couple of dropped passes. However, Foster came alive before halftime with a 14-yard touchdown behind the right side of his line with a great block from center "

Matt Schaub, meanwhile, completed a high percentage of his passes (26-of-35, 195 yards), though he didn't throw for much yardage. He didn't need to though with his 2 runners trampling the opposing stop unit. Jacksonville will be better defensively once it gets several of its key players back (linebacker Daryl Smith, cornerback Derek Cox), but Gabbert simply doesn't give this team a chance to win. Gene Smith needs to be fired for taking a homoclitic approach to his quarterbacking situation this offseason.    The Texans had a really clean game, but screwed up just before halftime. They didn't have any timeouts, and the clock was ticking down on what would have been a 4th-and-5. Gary Kubiak hesitated in terms of making his decision, and by the time he called the play in to Schaub, it was too late. The play clock expired, and Houston was whistled for a delay of game. This sort of sloppiness needs to be cleaned up if Houston wants to make a deep playoff run.    Some fantasy players of note: - Maurice Jones-Drew rushed for 60 yards on 12 carries, but saved his fantasy owners with a weird, short touchdown reception in the third quarter. - Andre Johnson barely did anything, catching just 3 balls for 21 yards. Houston's leading receiver was tight end Owen Daniels (6-47). - I mentioned earlier that Tate scored twice. He nearly found the end zone a third time. A run of his was ruled a touchdown, but was overturned by replay. He was stuffed at the 1-yard line on the next carry. Foster then entered the contest and waltzed into the end zone on the ensuing play. I'd say Tate owners were cheated, but he did have 2 touchdowns. - "

He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes, going 13-of-27 for 186 yards, but he threw 2 touchdowns. The impressive thing is that he didn't turn the ball over despite battling heavy pressure all afternoon.

The impressive thing is that he didn't turn the ball over despite battling heavy pressure all afternoon. The Texans sacked Luck 5 times, including once at the end of the first quarter when he was hit so hard that I didn't think he'd be able to get up. J.J. Watt got to Luck on 3 occasions, giving him 19.5 sacks on the year.    While the offensive line couldn't pass protect, it did a good job of opening up running lanes. Vick Ballard posted great numbers, gaining 105 yards on 18 carries. With that in mind, it makes you wonder what the hell Moore (4-6) was doing on the goal line.    As previously mentioned, Wayne missed out on a touchdown. He would end up disappointing his fantasy owners with just 3 catches for 14 yards. Luck's scores were thrown to TY Hilton (3-78) and Dwayne Allen (3-36).    As for the Texans, they opened up impressively with a Matt Schaub 52-yard bomb to Andre Johnson. The veteran wideout would end up with 11 grabs for 151 yards and a touchdown. The Colts simply had no answer for him.    Schaub finished 23-of-31 for 261 yards and a touchdown. The lack of misfires was impressive considering that the Colts did a decent job of pressuring him. They brought him down 3 times.    Foster was bottled up for most of the afternoon until he started breaking big gains in the second half. He had bursts of 31, 10, 27 (negated by hold), 26 and 25, all after intermission.

Making matters worse, Foster lost a fumble in the first half and later exited the contest in the second half with an irregular heartbeat. Foster called it a very minor situation. Meanwhile, Ponder had some brilliant moments, as indicated earlier. He also made several terrible throws. It was crazy how inconsistent he was. He'd make an awful-looking pass and then come back and convert a long-yardage situation. In all, Minnesota was 9-of-18 on third down, as Ponder went 16-of-30 for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also had 7 scrambles for 48 rushing yards.    Adrian Peterson still was great though. The Texans loaded the box on every play, so Peterson had many losses. However, he broke loose for several impressive gains, ultimately finishing with 86 yards on 25 carries. Peterson now has 1,898 rushing yards. He needs 208 yards to break Dickerson's record, which is feasible, though the Packers, who happen to be next week's opponent, just limited Foster to 15 yards on 10 carries.

It makes no sense. </i>    There is no doubt that the 2-0 Texans have some fight in them. Houston had a vigorous comeback against San Diego last Monday night, but looked dead in the water late in the 4.h quarter this week before some great throws by Matt Schaub to rookie DeAndre Hopkins led to an overtime win. The Titans came close to being 2-0 with road wins at Houston and Pittsburgh, but the Tennessee secondary couldn't close out the win for the team to now be 1-1. The Titans were down 14-10 at the start of the 4.h quarter when Chris Johnson was stopped in his own end zone for a safety. Tennessee started its next next drive at its own 1.yard line and moved the ball 99 yards for the lead. Jake Locker hit some big throws to Nate Washington (3-50) and Kendall Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Delanie Walker for a 10-yard touchdown. On the next third down, Schaub threw a weak pass off his back foot and it floated right to Alterraun Verner, who cruised into the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown. Hopkins ran the wrong route to set up the interception. The Texans responded by moving the ball with passes to Hopkins and a gain to Andre Johnson to the 3-yard line. Johnson (8-76) was injured on the play and headed into the locker room to end his game with what looked like a possible concussion courtesy of a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bernard Pollard.

   "comment":"Arian Foster when he had the ball on the ground very late in the game. Foster rolled forward past the first-down marker, giving Houston the win. The poor effort they displayed was staggering.    Watkins overcame his early drops by finishing the game with 4 catches for 30 yards and a touchdown. Mike Williams (2-84) reeled in Manuel's other score, thanks to a breakdown in coverage.    Fred Jackson was the star in the Bills' backfield last week, so C.J. Spiller naturally grabbed the reins in this contest, gaining 60 yards on 15 carries, while Jackson took his mere 7 attempts for 33 yards. However, Jackson was used more in the passing game. He logged 6 catches for 52 receiving yards, while Spiller secured all 3 targets thrown his way for 24 receiving yards.    Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    Foster when he had the ball on the ground very late in the game.

He dominated 1 drive single-handedly, bursting for a big gain and then making a nice cut, juking Barry Church, and running into the end zone.    DeAndre Hopkins (6-63) and Andre Johnson (5-58) both had marginal outings for their fantasy owners. Excluding Foster, they were the only players to see more than 2 targets.    It's a short trip, but I was impressed by the Texans' fans, who made the trip to Dallas. They made their presence known throughout the afternoon, as Bloooo was heard every time "

   "comment":"Arian Foster that the Colts recovered. Indianapolis took advantage with a nice run by Boom Herron (11-60) and an 18-yard pass to Nicks to move the ball to the 3-yard line. Luck fired a fastball to Foster that the Colts recovered. Indianapolis took advantage with a nice run by Boom Herron (11-60) and an 18-yard pass to Nicks to move the ball to the 3-yard line. Luck fired a fastball to Dwayne Allen (2-16) for a 3-yard touchdown on the next play. Savage struggled, but did connect on a 35-yard pass to DeAndre Hopkins (5-77) to move the ball to midfield. The drive then stalled, and just before the half, the Colts stuffed a fake punt to give Luck the ball just short of midfield. However, J.J. Watt snuffed out the drive by drawing a holding penalty on Anthony Castanzo and getting his second sack of the game. If it weren't for some big plays by Watt and the pick-six, the Texans wouldn't have been in the game. The Texans got going in the second half with a 30-yard pass to DeVier Posey (1-30). On a 4.h-and-1, Foster exploded for a touchdown run of over 20 yards, but Posey was called for a questionable holding call, so Houston settled for a 53-yard Randy Bullock field goal."

Bouye. The Texans answered with a field goal drive to take a 10-7 lead. Right before the half, Bortles drove the ball to Houston's 10-yard line, but he threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal to maintain the 3.point lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, the Jaguars stopped a 4.h-and-1 carry by Foster for a loss of a few yards, which set up Jacksonville at midfield. Bortles went on to hit Robinson for a gain of close to 20 and then threw a dart to a wide open Julius Thomas for a 29-yard touchdown. The Jaguars took a 14-10 lead, but after that, the Texans took over. Houston answered with Hopkins making a ridiculous 1.handed catch for 29 yards. A dumb 15-yard penalty on Jonathan Cyprien moved the ball to the 10-yard line, and Hoyer ended up throwing a bullet to Hopkins for a 9-yard touchdown. The Texans quickly got the ball back and struck again with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. Bortles promptly threw a pick-six to Hal, who jumped the route and returned it 31 yards for a score. The game was essentially over after that play. In garbage time, Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, but the bad news was that Allen Robinson went down with a leg injury on that drive.    DeAndre Hopkins was the fantasy star of the game with 10 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. For some strange reason, the Jaguars resisted sending double coverage to Hopkins, who ate up man coverage.    Brian Hoyer completed 24-for-36 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns. He played an efficient game for the Texans and was more steady than what they had received under Ryan Mallett.    Arian Foster finished with 53 yards on 18 carries. He did more damage through the air with 59 yards on 5 receptions and a touchdown. Foster had a fumble that Houston recovered.    Bortles was 30-of-53 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Texans' pass rush rattled Bortles into a number of misguided throws.    With T.J.

Miami then tacked on a 53-yard field goal, and Washington had another short touchdown catch to conclude the scoring.    Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston. He was 18-of-19 for 282 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for Tannehill. Miami seemed to have the perfect play call throughout the first half.    Lamar Miller was awesome. He ripped off 175 yards on 14 carries with 1 touchdown rushing. He added 3 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. All of this occurred in the first half. The Texans were incapable of defending Miller.    Jarvis Landry led Miami through the air with 5 catches for 83 yards and 2 scores. Rishard Matthews (3-75-1) also was impressive.    Brian Hoyer was 23-of-49 for 273 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Behind a weak offensive line, he was ineffective until the outcome was decided.    Arian Foster ran for 58 yards on 18 carries with a score. He had 66 yards on 5 catches with another touchdown. However, late in the 4.h quarter, Foster had his left leg give out on him untouched and had to be helped off the field with a cart ride into the locker room. This looks like it could be a serious injury to the left Achilles for Foster.    Surprisingly, Miami's weak secondary did the best job defending Foster. Shortly later, Foster added another touchdown on a short run and Nate Washington caught a 27-yard score."

   "comment":"Arian Foster returned this week from his hamstring injury, so the prevailing thought was that he would be the lead back, but instead it was Ajayi, who fended off the committee to take over as the bell-cow back in the second half. Ajayi looked strong all game, but as the Steelers had trouble moving the ball, their defense spent too much time on the field, allowing Ajayi and Miami's offensive line beat them down to the tune of 25 carries for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 62-yard scoring scamper that iced the game.    The Dolphins played inspired ball at times, but you can't devalue the injury to Roethlisberger. After returning to the field, he quickly floated a pass right to the Dolphins and just never looked right without his mobility. The Steelers are no doubt a much better team than the way they played in Miami, but they also very much need Roethlisberger healthy, much like last season. That begs the question, why is Landry Jones still Pittsburgh's backup? He is awful and should be on a scout team at best. I understand there is a huge dearth of quality quarterbacks in the league, but a decent backup should have been a major priority after their offense tanked when Roethlisberger was out last season.    This was a weird game. It's hard to tell how much better the Dolphins were due to Roethlisberger's injury, but 222 yards on the ground at 6.2 yards per carry against the Steelers, who had allowed just 70 yards per game to running backs. And to heap some more crazy statistical insults, the Dolphins had come into this game averaging 58 yards rushing per game.    Roethlisberger will get an MRI on his knee, and then the Steelers take on the red-hot Patriots at home. Pittsburgh will need Roethlisberger healthy, or it will be a massacre. The Dolphins, on the other hand, also face a red-hot team as the Buffalo Bills head into Miami, coming off 4 straight wins.   "
