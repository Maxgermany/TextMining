   "comment":"Arian Foster and Andre Johnson who screwed up early on. Following a nice 8-yard completion by Leinart on the opening drive, Foster was strip-sixed by his own teammate, as Johnson accidentally punched the ball out of his running back's hands. The Texans recovered and were able to establish a 20-10 lead at halftime, but now there's a different question: Can they win with T.J. Yates? Leinart suffered a broken collarbone just prior to intermission. He finished 10-of-13 for 57 yards and a touchdown. Leinart was used in many bootlegs and tossed mostly checkdowns. The offense was just really limited with him. A penalty forced them into a 1st-and-20 at some point, and it was evident that they didn't stand a chance to convert the first down. Not that it matters though because Leinart is likely out for the year. Yates looked great on his first drive in the 2-minute drill, but was dreadful after the break. Finishing 8-of-15 for 70 yards, Yates converted only 1 first down in the second half. With Houston unable to run the ball, the team just hung on for its life. Fortunately for them, the Jaguars were so inept on offense that it didn't matter.    Blaine Gabbert was so bad in this contest that he was benched in favor of Luke McCown. Gabbert went 13-of-29 for 136 yards and an interception that looked like a punt. Once again, he had major issues with pocket awareness. He also has a terrible habit of not looking downfield amid a pass rush, and shows terrible body language when things aren't going well (which is often the case). Gabbert's inaccuracy doesn't help matters. It was so bad that the CBS announcers made fun of him. After a poor pass, the color analyst (I think it was Rich Gannon) said: You have throw the ball to the receiver; not close to the receiver. Gabbert actually should have thrown a touchdown, but Marcedes Lewis had a really bad drop. This was actually hilarious because a minute earlier, the CBS announcers were pleading for Gabbert to go to Lewis more often.    The Jaguars were able to stay competitive because of Maurice Jones-Drew, who rushed for 99 yards on 18 carries. He also paced the team in receptions (4) and receiving yards (67) because many of Gabbert's completions were checkdowns.    Speaking of checkdowns, Arian Foster hauled in 7 balls for 24 yards to go along with his mediocre rushing numbers (22-65, TD). Andre Johnson, meanwhile, had just 2 receptions for 22 yards because his quarterbacks couldn't get him the football. His first catch came with 2 minutes to go in the third quarter.    As for Houston's defense, Wade Phillips' unit compiled 7 sacks. Four of those came from "

   "comment":"Arian Foster left Thursday's practice and didn't do anything Friday because of a knee injury. He was a game-time decision, and ESPN's Chris Mortensen said that he would be limited. Well, Foster had 26 carries to Ben Tate's 5. F*** you, Mort. </i> The biggest take-away from this game is that the Texans' defense is the real deal. It made the Dolphins' offense look incapable of moving the ball and didn't allow a touchdown. Defensive end J.J. Watt deflected 2 passes into interceptions in the first half, and, the Houston defense produced a turnover in 4 straight possessions to basically win the game before halftime. The Texans' offense played flat throughout the early going, but the team's defense was so dominant, the offense didn't have to do much to have 24 points at the half. Houston controlled the ball in the third quarter. The defense played prevent to drain the clock in the 4.h quarter, and stopped Miami twice on 4.h-and-goal. Watt was an absolute animal for the Texans. He was a dominant force for 4 quarters and looks like he could be a NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate. All of Houston's defensive starters had good plays, including the secondary.    Houston entered this season having lost its 2011 starters on the right side of the offensive line, but right guard Antoine Caldwell and right tackle Derek Newton played very well in their debut for the Texans. They were solid in run defense and in pass protection. There was no visible drop off against the Dolphins.    There was speculation that Houston running back Arian Foster wouldn't play due to a calf injury, but the fantasy football superstar answered the bell for the Texans, among others. He was held mostly in check in the first half and had a couple of dropped passes. However, Foster came alive before halftime with a 14-yard touchdown behind the right side of his line with a great block from center "

   "comment":"Arian Foster to 15 yards on 10 carries. It was easily his worst outing of the season. Making matters worse, Foster lost a fumble in the first half and later exited the contest in the second half with an irregular heartbeat. Foster called it a very minor situation. Meanwhile, Ponder had some brilliant moments, as indicated earlier. He also made several terrible throws. It was crazy how inconsistent he was. He'd make an awful-looking pass and then come back and convert a long-yardage situation. In all, Minnesota was 9-of-18 on third down, as Ponder went 16-of-30 for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also had 7 scrambles for 48 rushing yards.    Adrian Peterson still was great though. The Texans loaded the box on every play, so Peterson had many losses. However, he broke loose for several impressive gains, ultimately finishing with 86 yards on 25 carries. Peterson now has 1,898 rushing yards. He needs 208 yards to break Dickerson's record, which is feasible, though the Packers, who happen to be next week's opponent, just limited "

   "comment":"Arian Foster recorded 79 yards on 19 attempts. Why is Foster receiving more than double the amount of carries than his superior teammate? It makes no sense. </i>    There is no doubt that the 2-0 Texans have some fight in them. Houston had a vigorous comeback against San Diego last Monday night, but looked dead in the water late in the 4.h quarter this week before some great throws by Matt Schaub to rookie DeAndre Hopkins led to an overtime win. The Titans came close to being 2-0 with road wins at Houston and Pittsburgh, but the Tennessee secondary couldn't close out the win for the team to now be 1-1. The Titans were down 14-10 at the start of the 4.h quarter when Chris Johnson was stopped in his own end zone for a safety. Tennessee started its next next drive at its own 1.yard line and moved the ball 99 yards for the lead. Jake Locker hit some big throws to Nate Washington (3-50) and Kendall Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Delanie Walker for a 10-yard touchdown. On the next third down, Schaub threw a weak pass off his back foot and it floated right to Alterraun Verner, who cruised into the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown. Hopkins ran the wrong route to set up the interception. The Texans responded by moving the ball with passes to Hopkins and a gain to Andre Johnson to the 3-yard line. Johnson (8-76) was injured on the play and headed into the locker room to end his game with what looked like a possible concussion courtesy of a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bernard Pollard. That set up a short touchdown run from Arian Foster. Foster carried a defender to convert the 2.point conversion to tie it at 24. Houston got the ball back, and a 34-yard pass play to "

   "comment":"Arian Foster when he had the ball on the ground very late in the game. Foster rolled forward past the first-down marker, giving Houston the win. The poor effort they displayed was staggering.    Watkins overcame his early drops by finishing the game with 4 catches for 30 yards and a touchdown. Mike Williams (2-84) reeled in Manuel's other score, thanks to a breakdown in coverage.    Fred Jackson was the star in the Bills' backfield last week, so C.J. Spiller naturally grabbed the reins in this contest, gaining 60 yards on 15 carries, while Jackson took his mere 7 attempts for 33 yards. However, Jackson was used more in the passing game. He logged 6 catches for 52 receiving yards, while Spiller secured all 3 targets thrown his way for 24 receiving yards.    Surprisingly, both Jackson and Spiller outrushed Arian Foster. It appeared as though Foster struggled during warmups, but his health wasn't the entire issue. He mustered only 6 yards on 8 carries because his offensive line couldn't do anything to open up any holes against Buffalo's stalwart front. Foster made up for it with 7 catches for 55 receiving yards.    "

   "comment":"Arian Foster's hands, but Mallett should've put more touch on the ball. Mallett's play isn't why he'll be benched going forward; it's his horrible attitude and sportsmanship. How can a quarterback lead a team when he's actually visibly upset that his own team is winning?    Speaking of Foster, he had a very mixed game. He looked good early on, but was partly to blame for an early pick. He then took some negative plays. For example, he reversed field and was swallowed up for a loss of 4. Foster then appeared to be concussed, but somehow snuck onto the field. The coaching staff finally noticed and took his helmet away. Foster was eventually cleared in the third quarter, but by then, the Colts were way ahead. Foster managed just 41 yards on 19 carries, as rookie nose tackle "

   "comment":"Arian Foster. The Jaguars answered with a drive that was aided by a few Texans penalties. Close to the end zone, Bortles hit Allen Robinson for a short touchdown pass against A.J. Bouye. The Texans answered with a field goal drive to take a 10-7 lead. Right before the half, Bortles drove the ball to Houston's 10-yard line, but he threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal to maintain the 3.point lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, the Jaguars stopped a 4.h-and-1 carry by Foster for a loss of a few yards, which set up Jacksonville at midfield. Bortles went on to hit Robinson for a gain of close to 20 and then threw a dart to a wide open Julius Thomas for a 29-yard touchdown. The Jaguars took a 14-10 lead, but after that, the Texans took over. Houston answered with Hopkins making a ridiculous 1.handed catch for 29 yards. A dumb 15-yard penalty on Jonathan Cyprien moved the ball to the 10-yard line, and Hoyer ended up throwing a bullet to Hopkins for a 9-yard touchdown. The Texans quickly got the ball back and struck again with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. Bortles promptly threw a pick-six to Hal, who jumped the route and returned it 31 yards for a score. The game was essentially over after that play. In garbage time, Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, but the bad news was that Allen Robinson went down with a leg injury on that drive.    DeAndre Hopkins was the fantasy star of the game with 10 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. For some strange reason, the Jaguars resisted sending double coverage to Hopkins, who ate up man coverage.    Brian Hoyer completed 24-for-36 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns. He played an efficient game for the Texans and was more steady than what they had received under Ryan Mallett.    Arian Foster finished with 53 yards on 18 carries. He did more damage through the air with 59 yards on 5 receptions and a touchdown. Foster had a fumble that Houston recovered.    Bortles was 30-of-53 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Texans' pass rush rattled Bortles into a number of misguided throws.    With T.J. Yeldon out, the Jaguars' rushing attack was nonexistent. They were led by "

   "comment":"Arian Foster. Shortly later, Foster added another touchdown on a short run and Nate Washington caught a 27-yard score. Miami then tacked on a 53-yard field goal, and Washington had another short touchdown catch to conclude the scoring.    Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston. He was 18-of-19 for 282 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for Tannehill. Miami seemed to have the perfect play call throughout the first half.    Lamar Miller was awesome. He ripped off 175 yards on 14 carries with 1 touchdown rushing. He added 3 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. All of this occurred in the first half. The Texans were incapable of defending Miller.    Jarvis Landry led Miami through the air with 5 catches for 83 yards and 2 scores. Rishard Matthews (3-75-1) also was impressive.    Brian Hoyer was 23-of-49 for 273 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Behind a weak offensive line, he was ineffective until the outcome was decided.    Arian Foster ran for 58 yards on 18 carries with a score. He had 66 yards on 5 catches with another touchdown. However, late in the 4.h quarter, Foster had his left leg give out on him untouched and had to be helped off the field with a cart ride into the locker room. This looks like it could be a serious injury to the left Achilles for Foster.    Surprisingly, Miami's weak secondary did the best job defending "

   "comment":"Arian Foster (3-62). Stills, meanwhile, caught only 1 of his 5 targets for 16 yards. The Dolphins will be looking forward to having DeVante Parker in the lineup so Tannehill doesn't have to target Stills so heavily; Stills tied Foster for second on the team with 5 targets, trailing Landry's 10.    As for Foster, he did well as a receiver out of the backfield, but did nothing on the ground, as Seattle's stout front limited him to 38 yards on 13 carries. He was stuffed on an opening-quarter 4.h-and-1 in which "

   "comment":"Arian Foster returned this week from his hamstring injury, so the prevailing thought was that he would be the lead back, but instead it was Ajayi, who fended off the committee to take over as the bell-cow back in the second half. Ajayi looked strong all game, but as the Steelers had trouble moving the ball, their defense spent too much time on the field, allowing Ajayi and Miami's offensive line beat them down to the tune of 25 carries for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 62-yard scoring scamper that iced the game.    The Dolphins played inspired ball at times, but you can't devalue the injury to Roethlisberger. After returning to the field, he quickly floated a pass right to the Dolphins and just never looked right without his mobility. The Steelers are no doubt a much better team than the way they played in Miami, but they also very much need Roethlisberger healthy, much like last season. That begs the question, why is Landry Jones still Pittsburgh's backup? He is awful and should be on a scout team at best. I understand there is a huge dearth of quality quarterbacks in the league, but a decent backup should have been a major priority after their offense tanked when Roethlisberger was out last season.    This was a weird game. It's hard to tell how much better the Dolphins were due to Roethlisberger's injury, but 222 yards on the ground at 6.2 yards per carry against the Steelers, who had allowed just 70 yards per game to running backs. And to heap some more crazy statistical insults, the Dolphins had come into this game averaging 58 yards rushing per game.    Roethlisberger will get an MRI on his knee, and then the Steelers take on the red-hot Patriots at home. Pittsburgh will need Roethlisberger healthy, or it will be a massacre. The Dolphins, on the other hand, also face a red-hot team as the Buffalo Bills head into Miami, coming off 4 straight wins.   "
