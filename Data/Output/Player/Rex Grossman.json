Grossman, known as a turnover machine throughout his career, certainly lived up to that reputation at Dallas almost immediately, lobbing an ugly interception off his back foot in the first quarter. Grossman later fumbled on a strip sack, and the Cowboys eventually established a 30-14 lead through 3 quarters. I don't know what happened to change things, but Grossman was on fire in the final 15 minutes. He finished 25-of-43 for 322 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 picks, and it's hard to imagine that McNabb could have out-performed him. Shanahan got the most out of a sub-par Jake Plummer in Denver, and he may just be able to work his magic with Grossman in Washington. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

   "comment":"Grossman played like he was drunk until he was benched in favor of John Beck. Philadelphia caught many breaks. Here are some examples: - There was a bogus roughing-the-passer penalty called on QB Dog Killer on what could have been a safety in the first quarter. The official said the hit was helmet-to-helmet, but QBDK was trying to scramble around and that actually forced the ugly-looking hit. It definitely didn't deserve any sort of yellow flag, though I'm sure Tom Jackson would vehemently disagree. Fortunately for the Eagles, they were awarded a free first down and subsequently scored a touchdown. - QBDK threw a pass behind Brent Celek. The struggling tight end somehow tipped the ball up in the air. It bounced twice off his hands, and then he somehow caught it with a defender inches away from making the pick himself. - The Redskins dropped a potential touchdown in the fourth quarter. - A tipped throw from QBDK sailed right into Jeremy Maclin's lap in the red zone. Like I said, all of the bounces magically went the Eagles' way. The Curse of the Killed Dogs did not play a factor in Week 6.    Of course, Grossman didn't help. He tossed 2 picks in the first half, 1 of which was a dumb throw into double coverage. The second pick was underthrown. He was also responsible for "
