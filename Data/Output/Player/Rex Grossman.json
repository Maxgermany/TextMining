Grossman later fumbled on a strip sack, and the Cowboys eventually established a 30-14 lead through 3 quarters.

He finished 25-of-43 for 322 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 picks, and it's hard to imagine that McNabb could have out-performed him. Shanahan got the most out of a sub-par Jake Plummer in Denver, and he may just be able to work his magic with Grossman in Washington. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

   "comment":"Grossman, it was almost unfathomable that Washington would start 2-0. Yet, here we are. Rex Grossman continues to play relatively well for Mike Shanahan, as he went 25-of-43 for 291 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. One interception was tipped, but the second 1 was definitely a Bad Rex moment. He's had 2 of them in 2 games thus far, which is big positive because Washington can survive with only 1 Bad Rex instance per week. The important thing is that Grossman led the Redskins on 3 scoring drives in the 4.h quarter of 44, 73 and 64 yards.    Grossman once again looked comfortable throwing to his favorite weapons. "

   "comment":"Grossman played like he was drunk until he was benched in favor of John Beck. Philadelphia caught many breaks. Here are some examples: - There was a bogus roughing-the-passer penalty called on QB Dog Killer on what could have been a safety in the first quarter. The official said the hit was helmet-to-helmet, but QBDK was trying to scramble around and that actually forced the ugly-looking hit. It definitely didn't deserve any sort of yellow flag, though I'm sure Tom Jackson would vehemently disagree. Fortunately for the Eagles, they were awarded a free first down and subsequently scored a touchdown. - QBDK threw a pass behind Brent Celek. The struggling tight end somehow tipped the ball up in the air. It bounced twice off his hands, and then he somehow caught it with a defender inches away from making the pick himself. - The Redskins dropped a potential touchdown in the 4.h quarter. - A tipped throw from QBDK sailed right into Jeremy Maclin's lap in the red zone. Like I said, all of the bounces magically went the Eagles' way. The Curse of the Killed Dogs did not play a factor in Week 6.    Of course, Grossman didn't help. He tossed 2 picks in the first half, 1 of which was a dumb throw into double coverage. The second pick was underthrown. He was also responsible for "
