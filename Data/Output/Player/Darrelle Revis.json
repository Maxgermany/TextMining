He broke up a completion on third down directed toward Smith, but he committed pass interference, fell down on a Newton scramble and also whiffed on a tackle when Williams scored his touchdown. Not to beat a dead horse, but the Buccaneers are so insanely stupid for using Revis in a zone. Why would they deal a first-round pick and pay him $16 million if they aren't going to use his strength? It makes zero sense.    A player Tampa did select in the 2013 NFL Draft, "

Manuel hit a screen pass to Spiller (11-22 rushing, 1-26 receiving), and he busted it for an 83-yard touchdown - but a holding call brought it back. Both teams offenses were abysmal in the second half.    Glennon completed only 9-of-25 passes for 90 yards with 2 scores and 2 picks. Aside from 2 plays, the Bills' defense played well. Marcell Dareus had a sack, and Buffalo kept steady heat on Glennon.    Manuel was 18-of-33 for 184 yards with no touchdowns and 4 interceptions. He was awful. Fred Jackson (5-12 rushing, 4-26 receiving) was also contained.    The star of the game was David as he had 9 tackles with a sack and 2 interceptions. He was awesome.

This forced the Vikings to attempt a field goal, which was blocked and returned for a touchdown. Of course, it didn't help that the Vikings couldn't pass protect at all.

   "comment":"Darrelle Revis running down the sideline. Houston got on the board first as its second drive netted a field goal. The Texans were moving the ball again before a blindside blitz by Marcus Williams led to a strip-sack that was recovered by New York. Houston's defense limited the Jets to a field goal. In the second quarter, Yates didn't miss again as Hopkins beat Revis on a deep post for a 61-yard touchdown. The Texans took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, a 44-yard pass interference penalty on Quintin Demps set up the Jets inside the Texans' 30-yard line. Fitzpatrick hit Brandon Marshall with a 21-yard touchdown pass after he got open against Kevin Johnson to tie the game at 10. Yates answered with 2 receptions to Cecil Shorts for 50 yards as he beat Revis for 15 yards and Antonio Cromartie for 35 yards. The Texans pulled out some trickeration with a throwback pass to Shorts, and he lofted in a 21-yard touchdown to Alfred Blue. J.J. Watt terrorized Fitpatrick and quickly got the ball back for Houston. The Texans' next drive was led by Blue running well, and it ended with Yates throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. In the 4.h quarter, Fitzpatrick led a touchdown drive with a quarterback draw from 5 yards out to cut the Texans' lead to 24-17 with just over 4 minutes remaining. The Jets' defense forced a 3.and-out, but on a 4.h-down play, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by Eddie Pleasant. Still, the Jets had 1 more shot starting at their 20 with 2:19 remaining. After a couple of plays, Fitzpatrick had a route jumped by Andre Hal for another interception to clinch the win for Houston.    Yates was 16-of-34 for 229 yards with 2 touchdowns. DeAndre Hopkins had 5 receptions for 118 yards and 2 scores. Cecil Shorts collected 2 catches for 51 yards, 4 carries for 26 yards and a 21-yard touchdown pass.    Alfred Blue had 58 yards on 21 carries with 3 receptions for 34 yards and a touchdown.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was 19-of-39 for 216 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions. Eric Decker had 4 receptions for 81 yards, while Brandon Marshall totaled 5 catches for 47 yards and a score.    Chris Ivory was shut down by the Texans as he had only 8 carries for 36 yards. Bilal Powell led New York in receiving with 5 receptions for 67 yards and 4 carries for 22 yards.    J.J. Watt was absolutely dominant with 8 tackles, 3 run tackles for a loss, 2 sacks, and a drawn holding penalty. Jadeveon Clowney had .5 sacks and a number of pressures, and batted a few passes. Brian Cushing also turned in a very strong performance for Houston.    The Jets sustained some significant injuries as Nick Mangold went out early with a hand injury. In the third quarter, Darrelle Revis left the game with a head injury. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
