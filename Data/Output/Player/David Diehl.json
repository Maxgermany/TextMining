   "comment":"David Diehl hold. On the next play, Manning was sacked on a 4.h down.    New York's ineptness was limited to the offense. Outside of the 2 Grossman interceptions, the defense played disgracefully. Grossman (15-of-24, 185 yards, TD, 2 INTs) basically did whatever he wanted, converting a high number of third- and 4.h-down tries (9-of-17), and torching "

  "comment":"David Diehl recover on both occasions. Had Diehl not pounced on both loose balls, Manning's afternoon would have been much worse. Manning was under heavy pressure all afternoon. He was sacked 4 times, but that number isn't indicative of the amount of heat he faced throughout this contest. - Key injury: Victor Cruz (2-25) suffered a concussion at the beginning of the third quarter after what looked to be a 16-yard reception. However, Pete Carroll pulled a Cobra Kai-type maneuver, challenging the play while Cruz was down on the field and barely moving. The Giants already had issues moving the chains, but they had no hope of doing so without their top play-maker. New York had just 54 net yards of offense in the first half with just 2 first downs. Yes, that's right - the Giants had more turnovers than first downs in the opening half! They ultimately converted just 1-of-10 attempts on third down. - Superior play by the opponent: The Seahawks couldn't muster much offense early because of a great effort by the New York defense. However, "
