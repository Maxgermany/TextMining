   "comment":"Green-Beckham for a touchdown as he was being tackled. Mariota finished 21-of-37 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers look nice, but Mariota failed to complete many of his attempts because he had zero pass protection. He took so many big hits and fumbled twice as a consequence. The Browns also made sure he wouldn't run very much, as he scrambled just thrice for 19 yards. The silver lining, however, is that Mariota proved he can still be a decent fantasy producer even if he can't move around.    With Delanie Walker out, "

   "comment":"Green-Beckham, and a Brian Cushing roughing-the-passer penalty moved the ball in for a 35-yard opportunity. The Texans' defense then locked it down and started to win the field-position punt exchange between the offenses. Houston started a drive around midfield and a few passes moved the ball to Tennessee territory before DeAndre Hopkins made a tremendous leaping catch in the corner of the end zone for a 21-yard score. Bishop Sankey promptly fumbled the ball to the Texans on the kickoff. The Houston offense didn't move the ball though, and Nick Novack kicked a field goal. After trading punts, Dexter McCluster made a 37-yard return to the Texans' 28, but Whitney Mercilus had a sack, which along with a 15-yard penalty on Byron Bell, moved the ball out of field goal position. Houston took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Titans got going when Antonio Andrews put together a 28-yard run. A great play by Texans rookie corner Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Jared Crick at the Tennessee's 10-yard line. Houston could only get 3 out of the turnover, but it didn't matter because the defense slammed the door on the Titans.    DeAndre Hopkins totaled 94 yards on 8 catches with a score. Nate Washington made 4 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Hoyer completed 23-of-35 for 235 yards with 2 scores. Alfred Blue, meanwhile, recorded 39 yards on 14 carries, a disappointing showing.    Zach Mettenberger went 22-of-31 for 171 yards with an interception. Antonio Andrews actually ran pretty well for the Titans, notching 64 yards on 16 carries.    Tight end Delanie Walker led Tennessee with 62 yards on 6 receptions. Kendall Wright (4-21), Justin Hunter (2-17) and Dorial Green-Beckham (1-12) couldn't do much with Mettenberger and the offensive line struggling.    Tennessee's defense played well considering the tough positions they were put in. The Texans couldn't run the ball with only Hopkins and Washington making plays for the offense. "

   "comment":"Green-Beckham in the red zone and couldn't hit an open Delanie Walker downfield. I also think he should have ran more. His best trait are his legs. He's holding himself back by not utilizing them enough.    I thought Tennessee's offensive game plan sucked. The team ran the ball way too much on first down, resulting in predictable play-calling. Tennessee didn't get anything on the ground from its backs, save for 2 long carries, so Mariota was constantly in second-and-long situations, which was a tough task behind a weak offensive line. Antonio Andrews gained 78 yards on 15 carries, but most of that came on a 26-yard burst.    Walker had a big game. He had more than double the receiving yardage compared to any other Titan, catching 8 balls for 109 yards. Green-Beckham (3-40) was next. In fact, no Titan receiver caught a pass in the second half until the final drive. It's safe to say that Kendall Wright was missed.    A quick word on Phil Simms: He was awful once again. He did that we talked about this thing repeatedly, but I thought he was at his worst when Jim Nantz pointed out the pool and the golf course at the stadium. The exchange went something like this: <b> Jim Nantz: </b> You never thought you'd see a pool or a lifeguard at a stadium, did you? <b> Phil Simms: </b> Yeah, we talked about it, Jim. They're trying to get fans to the stadium. But there's only 1 real way to do that... ... ... ... <i> Me (thinking during his 10-second pause): Please don't say the generic win football games. Please don't do it. If you have any respect for yourself, please don't say it. </i> ... ... ... <b> Phil Simms: </b> You gotta win football games, Jim! <i> Me (Thinking): F*** you, Phil Simms!

Actually, never mind, as it may have cost them the No. 1 pick in the draft, where they will likely select Laremy Tunsil, as you can see in my .    The Titans' only semblance of offense before Mettenberger was pulled came on a Statue of Liberty play, which Delanie Walker executed for a 36-yard carry. Walker nearly capped off the drive with a touchdown, but was tackled inches shy of the goal line. Walker still had a big game though, catching 9 of his 14 targets for 94 yards.

   "comment":"Green-Beckham drop on third down. A hold ruined the second possession. Carson Wentz then threw an interception on an extremely poor throw to set the Vikings up deep in Philadelphia territory. Wentz fumbled on the ensuing drive on a botched hand-off with Darren Sproles, allowing the Vikings to take over on Philadelphia's 17-yard line. Wentz continued to struggle after that, forcing a horrible throw into heavy coverage that was easily picked off. You'd think the Vikings would be able to take advantage of these errors. They made nearly as many blunders, however, and theirs were more egregious because they made their mistakes in the red zone. Sam Bradford, who came into this contest with no interceptions on the year, fired a pick into the end zone under heavy pressure when he didn't see Rodney McLeod. Pressure was an issue all afternoon for the Vikings, as their fumble recovery turned into a Bradford strip-sack seemingly returned for a touchdown, but ruled down at the Philadelphia 24. Connor Barwin easily beat Jake Long, who was benched for a while after that. Long was swapped back in, but then was benched again, as Mike Zimmer and Norv Turner seemingly couldn't decide which crappy left tackle to have Bradford get killed. The Eagles ultimately got their act together offensively, sparked by a kickoff return touchdown. The Vikings never did, save for the very end in garbage time, ultimately prompting their first loss of the season.    Wentz finished 16-of-28 for 138 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Wentz began the game very poorly, but was sharp toward the end. He was actually 7-of-8 for 85 yards and a score following the break, so credit Philadelphia's coaching staff for making the proper adjustments. This was especially remarkable considering that left tackle Jason Peters left the game with an injury.    No Philadelphia player registered more than 40 receiving yards. Josh Huff (4-39) led the way, while Jordan Matthews was limited to 3 grabs for 10 yards. Green-Beckham (2-8) caught Wentz's sole touchdown, but had the aforementioned drop.    The Eagles got a good run out of "
