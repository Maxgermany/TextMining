   "comment":"Dorial Green-Beckham for a touchdown as he was being tackled. Mariota finished 21-of-37 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers look nice, but Mariota failed to complete many of his attempts because he had zero pass protection. He took so many big hits and fumbled twice as a consequence. The Browns also made sure he wouldn't run very much, as he scrambled just thrice for 19 yards. The silver lining, however, is that Mariota proved he can still be a decent fantasy producer even if he can't move around.    With Delanie Walker out, "

   "comment":"Dorial Green-Beckham, and a Brian Cushing roughing-the-passer penalty moved the ball in for a 35-yard opportunity. The Texans' defense then locked it down and started to win the field-position punt exchange between the offenses. Houston started a drive around midfield and a few passes moved the ball to Tennessee territory before DeAndre Hopkins made a tremendous leaping catch in the corner of the end zone for a 21-yard score. Bishop Sankey promptly fumbled the ball to the Texans on the kickoff. The Houston offense didn't move the ball though, and Nick Novack kicked a field goal. After trading punts, Dexter McCluster made a 37-yard return to the Texans' 28, but Whitney Mercilus had a sack, which along with a 15-yard penalty on Byron Bell, moved the ball out of field goal position. Houston took a 10-3 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Titans got going when Antonio Andrews put together a 28-yard run. A great play by Texans rookie corner Kevin Johnson killed the drive, and Tennessee settled for another field goal. Houston got moving afterward with passes to Hopkins before Hoyer threw a bomb to Nate Washington, who had beaten Coty Sensabugh, for a 42-yard touchdown. Following a J.J. Watt sack, Mettenberger was picked off by Johnson. The Texans then punted and pinned the Titans inside the 10-yard line. Watt soon beat a double-team to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Jared Crick at the Tennessee's 10-yard line. Houston could only get 3 out of the turnover, but it didn't matter because the defense slammed the door on the Titans.    DeAndre Hopkins totaled 94 yards on 8 catches with a score. Nate Washington made 4 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Brian Hoyer completed 23-of-35 for 235 yards with 2 scores. Alfred Blue, meanwhile, recorded 39 yards on 14 carries, a disappointing showing.    Zach Mettenberger went 22-of-31 for 171 yards with an interception. Antonio Andrews actually ran pretty well for the Titans, notching 64 yards on 16 carries.    Tight end Delanie Walker led Tennessee with 62 yards on 6 receptions. Kendall Wright (4-21), Justin Hunter (2-17) and Dorial Green-Beckham (1-12) couldn't do much with Mettenberger and the offensive line struggling.    Tennessee's defense played well considering the tough positions they were put in. The Texans couldn't run the ball with only Hopkins and Washington making plays for the offense. "

Skrine had a return to the Titans' 35-yard line, and once again, New York tacked on a field goal. Chris Ivory took off on runs of 32 and 11 yards on the Jets' next possession. This time, the drive was completed with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Bilal Powell on a checkdown. Late in the second quarter, the Titans weren't set and Fitzpatrick quickly snapped the ball to flip it to Marshall all alone along the sideline. He took off down the field for a 69-yard score. The Jets had a 27-0 lead at the half and the game was over.    Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-36 pass for 263 yards with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Marshall had 6 receptions for 125 yards with 1 score, and Decker totaled 7 catches for 74 yards and a touchdown.    Ivory ran for 101 yards on 22 carries, while Powell had 36 yards on 3 carries and 5 receptions for 46 yards with a score.    Mariota completed 21-of-39 for 274 yards with no touchdowns and 1 interception. Delanie Walker led Tennessee in receiving with 71 yards on 7 receptions. Harry Douglas (3-65) and Dorial Green-Beckham (3-53) contributed, but the biggest play through the air was Mariota's 41-yard touchdown catch.    The Titans had zero running game, as Dexter McCluster led them with a putrid 12 yards on 4 carries.    The engine of the Jets' win was their dominant defensive line overwhelming the Titans at the point of attack. Mariota was getting hit constantly, and Tennessee was completely incapable of running the ball. Muhammed Wilkerson had 3 sacks and 10 tackles. He dominated the Titans. "
