   "comment":"Binns had 2 terrible drops that could've been huge plays for Miami. Tannehill also had Bush running wide open for a touchdown, but overthrew him. Aside from those busted plays, the Patriots' defense played a superb game. The stop unit destroyed the Dolphins' offensive line, recording 7 sacks. Undrafted rookie "
