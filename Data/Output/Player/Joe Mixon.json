He had a 17-yard gain nullified by a Jake Fisher hold. Mixon, meanwhile, was a colossal disappointment, tallying 9 yards on 8 attempts, and all but 1 of his yards came on 1 try. He also caught 3 passes for 15 receiving yards. Bernard was the most-productive player, registering 40 yards on 7 carries, though 23 of his yards came on 1 carry. Bernard also had a 39-yard reception. This situation is a mess for fantasy football purposes. It's a legitimate 3.headed time share, and the Bengals can't consistently open up lanes for any of the runners.    "

   "comment":"Mixon ripping off some good gains. To finish the drive, Dalton tossed a well-located pass to Green for a score. Cincinnati promptly set up Green Bay with a kickoff that went out of bounds. A pass interference penalty, a completion to Jordy Nelson, and a conversion to Davante Adams (3-60) put the Packers at the 1-yard line. Rodgers found Lance Kendricks (2-51-1) wide open in the end zone for a short touchdown. In the second quarter, Cincinnati moved down the field with Gio Bernard (3-27 rushing, 2-12-1 receiving) ripping off a 25-yard run and getting wide open for a 6.yard touchdown catch. Green Bay got moving using a flea-flicker for a 41-yard completion to Adams, but then Rodgers had a 10-yard out to Neldon jumped by William Jackson, who raced down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown. It was only the second pick-six that Rodgers has thrown in his career. That play had Cincinnati ahead 21-7 at the half. Rodgers immediately got Green Bay moving in the third quarter, hitting Kendricks in the open field for a gain of 51 yards. A pass interference on Dre Kirkpatrick in the end zone set up the Packers at the 1-yard line, and on third-and-goal, Rodgers found Nelson open in the end zone. The Bengals moved into field goal range, but the second sack from Packers rookie safety Josh Jones pushed Randy Bullock back, and he missed the field goal attempt. A run by Rodgers with completions to Geronimo Allison and Nelson pushed the ball into the red zone before settling for a field goal to cut the Bengals lead to 21-17. Some nifty running by Bengals rookie Joe Mixon set up the Bengals for a short field goal to extend their lead to 24-17 with just under 4 minutes remaining. Rodgers got started as Allison made a phenomenal leaping catch for 17 yards and then converted a third-and-long with a superb hands catch along the sideline. Nelson followed with a great sideline reception, and shorter gains by Rodgers moved the ball inside the 5-yard line for a first-and-goal with 21 seconds remaining. Rodgers then threaded a needle to Nelson for the game-tying touchdown. The first possession of overtime ended with the Bengals punting. Rodgers promptly found Allison for a 73-yard reception to the Bengals' 7-yard line. "

Dalton was sacked 4 times, and then in the second half, the Bengals got behind, so there were few times at which the Bengals could commit to the run.    The Steelers looked the best they have all season, as they rolled up 420 total yards and held their division rival to just 179 total yards on the exact same number of drives. They take their AFC-best 5-2 record to Detroit next week to take on the rested Lions, but the Lions could be without their best wide receiver, Golden Tate.    The Bengals take their 2-4 record back home to face the 2-5 Indianapolis Colts, who were just shut out 27-0 by the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars.   "

   "comment":"Mixon came in as the lead back. Mixon, on his first carry, tripped over himself as he tried getting outside, and later, he lost a fumble. Mixon is Cincinnati's best running back and deserves to start, despite his troubles this week, and giving Hill the honorary start is just ludicrous. Mixon did show his ability on a middle screen, which he took for 67 yards. Right now, I'd say he needs his coach to show more faith in him and take the good with the bad, because with Hill, all you are really getting is the bad. Mixon did little on the ground, but ended up with 3 receptions for 91 yards, while no other receiver topped 46, as the Colts did all they could to slow down "
