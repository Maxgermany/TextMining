Those were the only 2 play-makers Cincinnati had with Green and Gresham both out, so they should've had a combined 35 touches at the very least. Instead, that number was only 24. Hill carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards and a touchdown. The Colts clamped down on the run with Green out, but the Bengals didn't try hard enough to establish the ground game. In fact, Hill had just 4 attempts following halftime. Bernard, meanwhile, caught 8 balls for 46 receiving yards, but most of that came in garbage time. Granted, he had a long reception on a screen wiped out by a Russell Bodine hold, but Bernard should've been used in space more. Instead, the Bengals had Dalton repeatedly fire futile passes downfield to Sanu and Brandon Tate that had no chance of being completed.    A couple of other notes for Cincinnati: - Excluding Bernard, no Bengal had more than 3 catches. A trio of players had those 3 receptions: Ryan Hewitt (3-37), Burkhead (3-34) and Sanu (3-31). - "

Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a 4.h touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground.

Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.
