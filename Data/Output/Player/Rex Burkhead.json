Those were the only 2 play-makers Cincinnati had with Green and Gresham both out, so they should've had a combined 35 touches at the very least. Instead, that number was only 24. Hill carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards and a touchdown. The Colts clamped down on the run with Green out, but the Bengals didn't try hard enough to establish the ground game. In fact, Hill had just 4 attempts following halftime. Bernard, meanwhile, caught 8 balls for 46 receiving yards, but most of that came in garbage time. Granted, he had a long reception on a screen wiped out by a Russell Bodine hold, but Bernard should've been used in space more. Instead, the Bengals had Dalton repeatedly fire futile passes downfield to Sanu and Brandon Tate that had no chance of being completed.    A couple of other notes for Cincinnati: - Excluding Bernard, no Bengal had more than 3 catches. A trio of players had those 3 receptions: Ryan Hewitt (3-37), Burkhead (3-34) and Sanu (3-31). - "

Flacco appeared to injure himself on an awkward slide in the second quarter and even sought some attention from the team doctors immediately afterward. However, if Flacco was affected by this, I didn't notice, and the stats would say the same thing. Flacco went 8-of-11 for 73 yards following intermission. Flacco played very well overall, which hasn't always been the case this year. However, before anyone gets too excited, Flacco was up against a secondary that has been atrocious this year. "

Dalton finshed the drive by throwing a beautiful 8-yard touchdown pass to LaFell. Philadelphia got moving as Wentz hit Paul Turner (6-80) on the run for a 41-yard gain. Wentz was hit on a following throw, by Carlos Dunlap, and the fluttering ball was intercepted by Vontaze Burfict. Dalton then used Tyler Boyd (4-66) to turn the give-away into 3 more points and a 29-0 lead. The Eagles finally got on the board as Zach Ertz was wide open in busted coverage for a short touchdown.

Burkhead also had 2 catches for 25 yards.    Meanwhile, Baltimore's offense was also responsible for not giving Smith a great send-off, as the unit did stupid stuff throughout the afternoon. The team managed to move the chains on occasion, but constantly screwed up in the red zone. "

   "comment":"Burkhead 2 plays later. Following a Denver field goal, the Broncos kicked off, only to watch Dion Lewis take it the distance to give his team a 14-3 advantage. The special-teams gaffes didn't even stop after that, as the Patriots blocked a punt when they were up 17-6. The nail in the coffin was the Broncos being whistled for a hold to negate a C.J. Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a fourth touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground. Replay showed that Gronkowski made the reception, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to overturn the call.    Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.    In addition to scoring on his kickoff return, Lewis found the end zone on offense, dashing for 55 yards on 14 carries. Rex Burkhead (10-36), who had the aforementioned blocked punt, also scored as a receiver, catching 3 balls for 27 yards. "
