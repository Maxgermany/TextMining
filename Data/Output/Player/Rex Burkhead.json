Nugent missed the extra point, and the Bengals took a 19-0 lead into the locker room. Dalton more over 200 yards passing, while Wentz was held to only 67 yards at intermission. In the third quarter, Dalton continued to rip the ball through the Eagles' defense with a 44-yard pass to Brandon LaFell, who had gotten vertical on Leodis McKelvin. Dalton finshed the drive by throwing a beautiful 8.yard touchdown pass to LaFell. Philadelphia got moving as Wentz hit Paul Turner (6-80) on the run for a 41-yard gain. Wentz was hit on a following throw, by Carlos Dunlap, and the fluttering ball was intercepted by Vontaze Burfict. Dalton then used Tyler Boyd (4-66) to turn the give-away into 3 more points and a 29-0 lead. The Eagles finally got on the board as Zach Ertz was wide open in busted coverage for a short touchdown. Bennie Logan forced a fumble from Rex Burkhead, and Philadelphia recovered the ball. Wentz threw into a crowd of defenders, however, and after being juggled around, "

   "comment":"Rex Burkhead 2 plays later. Following a Denver field goal, the Broncos kicked off, only to watch Dion Lewis take it the distance to give his team a 14-3 advantage. The special-teams gaffes didn't even stop after that, as the Patriots blocked a punt when they were up 17-6. The nail in the coffin was the Broncos being whistled for a hold to negate a C.J. Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a 4.h touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground. Replay showed that Gronkowski made the reception, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to overturn the call.    Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.    In addition to scoring on his kickoff return, Lewis found the end zone on offense, dashing for 55 yards on 14 carries. Rex Burkhead (10-36), who had the aforementioned blocked punt, also scored as a receiver, catching 3 balls for 27 yards. "
