That set the Redskins up in great field position, which led to their first of many scores of the game.    The Redskins are the second-best team in the NFL. They're 4-1 despite playing 3 divisional road games! That's pretty amazing, considering how awful they looked on opening night.   "

More on that later. Vick's lone interception ended a drive in the first quarter, but the killer turnover came from Ronnie Brown in the second quarter. He was trying to find the end zone on an inside run from the San Francisco 1-yard line. After realizing he would not make it, something froze his brain, prompting a backward pass attempt. He failed according to the refs, and it was ruled a fumble. The turnover basically took 3 points off the board, assuming they attempted and converted an easy field goal from about the 3. After driving the field at will, Philadelphia led only 20-3 at halftime, but should have been up by much more. The 49ers found some offense to start the second half only to watch King Dunlap block an Akers field goal attempt. A quick drive for a field goal later made it 23-3, and while the Philadelphia crowd was booing, they were still completely in charge of the game. Then the defense came unraveled. It is worth noting that "

   "comment":"Akers from 55 yards out at the halftime gun. Whatever works, right? Those key plays helped them take the lead 12-10. After a quick San Francisco punt opened the second half, Detroit drove for a field goal on a march fueled by consecutive passes to Jahvid Best (6 receptions for 73 yards) covering 53 yards. Those big gains were wasted when Stafford threw 3 straight incompletions going to Nate Burleson, Pettigrew and rookie Titus Young from the 6-yard line. He knows Calvin Johnson (6 receptions for 102 yards) is on his team right? The kick gave them a 13-12 lead. The 49ers answered immediately with another long run from Gore covering 55 yards plus an extra 15 on a questionable horse-collar personal foul. This time, the Lions stood up in the red zone, forcing a pair of incompletions, though an Akers field goal put the visitors back ahead 15-13. Johnson started the next drive with a 23-yard reception, but after getting another first down by penalty, the threat was over. Eventually, I figured Smith would throw an interception even though he entered the game with just 1 on the season. An exchange of punts later, I was right. It looked like the 16-0 dream would continue for Detroit when they took over at the San Francisco 49-yard line just before the end of the third quarter. They took small gains to march down for the touchdown, then failed at math by trying for 2 points after taking a 19-15 lead with a Stafford-to-Burleson touchdown pass. Were they worried about a pair of field goals tying them? The pass to Megatron failed. Four punts later San Francisco had the ball on the Detroit 35 after a great punt return covering 40 yards from "

   "comment":"Akers field goal made it 10-0. Cleveland's offense managed 1 first down before punting and the first quarter came to a close. San Francisco got another big run by Gore for 26 yards in between a pair of 19-yard receptions from their tight ends Vernon Davis and Justin Peelle. A Gore touchdown run was overturned, and 3 consecutive runs failed, giving the Browns possession on downs. It didn't matter too much. Cleveland did convert a third down with a 17-yard pass to Ben Watson and gained a little field position punting to San Francisco's 36. The 49ers sprinkled in a couple passes to their opponent's former top pick, Braylon Edwards, and capped the drive with a touchdown to their own top selection, Michael Crabtree, for the 17-0 lead. It was looking like a rout. The Browns did show some spunk in the 2-minute drill though. Dashaun Goldson was nailed for a 15-yard penalty and Joshua Cribbs caught a 12-yard pass to help set up a 52-yard field goal attempt. It put them on the board at the halftime gun, but the home team was very much in control. Whatever happened at halftime definitely changed things defensively for Cleveland. San Francisco went 3.and-out on 4 of their first 5 possessions. The Browns got feisty on offense, but getting back to the opening statement, lacked the playmakers to pull this 1 out. Goldson made up for his penalty earlier by killing a drive that reached the San Francisco 34 with an interception. McCoy threw it up for rookie Greg Little in the end zone, but he was doubled up. The score held at 17-3 after the third quarter. Rookie Aldon Smith sacked McCoy to end Cleveland's next drive, but the next time they got it, things became interesting all of a sudden. Cribbs caught a ball down the sideline and shed a tackle racing for a 46-yard touchdown. Leading by just 1 score, it was time for San Francisco's offense to regain their first-half form. This could mean only 1 thing - a pass to defensive tackle Sopoaga on third down from Cleveland's 32. It went for 18 yards and more importantly, allowed them to chew more time off the clock. The drive took 4:05 and concluded with a short Akers field goal to seal it at 20-10. Cleveland managed some garbage time yards and that was that. There really was not much to this game. "

   "comment":"Akers, 1 of the most valuable players for them this season, was good from 52 yards out to make it 3-0. The Redskins tried to mount an answer with Jabar Gaffney (4-40) catching 2 passes to convert third downs. However, on the second 1. Trent Williams was nailed for a totally unnecessary smack in the back of Justin Smith for a 15-yard personal foul to force a punt following a pass to Helu. Now that I mention it, passing to him was a large part of the offense. He set a team mark with 14 receptions, putting Art Monk out of the record book in the process, for 105 yards. Following another exchange of punts, San Francisco took over at its own 45. Alex Smith scrambled for 8 yards on first down and Gore (19-107) had his longest run of the game chugging down field for a gain of 27. Two runs by Kendall Hunter set up the 2.minute warning for a third-and-one. Smith threw incomplete under a bit of pressure, missing a wide-open Gore in the flat. Harbaugh decided to go for it, putting Smith in the Pistol formation. However, backup tight end Justin Peelle moved prior to the snap to set up another field goal for a 6-0 lead. For some reason, Mike Shanahan was determined to get points prior to the half, even after a false start set them back to open the drive. Two plays later, a Helu reception ended in a fumble forced by Patrick Willis and recovered by Donte Whitner. Like a bolt of lightning, the 49ers immediately called a play and executed it, hitting fullback Bruce Miller down the sideline for a 30-yard touchdown for a 13-0 lead. The Redskins did scratch their way down the field in the final minute and get into field goal range. Graham Gano set a team record with a 59-yard effort to make it 13-3 at the break. In the second half, Washington really never had a chance to get back in the game. After an exchange of punts, San Francisco finally converted its first third down (having failed on their first 6) and made it to the 21-yard line before Brian Orakpo delivered a sack to force another field goal by Akers and a 16-3 lead. Trying to answer, the Redskins battled their way into scoring range, but had to go for it on 4.h down. Navorro Bowman came up with the play to end the threat and things looked grim as the game entered the final quarter. With the defense wearing down ,it was easy to mix in some passing plays. "

   "comment":"Akers, who was having a terrific season entering this game, got his field goal attempt blocked by Calais Campbell. The Cardinals' next drive ended quickly with Patrick Willis recording an interception on the second play, collecting the ball on a deflection from cornerback Tarrell Brown. The 49ers' offense did nothing and the field goal from 49 yards out was wide right. After forcing a quick punt, they finally got on the board, sparked by a 27-yard pass to Vernon Davis followed by a 14-yard run by Frank Gore. The back was not the punishing force he is when completely healthy and fresh, but did log 24 carries for 88 yards. When the lead was in hand, Anthony Dixon (7 carries for 32 yards) and rookie Kendall Hunter (11 carries for 27 yards) took over, allowing Gore to rest up on a short week for the Harbaugh Bowl. A short field goal from Akers capped the drive and made it 3-0.

Lloyd (6-100, TD) did what he could to wreck his former team. Then, Steven Jackson (16-76) picked up 20 yards on 3 straight carries to put St. Louis in the red zone. Two plays later, the Rams were forced to third down, and with Clemens scrambling out of trouble, it looked like a field goal attempt was coming due. That is, until he kept running towards the end zone for the 7-0 lead and rare rushing score against this 49ers' defense. Both offenses followed with 3.and-outs, but the field position exchange went heavily in favor of San Francisco, which got a huge 66-yard punt out of Andy Lee and wound up starting from the St. Louis 33-yard line. Unlike a lot of occurrences this season, the 49ers actually finished the drive. Alex Smith (21-of-31, 219 yards, TD) completed a couple of short passes and ran for the tying touchdown as the first quarter came to a close. The Rams repeatedly started drives at their own 20-yard line or worse field position (8 times to be exact) but on this possession, worked out of it with a 19-yard pass to rookie tight end Lance Kendricks. However, after 2 Jackson runs created a third-down situation, Clemens was intercepted by Tarrell Brown. Smith wasted no time finishing this second-consecutive drive and putting San Francisco on top, completing 2 passes to Michael Crabtree (9-92, 2 TDs) to cover the 34 yards and make it 14-7. Cadillac Williams substituted in for Jackson on the next drive for St. Louis, but again, the team couldn't move the ball, so it flipped back to the 49ers. Having started at their own 33-yard line, which on this day was par for the course, San Francisco executed 2 short runs, which Smith followed by hitting Vernon Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, "
