   "comment":"David Akers is now 3 of his previous 14 from 40-plus. Reid foolishly tried a 50-yard kick, which didn't have a chance. That set the Redskins up in great field position, which led to their first of many scores of the game.    The Redskins are the second-best team in the NFL. They're 4-1 despite playing 3 divisional road games! That's pretty amazing, considering how awful they looked on opening night.   "

After that, in the 4.h quarter the more talented Cowboys were done making mistakes and drove the ball on 3 straight scoring drives while the defense did not allow another first down. Dallas drove 80 yards for a touchdown to cut the lead to 24-21, then probably got too conservative with time running out by marching 44 yards to tie it with a field goal. I guess I can't really call the third 1 a drive since Romo hit reality TV show winner (seriously) "
