   "comment":"George Kittle had a nice debut, getting 5 receptions for 27 yards.    I mentioned that Shanahan had a dubious start to his head-coaching career. He made 2 sketchy decisions in the second quarter, going for it twice on 4.h-and-short near midfield. The 49ers failed both times. The second play was especially poor, as it was a slow-developing run by "

The 49ers stopped committing unforced mistakes in the second half, perhaps because the Rams were so exhausted defensively. The injuries didn't help either. They lost star safety "

Kittle proved that he can be streamed versus poor defenses against tight ends, and that's the sort of matchup he has next week against the Redskins. Goodwin, on the other hand, had a fluky performance versus a poor group of cornerbacks. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
