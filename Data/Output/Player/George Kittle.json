   "comment":"Kittle had a nice debut, getting 5 receptions for 27 yards.    I mentioned that Shanahan had a dubious start to his head-coaching career. He made 2 sketchy decisions in the second quarter, going for it twice on 4.h-and-short near midfield. The 49ers failed both times. The second play was especially poor, as it was a slow-developing run by "

The 49ers stopped committing unforced mistakes in the second half, perhaps because the Rams were so exhausted defensively. The injuries didn't help either. They lost star safety "

Kittle proved that he can be streamed versus poor defenses against tight ends, and that's the sort of matchup he has next week against the Redskins. Goodwin, on the other hand, had a fluky performance versus a poor group of cornerbacks.   "

   "comment":"Kittle (4-46). Garcon saw a team-high 12 targets, but was covered well by Bashaud Breeland for most of the day. Garcon had a lot of production on the final drive, which helped him boost his stats. If Beathard continues to improve, Garcon will become more relevant in fantasy. For now, he is a WR3 in good matchups. Meanwhile, Kittle looked good running routes for the team, but he had a couple of bad drops. The rookie should look to improve that, but he is still a TE2 and a solid streaming option most weeks. Elsewhere, Aldrick Robinson (2-66) led the team in receiving yards and caught the touchdown. Most of his production came on the 1 play, so he can be ignored in fantasy formats.    When Beathard entered the contest, the 49ers' run game picked up a bit. "
