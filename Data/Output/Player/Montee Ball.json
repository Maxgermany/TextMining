The Broncos clearly don't trust him yet, as he pass protects poorly and 10.s to fumble the ball. Ball managed 24 yards on 8 carries, but most of that was when Osweiler was under center.    The Eagles moved the chains well in between the 20s in the first half, but sputtered in the red zone - a problem that has been prevalent for them throughout the season thus far. They settled for a pair of field goals early on, which is a recipe for disaster when Manning is scoring 7. for the opposition. Late in the first half, Philadelphia, in a 4.h-and-6, had a curious delay of game when a long field goal was possible. Kelly opted to punt the ball and did manage to pin the Broncos inside the 10. This was all for naught, however, as the Broncos were in Philadelphia territory after just 2 plays. That's the type of game this was.    QBDK went 14-of-27 for 248 yards before exiting the game in the 4.h quarter. He was solid in the first half, but the Broncos made great adjustments during the break; he was limited to just 4-of-11 passing for 78 yards after intermission. It also didn't help QBDK that "
