   "comment":"Ball lost a fumble in the red zone on the opening possession. Wes Welker then had a couple of drops. The Broncos then had 4 penalties during a third-quarter series, including a ridiculous taunting penalty that helped New York score a touchdown. The Giants trailed by just 1 point at that moment, so it appeared as though Denver would be the team that would screw itself out of a victory. And that's exactly when the Broncos took over. Peyton Manning was unstoppable in the second half. He was great overall - 30-of-43, 307 yards, 2 touchdowns - but his numbers after intermission were just outstanding. He went a near-perfect 12-of-14 for 107 yards and the pair of scores following the break. If the Broncos didn't commit mental errors in the first half, this would've been an even uglier blowout. The Giants' back 7 is atrocious, thanks to injuries and mismanagement, so they didn't stand a chance against Manning once Denver started playing clean football.    Peyton's 2 scores went to Julius Thomas (6-47) and Welker (3-39). Eric Decker (9-87) and Demaryius Thomas (5-52) couldn't find the end zone, but happened to be the 2 leading receivers. Demaryius Thomas fumbled, but was extremely fortunate that his teammate was able to recover the football. There were 3 Giants around to pounce on it, but they somehow couldn't come up with what looked like a golden opportunity.    It was no surprise to see Knowshon Moreno have the best rushing performance on the Broncos. Listed as the No. 1 fantasy football sleeper on this Web site, Moreno gained 93 yards and 2 scores on just 13 carries. He should be given more carries going forward, as it's quite apparent that Ball is a typical Big Ten plodder who is inept on third down. Ball mustered only 16 yards on 12 attempts to go along with the aforementioned lost fumble.    Eli lost this contest - giving him an 0-3 record versus Peyton - but if it's any consolation to him, he out-threw his older brother. He generated 362 yards and a touchdown on 28-of-49 passing, but was responsible for 4 interceptions. The first occurred just prior to halftime. He made a poor decision and heaved it toward the end zone despite being in field goal range. One of his other picks was fluky, as it bounced off a player's foot. I was hoping the Broncos would return it for a score so I could call it a kick-six. The other 2 interceptions were heaved deep into double coverage. Eli had a poor showing overall in what could be his final battle against his brother, but if Peyton ever brings this up in the future, Eli can just shove his 2 Super Bowl rings in Peyton's face.    Eli's sole aerial score came late in garbage time to "

The Broncos clearly don't trust him yet, as he pass protects poorly and 10.s to fumble the ball. Ball managed 24 yards on 8 carries, but most of that was when Osweiler was under center.    The Eagles moved the chains well in between the 20s in the first half, but sputtered in the red zone - a problem that has been prevalent for them throughout the season thus far. They settled for a pair of field goals early on, which is a recipe for disaster when Manning is scoring 7. for the opposition. Late in the first half, Philadelphia, in a 4.h-and-6, had a curious delay of game when a long field goal was possible. Kelly opted to punt the ball and did manage to pin the Broncos inside the 10. This was all for naught, however, as the Broncos were in Philadelphia territory after just 2 plays. That's the type of game this was.

   "comment":"Ball to gain 23 yards on a second-and-30 in the second half robbed the team from another possession. Smith was also strip-sacked near the end of the game, but the officials made a curious call by ruling it an incompletion.    Excluding Davis, 3 Chiefs tied for the team lead with 6 targets. They were Travis Kelce (4-81), Donnie Avery (3-14) and Dwayne Bowe (3-40), who didn't do much in his 2014 debut.    The Broncos are 2-0, but there's something off with their offense. They just can't put teams away. It looked like the Broncos would when Peyton Manning hurled a 48-yard bomb to Emmanuel Sanders early on, but they just couldn't convert third downs, moving the sticks on just 3 of 8 tries. Manning nearly threw an interception, while the team as a whole was guilty of 11 penalties.    Sanders (8-108) made an error of his own when he lost a fumble in the second quarter. The officials ruled it an incompletion, but Andy Reid challenged. The call was inexplicably upheld. Reid could do nothing but laugh at the officials' incompetence. Kansas City then had an incorrect call go its way later in the game, so everything turned out even.    Manning's touchdowns went to Demaryius Thomas (5-62), Julius Thomas (4-39) and Jacob Tamme.    As mentioned, Ball had a 23-yard gain on a second-and-30 that caught the Chiefs off-guard. Ball otherwise had a pretty averaging outing, tallying 60 rushing yards on 12 carries and catching all 3 of his targets for 29 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Ball draws in those situations. His passes fluttered all over the place, some of which weren't even close to his intended targets. He also nearly threw a second interception - though it occurred prior to his actual 1 - as Kam Chancellor snagged a pass that just barely hit the ground. Chancellor would redeem himself later by securing what seemed to be a game-clinching pick in the red zone. However, Manning flipped the switch at the very end and gave his team a chance. He finished 31-of-49 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and that pick. Consider that Manning was just 11-of-16 for only 87 yards at intermission. Also, to be fair, Demaryius Thomas was hobbled with an injury throughout. He left the game briefly, but was never the same upon returning. It didn't help that he had to battle Richard Sherman for most of the afternoon. Thomas caught just 4 passes for 31 yards. He appeared to lose a fumble, but it was ruled incomplete after a review.    Manning's scores went to Jacob Tamme and Julius Thomas (3-17), who was strangely shut out for the most part after Antonio Gates had a monstrous outing the week before. Thomas' touchdown came on a shovel pass. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Sanders saw a team-high 15 targets, reeling in 11 of them for 149 yards. Wes Welker also contributed with 6 grabs for 60 yards in his first game back from his suspension.    As mentioned, the Broncos couldn't run the ball very successfully. Ball was limited to just 38 yards on 14 carries. This output was not a surprise considering how dominant Seattle's front is.    Wilson was masterful at the end of the game, and he was pretty sharp throughout. He made 1 mistake with an interception that he threw up 12 with 11 minutes remaining, but he made up for it with his terrific performance in overtime. He finished 24-of-34 for 258 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick to go with his 40 rushing yards on his 9 scrambles.    The Broncos barely had any answers for "
