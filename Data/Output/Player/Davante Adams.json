   "comment":"Davante Adams. He completely lost his mobility and couldn't escape pressure. Rodgers finished 28-of-39 for 418 yards, a pair of touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 interceptions. The good news for the Packers is that they have a bye coming up, so Rodgers will get to rest his hamstring before a divisional matchup against the Bears at home.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, was pretty much flawless, as he usually is in the Superdome. He misfired on just 5 attempts, going 27-of-32 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't let the ball hit the ground a single time in the second half, completing all 11 of his attempts for 124 yards. Some of his first-half misfires weren't even his fault. For example, Brandin Cooks had a deep drop, though he made up for it on the very same drive by making a great reception that popped into the air and fell back down to him. Brees' scores went to Cooks (6-94), Jimmy Graham (5-59) and Josh Hill. Cooks' touchdown was a thing of beauty, as the speedy rookie blew by 2 defenders and let a perfectly thrown ball just drop into his hands. Graham, meanwhile, didn't register a single first-half reception, but came alive after intermission.    A big part of New Orleans' offense in this contest was the running game. With Khiry Robinson and Pierre Thomas both out, Mark Ingram received a full workload. He made the most of it, bulldozing his way for 172 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Travaris Cadet, meanwhile, handled the Thomas aspect of the offense. He caught 4 balls for 40 receiving yards.    Before I move on to the Packers, there are 2 things that bothered me about the Saints. The first was Brees' clock management at the end of the first half. For whatever reason, he refused to spike the ball to stop the clock, and as a consequence, things got dicey. Brees threw a pass over the middle of the field without any timeouts, and the clock would have expired if there wasn't a defensive penalty. Brees did the same exact thing at the end of the Detroit loss. He would be so much better off spiking the ball, so I have no idea why he won't do that. Also, Sean Payton made a poor decision in the third quarter. Stationed just past midfield, Payton called for a run with his fullback on third-and-1. He was unsuccessful, but Payton opted to go for it on 4.h down. He had Ingram run, but the former first-rounder was stuffed. It was strange that Payton didn't even try a pass with 1 of the NFL's top quarterbacks on 1 of these crucial plays. Fortunately for Payton, it didn't hurt him, as the Packers didn't score on the short field because Rodgers proceeded to hurt his hamstring on the very next drive.    Some notes on the Packers: - Rodgers' sole aerial score went to Randall Cobb, who had 5 catches for 126 yards and a 70-yard touchdown, beating Keenan Lewis. - Lewis covered Jordy Nelson for most of the evening and did a good job; Nelson secured just 3 of his 5 targets for 25 yards. - Davante Adams tied Eddie Lacy for the team lead in targets.Adams.

Fortunately for Payton, it didn't hurt him, as the Packers didn't score on the short field because Rodgers proceeded to hurt his hamstring on the very next drive.    Some notes on the Packers: - Rodgers' sole aerial score went to Randall Cobb, who had 5 catches for 126 yards and a 70-yard touchdown, beating Keenan Lewis. - Lewis covered Jordy Nelson for most of the evening and did a good job; Nelson secured just 3 of his 5 targets for 25 yards. - Davante Adams tied Eddie Lacy for the team lead in targets."

   "comment":"Davante Adams dropped a potential touchdown in the first quarter. - Adams dropped a potential touchdown in the first quarter. - Eddie Lacy lost a fumble in his own territory in the second quarter. The Bears, who had gone 3.and-out on 4 of their first 5 drives, used the turnover to get momentum, scoring their first touchdown of the night. - An offensive pass interference call ruined a chance for the Packers to score a touchdown right before halftime. The officials called James Jones for a pick. - Adams dropped a pass to move the chains in the third quarter. Adams then dropped another ball on the same possession, and this was followed by a botched snap that ruined field goal position. - Rodgers threw an interception because Adams was bumped off the route. - Adams - you guessed it - dropped another pass in the 4.h quarter. - On the final drive, James Starts was guilty of letting the ball fall through his hands, and then Jones dropped the game-winning touchdown. The final drive stalled. As you can see, the Packers absolutely wrecked themselves with mental errors. They managed to outgain the Bears, 365-290, but no team could've overcame all of those horrible mistakes. So, what can the Packers do to improve this? I'm not sure there are any clear answers besides removing Adams from the lineup. He is absolute trash. He saw a team-high 11 targets, but caught only TWO passes for 14 yards. That's ridiculous! He might just be the least-efficient receiver in the NFL, taking that distinction from "

The protection is an issue, and it makes me wonder if the Packers already regret releasing Josh Sitton. Green Bay's offense sputtered, looking like last year's lethargic version in this contest.    Only 1 Packer registered more than 42 receiving yards. That was Jordy Nelson, who caught 5 balls for 73 yards and Rodgers' sole touchdown. Cobb (5-42) was huge in recovering an early fumble. Adams (3-26) was the 1 who coughed it up. He didn't have a good game, though he did draw a 40-yard pass interference on Waynes.    "

Adams caught a ridiculous 13 passes for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is remarkable because he wasn't even expected to play, given that he was going through concussion protocol on a short work week. Cobb snatched 11 balls for 95 yards and a late score, though he dropped an early touchdown on the opening drive. Montgomery, meanwhile, played running back, yet was still able to catch 10 passes for 66 yards. He also rushed for 60 yards on 9 carries. The 1 dark cloud over Montgomery's performance wasn't his fault. For some reason, Mike McCarthy called a run for Montgomery up the middle on 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Montgomery was predictably stuffed. That's right - with Aaron Rodgers as his quarterback, McCarthy called a rush up the middle with a receiver on what might have been 1 of the most important plays of the game. It was completely irresponsible play-calling, and had the Packers lost this contest, fans could've pointed to that moment for a major, recent reason to fire McCarthy. As for Nelson, it's clear that he's not 100 percent. "

Mariota quickly responded by lofting in a beautiful 32-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews (3-63-1). Green Bay responded with 46-yard pass to Adams set up a Mason Crosby field goal. The Packers muffed the punt on the Titans' next drive, giving Mariota a short field. He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (2-8-1). The Packers scored quickly in response, as Rodgers used Adams to move the ball and set up a screen touchdown pass to James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. Adams and a pass to Randall Cobb (4-31) to get to the 1-yard line. To end the drive, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson on a slant for the touchdown. Mariota quickly responded by lofting in a beautiful 32-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews (3-63-1). Green Bay responded with 46-yard pass to Adams set up a Mason Crosby field goal."

   "comment":"Davante Adams, who was wide open downfield. Still, Rodgers proved that he's just as worthy of being the MVP, if not more, than Adams, who was wide open downfield. Still, Rodgers proved that he's just as worthy of being the MVP, if not more, than Matt Ryan. Rodgers, despite missing Jordy Nelson, made tremendous throws all evening. The only times the Packers stalled, aside from the aforementioned pick, occurred when Geronimo Allison ran a wrong route, and when the officials missed blatant defensive pass interference calls. They made up for it with a very sketchy penalty in the 4.h quarter; the referees had a terrible performance in this contest and really need to be downgraded.    It's not all good news for the Packers, however, as they suffered some injuries in this game. They lost Morgan Burnett on the first drive, and the stud safety was sorely missed, especially in the 4.h quarter when his teammates were worn down. Linemen David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga were also banged up, but they remained in the game (Bakhtiari missed a series). The Packers will need both Burnett and Nelson back for next week's contest in Atlanta.    Cook was the big hero for the Packers for his spectacular catch. Cook was huge, logging 6 catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. He was guilty of a drop to negate a long gain, but he more than made up for it on the final drive. Adams finished with 5 catches for 76 yards, ranking second in yardage. He could've had a better day had the Cowboys not been constantly guilty of tugging on his jersey and not being called for it. "

He could've posted better numbers, but the Cowboys sucked the life out of the 4.h quarter by going on a 9-minute drive that culminated with a Dak Prescott touchdown that seemed like it might give Dallas the victory. And it probably would have if the Packers didn't have the best current quarterback on the planet commanding their offense.    The Packers' victory was terrific, and the cherry on top is that they may have found a legitimate running back. Ty Montgomery is a solid player, but he's not a natural at the position. Rookie Aaron Jones definitely is, and he had a stellar performance in his first career start. Jones burst for 125 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries. He had a key run on the team's final drive; he picked up a big gain and also managed to step out of bounds.    Nelson was hampered with an injury, but he was still able to help his fantasy owners with a touchdown, catching 2 balls for 24 yards. He should've snatched a 2.point conversion in the 4.h quarter; he was wide open, but Rodgers sailed the ball over his head. Meanwhile, Adams' decisive score wasn't his only 1. He caught 7 balls for 66 yards and found the end zone twice. This was amazing, considering the brutal hit he took from Danny Trevathan on Thursday night. Elsewhere in the receiving corps, "
