   "comment":"Davante Adams. Nelson caught a 66-yard bomb in the first quarter, but that was his only reception of the night. Cobb paced the team in targets with 4. catching 3 of them for 34 yards. Adams' score was also his only catch, an 11-yarder. He had an opportunity to reel in another reception, but he slipped in the red zone.    Green Bay's defense was just as excellent as its offense. It made Ponder look terrible. His final numbers - 22-of-44, 222 yards, 2 interceptions - aren't indicative of how poorly he played. As mentioned, the Vikings didn't run a play past midfield until there were 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ponder was then able to rack up some garbage yardage to make his stats look respectable. Ponder had major issues with pass protection. The Packers swarmed his backfield and brought him down on 6 occasions. They also forced some holding penalties. "

   "comment":"Davante Adams. He completely lost his mobility and couldn't escape pressure. Rodgers finished 28-of-39 for 418 yards, a pair of touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 interceptions. The good news for the Packers is that they have a bye coming up, so Rodgers will get to rest his hamstring before a divisional matchup against the Bears at home.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, was pretty much flawless, as he usually is in the Superdome. He misfired on just 5 attempts, going 27-of-32 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't let the ball hit the ground a single time in the second half, completing all 11 of his attempts for 124 yards. Some of his first-half misfires weren't even his fault. For example, Brandin Cooks had a deep drop, though he made up for it on the very same drive by making a great reception that popped into the air and fell back down to him. Brees' scores went to Cooks (6-94), Jimmy Graham (5-59) and Josh Hill. Cooks' touchdown was a thing of beauty, as the speedy rookie blew by 2 defenders and let a perfectly thrown ball just drop into his hands. Graham, meanwhile, didn't register a single first-half reception, but came alive after intermission.    A big part of New Orleans' offense in this contest was the running game. With Khiry Robinson and Pierre Thomas both out, Mark Ingram received a full workload. He made the most of it, bulldozing his way for 172 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Travaris Cadet, meanwhile, handled the Thomas aspect of the offense. He caught 4 balls for 40 receiving yards.    Before I move on to the Packers, there are 2 things that bothered me about the Saints. The first was Brees' clock management at the end of the first half. For whatever reason, he refused to spike the ball to stop the clock, and as a consequence, things got dicey. Brees threw a pass over the middle of the field without any timeouts, and the clock would have expired if there wasn't a defensive penalty. Brees did the same exact thing at the end of the Detroit loss. He would be so much better off spiking the ball, so I have no idea why he won't do that. Also, Sean Payton made a poor decision in the third quarter. Stationed just past midfield, Payton called for a run with his fullback on third-and-1. He was unsuccessful, but Payton opted to go for it on 4.h down. He had Ingram run, but the former first-rounder was stuffed. It was strange that Payton didn't even try a pass with 1 of the NFL's top quarterbacks on 1 of these crucial plays. Fortunately for Payton, it didn't hurt him, as the Packers didn't score on the short field because Rodgers proceeded to hurt his hamstring on the very next drive.    Some notes on the Packers: - Rodgers' sole aerial score went to Randall Cobb, who had 5 catches for 126 yards and a 70-yard touchdown, beating Keenan Lewis. - Lewis covered Jordy Nelson for most of the evening and did a good job; Nelson secured just 3 of his 5 targets for 25 yards. - Davante Adams tied Eddie Lacy for the team lead in targets."

   "comment":"Davante Adams to clinch the victory. Rodgers was able to help his fantasy owners with a rushing touchdown, but he didn't play well overall, as he could've been picked off on a couple of other occasions, including once in the end zone. The protection is an issue, and it makes me wonder if the Packers already regret releasing Josh Sitton. Green Bay's offense sputtered, looking like last year's lethargic version in this contest.    Only 1 Packer registered more than 42 receiving yards. That was "

   "comment":"Davante Adams (12-74) led the way for the team. Nelson finally appears to have come on after a slow start to the season. He had a huge 58-yard catch in the first quarter that got the Packers on the board early. Meanwhile, Adams has emerged as a reliable target for Rodgers. He has 25 catches over the last 2 games and should continue to be heavily targeted as he continues to get open. The only concern about Adams today was a fumble that rolled out of bounds. He tried to do a bit too much to get extra yardage and lost the ball. You cannot fault him for effort, but he needs to be more careful in the future.    One of the most important plays of the day came on the final touchdown drive for the Packers. Rodgers hit Nelson for what would have been a first down, but Nelson backtracked and was short of the first down. However, upon video review it was revealed that "

   "comment":"Davante Adams and a pass to Randall Cobb (4-31) to get to the 1-yard line. To end the drive, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson on a slant for the touchdown. Mariota quickly responded by lofting in a beautiful 32-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews (3-63-1). Green Bay responded with 46-yard pass to Adams set up a Mason Crosby field goal. The Packers muffed the punt on the Titans' next drive, giving Mariota a short field. He took advantage of the oppoturnity with a touchdown pass to Kendall Wright (2-8-1). The Packers scored quickly in response, as Rodgers used Adams to move the ball and set up a screen touchdown pass to James Starks (7-33 rushing, 3-11-1 receiving). The Titans took a 35-16 lead into the locker room after Crosby missed the extra point. In the third quarter, Rodgers made a beautiful throw for a great catch by Adams for 35 yards. A few plays later, Rodgers took off on a 20-yard touchdown run. The 2.point attempt was stopped, so the Titans' lead was cut to 35-22. The Packers tried an onside kick, but the Titans recovered. Mariota took advantage of the opportunity as he found Sharpe wide open in busted coverage for a 33-yard touchdown. Each team added field goal drives to make it 44-25 early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers wasn't on the same page with his tight end, and that led to an interception for Parrish Cox to give the Titans another field goal and clinch the win midway through the 4.h quarter.    Rodgers was 31-of-51 for 371 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions - 1 came on a Hail Mary on the last play of the first half. He also ran for 27 yards and a touchdown. Rodgers played well overall and wasn't the reason for this Packers' loss.    Jordy Nelson led Green Bay with 12 catches for 126 yards and 1 touchdown. Davante Adams had 6 receptions for 156 yards.    Mariota was incredibly efficient and accurate, completing 19-of-26 passes for 295 yards with 4 touchdowns. Walker was superb with 9 catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.    DeMarco Murray ran for 123 yards on 17 carries with a score.    Defensively, the Titans got a good game from rookie safety Kevin Byard with 7 tackles and a sack. "

   "comment":"Davante Adams touchdown for 66 yards, thrown 90 seconds into the game, was the Packers' longest play of the season. With the Seahawks unable to generate much offense, Rodgers made the Earl Thomas-less Seattle defense pay throughout the evening. This contest was such a blowout that Rodgers was pulled early in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers misfired on just 5 attempts, going 18-of-23 for 246 yards and 3 touchdowns, and his only poor throw was when he missed a wide-open Adams for another score. If there's a dark cloud over this victory, it's that Rodgers tweaked his calf in the first quarter. That didn't affect his passing ability, obviously, but he couldn't scramble whatsoever. Rodgers' ability to move around is very crucial to his game, so we'll see if this affects him going forward.    Rodgers wasn't the only Packer who sustained an injury, as "
