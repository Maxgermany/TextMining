   "comment":"Rogers, making it 24-20 Pittsburgh with just over 3 minutes left in the game. The Steelers, however, had help on their touchdown drive. The Bengals' defense had a meltdown in their 2015 playoff loss to the Steelers when they were flagged repeatedly late in the game, giving the lead away. And this week, they did something similar, getting called for 4 straight penalties on the Steelers' game-winning and only touchdown drive. The Bengals had talked about being under control and how they wouldn't let something like last season's playoff game happen again, but they did. It probably cost them the game and any chance at the playoffs. The Bengals are eliminated from the playoffs, but the Steelers remain in first place in the AFC North with a showdown against the Baltimore Ravens in Pittsburgh. The winner will likely win the division, as the Ravens beat the Steelers earlier in the season and would own the tiebreaker if they swept them.   "

   "comment":"Rogers lost fumble, and they were very fortunate to retain possession following a Tom Brady lost fumble that should've been rewarded to Pittsburgh. However, the Steelers struggled to stop the Patriots on too many drives, and they probably would've lost to the Patriots regardless. This game would've been a lot closer with Bell on the field, though.    Tom Brady finished 32-of-42 for 384 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also fumbled, but despite the Steelers getting a clear recovery, incompetent officiating ruled New England possession without any sort of explanation. That was Brady's sole mistake of the afternoon, and his numbers would've been better if it weren't for a couple of drops. It really helped that Brady was seldom hit this evening. He took a sack early, but was barely touched after that. Brady will be heading to his seventh Super Bowl, and if he gets the win, he'll have the most championships of any quarterback in NFL history, breaking the current tie he has with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw.    Despite Brady's high yardage total, only 3 Patriots accumulated more han 13 receiving yards. They were Chris Hogan (9-180), Julian Edelman (8-118) and Martellus Bennett (5-32). Hogan secured 2 of Brady's 3 touchdowns, while Edelman snatched the other. Both made big plays in this game, obviously, but Edelman really sparked the team with a 12-yard conversion on a third-and-10 between 2 defenders, ultimately leading to a score.    The Patriots tried to run with LeGarrette Blount in the early going, but weren't very successful; his 5 first-half carries went for just 4 yards. However, the flu-stricken Steelers wore down in the second half, and Blount finished with 47 yards and a touchdown on 16 tries. His best run was when he managed to carry what appeared to be the entire Pittsburgh defense down to the 1-yard line.    Back to the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 31-of-47 for 314 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. While Roethlisberger accumulated a bulk of his numbers in garbage time, it's still amazing that he was competent when factoring in the utter trash he was throwing to. With Bell injured and Brown constantly double teamed, he had to resort to working with the aforementioned Coates, Hamilton and Heyward-Bey. The first drive saw Roethlisberger curiously take a deep shot to Coates on a third-and-1, which fell incomplete. Hamilton dropped a touchdown in the second quarter. Coates then did the same thing right after halftime. Heyward-Bey was responsible for Roethlisberger's interception, as he wasn't even aware the ball was heading in his direction. The Steelers could have Martavis Bryant back next year, but he needs to be reinstated. It's difficult for the Steelers to trust him, so they may target 1 of the 2017 NFL Draft Wide Receiver Prospect Rankings in the early rounds. Roethlisberger desperately needs someone reliable to throw to outside of Brown.    Pittsburgh's 2 leading receivers were predictably Brown (7-77)and Rogers (7-66). However, Brown didn't do much when this game was in doubt, while Rogers was responsible for a lost fumble that gave the Patriots a quick touchdown, putting this game completely out of reach.    With Bell limited to just 6 carries (20 yards), "
