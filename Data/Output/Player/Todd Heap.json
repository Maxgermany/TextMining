I was perplexed when Flacco took a sack on a third-and-one in the first quarter. How do you take a sack on third-and-short? And why was a rookie quarterback even throwing in that situation? Flacco also fumbled later.    So much for the Wildcat offense. Baltimore completely shut down the Dolphins' scoring attack. "
