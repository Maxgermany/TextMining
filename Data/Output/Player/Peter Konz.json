   "comment":"Konz was lost with a knee issue. To give you an idea of the amount of pressure Ryan faced, the 5 sacks he took aren't even close to being indicative of the amount of heat Baltimore brought. Ryan's poor blocking is the primary reason why the Falcons achieved only 4 first downs and 61 net yards in the opening half. Ryan also lost a fumble in the red zone early on when he was under siege. Later, 1 of the sacks was taken in Ryan's own end zone, resulting in a safety. It was a 20-7 contest at that point, so the Falcons still had a chance, albeit a very slim 1. That safety iced this victory for the Ravens, who continue to play impressive football.    "
