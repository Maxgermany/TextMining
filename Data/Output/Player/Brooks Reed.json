   "comment":"Brooks Reed did not do a bad job stepping in, but the front 7 was not nearly as effective the rest of the way. On the other hand, Oakland's front made Schaub uneasy. He was only sacked 3 times, but looked out of it at times, and was an erratic 24-for-51, with the aforementioned tipped passes a huge problem.    After a punt from each side to start the second half, Houston found a way to involve Foster. He took a screen 60 yards and would finish with a game-high 116 yards receiving on 5 catches. Needless to say, Andre Johnson was missed, but 4 Texans had at least 81 yards receiving. The drive immediately stalled, and it was wasted when "

  "comment":"Brooks Reed was able to record a game-ending sack to give the Falcons their first victory of the season. It was discouraging to see the Falcons post just 23 points against a Chicago defense missing its top cornerback. That said, Atlanta began its 2016 campaign sluggishly as well, losing to Tampa Bay at home. The Falcons at least won this contest, though they needed some late-game fortune to do so.    ",
