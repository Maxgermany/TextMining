Later, Freeman was intercepted by Brian Cushing on a deflected pass off Kellen Winslow. Cushing played phenomenally for the Texans with 8 tackles, a sack that caused a punt and that interception. His pick led to former Tampa Bay running back Derrick Ward getting into the end zone with a 4-yard touchdown run. With the Texans up 30-3, Freeman threw another interception. Tampa Bay later removed Freeman and inserted backup Josh Johnson. On his first play, he fumbled a handoff that was recovered by Houston. The Texans could have scored again with an easy field goal, but they ran it on 4.h-and-long. The Houston defense played an excellent game. They harassed Freeman all afternoon. Reed and J."

Cam Cameron idiotically forgot to involve Ray Rice early on. Rice finished with 21 carries, gaining 60 rushing yards in the process, but had just 4 catches. Even worse, Cameron was guilty of some really predictable play-calling at the goal line in the 4.h quarter. He did a good job with this in the first quarter, signaling in a play-action pass from Flacco to Kris Wilson, which resulted in a touchdown, so I don't understand why Cameron went back to stupidity when he could have sealed the deal. No, wait. I do understand what happened. Cameron is just that completely inept. - What happened to Baltimore's run defense? I figured it would be better with Ray Lewis healthy, but Arian Foster managed to rush for 132 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. This made things easier for T.J. Yates. Of course, Yates' turnovers made things easier for the Ravens. Yates went 17-of-35 for 184 yards and 3 interceptions. He could have been picked off on 5 occasions, but Ed Reed dropped 2 interceptions in the first half. Yates' problem wasn't accuracy; in fact, most of his throws were on the money. The issue was that he predetermined where he wanted to go on some of his attempts. He stared down "

   "comment":"Brooks Reed was able to record a game-ending sack to give the Falcons their first victory of the season. It was discouraging to see the Falcons post just 23 points against a Chicago defense missing its top cornerback. That said, Atlanta began its 2016 campaign sluggishly as well, losing to Tampa Bay at home. The Falcons at least won this contest, though they needed some late-game fortune to do so.
