   "comment":"Shepard falling down. The Ravens took the lead, but that didn't last very long. Manning, who was horrid in early going, lofted a bomb to Beckham, who managed to secure it for a 75-yard touchdown, torching Will Davis, who was on the field because starting cornerback Jimmy Smith left the game with an injury. The Ravens managed to take the lead, but Manning once again hit Beckham for a long score, this time a 66-yarder on a 4.h-and-1 as a result of a 2 Baltimore defensive backs crashing into each other. Beckham followed that up by ripping off his helmet, running to the kicking net and proposing to it. After the net apparently said yes, he hugged the net, which collapsed as a result, so Beckham did more harm than good to his new fiancee. The Giants had a 4.point advantage with less than 2 minutes remaining, but the Ravens drove down the field and nearly reached the red zone, thanks to a very bogus roughing-the-passer penalty. Joe Flacco had an open receiver at the 5-yard line, but overthrew him. Flacco then had to try a Hail Mary, and that fell incomplete as time expired.    As you can tell, this game was insane, with so many twists and turns. Either team could have won it; the Ravens failed to convert a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Plus, these teams weren't far apart in terms of net yardage (435-391, Giants), and Baltimore won the time-of-possession battle by more than 10 minutes.    Speaking of twists and turns, that could appropriately describe Eli Manning's performance. Manning began very poorly; as mentioned, he was throwing way behind countless receivers. However, his deep connections to Beckham bolstered his stat line, and he finished 32-of-46 for 403 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first score was the 300th of his career. By the way, neither of Manning's interceptions were his fault; I mentioned Shepard fell down during 1 of them. The other occurred when Manning tried to make something happen at the end of the first half, so the turnover didn't hurt at all.    Beckham had just 2 catches for 11 yards at halftime, and as mentioned, he was dealing with a hip pointer. However, he came alive following intermission, and he finished with 8 catches for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns, as Baltimore's beleaguered secondary blew coverage after coverage.    "

Manning had a very mixed performance. He began the game 1-of-6 for only 1 yard and a pick-six in which he didn't see Malcolm Jenkins. Manning caught fire after that, as he seemed to figure out what the Eagles were doing defensively. He engineered some scoring drives, but his hot streak fizzled when he threw his second of 3 picks, as he telegraphed a throw that was snatched by Malcolm Jenkins. Manning finished 38-of-63, 356 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It certainly wasn't a horrible showing, but his first 2 picks were absolute killers and allowed the Eagles to prevail. Manning is a weak spot on the Giants' roster as it stands, but he's not getting much help from his offensive line. That said, the blocking has been better with Justin Pugh on the field.    Despite facing constant double teams, Odell Beckham Jr. saw a whopping 20 targets. He snatched 11 of them for 150 yards. Beckham dropped a pass in the third quarter, but he should've caught a touchdown, as Manning overthrew him in the final frame. Shepard and Victor Cruz were targeted a ton as well, which isn't a surprise considering that Manning threw the ball 63 times."

   "comment":"Shepard caught a 77-yard touchdown from Manning that gave the team a 21-14 lead with just 7 minutes left to go. But the Eagles would drive to tie it. After exchanging field goals, the game looked destined to be heading to overtime. Then, Jake Elliott happened. Elliott, the rookie kicker who had replaced an injured Caleb Sturgis just a week ago, was given a chance to kick a 61-yard field goal to clinch the win for the Eagles. The choice was not too surprising, given that Doug Pederson had been aggressive in going for it on 4.h down in multiple occasions in the contest. Still, handing the game over to a rookie for the longest kick of his life was risky, but it paid off.    Though the Eagles won, they still had a mediocre performance for most of the contest. Part of the the problem was their offense's lack of ability to consistently move the ball. Carson Wentz had his worst performance of the 2017 season and definitely didn't look great. He held onto the ball too long against the Giants' stellar pass rush, and he took 3 sacks as a result. The pressures occurred early in the game and seemed to get him out of rhythm. Wentz went 21-of-31 for 176 yards and a touchdown, but had issues with his downfield accuracy during the contest. He couldn't hit Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way. Jeffery had a nice afternoon, battling Janoris Jenkins and catching the crucial pass that set up the Elliott field goal. Jeffery will be an up-and-down fantasy performer, but is a high-end WR2 most weeks. Smith is a boom-or-bust play, but he did well to catch most of his targets on Sunday.    Doug Pederson got some criticism for refusing to give LeGarrette Blount a carry against the Chiefs in Week 2. Against the Giants, Blount split the workload with Wendell Smallwood and got 12 carries for 67 yards and a score. Blount looked strong and was able to run through some of the Giants' defenders. However, his inconsistent workload will make him a FLEX play most weeks. Smallwood actually outgained Blount with 71 yards on 12 carries. He looked fairly good, but Blount will continue to see goal-line work. Darren Sproles suffered a wrist injury in this game and was replaced by Corey Clement, who had a nice 15-yard touchdown scamper late in the contest. Clement looked good, but will be kept in a limited role.    The Giants lost to fall to 0-3, but the most encouraging part of the victory for the team was the improvement of Manning. In the second half, Manning was able to help lead the team's offense without making many mistakes. He had issues throwing the ball downfield in the early portion of the contest, but once the 4.h quarter hit, he caught fire. On the first 3 drives of the 4.h quarter, Manning threw no incompletions and had the 3 touchdown passes. He was sharp and accurate, and finally looked to be in rhythm with his receivers. He was able to spread the ball around to his top options and really get everyone involved down the stretch. Overall, Manning finished 35-of-47 for 366 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. Though the picks were not good-looking plays, his second-half performance was very strong. The Giants are going to need him to play like that moving forward. Manning has to carry the offense. He truly is the team's catalyst.    Manning's top receiver was predictably Beckham for most of the contest. After missing Week 1 and being limited in Week 2, Beckham looked to be healthy for the first time. He caught the 2 touchdown passes and was able to rack up 79 yards on 9 catches. He also led the team with 13 targets. Beckham is undoubtedly a WR1 in fantasy, and he can be trusted in any matchup going forward. Elsewhere, Brandon Marshall (8-66) and Sterling Shepard mixed in well as the second and third options. Marshall finally looked to be putting forth a strong effort in his third game. Beckham's presence opened the field for him more, and Marshall can be played as a FLEX in certain matchups. Meanwhile, Shepard led the team with 133 yards, but a lot of it came on the 77-yard touchdown catch. He can be a FLEX in certain matchups, but is too inconsistent to be in the lineup.    In the running game, the Giants struggled continued. "

   "comment":"Shepard. Manning then hit a few more receptions before throwing a 9.yard touchdown strike to Evan Engram. The Giants' defense continued to struggle with tight ends and allowed a score to a tight end for the 10th-straight game. Beathard hit Garrett Celek (4-67-1) on the run, and he broke a tackle from Janoris Jenkins to get into end zone for a 47-yard score. That gave the 49ers a 17-13 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Giants had a drive end with a missed 34-yard field goal. The 49ers soon moved inside the 30-yard line, but Olivier Vernon intercepted a screen pass to snatch the scoring opportunity away. San Francisco got the ball back and continued to move the chains on New York. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Beathard kept a bootleg to run into the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown. A few minutes later, the 49ers put the game away with Matt Breida (9-55-1) running up the middle untouched for a 33-yard touchdown as Landon Collins took a bad angle to let Breida cut upfield for pay dirt.    Beathard completed 19-of-25 passes for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Carlos Hyde led the 49ers on the ground with 17 carries for 98 yards.    Manning was 28-of-37 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. Shepard caught 11 passes for 142 yards. Engram hauled in 6 passes for 31 yards and a touchdown.    "
