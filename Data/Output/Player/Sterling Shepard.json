   "comment":"Sterling Shepard caught a 77-yard touchdown from Manning that gave the team a 21-14 lead with just 7 minutes left to go. But the Eagles would drive to tie it. After exchanging field goals, the game looked destined to be heading to overtime. Then, Jake Elliott happened. Elliott, the rookie kicker who had replaced an injured Caleb Sturgis just a week ago, was given a chance to kick a 61-yard field goal to clinch the win for the Eagles. The choice was not too surprising, given that Doug Pederson had been aggressive in going for it on 4.h down in multiple occasions in the contest. Still, handing the game over to a rookie for the longest kick of his life was risky, but it paid off.    Though the Eagles won, they still had a mediocre performance for most of the contest. Part of the the problem was their offense's lack of ability to consistently move the ball. Carson Wentz had his worst performance of the 2017 season and definitely didn't look great. He held onto the ball too long against the Giants' stellar pass rush, and he took 3 sacks as a result. The pressures occurred early in the game and seemed to get him out of rhythm. Wentz went 21-of-31 for 176 yards and a touchdown, but had issues with his downfield accuracy during the contest. He couldn't hit Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way. Jeffery had a nice afternoon, battling Janoris Jenkins and catching the crucial pass that set up the Elliott field goal. Jeffery will be an up-and-down fantasy performer, but is a high-end WR2 most weeks. Smith is a boom-or-bust play, but he did well to catch most of his targets on Sunday.    Doug Pederson got some criticism for refusing to give LeGarrette Blount a carry against the Chiefs in Week 2. Against the Giants, Blount split the workload with Wendell Smallwood and got 12 carries for 67 yards and a score. Blount looked strong and was able to run through some of the Giants' defenders. However, his inconsistent workload will make him a FLEX play most weeks. Smallwood actually outgained Blount with 71 yards on 12 carries. He looked fairly good, but Blount will continue to see goal-line work. Darren Sproles suffered a wrist injury in this game and was replaced by Corey Clement, who had a nice 15-yard touchdown scamper late in the contest. Clement looked good, but will be kept in a limited role.    The Giants lost to fall to 0-3, but the most encouraging part of the victory for the team was the improvement of Manning. In the second half, Manning was able to help lead the team's offense without making many mistakes. He had issues throwing the ball downfield in the early portion of the contest, but once the 4.h quarter hit, he caught fire. On the first 3 drives of the 4.h quarter, Manning threw no incompletions and had the 3 touchdown passes. He was sharp and accurate, and finally looked to be in rhythm with his receivers. He was able to spread the ball around to his top options and really get everyone involved down the stretch. Overall, Manning finished 35-of-47 for 366 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. Though the picks were not good-looking plays, his second-half performance was very strong. The Giants are going to need him to play like that moving forward. Manning has to carry the offense. He truly is the team's catalyst.    Manning's top receiver was predictably Beckham for most of the contest. After missing Week 1 and being limited in Week 2, Beckham looked to be healthy for the first time. He caught the 2 touchdown passes and was able to rack up 79 yards on 9 catches. He also led the team with 13 targets. Beckham is undoubtedly a WR1 in fantasy, and he can be trusted in any matchup going forward. Elsewhere, Brandon Marshall (8-66) and Sterling Shepard mixed in well as the second and third options. Marshall finally looked to be putting forth a strong effort in his third game. Beckham's presence opened the field for him more, and Marshall can be played as a FLEX in certain matchups. Meanwhile, Shepard led the team with 133 yards, but a lot of it came on the 77-yard touchdown catch. He can be a FLEX in certain matchups, but is too inconsistent to be in the lineup.    In the running game, the Giants struggled continued. "

   "comment":"Sterling Shepard caught a 77-yard touchdown from Manning that gave the team a 21-14 lead with just 7 minutes left to go. But the Eagles would drive to tie it. After exchanging field goals, the game looked destined to be heading to overtime. Then, Jake Elliott happened. Elliott, the rookie kicker who had replaced an injured Caleb Sturgis just a week ago, was given a chance to kick a 61-yard field goal to clinch the win for the Eagles. The choice was not too surprising, given that Doug Pederson had been aggressive in going for it on 4.h down in multiple occasions in the contest. Still, handing the game over to a rookie for the longest kick of his life was risky, but it paid off.    Though the Eagles won, they still had a mediocre performance for most of the contest. Part of the the problem was their offense's lack of ability to consistently move the ball. Carson Wentz had his worst performance of the 2017 season and definitely didn't look great. He held onto the ball too long against the Giants' stellar pass rush, and he took 3 sacks as a result. The pressures occurred early in the game and seemed to get him out of rhythm. Wentz went 21-of-31 for 176 yards and a touchdown, but had issues with his downfield accuracy during the contest. He couldn't hit Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way. Jeffery had a nice afternoon, battling Janoris Jenkins and catching the crucial pass that set up the Elliott field goal. Jeffery will be an up-and-down fantasy performer, but is a high-end WR2 most weeks. Smith is a boom-or-bust play, but he did well to catch most of his targets on Sunday.
