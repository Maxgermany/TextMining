   "comment":"Robinson false started. A Robinson hold, by the way, ruined a previous promising drive. - Field goal. That's just awful. So was Jeff Fisher's decision-making. Fisher ran a fake punt on 1 occasion, which failed, and then he inexplicably punted on a fourth-and-5 on Pittsburgh's 42 late in the third quarter. The punt went into the end zone for a net gain of just 22 yards.    This game was delayed for nearly a half hour because of a pyrotechnics accident when a blue flame torched part of the field. This was especially embarrassing, as these fireworks were unnecessary because the stadium was half-empty. Those in the stands cheered for the Steelers. A loud HEEEEEATH was heard when Miller caught a pass, and a Pittsburgh touchdown was cheered frantically. The Rams barely have any fans, and it's painfully obvious that the team needs to move back to Los Angeles.   "
