   "comment":"Nelson Agholor, though it's possible that the rookie receiver ran the wrong route. It was so ugly that it was difficult to tell what happened. With all that being said, I wouldn't panic on Bradford just yet. He has an easy matchup next week against the Jets, who may not have Antonio Cromartie, so he could rebound with a decent fantasy performance. However, it's difficult to justify starting him at this point until he shows that he can do something outside of garbage time. The offensive line is a huge issue, and if Bradford has to keep operating in long-yardage situations, the Eagles will be in trouble. Bradford led the team in rushing yardage (9) in this game, for crying out loud.    Agholor, though it's possible that the rookie receiver ran the wrong route.

The stats may not show it, as Matthews secured 6 balls for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came late, and Matthews dropped several passes, including a third down early in the game. He'll continue to be a strong fantasy option, but he needs to improve in real life.    Agholor, who may have botched an aforementioned play, caught 3 of 6 targets for 31 yards. He was a bigger part of the offense this week, but he's not anywhere near the fantasy radar yet, especially with Bradford and the blocking struggling.    Two other Eagles that need to be mentioned: Ertz saw 7 targets, but reeled in just 3 grabs for 17 yards. Bradford was also intercepted while throwing the ball to him in the end zone. "

Bradford's numbers would've been better had the Eagles not been guilty of several drops throughout the second half. Zach Ertz let a potential third-down conversion fall through his hands. The Celek interception could be considered a drop. Agholor also messed up in the red zone. Bradford, however, missed some throws that he needs to convert.

   "comment":"Nelson Agholor in the end zone. Agholor in the end zone. Zach Ertz dropped a ball on a third down that would've moved the chains. Riley Cooper dropped a potential 40-yard reception, and then Chip Kelly compounded the mistake by throwing the challenge flag. Drops weren't the only issue. Ertz had a big game - 13 catches, 122 yards - but he lost a fumble in the second quarter that set up the Redskins with a field goal. It seemed like Ertz's shin was down - the 2 CBS announcers and Mike Carey believed this to be true - but senile official Walt Coleman is too incompetent to overturn anything. The fact that Coleman is still officiating despite being mentality incapable of doing so is a complete embarrassment. At any rate, the Eagles had a sequence where they were flagged for illegal substitution on a special-teams trick play. A 5-yard penalty on an illegal formation pushed them back, and a false start moved them to first-and-20. Sam Bradford followed that up by missing a wide-open Ertz for a touchdown. This was 1 of 2 instances where Bradford overshot 1 of his players for a score.    Bradford's numbers look nice. He went 37-of-56 for 380 yards and a touchdown. That doesn't tell the entire story, however. As a positive for Bradford, he should've had more success, but the Eagles dropped a half-a-dozen passes. On the flip side, Bradford, as mentioned, missed 2 open players for would-be touchdowns. He made some impressive throws early on, but turned into an Alex Smith-type dink-and-dunker as the evening progressed. He showed absolutely no desperation when the Eagles were down 21 with about 6 minutes remaining. He and his team simply quit.    Bradford's sole touchdown went to Jordan Matthews, who snagged 6 balls for 104 yards and a touchdown. He's the only viable wide receiver, as Agholor (2-35), Josh Huff (1-8) and Cooper (no catches) dropped numerous passes."

   "comment":"Nelson Agholor is now persona non grata in the City of Brotherly Love. If Agholor is still on the roster by Tuesday, the people downtown may stop protesting free democratic elections and begin chanting for Agholor to be cut. The Eagles should just misplace him with some luggage on the flight back to Philadelphia.    The Seahawks absolutely dominated the Eagles. The final score says that Seattle won by just 11, but the margin of victory felt like it was a lot more than that. The Seahawks controlled the contest from start to finish and really solidified themselves as a contender after a tough start to the year. The running game for the Seahawks was very impressive. Despite the unceremonious release of Christine Michael early in the week, the team was able to utilize its backs to the best of their respective abilities. Thomas Rawls led the way for the Seahawks with 14 carries for 57 yards. He did not miss a beat in his return from injury, and his physical running style will be hugely beneficial for the offense. C.J. Prosise looked great as well. He had a 72-yard touchdown run where he burst through the line and ran around some would-be tacklers. Prosise displayed great speed and looked like he would be the third-down/change-of-pace back going forward. In all, he totaled 4 carries for 76 yards and the touchdown, before leaving the game hurt. Unfortunately, Prosise' injury turned out to be a broken scapula, which will result in him missing approximately 8 weeks.    Russell Wilson was yet another Seahawk who put together a strong performance. Wilson finally looks to be back after an injury-plagued start to the 2016 season. In the contest, Wilson went 18-of-31 for 272 yards and a touchdown. He displayed excellent downfield accuracy, tossing numerous perfect deep balls. On 1 in particular, he lofted the ball to Tyler Lockett for what was nearly a touchdown. Wilson hit the speedster in stride, but Lockett went out of bounds at the 3-yard line. Wilson was also able to have an impact in terms of scrambling around. His mobility has returned as his ankle has gotten healthier, and that was on display today. He ran the ball 5 times for 23 yards, but he was also able to move around the pocket, avoid sacks, and complete passes downfield. On a trick play, he caught a 15-yard pass from Doug Baldwin went for a touchdown. Overall, this was a great day for Wilson, and he is certainly returning to his peak performance level.    Because of the improved play of Wilson, Seattle's receivers were able to find some success. Doug Baldwin (4-104) was the top target of the quarterback during the game. He was constantly getting open downfield, and he was able to get some serious yards after the catch as well. On 1 short completion, Baldwin managed to turn upfield and avoid tacklers to get a big gain. He should be a low-end WR1 so long as Wilson is healthy.    Jimmy Graham (3-46, 1 TD) was Wilson's second-favorite target. Graham put together yet another solid performance, and he continues to defy the odds coming off of a devastating knee injury. His touchdown was a highly impressive play, as he caught the ball and used his physicality to push the defender away as he brought it in. Graham then scampered to the end zone for the 35-yard touchdown. He is 1 of the top-five tight ends in fantasy right now.    Elsewhere, Tyler Lockett (2-39) looks to be at full speed again. He had just 2 catches, but he had some opportunities that were wiped out by penalties. He will be a factor down the stretch and is worth picking up if he is available in your league.    Defensively, Bobby Wagner once again stood out. Arguably the best linebacker in the league, Wagner had 15 total tackles on the day and was constantly making plays in the backfield. He recorded a sack and 2 tackles for a loss. He is probably the most important player on the Seahawks' defense.    The Eagles have to be disappointed in the result of this contest. They were hanging with the Seahawks early, but they absolutely fell apart as the game went on. Part of that can be blamed on the inexperience of Carson Wentz. Wentz had a tough day, going 23-of-45 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He simply did not have it. Early on, he made some sharp throws against the Seahawks' defense, but eventually the talent of their secondary caught up with him. Wentz had some issues with staring down receivers, and that helped to lead to 1 of the picks by Kam Chancellor. Wentz telegraphed his throw and allowed the roaming safety to come across and grab the pass. That seemed to shake Wentz's confidence, and from there, he had more problems. Still, Wentz was not altogether terrible. He had a below-average game against a tough defense. The contest will be a learning experience for the rookie, and it will be interesting to see if he improves following this contest.    Part of Wentz's issues stemmed from issues with Philadelphia's receiving corps. At 1 point, the receivers had 15 receiving yards, which was the same amount as Russell Wilson. Nelson Agholor was guilty of some brutal drops, as always. By the end of the game, Agholor is now persona non grata in the City of Brotherly Love. If Agholor is still on the roster by Tuesday, the people downtown may stop protesting free democratic elections and begin chanting for Agholor to be cut. The Eagles should just misplace him with some luggage on the flight back to Philadelphia.    The Seahawks absolutely dominated the Eagles.

   "comment":"Nelson Agholor, at 1 point, that would have gone for a touchdown if it was not for a blatant pass interference by Quinton Dunbar. The only big mistake that Wentz made was a pick in the end zone. In the first half, the Eagles were driving and had all the momentum against the Redskins. They were facing a third-and-goal when Wentz threw a ball over the middle. Safety Deshazor Everett managed to get in front of the receiver and picked it off. It was not a bad throw from Wentz, but he has to show better decision-making as he continues to develop.    Wentz was able to do a lot despite having only 1 proven receiver. Ertz led the way in targets (13), catches (10) and yards (112) during the game. He could end up being a big fantasy performer down the stretch, though the Redskins have been notoriously bad against tight ends this year.    Jordan Matthews (8-79) put together a strong performance, and he is the No. 1 receiver on the Eagles right now. He can be used as a WR3 unless he has a tough matchup.

Safety Deshazor Everett managed to get in front of the receiver and picked it off. It was not a bad throw from Wentz, but he has to show better decision-making as he continues to develop.    Wentz was able to do a lot despite having only 1 proven receiver. Ertz led the way in targets (13), catches (10) and yards (112) during the game. He could end up being a big fantasy performer down the stretch, though the Redskins have been notoriously bad against tight ends this year.    Jordan Matthews (8-79) put together a strong performance, and he is the No. 1 receiver on the Eagles right now. He can be used as a WR3 unless he has a tough matchup. Nelson Agholor (2-22) looked better today as he used his speed to beat Washington's corners. He just did not see a lot of targets. Tight end "

Wentz's mobility allowed him to move around the pocket easily and find open receivers. Wentz was very accurate on most of his throws, and he was able to make clutch completions in third-and-long scenarios. His downfield accuracy was very good, and that should bode well for the Eagles moving forward. Wentz's 1 issue was that he overthrew Agholor on a few different occasions. On 3 passes, Agholor had to reach up to try to knock a ball down to himself, and each time, he was mostly wide open. One of Wentz's biggest mistakes came on a backward pass to Agholor that was too high. Agholor dropped it, and the Redskins recovered the fumble. Overall, Wentz went 26-for-39, totaling 307 yards, 2 touchdowns, and throwing an interception. This is an impressive stat line, and he is definitely improving with each game. Wentz will soon be a top-10 quarterback in the NFL.    Wentz's favorite receiver was unsurprisingly tight end Zach Ertz. Last season, the 2 developed a strong rapport, and it carried over to this opener. Ertz caught all 8 of his targets for 93 yards and had many key first-down catches. Ertz is a smooth route runner, and he is definitely a TE1 in fantasy this season.
