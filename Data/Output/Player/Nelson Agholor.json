   "comment":"Agholor, though it's possible that the rookie receiver ran the wrong route. It was so ugly that it was difficult to tell what happened. With all that being said, I wouldn't panic on Bradford just yet. He has an easy matchup next week against the Jets, who may not have Antonio Cromartie, so he could rebound with a decent fantasy performance. However, it's difficult to justify starting him at this point until he shows that he can do something outside of garbage time. The offensive line is a huge issue, and if Bradford has to keep operating in long-yardage situations, the Eagles will be in trouble. Bradford led the team in rushing yardage (9) in this game, for crying out loud.    Jordan Matthews struggled as well. The stats may not show it, as Matthews secured 6 balls for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came late, and Matthews dropped several passes, including a third down early in the game. He'll continue to be a strong fantasy option, but he needs to improve in real life.    Agholor, who may have botched an aforementioned play, caught 3 of 6 targets for 31 yards. He was a bigger part of the offense this week, but he's not anywhere near the fantasy radar yet, especially with Bradford and the blocking struggling.    Two other Eagles that need to be mentioned: Ertz saw 7 targets, but reeled in just 3 grabs for 17 yards. Bradford was also intercepted while throwing the ball to him in the end zone. "

Riley Cooper dropped a potential 40-yard reception, and then Chip Kelly compounded the mistake by throwing the challenge flag. Drops weren't the only issue. Ertz had a big game - 13 catches, 122 yards - but he lost a fumble in the second quarter that set up the Redskins with a field goal. It seemed like Ertz's shin was down - the 2 CBS announcers and Mike Carey believed this to be true - but senile official Walt Coleman is too incompetent to overturn anything. The fact that Coleman is still officiating despite being mentality incapable of doing so is a complete embarrassment. At any rate, the Eagles had a sequence where they were flagged for illegal substitution on a special-teams trick play. A 5-yard penalty on an illegal formation pushed them back, and a false start moved them to first-and-20. Sam Bradford followed that up by missing a wide-open Ertz for a touchdown. This was 1 of 2 instances where Bradford overshot 1 of his players for a score.    Bradford's numbers look nice. He went 37-of-56 for 380 yards and a touchdown. That doesn't tell the entire story, however. As a positive for Bradford, he should've had more success, but the Eagles dropped a half-a-dozen passes. On the flip side, Bradford, as mentioned, missed 2 open players for would-be touchdowns. He made some impressive throws early on, but turned into an Alex Smith-type dink-and-dunker as the evening progressed. He showed absolutely no desperation when the Eagles were down 21 with about 6 minutes remaining. He and his team simply quit.    Bradford's sole touchdown went to Jordan Matthews, who snagged 6 balls for 104 yards and a touchdown. He's the only viable wide receiver, as Agholor (2-35), Josh Huff (1-8) and Cooper (no catches) dropped numerous passes."

If Agholor is still on the roster by Tuesday, the people downtown may stop protesting free democratic elections and begin chanting for Agholor to be cut. The Eagles should just misplace him with some luggage on the flight back to Philadelphia.    The Seahawks absolutely dominated the Eagles. The final score says that Seattle won by just 11, but the margin of victory felt like it was a lot more than that. The Seahawks controlled the contest from start to finish and really solidified themselves as a contender after a tough start to the year. The running game for the Seahawks was very impressive. Despite the unceremonious release of Christine Michael early in the week, the team was able to utilize its backs to the best of their respective abilities. "

   "comment":"Agholor, at 1 point, that would have gone for a touchdown if it was not for a blatant pass interference by Quinton Dunbar. The only big mistake that Wentz made was a pick in the end zone. In the first half, the Eagles were driving and had all the momentum against the Redskins. They were facing a third-and-goal when Wentz threw a ball over the middle. Safety Deshazor Everett managed to get in front of the receiver and picked it off. It was not a bad throw from Wentz, but he has to show better decision-making as he continues to develop.    Wentz was able to do a lot despite having only 1 proven receiver. Ertz led the way in targets (13), catches (10) and yards (112) during the game. He could end up being a big fantasy performer down the stretch, though the Redskins have been notoriously bad against tight ends this year.    Jordan Matthews (8-79) put together a strong performance, and he is the No. 1 receiver on the Eagles right now. He can be used as a WR3 unless he has a tough matchup. Nelson Agholor (2-22) looked better today as he used his speed to beat Washington's corners. He just did not see a lot of targets. Tight end "

   "comment":"Agholor for a 58-yard touchdown. That 1 play was a microcosm of Wentz's performance on Sunday. Wentz's mobility allowed him to move around the pocket easily and find open receivers. Wentz was very accurate on most of his throws, and he was able to make clutch completions in third-and-long scenarios. His downfield accuracy was very good, and that should bode well for the Eagles moving forward. Wentz's 1 issue was that he overthrew Agholor on a few different occasions. On 3 passes, Agholor had to reach up to try to knock a ball down to himself, and each time, he was mostly wide open. One of Wentz's biggest mistakes came on a backward pass to Agholor that was too high. Agholor dropped it, and the Redskins recovered the fumble. Overall, Wentz went 26-for-39, totaling 307 yards, 2 touchdowns, and throwing an interception. This is an impressive stat line, and he is definitely improving with each game. Wentz will soon be a top-10 quarterback in the NFL.    Wentz's favorite receiver was unsurprisingly tight end "

   "comment":"Agholor (3-58) and Alshon Jeffery (3-29, 1 TD). Ertz was the most consistent threat, and he was able to make a nice catch on a 38-yard pass. The Eagles were backed up deep in their own territory when Wentz threw a perfect touch pass Ertz's way just over the defender. Ertz will continue to be a TE1 each week. As for Agholor and Jeffery, they were a bit less consistent. Much of Agholor's damage came on a 36-yard catch at the beginning of the contest. Jeffery had to deal with "

Ertz had a tough matchup going into this game, as Carolina is excellent against tight ends. That changed with Kuechly out, as Ertz was able to score twice. He caught 2 balls for 18 yards. The other touchdown was caught by Agholor (4-55). "
