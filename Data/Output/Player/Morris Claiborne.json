   "comment":"Claiborne. That set up a short field goal. Dallas answered with DeMarco Murray (14-86 rushing, 3-40 receiving) as he ripped off a few chunk runs including a 30-yarder. A screen to Lance Dunbar set up Romo to throw a rope to Jason Witten (4-37) for a 20-yard touchdown. A ridiculous penalty on Brandon Carr took away a fumble that Dallas recovered, and the Giants took advantage of the break. Brandon Jacobs (9-75) took the ball to the 5-yard line on a 36-yard run, but the Giants had to settle for a field goal. The Cowboys fumbled the ball away during the third quarter, but a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on Mathias Kiwanuka negated the fumble. A few plays later, Romo threw a short touchdown pass to Witten. The Giants quickly answered with a 27-yard touchdown to Brandon Myers (3-39). He made a leaping catch along the sideline and was on the ground. but neither Bruce Carter or Heath tagged him down. Myers got up and ran 10 yards into the end zone. Manning moved the ball down the field as the 4.h quarter wound down. A 22-yard pass to Cruz (2-27) set up the Giants inside the 10. Manning hit Louis Murphy (1-4) in the back corner of the end zone, and Andre Brown ran in the 2.point conversion to tie the game at 21. In crunch time, Romo came through for Dallas. The Cowboys were in a third-and-long situation, but Romo hit Dez Bryant for 18 yards to move the chains. Another completion to Bryant (9-102) moved the ball into Giants territory. Passes to Miles Austin (1-17) and Cole Beasley (2-13) got Dallas in field goal range. One more completion set up a 35-yard field goal for Dan Bailey to knock home the game winner.    Romo finished completing 23-of-38 passes for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.    Manning was 16-of-30 for 174 yards and 2 scores. Andre Brown was very impressive with 127 yards on 21 carries. The Cowboys' defense came up with timely stops. Jason Hatcher had 2 sacks and Barry Church contributed a good game.    Cullen Jenkins led the Giants with 2 sacks. The interior of the Dallas' offensive line had some issues, but that unit did well overall on the edges. Jason Pierre-Paul was held to 1 tackle.    An injury of note is Cowboys cornerback Morris Claiborne hurt his hamstring and missed the second half. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
