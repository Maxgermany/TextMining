Actually, his numbers could have been a lot worse because the Eagles dropped 3 potential picks. Weeden, who played like he was drunker than Derek Anderson, simply doesn't look like an NFL quarterback. Perhaps he'll improve as he ages and matures.    As for the other rookie, "

   "comment":"Weeden attempted a weird throw off his back foot. It was picked off. A couple of plays later, the Giants scored a touchdown and tied the game. If that wasn't bad enough, Joshua Cribbs fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Wasting no time, Eli Manning hit Victor Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7-point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible.

   "comment":"Weeden, who apparently was not too old for their offense. In this game, they opted not to have Joe Haden shadow Reggie Wayne. I don't quite understand what Cleveland was possibly thinking. I know it's not part of the team's scheme, but sometimes you have to adjust. Andrew Luck has only 1 play-maker at his disposal. The Jets, who used Antonio Cromartie to blanket Wayne, completely disrupted Indianapolis' offense as a consequence. The Browns had the opportunity to do so by asking Haden to shadow Wayne. They elected not to do so, and as a result, the Colts compiled 321 total yards of offense, with Wayne leading the team with 6 catches for 73 yards. Luck, meanwhile, went 16-of-29 for 186 yards with 2 rushing touchdowns. He started hot, and then just handed the ball off to Vick Ballard (20-84) and Delone Carter (11-41) with a lead throughout, as Indianapolis went conservative.    The Browns helped the cause by making other dumb mistakes. Ben Watson scored a touchdown, but it was wiped out because of a Joshua Cribbs offensive pass interference. Greg Little (6-52, TD) found the end zone later on the drive, but he double clutched the ball and landed out of bounds. The play was reviewed and was incorrectly ruled a score (at least in my opinion). The killer was that the Browns botched the snap on the ensuing extra point, forcing them to go for a touchdown instead of a game-tying field goal in the fourth quarter. Cleveland committed another egregious error, which was a Josh Gordon (2-59, TD) dropped touchdown in the fourth quarter. It looked like he lost the ball in the sun, as the roof was open because it was an unseasonably warm October day in Indianapolis.    All of the mistakes ruined a very good afternoon for Brandon Weeden, who went 25-of-41 for 264 yards and 2 scores. He should've thrown a third touchdown, but as mentioned, Gordon lost a potential 55-yard score in the sun. Weeden had the luxury of throwing from a clean pocket all afternoon; the Colts couldn't put any pressure on him, as "

Starting with the victor, Flacco opened up 10-of-12 for 110 yards, leading the Ravens to a pair of first-quarter touchdowns to establish a quick, 14-0 advantage. He was then was 4 of his next 11 for just 24 yards. He had several passes that easily could have been picked off.

Weeden finished 20-of-35 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and the fumble. Those stats make it seem like he was competent, but that was hardly the case. He missed some easy passes and nearly threw multiple interceptions, prompting the CBS announcers to repeatedly state that he's just a turnover waiting to happen.

His final numbers don't look too bad - 21-of-35, 244 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but he was just 19-of-31 for 166 yards and the pair of picks once the Redskins went up 31-14 in the second half and put this game out of reach. This had to be extremely discouraging for Cleveland fans. Cousins was taken 3 rounds after Weeden and also happens to be 5 years younger. The Browns could have spent the No. 22 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft on a talented player and then grabbed Cousins in Round 3. Instead, they're stuck with Weeden, who has been terribly inconsistent thus far. Perhaps he'll improve as he gains more experience, but his physical skills will begin to erode by then. It's still mind-boggling that Cleveland used a first-rounder on him.    As for the skill-position players, a pair of former Miami Hurricanes combined for 3 combined touchdowns. "

   "comment":"Weeden entered the game to a chorus of boos. The jeers grew louder with each ugly incompletion. Weeden, who holds the ball way too long, took some unnecessary sacks as well. Weeden started poorly, but got more and more comfortable as the game progressed. He did well to convert multiple third downs in the second quarter to lead his team down the field for a touchdown. Weeden was even better in the second half, going 7-of-12 for 129 yards and a score after the break. He had some throws that made me go yeeesh, but he impressed me at times. His main highlight was a beautiful 37-yard rainbow to "

On a first-and-10 inside Detroit territory, Weeden felt some pressure. He moved around in the pocket and flinged a weird, backhanded throw to the sideline. I suppose he was trying to throw the ball away, but the Lions came away with an easy interception. Detroit converted the turnover into a touchdown, clinching the victory.    Weeden went 26-of-43 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He could've passed for a third score, but he overthrew his target. Weeden's scores went to "

He did the dumbest things ever in this contest. For instance, his interception came off a horrible throw off his back foot. He then tried a moronic throw that rivaled his backhanded attempt from last week when he lobbed up an underhanded pass carelessly under pressure. He's insanely lucky it wasn't picked off. There was another hilarious instance in which Weeden fired the ball as hard as he could to his running back, who was 2 yards in front of him. The pass fell incomplete because the running back wasn't paying attention because he was blocking. As for Mr. Dependable, he caught 4 balls for 49 yards, but dropped his trademark big catch - this time in the end zone. He also ran the wrong route on 1 occasion deep in Green Bay territory.

Weeden sparked the Steelers instead. He lost a fumble because he held the ball carelessly, and then he came back with a pick-6 on an especially dumb throw. He would eventually get a garbage-time touchdown. He finished 13-of-30 for 209 yards, 1 score and the 2 turnovers. Campbell, meanwhile, wasn't terrible, but was an unspectacular 14-of-22 for 124 yards. He also had that aforementioned lost fumble.    As for the team with actual playoff aspirations, "

   "comment":"Weeden was fine in relief, but the disparity between the 2 quarterbacks is immeasurable. For more on how this affects the Cowboys, check out my NFL Disaster Ratings. The injury is a shame, especially since Romo had played well overall prior to getting hurt. Despite missing Dez Bryant, Romo finished 18-of-27 for 195 yards and the lost fumble, but his numbers could've been much better. Romo missed out on a touchdown to Gavin Escobar when the officials screwed up both the call and the replay. Romo then appeared to have Jason Witten for a score, but DeMeco Ryans made a great play to break up the pass. Romo also had a long conversion to Terrance Williams negated by an illegal formation. Williams hurt Romo with a drop as well.    Weeden, as mentioned, performed well in Romo's absence. He completed all 7 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. Cowboy fans shouldn't be overly optimistic, however, as Weeden had the luxury of torching a poor defense, featuring "

   "comment":"Weeden... hahahahaha! Looks like the Weed Man got the last laugh.    Realistically, the winner of this game is probably going to be hosting a playoff game as the victor of the AFC South. The Texans were 0-13 all-time in Indianapolis and picked a perfect time to break that streak. Houston's defense held the Colts to 190 total yards, zero points after halftime and 2 late turnovers to lead the Texans to a win over their biggest rival. It wasn't pretty, as the Texans went down to third-string quarterback Brandon Weeden, but Houston got just enough out of its offense to take control of the AFC South.    The Texans moved the ball on their opening 2 possessions, but the first ended with a "

   "comment":"Weeden and B.J. Daniels seeing action against Tennessee. The Texans hope that Brian Hoyer will return to the field in Week 17.    On the first drive of the game, Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on "
