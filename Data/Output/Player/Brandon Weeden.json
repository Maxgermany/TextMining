A couple of plays later, the Giants scored a touchdown and tied the game. If that wasn't bad enough, Joshua Cribbs fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Wasting no time, Eli Manning hit Victor Cruz for a quick touchdown to take a 7.point lead. The Browns got the ball back but failed to run the clock out. They punted to the Giants, who then were the recipients of a bogus, long pass interference penalty on an uncatchable ball. Lawrence Tynes hit a 40-yard field goal, giving New York a 10-point advantage. In other words, the Browns could have led 24-10 at intermission, but trailed 27-17 instead. Game, set, match.    Pat Shurmur was guilty of terrible play-calling. I mentioned the poor decision not to give Richardson the ball on that 3rd-and-1; well, Shurmur panicked and forgot to give the ball to his best player. Richardson received just TWO carries in the third quarter. It's not like the game was out of hand either; it was a 10- or 14-point lead for the Giants throughout most of the period. In fact, 1 sequence just after intermission at midfield saw the Browns call a double reverse (gain of 2 yards), an ugly incompletion and a checkdown short of the first-down marker. Cleveland consequently had to punt.    Weeden was terrible.

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden, who apparently was not too old for their offense. In this game, they opted not to have Joe Haden shadow Reggie Wayne. I don't quite understand what Cleveland was possibly thinking. I know it's not part of the team's scheme, but sometimes you have to adjust. Andrew Luck has only 1 play-maker at his disposal. The Jets, who used Antonio Cromartie to blanket Wayne, completely disrupted Indianapolis' offense as a consequence. The Browns had the opportunity to do so by asking Haden to shadow Wayne. They elected not to do so, and as a result, the Colts compiled 321 total yards of offense, with Wayne leading the team with 6 catches for 73 yards. Luck, meanwhile, went 16-of-29 for 186 yards with 2 rushing touchdowns. He started hot, and then just handed the ball off to Vick Ballard (20-84) and Delone Carter (11-41) with a lead throughout, as Indianapolis went conservative.    The Browns helped the cause by making other dumb mistakes. Ben Watson scored a touchdown, but it was wiped out because of a Joshua Cribbs offensive pass interference. Greg Little (6-52, TD) found the end zone later on the drive, but he double clutched the ball and landed out of bounds. The play was reviewed and was incorrectly ruled a score (at least in my opinion). The killer was that the Browns botched the snap on the ensuing extra point, forcing them to go for a touchdown instead of a game-tying field goal in the 4.h quarter. Cleveland committed another egregious error, which was a Josh Gordon (2-59, TD) dropped touchdown in the 4.h quarter. It looked like he lost the ball in the sun, as the roof was open because it was an unseasonably warm October day in Indianapolis.    All of the mistakes ruined a very good afternoon for Brandon Weeden, who went 25-of-41 for 264 yards and 2 scores. He should've thrown a third touchdown, but as mentioned, Gordon lost a potential 55-yard score in the sun. Weeden had the luxury of throwing from a clean pocket all afternoon; the Colts couldn't put any pressure on him, as Weeden, who apparently was not too old for their offense.

Weeden finished 20-of-35 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and the fumble. Those stats make it seem like he was competent, but that was hardly the case. He missed some easy passes and nearly threw multiple interceptions, prompting the CBS announcers to repeatedly state that he's just a turnover waiting to happen. He did make some nice throws, but just couldn't get it done when it mattered most. It's worth noting though that his receivers dropped some passes, including "

The Browns could have spent the No. 22 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft on a talented player and then grabbed Cousins in Round 3. Instead, they're stuck with Weeden, who has been terribly inconsistent thus far. Perhaps he'll improve as he gains more experience, but his physical skills will begin to erode by then. It's still mind-boggling that Cleveland used a first-rounder on him.    As for the skill-position players, a pair of former Miami Hurricanes combined for 3 combined touchdowns.

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden and Greg Mr. Dependable Little. Weeden is the worst and should probably be cut. He went 17-of-42 for only 149 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and an interception. He did the dumbest things ever in this contest. For instance, his interception came off a horrible throw off his back foot. He then tried a moronic throw that rivaled his backhanded attempt from last week when he lobbed up an underhanded pass carelessly under pressure. He's insanely lucky it wasn't picked off. There was another hilarious instance in which Weeden fired the ball as hard as he could to his running back, who was 2 yards in front of him. The pass fell incomplete because the running back wasn't paying attention because he was blocking. As for Mr. Dependable, he caught 4 balls for 49 yards, but dropped his trademark big catch - this time in the end zone. He also ran the wrong route on 1 occasion deep in Green Bay territory.

On the contrary, Weeden, despite some shaky attempts following intermission, was solid for most of this contest, but he barely had a chance to do anything in the second half because the Falcons maintained possession for so long.
