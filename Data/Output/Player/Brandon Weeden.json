Actually, his numbers could have been a lot worse because the Eagles dropped 3 potential picks. Weeden, who played like he was drunker than Derek Anderson, simply doesn't look like an NFL quarterback. Perhaps he'll improve as he ages and matures.    As for the other rookie, "

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden, who apparently was not too old for their offense. In this game, they opted not to have Joe Haden shadow Reggie Wayne. I don't quite understand what Cleveland was possibly thinking. I know it's not part of the team's scheme, but sometimes you have to adjust. Andrew Luck has only 1 play-maker at his disposal. The Jets, who used Antonio Cromartie to blanket Wayne, completely disrupted Indianapolis' offense as a consequence. The Browns had the opportunity to do so by asking Haden to shadow Wayne. They elected not to do so, and as a result, the Colts compiled 321 total yards of offense, with Wayne leading the team with 6 catches for 73 yards. Luck, meanwhile, went 16-of-29 for 186 yards with 2 rushing touchdowns. He started hot, and then just handed the ball off to Vick Ballard (20-84) and Delone Carter (11-41) with a lead throughout, as Indianapolis went conservative.    The Browns helped the cause by making other dumb mistakes. Ben Watson scored a touchdown, but it was wiped out because of a Joshua Cribbs offensive pass interference. Greg Little (6-52, TD) found the end zone later on the drive, but he double clutched the ball and landed out of bounds. The play was reviewed and was incorrectly ruled a score (at least in my opinion). The killer was that the Browns botched the snap on the ensuing extra point, forcing them to go for a touchdown instead of a game-tying field goal in the 4.h quarter. Cleveland committed another egregious error, which was a Josh Gordon (2-59, TD) dropped touchdown in the 4.h quarter. It looked like he lost the ball in the sun, as the roof was open because it was an unseasonably warm October day in Indianapolis.    All of the mistakes ruined a very good afternoon for Brandon Weeden, who went 25-of-41 for 264 yards and 2 scores. He should've thrown a third touchdown, but as mentioned, Gordon lost a potential 55-yard score in the sun. Weeden had the luxury of throwing from a clean pocket all afternoon; the Colts couldn't put any pressure on him, as "

Starting with the victor, Flacco opened up 10-of-12 for 110 yards, leading the Ravens to a pair of first-quarter touchdowns to establish a quick, 14-0 advantage. He was then was 4 of his next 11 for just 24 yards. He had several passes that easily could have been picked off.

Weeden finished 20-of-35 for 210 yards, 2 touchdowns and the fumble. Those stats make it seem like he was competent, but that was hardly the case. He missed some easy passes and nearly threw multiple interceptions, prompting the CBS announcers to repeatedly state that he's just a turnover waiting to happen. He did make some nice throws, but just couldn't get it done when it mattered most. It's worth noting though that his receivers dropped some passes, including "

His final numbers don't look too bad - 21-of-35, 244 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions - but he was just 19-of-31 for 166 yards and the pair of picks once the Redskins went up 31-14 in the second half and put this game out of reach. This had to be extremely discouraging for Cleveland fans. Cousins was taken 3 rounds after Weeden and also happens to be 5 years younger. The Browns could have spent the No. 22 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft on a talented player and then grabbed Cousins in Round 3. Instead, they're stuck with Weeden, who has been terribly inconsistent thus far. Perhaps he'll improve as he gains more experience, but his physical skills will begin to erode by then. It's still mind-boggling that Cleveland used a first-rounder on him.    As for the skill-position players, a pair of former Miami Hurricanes combined for 3 combined touchdowns. "

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden entered the game to a chorus of boos. The jeers grew louder with each ugly incompletion. Weeden, who holds the ball way too long, took some unnecessary sacks as well. Weeden started poorly, but got more and more comfortable as the game progressed. He did well to convert multiple third downs in the second quarter to lead his team down the field for a touchdown. Weeden was even better in the second half, going 7-of-12 for 129 yards and a score after the break. He had some throws that made me go yeeesh, but he impressed me at times. His main highlight was a beautiful 37-yard rainbow to "

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden happened. The Lions seemed to get their act together offensively following the break. They led 24-17 in the 4.h quarter, but the Browns had a good drive going. On a first-and-10 inside Detroit territory, Weeden felt some pressure. He moved around in the pocket and flinged a weird, backhanded throw to the sideline. I suppose he was trying to throw the ball away, but the Lions came away with an easy interception. Detroit converted the turnover into a touchdown, clinching the victory.    Weeden went 26-of-43 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He could've passed for a third score, but he overthrew his target. Weeden's scores went to "

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden and Greg Mr. Dependable Little. Weeden is the worst and should probably be cut. He went 17-of-42 for only 149 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and an interception. He did the dumbest things ever in this contest. For instance, his interception came off a horrible throw off his back foot. He then tried a moronic throw that rivaled his backhanded attempt from last week when he lobbed up an underhanded pass carelessly under pressure. He's insanely lucky it wasn't picked off. There was another hilarious instance in which Weeden fired the ball as hard as he could to his running back, who was 2 yards in front of him. The pass fell incomplete because the running back wasn't paying attention because he was blocking. As for Mr. Dependable, he caught 4 balls for 49 yards, but dropped his trademark big catch - this time in the end zone. He also ran the wrong route on 1 occasion deep in Green Bay territory.    The 2 talented Cleveland offensive players are "

One of the announcers, not realizing that Cleveland was screwed, made this strange statement: The Browns need someone to make a play. Maybe Brandon Weeden can provide that spark. Yeah, OK. Weeden sparked the Steelers instead. He lost a fumble because he held the ball carelessly, and then he came back with a pick-six on an especially dumb throw. He would eventually get a garbage-time touchdown. He finished 13-of-30 for 209 yards, 1 score and the 2 turnovers. Campbell, meanwhile, wasn't terrible, but was an unspectacular 14-of-22 for 124 yards. He also had that aforementioned lost fumble.    As for the team with actual playoff aspirations, "

   "comment":"Brandon Weeden following the bye. Weeden has regressed every week and is now playing with zero confidence. When he wasn't settling for checkdowns, he was missing open receivers. Matt Cassel is severely limited, but is at least accurate in the short passing game. Weeden went 26-of-39 for 188 yards and an interception. He nearly had a second pick when he fired a pass right to "

On the first drive of the game, Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on "
