   "comment":"Whittaker wiped out by a Kelvin Benjamin block-in-the-back penalty.    Speaking of Benjamin, he had a brutal game. In addition to that penalty, he didn't manage to catch a single pass. Oddly enough, Newton targeted Benjamin only once. Carolina's leaders in receiving were Greg Olsen (6-64) and Ted Ginn (3-62). Devin Funchess, like Benjamin, didn't log a reception either.    Much was made of the Panthers' running back decision with Jonathan Stewart out. Cameron Artis-Payne had more carries than Fozzy Whittaker, 12-5, with Artis-Payne tallying 47 yards. However, Whittaker was more of a factor in the passing attack, logging 5 receptions for 34 yards. As mentioned, Whittaker scored on a long touchdown, but Benjamin ruined it with a penalty.    The Vikings, meanwhile, weren't doing anything offensively in the first half. They managed just 34 net yards, averaging only 1.6 yards per play. However, they came alive after intermission when they began running a no-huddle offense. The Vikings were suddenly sharp offensively, with "

   "comment":"Whittaker catching touchdowns?    The result of this game may be surprising on the surface, but it's abundantly clear that the Panthers were the better team. They dominated the Patriots for most of the day and solidified themselves as a potential playoff team. On the offensive side of the ball, Cam Newton had 1 of the best performances since his MVP season in 2015. Newton was the leader of the Panthers' offense, and focused on utilizing both his arm strength and mobility to take down the Patriots. Newton went 22-of-29 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. Throughout the contest, Newton was able to find massive gaps in the Patriots' defense thanks to coverage busts and good routes by his receivers. Newton displayed excellent accuracy and field vision, and rarely had a regrettable throw. His only bad plays came on a couple of overthrows. The first was on his interception, where he launched a pass into double coverage. The second came on the game-winning drive, where Newton overshot Devin Funchess, who had to break up the pass to prevent a second pick. Still, for the most part, Newton was sharp and accurate, and had some really nice throws throughout the day. On the ground, Newton's performance was equally as impressive. Ron Rivera called many quarterback runs throughout the day to keep New England's defense off balance. Newton took advantage and was able to total 44 yards on 8 carries. He also notched a touchdown. Newton looked as strong as ever and was able to bounce off defenders and find open space. He needs to continue to do that to succeed.    In the run game, Jonathan Stewart led the way for the Panthers. He saw 14 carries and was able to turn them into 68 yards. Stewart found holes in the defense, and his offensive line did a good job of blocking the Patriots' weak defensive line. Rookie Christian McCaffrey only got 16 yards on 6 carries. He struggled to fight through stronger defenders close to the line of scrimmage, but showed promise in the passing game (4 catches, 33 yards).    Newton's top receiver in this contest was Funchess. The former second-round pick saw a team-high 9 targets and turned them into 7 catches for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns. Funchess displayed much better route-running skills than he has demonstrated in the past and was able to make catches over the Patriots' defensive backs thanks to his size. Funchess is a player who should be added in fantasy, as he will be the team's No. 2 receiver and receive a lot of targets. He could end up being a WR3 if he continues to improve. Kelvin Benjamin (4-104) led Carolina in yardage despite not being on the field for the whole game. He was dealing with an injury, but he should continue to perform well when he is completely healthy. Fozzy Whittaker (3-35) caught Newton's other touchdown on a screen play.    Meanwhile, this is a bad loss for the Patriots. There's no doubt about it. Their defense is a mess, and the offense isn't quite good enough to lead the team to victory. It may not be time to panic yet, but the team needs to do something to improve quickly. "
