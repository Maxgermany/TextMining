Dallas took advantage with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams (4-44-1). Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock. To start the second half, Hyde rumbled for 32 yards, and Gabbert threw a beautiful pass to Celek for 29 yards. The 49ers settled for a short field goal, but that was all the offense they could muster in the final 2 quarters. Dallas got going when Elliott ripped off a 23-yard run. Prescott connected on a couple of passes, and then Elliott plunged into the end zone for the game-winning score. Early in the 4.h quarter, Gabbert threw a poorly placed pass, and it was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Garrett Celek lost a fumble in the red zone. The 49ers had another scoring chance negated at the very end, of course, as Celek lost a fumble in the red zone. The 49ers had another scoring chance negated at the very end, of course, as Colin Kaepernick was tackled short of the goal line of the final play of the game. The 49ers have no talent on offense outside of Carlos Hyde, so this has to be a major concern for Miami. The Dolphins had no answer for Kaepernick, who helped rack up 475 net yards of offense and 25 first downs. Had Miami surrendered 477 net yards instead of 475, this game would've gone to overtime.    Kaepernick finished 29-of-46 for 296 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault; Torrey Smith had the ball pop out of his hands on the opening play of the third quarter. He was welcomed to the field by a chorus of boos, but those quickly transformed to oohs and ahhs, as Kaepernick was able to make some dazzling plays to help the 49ers move the chains consistently. Most of his great plays came on the ground, as Kaepernick accumulated 113 rushing yards on 10 scampers.    Kaepernick's touchdowns went to Hyde, Smith and Celek. However, his leading target, "

   "comment":"Garrett Celek to bring the 49ers within 2.points with just over 5 minutes left in the game. They, of course, fell short, but Kaepernick, despite his many faults as a passer, does make things happen. Maybe he's just a faster Tim Tebow, but I believe he does have a future in the right spot. Where that will be is clear as clay, especially with huge changes in store among the San Francisco brass.    Celek to bring the 49ers within 2.points with just over 5 minutes left in the game.
