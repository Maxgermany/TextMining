   "comment":"Cameron Artis-Payne once the Panthers had a comfortable lead.    Newton continued his steady season on a day when the defense kept handing him good field position. Newton completed 11-of-22 passes for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 51 yards rushing on 12 carries.    For the Buccaneers (1-3), rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had an absolutely dismal day. He was intercepted 4 times and lost a fumble. Winston did put up 287 passing yards and 2 interceptions. But a big chunk of his yardage came after the game was out of hand and the Bucs were throwing on virtually every down.    One of the few bright spots for the Bucs was running back "

   "comment":"Cameron Artis-Payne as their feature back. He responded with 44 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries. But all indications are that Stewart will be ready to return for the first playoff game.    The Panthers don't have many glaring needs, and they won't be drafting until late in the first round during the 2016 NFL Draft. But it's pretty obvious that the Panthers need to add a wide receiver even though Kelvin Benjamin will be coming back from injury. That position could be Carolina's target in the first round of the draft.    Success comes with a price, and you have to wonder if the Panthers will pay for this season. Defensive coordinator Sean McDermott and offensive coordinator Mike Shula could be candidates for head-coaching jobs elsewhere.    For Tampa Bay, the Bucs ended the season by losing their final 4 games. Coach Lovie Smith's job is safe for now. But it's clear Smith will enter next season on the hot seat.    Any chance Tampa Bay running back "
