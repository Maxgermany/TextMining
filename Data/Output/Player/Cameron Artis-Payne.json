   "comment":"Cameron Artis-Payne once the Panthers had a comfortable lead.    Newton continued his steady season on a day when the defense kept handing him good field position. Newton completed 11-of-22 passes for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 51 yards rushing on 12 carries.    For the Buccaneers (1-3), rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had an absolutely dismal day. He was intercepted 4 times and lost a fumble. Winston did put up 287 passing yards and 2 interceptions. But a big chunk of his yardage came after the game was out of hand and the Bucs were throwing on virtually every down.    One of the few bright spots for the Bucs was running back "
