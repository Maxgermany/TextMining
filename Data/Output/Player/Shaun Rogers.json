  "comment":"Shaun Rogers once again dominated the line of scrimmage. Unfortunately, Rogers left the game late. He's now out for the year with a torn Achilles' 10.on.    As you can imagine, the Bengal receivers did nothing. Chad Ochocinco led the group with 3 grabs for 38 yards. J.P. Foschi caught Palmer's lone score.    Outside of 1 drive, ",
