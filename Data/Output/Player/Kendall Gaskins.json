   "comment":"Gaskins stepped in and did most of his work in the passing game, catching 6 balls for 52 yards. He carried twice, but didn't gain anything.    Jim Tomsula's coaching blunders need to be acknowledged. First of all, some of the players didn't appear to be focused. The receivers were guilty of being offside on multiple occasions. I'll repeat - the RECEIVERS, as in offensive players - were flagged for multiple offside penalties. Tomsula also had 1 of the most ridiculous challenges ever. It was so bad that color analyst Solomon Wilcots made fun of him. Tomsula predictably lost, making him now 0-of-6 on replay reviews. At the end of the third quarter, the 49ers scored a touchdown after they trailed 24-0. Simple arithmetic says a team needs 3 8. to tie, hence going for 2 thrice would be the right move. Tomsula, unaware of how math works, ordered his team to kick the extra point. It was yet another derp moment in a derp season by the 49ers. Meanwhile, ownership is already scheming on how to keep Tomsula around for another year because he's a company man. It's amazing how quickly the once-proud 49ers organization has disintegrated into the worst franchise in the NFL.   "
