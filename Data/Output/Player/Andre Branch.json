   "comment":"Andre Branch opened an explosion of points from Jacksonville's offense and special teams. The Jaguars put up 42 points after halftime to blow out the Colts. Jacksonville clearly outplayed Indianapolis, and this Colts team looks undermanned, worn down, and absurdly lucky to be in the playoff race. Early in the season, the Colts got lucky in a home win over the Jaguars, as kicker Jason Myers had 2 missed field goals with 1 in the 4.h quarter and 1 in overtime that allowed Indianapolis to escape with an overtime win. If Myers had made 1 of those field goals, the Colts would be 5-8, and the Jaguars would be in the AFC South title race. Blake Bortles is the most improved quarterback in the NFL this year, and the credit goes to new offensive coordinator Greg Olson. If the Jaguars can improve their offensive line and pass defense this offseason, they could be a serious playoff contender in 2016.    The Jaguars were fortunate on the opening drive, as the Colts dropped 2 interceptions, and 1 went for a chunk completion to tight end Clay Harbor, who caught the pass while on the ground. T.J. Yeldon ran well, and Myers connected on a 46-yard field goal. The Colts answered right back as Matt Hasselbeck threw a ball up for T.Y. Hilton and Nick Marshall mistimed his jump to allow a 57-yard reception to Jacksonville's 11-yard line. The Jaguars held the Colts to a chip-shot field goal. Shortly later, the Jaguars got caught on a blitz, and Hasselbeck quickly hit Zurlon Tipton on the run for a gain of 27 yards. A pass to Hilton went for about 15 to Jacksonville's 10-yard line, but once again Indianapolis settled for a short field goal. Backed up deep in his own territory, a bad shotgun snap hit off the fingers of Bortles and rolled into the end zone. Robert Mathis fell on the ball for a Colts touchdown. It was the second straight week that a bad Steve Wisnewski snap gifted a touchdown for the opposition. Indianapolis got the opportunity for more points when Mike Adams strip-sacked Bortles to set up the Colts at the Jaguars' 35-yard line after the return. But on the next play, Andre Branch stripped Hasselbeck of the ball and scooped it up before returning it 49 yards for a touchdown. Unsurprisingly, Myers missed the extra point, so the Colts had a 13-9 lead at the half. The Jaguars' offense came alive on their first play of the third quarter as Bortles threw a bullet between 2 defenders to "
