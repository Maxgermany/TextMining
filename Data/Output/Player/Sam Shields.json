A completion to Quarless (6-66), a pass-interference penalty and runs from Lacy moved the ball to the goal line. Lacy then dived over the top to grab the lead. The 2.point conversion was incomplete. To end the game, Romo had a pass off the mark and Williams made a diving interception to clinch the victory for Green Bay.    Romo completed 29-of-48 passes for 358 yards for 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Bryant was a beast with 11 catches for 153 yards and a score.    Flynn was 26-of-39 for 299 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He really struggled in the first half, but made some clutch throws in the final 2 quarters.
