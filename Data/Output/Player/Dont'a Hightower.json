New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5. and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain. A few more short throws moved the ball to the Jets' 6-yard line before the drive stalled and ended in another field goal. The Jets finally put together a nice drive after falling dormant in the middle of the game. They methodically moved the ball down the field before Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. Nick Folk added a field goal to make it 20-16 early in the 4.h quarter. That drop proved to be huge. Brady got on the move with a 27-yard pass to Julian Edelman to get the drive started. Gronkowski added receptions of 11 and 12 yards, including giving Marcus Gilchrist for a ride on his back. The Patriots took the lead as Edelman made a tremendous leaping catch over Gilchrist for an 8-yard score. With the Patriots up 23-20, New England quickly got the ball back and a leaping grab by Amendola put the Patriots in New York's territory. The Jets brought the house on a blitz, and that left Gronkowski completely alone in the middle of the field for a 15-yard score. New England's defense allowed a field goal drive, but there were only seconds remaining. Shockingly, Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. A short pass to Decker and then a penalty on Marshall ran out the clock. Unfortunately, the Jets lost center Nick Mangold to scary injury late in the 4.h quarter. It looked a hard hit to the head or neck that could be serious.    Tom Brady completed 34-of-54 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also led the Patriots on the ground with 15 yards on 4 carries. Brady was the MVP as he carried the New England offense.    Dion Lewis was inactive, but the excitement for LeGarrette Blount fantasy owners like myself was turned into a huge disappointment as he totaled minus-3 yards on 3 carries.    Gronkowski led New England through the air with 11 receptions for 108 yards and a score. He really hurt the Jets' defense. It was Gronkowski's 18th career 100-yard game. Danny Amendola (8-86-1) and Julian Edelman (5-54) chipped in some critical receptions. Brandon LaFell (2-25) returned to the field with a terrible performance of 6 dropped passes.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was 22-of-39 for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns. He had some good passes dropped by receivers.    Chris Ivory ran for 41 yards on 17 carries with 2 receptions for 12 yards and a touchdown. He injured a hamstring at the start of the game and didn't look like himself, but gutted it out.    Decker had 6 receptions for 94 yards, and Marshall had 4 catches for 67 yards, but his dropped touchdown was massive.    Defensively, the Jets received nice performances out of Sheldon Richardson, Calvin Pace and Muhammed Wilkerson. New England's defense was led by Rob Ninkovich with 4 passes batted. Jaime Collins had a sack, Chandler Jones had a strip-sack, and Dont'a Hightower totaled 10 tackles and a fumble recovery.   Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line.

The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all 5 of his targets for 98 receiving yards and 2 more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and 4 touchdowns.
