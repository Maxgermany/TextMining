   "comment":"Browns won their first game of the season on Brandon Weeden's birthday. How fitting that they would finally achieve a victory as their young quarterback aged up. Imagine how good they'll be when Weeden matures in 5 years or so. Cleveland will be Super Bowl-bound just as Weeden is at the ripe, young age of 34. OK, OK, Weeden played well, so I won't completely rain on his parade. He went 17-of-29 for 231 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't really his fault because it was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Weeden dissected Cincinnati's struggling secondary that is forced to start has-beens like Terence Newman and players out of position like Nate Clements, who has to be used at safety because Taylor Mays sucks so much.    It's pretty amazing that the Browns won this game without Trent Richardson's services."

These weren't the only mistakes the Steelers made. They had 9 penalties, 1 of which was a ticky-tack hold that negated a 33-yard Heath Miller reception. Meanwhile, Mike Wallace had the ball pop out of his hands and into the arms of a Cleveland player. This was 1 of 3 interceptions that Charlie Batch threw. Batch went 20-of-34 for 199 yards and the 3 picks. He had some very ugly passes, but wasn't as bad as some media members are making him out to be. Had he gotten some help from his teammates, he may have pulled off a victory.    Batch's preferred targets were Emmanuel Sanders (5-75), Heath Miller (6-63) and Rainey (4-15). Wallace caught 1 pass for 9 yards, which was the final play of the game. He was thrown to 8 times.    Plaxico Burress, who was signed this week, didn't catch a pass, but drew a pass-interference flag on Sheldon Brown in the end zone.    It would've been difficult to believe heading into this game, but Pittsburgh's leading rusher (Dwyer) had 19 yards. Mendenhall gained just 6 yards on 4 attempts. The Steelers have to upgrade this position after the season.    As for the victor, "
