Despite Manuel's pedestrian performance, he wasn't the most disappointing Buffalo player in this contest. That was C.J. Spiller, who wasn't able to parlay last week's awesome outing into another big game. He gained just 23 yards on just 8 carries to go along with 3 catches for 11 receiving yards. Fred Jackson, meanwhile, had more than double the rushing yards, tallying 55 yards on 12 attempts.    Manuel's touchdown, which came in garbage time, went to rookie tight end Chris Gragg (4-25). Johnson led the team in receiving yards (3-48).    As for the winning team, Roethlisberger's first-quarter pick to Byrd was a poor overthrow. The Steelers couldn't do anything offensively in the opening period, but they eventually got their act together. Roethlisberger ultimately finished 18-of-30 for 204 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception. He had to attempt only 11 passes following intermission because his team had such a huge lead. Roethlisberger's lone score went to "
