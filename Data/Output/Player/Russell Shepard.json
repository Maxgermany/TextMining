   "comment":"Shepard (5-77). Winston lofted a perfect pass into a small window that allowed Shepard to go up and catch the pass. It was definitely Winston's best throw of the game. The final score went to Evans as well. Winston put the pass up where only his tall receiver could get it. It was a smart play that really helped to solidify the lead for the Buccaneers. If Winston can continue to play like this against major competition, that would be great for Tampa. They definitely need him to play well if they want to have any chance of competing in the future.    In terms of the receivers, Evans and Shepard really led the way for the team. They combined to catch 13 of Winston's 21 completions. It looks like they will be the top guys moving forward. Aside from those 2. tight end "
