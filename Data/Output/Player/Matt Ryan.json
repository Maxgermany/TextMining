   "comment":"Matt Ryan. If William Clay Ford Darth Sidious doesn't fire Millen this week, he never will. Sorry, Lions fans. It looks like you're stuck with Millen until he retires on his own accord.    On that note, someone please shoot me with a tranquilizer the next time I pick the Lions as a favorite. I know it was for only 1 unit, and I said I wouldn't recommend betting on it, but still. What was I thinking?    I wouldn't vote Matt Ryan into the Hall of Fame just yet. Before Falcons fans get excited, remember that a blind, 1.legged old woman could dominate Detroit's secondary. Still, there's nothing to complain about. Ryan's first throw as a 62-yard bomb to "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan. I say this now because last week didn't count. As discussed in the Sunday NFL In-Games Thread, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL could probably beat the Detroit Lions right now. Seeing a top-notch defense for the first time in his career, Ryan began the game 0-of-9 and 2 interceptions. He finished 13-of-33 for 158 yards, those 2 picks and a fumble.    When Ryan actually completed a pass, he went to Roddy White and Laurent Robinson 4 times each. White had 59 yards. Meanwhile, Michael Turner, coming off a 220-yard performance, compiled only 42 yards, as Atlanta's offensive line couldn't open up any running lanes. Left tackle Sam Baker left the game prior to halftime.    Welcome back to the NFL, Brian Griese. Griese, whose arm is an upgrade over Jeff Garcia's, was 18-of-31 for 160 yards and a touchdown versus a pretty soft defense. Griese is known for his mental ineptness, so Buccaneer fans shouldn't get excited because he's bound to make tons of errors when it counts. Jon Gruden, meanwhile, should be excited because Griese's performance means he can kick sworn enemy Jeff Garcia off his roster.    While Griese's numbers weren't spectacular, Earnest Graham's were. Graham gained 116 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Warrick Dunn chipped in with 12 rushes, 49 yards and a score.    Gaines Adams finally emerged as the potent pass-rusher the Buccaneers drafted No. 4 overall last year. Adams breathed down Matt Ryan's neck the entire game, recording 6 tackles and 2 sacks. It didn't help that Baker missed the entire second half.   "

Ryan was 12-of-18 for 192 yards and a score.    So, how pathetic are the Chiefs? Well, we can talk about their errant 32-yard field goal, but let's get some quotes from the forum members: McWatt: Bahahahahaha....it's too bad we can't play the Chiefs 16 times. Eagles4Life: C'mon "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan sucked. Jake Delhomme's kids aren't kidnapped anymore. Let's go over each of those: - <b> Michael Turner injury: </b> Turner left the game in the second quarter with a high ankle sprain. It's a shame because Turner had 111 yards on 9 carries. Jason Snelling got the rest of the work, gaining 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 rushes. - <b> Horrible Falcons play-calling: </b> Early on, Atlanta wasn't running the ball enough. Nine of their first 14 plays were passes - this without left tackle Sam Baker. If Carolina is strong versus the pass and weak against the run, why would you throw non-stop? Mike Mularkey's game plan was full of mularkey. Atlanta also had major problems converting third-and-short situations. Turner was out, but it was more than that; the play-calling was ridiculously predictable. Most of the calls were ineffective runs up the middle with Snelling. - <b> Atlanta can't tackle: </b> Whether it was defending Steve Smith, or trying to tackle DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart, the Falcons whiffed on numerous opportunities to bring down the Panthers. Williams rushed for 92 yards on 19 carries. Stewart managed 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 11 attempts. Smith scored twice, catching 4 balls for 34 yards. Muhsin Muhammad, meanwhile, somehow came up with 6 grabs for 91 yards. - <b> Matt Ryan sucked: </b> Ryan was 22-of-41 for 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He was off on a number of his throws. He tossed a really ugly interception at midfield down 21-19 in the 4.h quarter. He overthrew his receiver by a mile. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan should have played; with the Falcons eliminated from the playoffs after Dallas' Saturday night win, both players should have sat out to heal their injuries. Instead, Smith irresponsibly went with his 2 starters despite the fact that they clearly weren't 100 percent. This, in my opinion, is a fireable offense. I like what Smith has done in Atlanta thus far, but his decision lacked any sort of intelligence, logic or common sense. Ryan, by the way, was just 16-of-34 for 152 yards and a score. He suffered some uncharacteristic dropped balls by "

Part of it, of course, was Chicago's stellar defense. And I'd like to believe that part of it was Jim Cornelison's awesome rendition of the national anthem prior to kickoff. That really fired up the crowd, the players and even me. I was so pumped up that I actually stopped eating Cheetos for a few minutes. At any rate, Ryan went 31-of-47 for 319 yards and a pick, as he was playing in catch-up mode the whole game. Ryan was constantly harassed by Chicago's front - he was sacked 5 times and hit many times more - but because he threw the ball so much, he was able to hit 4 different targets 5 times: "

With all the focus on the 2 signal-callers, both QBDK and Ryan had took turns trying to prove who was worse for the first 3 quarters. For every QBDK fumble, there was a Ryan interception. However, QBDK took a hit on the head falling into right tackle "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan was sacked and fumbled the ball from a hit by blitzing linebacker Dekoda Watson. Cornerback Ronde Barber covered the fumble for Tampa Bay and set the Bucs up at the Atlanta 17-yard line. Josh Freeman gave it right back a few plays later as threw a terrible pass to tight end Kellen Winslow that was intercepted safety Thomas DeCoud in the back of the end zone. Freeman was off for most of the first half. A 16-yard pass to Mike Williams and some quality runs by LeGarrette Blount got Tampa Bay on the board first with a field goal. Freeman got into more of a groove late in the second quarter to lead a 14-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. He connected on a few passes to rookie tight end Luke Stocker and Williams. Freeman dived into the end zone from a yard out to give Tampa Bay 10-3 lead. A turnover set Tampa Bay up for 3 more points just before halftime and a lead of 16-3. To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off the hands of wide receiver Arrelious Benn and into the hands of safety William Moore, who returned the interception to midfield. Freeman finished the game 22-of-32 for 180 yards and 2 interceptions. Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.    The Falcon defensive line got some pressure on Freeman but never sacked him. Defensive end Ray Edwards was held in check by Bucs right tackle Jeremy Trueblood. Left tackle Donald Penn was called for a holding on John Abraham, but otherwise, he limited Abraham to 1 hit on Freeman. Atlanta's defensive line did not defend the run that well either.    Matt Ryan answered the first 3 points from the Bucs with a field goal on an 84-yard drive midway through the first half. Ryan moved the ball by throwing the ball up and letting his receivers make some plays. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control. Up against it, Matt Ryan (29-of-52 351 yards 2 TD 1 INT) came out firing from the shotgun, connecting with Gonzalez (6 receptions for 71 yards) to start the drive picking up 18 yards and to finish it with a 20-yard score. New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6.point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line. Forced to third down, "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan had the matchup of a lifetime against the Raiders. Everyone has been throwing successfully on an Oakland defense missing its starting cornerbacks. There was no way Ryan wasn't going to pass for at least 300 yards and 4 touchdowns. Well, I guess that's why Chris Berman invented the saying, That's why they play the games. Ryan, who had just 3 interceptions entering this contest, tossed 3 picks in the first half alone. Though the first 2 were his fault - he was hit as he heaved the third 1 - pass protection was the main culprit. The Raiders, who have struggled getting to the quarterback all season, somehow put good pressure on Ryan. It really looked like the Falcons were going to lose. Ryan couldn't really get anything going for the most part (24-of-37, 249 yards, TD, 3 INTs), especially in the red zone where his team squandered several opportunities. The Raiders, who were gashing the Falcons on the ground all afternoon, decided to throw the ball for some strange reason inside the Atlanta 30-yard line with only a few minutes remaining. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan, who has been extremely turnover-prone of late, was razor-sharp, letting the ball hit the ground just 9 times as he completed 30-of-39 passes for 292 yards. He nearly had a touchdown, but 1 of his receivers was tackled inches short of the end zone on the opening drive. Ryan spent most of the night targeting beleaguered cornerback Corey White, who was starting in place of the injured Jabari Greer. Though he had a great game, he had 2 interceptions dropped and took some heat for sliding down 4 yards short of the end zone on third-and-goal. The crowd booed him, as it thought he had a chance to score. Ryan probably wouldn't have found the end zone, but a greater effort could've set up a 4.h-and-goal situation inside the 2-yard line, so that negated a possible touchdown. Ryan was also betrayed by his offensive line (5 sacks allowed) as well as 1 of his young receivers. He constantly threw to SMU rookie Darius Johnson, who caught 6 balls for 67 yards. Johnson had a brilliant first half, but dropped a big third-down pass in the third quarter that would've moved the chains and then lost a fumble inside the red zone during the early stages of the final period.    Ryan's usual suspects didn't do much. In fact, Tony Gonzalez didn't catch his first pass until around the 2-minute warning at the end of the opening half. Gonzalez finished with 4 grabs for 43 yards, while Roddy White was an even greater disappointment (2-24). Harry Douglas paced the team with 9 catches for 79 yards.    The Falcons had a ton of success running the ball early in the game. Steven Jackson rushed for 37 yards and a touchdown on just 9 carries in the opening half, but had a meager 7-26 line following intermission.    As for Drew Brees, he had 1 more misfire than Ryan, going 23-of-33 for 278 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Despite the completion percentage, Brees was unusually inaccurate, missing some throws he would usually hit. He also had a dropped interception in the end zone. Brees was hurt a bit by injuries, as Darren Sproles and Pro Bowl guard Jahri Evans were both of the lineup. Brees' scores went to Ben Watson and Jimmy Graham (5-100), who beat a safety on a double move. Upon reaching the end zone, Graham dunked the ball so hard that he made the uprights crooked in the process. There was 3-minute delay because someone had to straighten it out with a huge level. It was funny, but the officials probably should've flagged Graham with a delay-of-game penalty.    Pierre Thomas had a huge outing in the wake of Sproles' absence. He rushed for 73 yards on just 10 carries to go along with 5 catches for 57 receiving yards. His best play was an 18-yard burst on a second-and-17 in which he held off a defender with an extremely impressive stiff-arm.    On the flip side, Marques Colston struggled again. He had an underwhelming stat line - 4 catches, 40 yards - and he also disappointed his team with a drop deep in Atlanta territory.    I picked Saints' defensive end Cameron Jordan to reach the Pro Bowl - click here for my - and he definitely did not disappoint, recording 2.5 sacks. Akiem Hicks chipped in with 1.5 sacks. Speaking of the Saints' defensive line, there was a hit on Matt Ryan in the second quarter that resembled the controversial penalty that Brees took last week against the 49ers. This 1 was worse and it actually deserved a flag, as Ryan was hit in the helmet. Interestingly enough, no flag was thrown. What is it with the Saints and always benefiting from these sorts of hits?

   "comment":"Matt Ryan and Julio Jones versus Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half. Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan was able to engineer some very long drives in the second half, thanks to 8-of-9 third-down conversions versus a Dallas defense that actually played somewhat well in the opening 2 quarters. Ryan was very precise, dissecting Dallas' defense with ease. He finished 24-of-36 for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns, and his second-half numbers were particularly impressive. He misfired on just 4 occasions, going 13-of-17 for 153 yards following the break. Ryan was nearly intercepted twice early in the first half, but he was lucky that the Dallas defensive players dropped the ball twice.    Ryan, of course, couldn't do this all by himself, and he had the luxury of throwing the ball to the best receiver in the NFL right now. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan said. When you go on the road and get it done that's rewarding. It's rewarding enough that the Falcons are 6-1 and very much in the race for the NFC South championship. So what if the Falcons only won by 3 points against a Tennessee team that fell to 1-5? The important thing is that the Falcons took care of business and got the victory.    Ryan didn't have his best day. He completed 22-of-38 passes for 251 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. But Ryan's performance still was good enough to produce a win.    One of the best stories - fantasy or reality - continues to be Atlanta running back "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan touchdown pass to Julio Jones with 16 seconds remaining in regulation sent the game to overtime. From there, Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Jameis Winston calmly set up a drive that ended in a 31-yard field goal by Connor Barth. Tampa Bay's defense took care of the rest, shutting down an Atlanta drive in overtime.    Smith has a reputation for being conservative. That's why a decision he made late in regulation was so surprising. Faced with a 4.h-and-1 in his own territory, Smith elected to go for the first down. It didn't work as Doug Martin was stuffed, giving Atlanta the ball at Tampa Bay's 41-yard line with 1:52 remaining. If the Bucs ended up losing, that call would have been questioned endlessly. Instead, we'll give Smith a pass and credit for showing some guts.    Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has taken some recent criticism from fans for not coming up with big plays, but he made 1 against the Falcons. On the final play of overtime, McCoy got to Matt Ryan and tied the quarterback's legs up, forcing an incompletion.    Tampa Bay's defense had a huge outing, forcing 4 turnovers that were converted into 20 points. Rookie middle linebacker "

It was a combination of factors that did the Falcons in, beginning with Matt Ryan. Atlanta's signal-caller was guilty of 3 interceptions himself. The first wasn't really his fault, as it was a tipped pass that appeared to hit the ground. Mike Carey said that it should've been ruled incomplete. Ryan's third pick was on a Hail Mary attempt that was actually snatched by Coby Fleener. The middle interception was the horrible 1. as the Falcons were backed up on their own 1-yard line.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan and the Falcons have been so bad in the red zone for 3 years now. I don't get how they can be so efficient in between the 20s, yet come up short when it matters most.    This game had absolutely no playoff implications for either team. But you couldn't tell that by watching what transpired. This turned out to be a typical game in a matchup of the NFC South's 2 biggest rivals. Both teams were sharp throughout. But the Saints, who could have been ending an era, came out on top. New Orleans safety Jamarca Sanford came up with an interception of a Matt Ryan pass with just under 2 minutes left in the game. That cleared the way for a game-winning field goal by "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, as the latter set a franchise record for receiving yards in a game while the former totaled nearly 2 games of production versus Carolina. The Panthers' offseason decisions to let Josh Norman leave and not improve their offensive tackles came back to bite them against Atlanta. They had no defensive back who could contain Jones, while offensive tackle Mike Remmers was a crushing liability. These predictable weaknesses have put Carolina in a huge hole after a quarter of this season.    Immediately in the first quarter, the Falcons got moving with 3 completions to Julio Jones for 50 yards. Atlanta finished the drive with Ryan rolling out to hit Jacob Tamme (2-3) for a short touchdown. Starting at their own 2.yard line, the Falcons continued to move the ball with a 44-yard pass to Jones. Devonta Freeman (13-57-1) then rumbled for a 12-yard run before gashing the Panthers up the middle on a 13-yard touchdown run. Atlanta center Alex Mack hit a great block on Luke Kuechly to spring Freeman. After a Carolina punt was downed just outside of the end zone, Thomas Davis then made a superb play to deflect a pass from Ryan that was picked off by Kurt Coleman, who coasted into the end zone to get the Panthers back into the game. The Falcons and Panthers traded field goal drives before the half, but Carolina was lucky to be in the game as Atlanta dominated with the pick-six being the only thing that kept the Panthers close at 17-10. By the half, Jones had 7 receptions for 170 yards. The Falcons expanded their lead after halfrime as the Panthers had busted coverage where they completely forgot to cover Austin Hooper (1-42-1). That 42-yard touchdown pass gave Atlanta a 24-10 lead. Another long pass to Jones set up Ryan to loft in a beautiful 35-yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson (2-48-1). In the 4.h quarter, Atlanta added a 53-yard field goal from Matt Bryant. Down by 24, Carolina got its first offensive touchdown of the game with a 6.yard strike to Kelvin Benjamin. Newton ran in the 2.point conversion, but took a massive hit from Deion Jones. That hit sent Newton into the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Prior to leaving the game, "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan needed to make a safer throw because an interception can now be turned into a pick-two. I actually just wanted to write pick-two.    Right off of the bat, this game had the making of a barn burner. The 2 teams scored on 5 of the first 6 total possessions and neither defense was getting much done. As the contest progressed though, the Chiefs got better on defense, and they were ultimately able to limit Atlanta's offense. The Falcons, however, still had a chance to win, but a crucial mistake cost them a victory. After a touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson, the Falcons lined up to go for 2 points. It was a sensible decision, as they were leading by a score of 28-27 at the time. On the play, Matt Ryan made a horrible error. He tossed a pass to his well-covered Atlanta tight end, and "

They involved moving the chains and keeping the Packers off the field, chewing up enough clock for Atlanta to hold on to a giant lead for a change. Why the Packers never attempted an onside kick is beyond me. The Atlanta defense, meanwhile, did a tremendous job, although the stats don't show it. Rodgers finished 33-of-50 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 10-of-18 for 85 yards and a pick in the first half. The Falcons changed their defensive philosophy when they were way ahead, playing way off Green Bay's receivers. This allowed the Packers to accumulate tons of garbage yardage, but it also took a ton of time as well. Helping the Falcons' defense's cause was the play that occurred right before halftime.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan may have gotten to that milestone in garbage time had he been given 1 more drive. Still, even if he were successful in that regard, there was a marked improvement from the New England secondary, which blew countless coverages against the Jets last week. Ryan finished 23-of-33 for 233 yards and a touchdown. He didn't play poorly, but the Patriots were able to easily diagnose whatever Atlanta happened to be doing. It's clear that the Falcons are missing Kyle Shanahan, and his replacement, Steve Sarkisian, might be the worst offensive coordinator in the NFL. His play-calling was so predictable that I felt like Tony Romo watching the game. And on the rare occasions when Sarkisian did something unexpected, it was often stupid, such as a failed sweep with Tayor Gabriel at the goal line to ruin a scoring opportunity. It's fair to wonder if the Falcons should just consider Sarkisian a sunk cost and fire him right away. The Falcons are now just 3-3, so there's still time to save their season. Otherwise, Atlanta will continue to struggle offensively.    "
