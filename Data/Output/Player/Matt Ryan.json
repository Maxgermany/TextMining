   "comment":"Matt Ryan. I say this now because last week didn't count. As discussed in the Sunday NFL In-Games Thread, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL could probably beat the Detroit Lions right now. Seeing a top-notch defense for the first time in his career, Ryan began the game 0-of-9 and 2 interceptions. He finished 13-of-33 for 158 yards, those 2 picks and a fumble.    When Ryan actually completed a pass, he went to Roddy White and Laurent Robinson 4 times each. White had 59 yards. Meanwhile, Michael Turner, coming off a 220-yard performance, compiled only 42 yards, as Atlanta's offensive line couldn't open up any running lanes. Left tackle Sam Baker left the game prior to halftime.    Welcome back to the NFL, Brian Griese. Griese, whose arm is an upgrade over Jeff Garcia's, was 18-of-31 for 160 yards and a touchdown versus a pretty soft defense. Griese is known for his mental ineptness, so Buccaneer fans shouldn't get excited because he's bound to make tons of errors when it counts. Jon Gruden, meanwhile, should be excited because Griese's performance means he can kick sworn enemy Jeff Garcia off his roster.    While Griese's numbers weren't spectacular, Earnest Graham's were. Graham gained 116 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Warrick Dunn chipped in with 12 rushes, 49 yards and a score.    Gaines Adams finally emerged as the potent pass-rusher the Buccaneers drafted No. 4 overall last year. Adams breathed down Matt Ryan's neck the entire game, recording 6 tackles and 2 sacks. It didn't help that Baker missed the entire second half.   Ryan. I say this now because last week didn't count.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan sucked. Jake Delhomme's kids aren't kidnapped anymore. Let's go over each of those: - <b> Michael Turner injury: </b> Turner left the game in the second quarter with a high ankle sprain. It's a shame because Turner had 111 yards on 9 carries. Jason Snelling got the rest of the work, gaining 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 rushes. - <b> Horrible Falcons play-calling: </b> Early on, Atlanta wasn't running the ball enough. Nine of their first 14 plays were passes - this without left tackle Sam Baker. If Carolina is strong versus the pass and weak against the run, why would you throw non-stop? Mike Mularkey's game plan was full of mularkey. Atlanta also had major problems converting third-and-short situations. Turner was out, but it was more than that; the play-calling was ridiculously predictable. Most of the calls were ineffective runs up the middle with Snelling. - <b> Atlanta can't tackle: </b> Whether it was defending Steve Smith, or trying to tackle DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart, the Falcons whiffed on numerous opportunities to bring down the Panthers. Williams rushed for 92 yards on 19 carries. Stewart managed 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 11 attempts. Smith scored twice, catching 4 balls for 34 yards. Muhsin Muhammad, meanwhile, somehow came up with 6 grabs for 91 yards. - <b> Matt Ryan sucked: </b> Ryan was 22-of-41 for 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He was off on a number of his throws. He tossed a really ugly interception at midfield down 21-19 in the 4.h quarter. He overthrew his receiver by a mile. "

Redman was solid on Atlanta's last possession, and his numbers look good on the stat sheet (23-of-41, 243 yards, 2 TDs). However, Redman took far too many sacks (6), which stalled a lot of drives and allowed the Buccaneers to hang around. Redman played relatively well, but there's no way the Falcons will be able to beat the Eagles or Saints without Ryan under center.    Ryan's toe wasn't the only major injury for Atlanta. "

Cornerback Ronde Barber covered the fumble for Tampa Bay and set the Bucs up at the Atlanta 17-yard line.

Freeman was off for most of the first half. A 16-yard pass to Mike Williams and some quality runs by LeGarrette Blount got Tampa Bay on the board first with a field goal. Freeman got into more of a groove late in the second quarter to lead a 14-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. He connected on a few passes to rookie tight end Luke Stocker and Williams. Freeman dived into the end zone from a yard out to give Tampa Bay 10-3 lead. A turnover set Tampa Bay up for 3 more points just before halftime and a lead of 16-3. To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off the hands of wide receiver Arrelious Benn and into the hands of safety William Moore, who returned the interception to midfield. Freeman finished the game 22-of-32 for 180 yards and 2 interceptions. Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.    The Falcon defensive line got some pressure on Freeman but never sacked him. Defensive end Ray Edwards was held in check by Bucs right tackle Jeremy Trueblood. Left tackle Donald Penn was called for a holding on John Abraham, but otherwise, he limited Abraham to 1 hit on Freeman. Atlanta's defensive line did not defend the run that well either.    Matt Ryan answered the first 3 points from the Bucs with a field goal on an 84-yard drive midway through the first half.

A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference."

On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control.

New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6.point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan to Tony Gonzalez.Ryan to Tony Gonzalez. The Falcon defense was really playing well in the first half and forced a series of punts. Atlanta had a 13-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, a miraculous catch along the sideline by Roddy White led to a touchdown run by Michael Turner. White kept up the heat on the Titans' defense with a 32-yard wide receiver screen that led to another Matt Bryant field goal. In the third quarter, Matt Hasselbeck left the game with a sprained right elbow. Rookie quarterback Jake Locker came in the game with his team down 23-3. He quickly got the Titans in the end zone. Locker threw a deep out to Nate Washington about 20 yards downfield on the sideline. He cut back to the middle of the field and ran by a couple defenders for a 40-yard touchdown pass. In the 4.h quarter, rookie linebacker Colin McCarthy forced a fumble from Turner when Tennessee was backed up deep in their own territory. That helped keep the Titans in the game. Locker made a big play downfield after scrambling to buy time. He tossed a ball deep for Lavelle Hawkins and the 5-foot-11 wide out caught the pass over a defensive back for a 32-yard gain. It set up Tennessee at the Atlanta 4.yard line with 4 minutes left and down by 13. Locker made a good throw on third-and-goal to Washington for his second touchdown pass. Locker finished the game 9-of-19 for 140 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons' offense ran out the clock with some tough runs by Turner. Atlanta's offense played a balanced game. Turner ran for 100 yards on 21 carries with a score. Ryan was 22-of-32 for 316 yards and 1 touchdown. White led Atlanta with 7 receptions for 147 yards. It could have been an even bigger game but he dropped a couple of passes. The Falcons' defense really played well. Conversely, the Titans' offensive line played like crap. They weren't winning at the point of attack, and had only 41 yards rushing in the game. They looked very predictable for the Atlanta defense. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan had the matchup of a lifetime against the Raiders. Everyone has been throwing successfully on an Oakland defense missing its starting cornerbacks. There was no way Ryan wasn't going to pass for at least 300 yards and 4 touchdowns. Well, I guess that's why Chris Berman invented the saying, That's why they play the games. Ryan, who had just 3 interceptions entering this contest, tossed 3 picks in the first half alone. Though the first 2 were his fault - he was hit as he heaved the third 1 - pass protection was the main culprit. The Raiders, who have struggled getting to the quarterback all season, somehow put good pressure on Ryan. It really looked like the Falcons were going to lose. Ryan couldn't really get anything going for the most part (24-of-37, 249 yards, TD, 3 INTs), especially in the red zone where his team squandered several opportunities. The Raiders, who were gashing the Falcons on the ground all afternoon, decided to throw the ball for some strange reason inside the Atlanta 30-yard line with only a few minutes remaining. "

He was 12-of-13 for 157 yards and a trio of scores on those drives. The Eagle corners were no match for him, as Julio Jones torched Nnamdi Asomugha. Based on this, you have to believe that Asante Samuel received some sort of vindication after being traded for a mid-round draft pick this offseason.    Ryan finished 22-of-29 for 262 yards and the 3 touchdowns. Those numbers don't indicate all of the defensive penalties the Eagles committed, and it's also worth noting that he had just 65 passing yards in the second half because his team was so far ahead. Ryan was a machine on third down, converting 7-of-13 attempts. Though he was sacked twice, he had a clean pocket most of the afternoon. The Eagles just had no chance, especially with their poor tackling.    Ryan's scores went to Jones (5-123), "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan threw the ball 38 times. He completed 25 passes for 304 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Ryan's an excellent quarterback, but the constant passing was a bad idea because the Saints did a great job of applying pressure on him. New Orleans recorded 3 sacks, but the number could've been much higher if Ryan wasn't capable of releasing the ball so quickly. Ryan took a shot to the ribs early on and appeared to be hurt.    Ryan's scores went to Ryan's new unit surrendered just 7 points in the final 3 frames and had an awesome goal-line stand to secure a victory. This was especially impressive because the Saints lost several defenders in this contest, including nose tackle Brodrick Bunkley and starting cornerback Keenan Lewis. Of course, Drew Brees had a big say in this victory. He went 26-of-35 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, absolutely torching a secondary featuring 2 rookie cornerbacks. Asante Samuel was out, so Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford were tasked with stopping New Orleans' aerial attack. Yeah, that wasn't happening.    Brees' scores went to the usual suspects: Marques Colston (5-68) and Jimmy Graham (4-45). Rookie wideout Kenny Stills caught a 67-yard bomb, but he had just 2 receptions on the afternoon. Darren Sproles (6-88) led the team in receiving yardage.    Sean Payton told the media that he wants to run the ball more often this season. He kept his word, as Pierre Thomas (9-43), Sproles (8-22) and Mark Ingram (9-11) combined for 26 carries. It's always good to be balanced, but Payton may have run the ball a little too much early on. The Saints failed on a 4.h-and-inches try in the first half because Ingram was stuffed in the backfield. With Brees matched up versus 2 rookie corners, the Saints should have exploited that advantage.    The Falcons, meanwhile, didn't run the ball enough. Steven Jackson had just 11 carries for 77 yards, including a 50-yard scamper. Atlanta never trailed by more than 6 points, so I'm not sure why the team abandoned its rushing attack, especially since Jackson was such a prized offseason acquisition. It's worth noting though that Jackson dropped 2 passes, including a key 1 on the team's final drive.    Matt Ryan threw the ball 38 times. He completed 25 passes for 304 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Ryan's an excellent quarterback, but the constant passing was a bad idea because the Saints did a great job of applying pressure on him. New Orleans recorded 3 sacks, but the number could've been much higher if Ryan wasn't capable of releasing the ball so quickly. Ryan took a shot to the ribs early on and appeared to be hurt.    Ryan's scores went to "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan didn't have Sam Baker at his disposal. Roddy White once again was ineffective (2-16). Despite this, Matt Ryan was solid, going 23-of-38 for 231 yards, 2 touchdowns and a late interception in desperation time. Ryan's scores went to Snelling and rookie tight end Levine Toiolo. That had to anger Ryan Tannehill simply came through in the clutch. He was 8-of-11 for 67 yards on the final possession, capping it off with a 1-yard score to rookie tight end Dion Sims. Tannehill had some accuracy issues at times throughout the afternoon - his overall numbers were 24-of-35 for 236 yards, 2 touchdowns, a lost fumble and an ugly interception thrown off his back foot - but he was sharp when it mattered most. The Falcons helped Miami clinch an improbable victory with mistakes. Harry Douglas fumbled a punt return deep in Dolphins' territory, which led to a game-tying touchdown in the third quarter. A missed, chip-shot field goal by Matt Bryant also took 3 points off the board. Worst of all, Mike Smith had issues with clock management. The Dolphins were bleeding the clock while driving for their decisive touchdown. Smith used only 1 of his timeouts. As a consequence, the Falcons missed out on 1:20 to try to win the game. They went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. That's inexcusable.    These mental lapses ruined a great effort by Atlanta's rushing attack. Jacquizz Rodgers (18-86) and Jason Snelling (11 carries, 53 rush yards; 4 catches, 58 rec. yards, 1 TD) both ran extremely well. A major reason for this was that 3 Miami front-seven players were knocked out of the lineup. Cameron Wake, Philip Wheeler and Koa Misi all suffered injuries. It should be noted though that rookie Dion Jordan did a great job of setting the edge to stuff the Falcons in the red zone. He didn't register a sack, however.    Matt Ryan didn't have Sam Baker at his disposal. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan, who has been extremely turnover-prone of late, was razor-sharp, letting the ball hit the ground just 9 times as he completed 30-of-39 passes for 292 yards. He nearly had a touchdown, but 1 of his receivers was tackled inches short of the end zone on the opening drive. Ryan spent most of the night targeting beleaguered cornerback Corey White, who was starting in place of the injured Jabari Greer. Though he had a great game, he had 2 interceptions dropped and took some heat for sliding down 4 yards short of the end zone on third-and-goal. The crowd booed him, as it thought he had a chance to score. Ryan probably wouldn't have found the end zone, but a greater effort could've set up a 4.h-and-goal situation inside the 2-yard line, so that negated a possible touchdown. Ryan was also betrayed by his offensive line (5 sacks allowed) as well as 1 of his young receivers. He constantly threw to SMU rookie Darius Johnson, who caught 6 balls for 67 yards. Johnson had a brilliant first half, but dropped a big third-down pass in the third quarter that would've moved the chains and then lost a fumble inside the red zone during the early stages of the final period.    Ryan's usual suspects didn't do much. In fact, Tony Gonzalez didn't catch his first pass until around the 2-minute warning at the end of the opening half. Gonzalez finished with 4 grabs for 43 yards, while Roddy White was an even greater disappointment (2-24). Harry Douglas paced the team with 9 catches for 79 yards.    The Falcons had a ton of success running the ball early in the game. Steven Jackson rushed for 37 yards and a touchdown on just 9 carries in the opening half, but had a meager 7-26 line following intermission.    As for Drew Brees, he had 1 more misfire than Ryan, going 23-of-33 for 278 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Despite the completion percentage, Brees was unusually inaccurate, missing some throws he would usually hit. He also had a dropped interception in the end zone. Brees was hurt a bit by injuries, as Darren Sproles and Pro Bowl guard Jahri Evans were both of the lineup. Brees' scores went to Ben Watson and Jimmy Graham (5-100), who beat a safety on a double move. Upon reaching the end zone, Graham dunked the ball so hard that he made the uprights crooked in the process. There was 3-minute delay because someone had to straighten it out with a huge level. It was funny, but the officials probably should've flagged Graham with a delay-of-game penalty.    Pierre Thomas had a huge outing in the wake of Sproles' absence. He rushed for 73 yards on just 10 carries to go along with 5 catches for 57 receiving yards. His best play was an 18-yard burst on a second-and-17 in which he held off a defender with an extremely impressive stiff-arm.    On the flip side, Marques Colston struggled again. He had an underwhelming stat line - 4 catches, 40 yards - and he also disappointed his team with a drop deep in Atlanta territory.    I picked Saints' defensive end Cameron Jordan to reach the Pro Bowl - click here for my - and he definitely did not disappoint, recording 2.5 sacks. Akiem Hicks chipped in with 1.5 sacks. Speaking of the Saints' defensive line, there was a hit on Matt Ryan in the second quarter that resembled the controversial penalty that Brees took last week against the 49ers. This 1 was worse and it actually deserved a flag, as Ryan was hit in the helmet. Interestingly enough, no flag was thrown. What is it with the Saints and always benefiting from these sorts of hits?

That was certainly the case early on. It appeared as though Flynn would ruin yet another potential victory with some awful mistakes. He was strip-sacked in the first half when Eddie Lacy missed a blitz pick-up, which ultimately led to a Tony Gonzalez touchdown. Flynn was then pick-sixed by Sean Weatherspoon, who missed some action with a shoulder injury. The interception was a weird 1. as it bounced off linebacker Paul Worrilow's foot. Ryan, meanwhile, misfired on just 4 passes in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 85 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons were up 21-10 and appeared as though they'd cruise to victory, effectively eliminating Green Bay from playoff contention. Mike McCarthy and his coaching staff made some awesome adjustments at halftime, however, which is something I never thought I'd write. Flynn was simply unbelievable in the second half, going 10-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown. Of course, much of this can be attributed to the ineptitude of the Atlanta defense, but the important thing is that Flynn bought his team another week for Aaron Rodgers to return. With the Lions losing, Green Bay is just half a game out of the division lead. Rodgers could return next week, which would give the team a great chance to claim the NFC North.    Flynn ultimately finished 24-of-32 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. His score went to tight end "

Another Atlanta drive led to a tie score after Matt Bryant drilled a 54-yard field goal. After blowing a game at Carolina a week ago in the 4.h quarter, the Bears showed some heart by turning the momentum in their direction after Atlanta came out strong following halftime. Cutler and his offense were continuing their trend of struggling in the second half until a 74-yard bomb to Alshon Jeffery (5-136) turned everything around. On the next play, Matt Forte squirted into the end zone from 6 yards out. Falcons' defensive tackle Ra'Shede Hageman blocked the extra point. Cutler kept moving the ball and threw a short touchdown pass to Jeffery, but the big wideout stepped out of bounds before the reception. Forte finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown run up the middle. Cutler threw a fastball to Martellus Bennett (4-52) for the 2.point conversion. To close out the game, the Falcons had 2 possessions to do something. The first 1 ended when Jared Allen and Willie Young combined for a sack.

Jones, who was very questionable entering this contest, looked good in pre-game warmups. That transitioned to the field, as he opened things up for a 23-yard reception right away, leaping over solid corner Keenan Lewis. Jones finished with a team-high 7 catches for 107 yards. He wasn't on the field for every snap, but the Falcons will likely have him at full strength for the Carolina contest. As for Ryan, the Falcon signal-caller went 30-of-40 for 322 yards and a touchdown. He was highly efficient, helping his offense convert nearly half of their first downs (7-of-15) and average 6.4 yards per play, which is an excellent figure. The Saints couldn't get any pressure on him; he wasn't sacked on a single occasion.    The rest of Ryan's receiving corps posted meager numbers. "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan was not prepared for this, as he had a terrible performance in a failed attempt to compete in what was anticipated to be a high-scoring affair. Ryan finished 29-of-47 for 260 yards and 2 interceptions, both of which were taken back for touchdowns. The first was an overthrow, while the second was a telegraphed pass. Ryan also had a third pick-six nullified by a defensive penalty. It wasn't all Ryan's fault though, as his offensive line really let him down. Also, "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan and Julio Jones versus Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half. Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and Ryan and Julio Jones versus Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan had an efficient day. Ryan completed 19-of-27 passes for 256 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions on a day when the Falcons didn't really need to throw the ball.    Atlanta wide receiver Ryan Mallett, he sucks. Here's an idea: Why don't the Texans start a random quarterback - it doesn't matter which 1 - and immediately pull him after 1 drive? That would totally work, right? </i>    Finally, someone found a way to slow down Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. The Texans threw all sorts of coverage at Jones and held him to 4 catches for 38 yards. It didn't matter. The 4-0 Falcons still hammered the Texans with running back Devonta Freeman, showing last week's effort wasn't a flash in the pan. For the second straight week, Freeman scored 3 rushing touchdowns. Freeman became the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score 3 rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. He also became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to have 7 rushing touchdowns in the first 4 games of a season. Freeman has made himself into a must-start in any fantasy league. He finished with 68 yards on 14 carries and also caught 5 passes for 81 yards. Freeman's numbers could have been even higher, but the Falcons replaced him with Terron Ward (19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown) once the game got out of hand.    Even with Jones being held quiet, quarterback Matt Ryan had an efficient day. Ryan completed 19-of-27 passes for 256 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions on a day when the Falcons didn't really need to throw the ball.    Atlanta wide receiver "

After that, Tevin Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a 4.h turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns.

From there, Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Jameis Winston calmly set up a drive that ended in a 31-yard field goal by Connor Barth. Tampa Bay's defense took care of the rest, shutting down an Atlanta drive in overtime.    Smith has a reputation for being conservative. That's why a decision he made late in regulation was so surprising. Faced with a 4.h-and-1 in his own territory, Smith elected to go for the first down. It didn't work as Doug Martin was stuffed, giving Atlanta the ball at Tampa Bay's 41-yard line with 1:52 remaining. If the Bucs ended up losing, that call would have been questioned endlessly. Instead, we'll give Smith a pass and credit for showing some guts.    Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has taken some recent criticism from fans for not coming up with big plays, but he made 1 against the Falcons. On the final play of overtime, McCoy got to Matt Ryan and tied the quarterback's legs up, forcing an incompletion.    Tampa Bay's defense had a huge outing, forcing 4 turnovers that were converted into 20 points. Rookie middle linebacker Ryan Mallett. They then barely escaped against the Redskins, who went on to get blown out at the Jets, and the Titans, who were just crushed by the Texans. And now, Atlanta lost to the crappy Buccaneers at home. We've all been fooled, and they are not a good football team.    Maybe someday the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will look back at what happened Sunday as a watershed moment in franchise history. Maybe Sunday's overtime victory will do for coach Lovie Smith what a 1996 victory at San Diego did for Tony Dungy. Smith got what was easily the biggest victory of his short 10.re in Tampa Bay on a day when the Bucs (3-4) came dangerously close to blowing another big lead. Dungy's victory in San Diego marked a turning point for the franchise, and the victory against the Falcons (6-2) could do the same thing. After building a 20-3 lead in the third quarter, the Bucs looked like they were ready to choke the way they did at Washington last week when they squandered a 24-point lead. But this time ended up being different. This time, the Bucs hung on. But it wasn't easy. The Bucs let the Falcons back in the game in the second half, and a Matt Ryan touchdown pass to Julio Jones with 16 seconds remaining in regulation sent the game to overtime."

   "comment":"Matt Ryan on the food chain of NFC South quarterbacks. Well, he's still clearly behind Ryan on the food chain of NFC South quarterbacks. Well, he's still clearly behind Drew Brees. Winston's accuracy was an issue in this contest, though he was still better than Ryan this particular week.    Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, as the latter set a franchise record for receiving yards in a game while the former totaled nearly 2 games of production versus Carolina. The Panthers' offseason decisions to let Josh Norman leave and not improve their offensive tackles came back to bite them against Atlanta. They had no defensive back who could contain Jones, while offensive tackle Mike Remmers was a crushing liability. These predictable weaknesses have put Carolina in a huge hole after a quarter of this season.    Immediately in the first quarter, the Falcons got moving with 3 completions to Julio Jones for 50 yards. Atlanta finished the drive with Ryan rolling out to hit Jacob Tamme (2-3) for a short touchdown. Starting at their own 2.yard line, the Falcons continued to move the ball with a 44-yard pass to Jones. Devonta Freeman (13-57-1) then rumbled for a 12-yard run before gashing the Panthers up the middle on a 13-yard touchdown run. Atlanta center Alex Mack hit a great block on Luke Kuechly to spring Freeman. After a Carolina punt was downed just outside of the end zone, Thomas Davis then made a superb play to deflect a pass from Ryan that was picked off by Kurt Coleman, who coasted into the end zone to get the Panthers back into the game. The Falcons and Panthers traded field goal drives before the half, but Carolina was lucky to be in the game as Atlanta dominated with the pick-six being the only thing that kept the Panthers close at 17-10. By the half, Jones had 7 receptions for 170 yards. The Falcons expanded their lead after halfrime as the Panthers had busted coverage where they completely forgot to cover Austin Hooper (1-42-1). That 42-yard touchdown pass gave Atlanta a 24-10 lead. Another long pass to Jones set up Ryan to loft in a beautiful 35-yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson (2-48-1). In the 4.h quarter, Atlanta added a 53-yard field goal from Matt Bryant. Down by 24, Carolina got its first offensive touchdown of the game with a 6.yard strike to Kelvin Benjamin. Newton ran in the 2.point conversion, but took a massive hit from Deion Jones. That hit sent Newton into the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. Derek Anderson took over to lead a drive down the field, and Greg Olsen made a superb 1.handed 14-yard touchdown catch. They connected again on the 2.point conversion attempt. However, the Falcons put the Panthers in a bigger hole as Ryan hit Jones on the run and he exploded down the field for a 75-yard touchdown. Anderson led another touchdown drive with a short pass to Corey Brown for pay dirt. The Panthers got the ball back with 1:25 around their own 25-yard line down by 8 points, but Anderson floated a terrible pass that was picked off by Atlanta's Robert Alford, who then coasted into the end zone from 35 yards out.    Jones was the star of the game with 12 receptions for 300 yards and a touchdown. It set a Falcons franchise record, and Jones was sensational dominating a weak Carolina defense. Panthers cornerback Bene Benwikere was especially dominated by Jones.    Matt Ryan was tremendous, picking apart the vulnerable Carolina secondary. He completed 28-of-37 passes for 503 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.

   "comment":"Matt Ryan continues to surprise his critics. Although many wrote him off prior to the season, Ryan has been extremely impressive. He came into the game as the league leader in passing yards with 1,740 yards, and he added to that total today. Ryan went 27-of-42 on the day with 335 yards and 3 total touchdowns. He did throw 1 pick on a deflected ball, but that was virtually his only mistake. Ryan looks to have regained his form from past seasons, and he is putting the Falcons in position to contend for a playoff spot. It also helps that his protection has improved significantly. Of course, it does help Ryan's cause that he has 1 of the best receivers in the league at his disposal. Julio Jones was once again on point for the Falcons. After having some trouble in the first half, Jones caught fire against the Seahawks' defense. He hauled in 7 passes for the team on 9 targets, totaling 139 yards and another touchdown pass. His excellent athleticism was on display, and if he stays healthy, he should lead the league in receiving yards.    In terms of the other receivers, the Falcons got some help from No. 2 wideout Mohammad Sanu (5-47-1) and tight end Levine Toilolo (3-69-1). Sanu caught a nice touchdown pass from Ryan and should have success if Jones continues to play well. Sanu is only a bench player, at best, in fantasy, but he could see an uptick in production as the year goes on. Toilolo's performance was more surprising. He caught a 46-yard touchdown from Ryan, on which he was wide open, so that helped to skew his numbers. He is definitely not be worth an add in fantasy, but he should be monitored. Perhaps Toilolo could take over for Jacob Tamme in the future.    The running game for the Falcons was not at its best today. The strong Seattle front had a lot of success bottling up Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman. Freeman led the way for the 2.headed attack, getting 12 carries and 40 yards. Coleman was uninspiring. He toted the rock 5 times for 10 yards. He should do better against less physical defenses, as his physicality is his strength.    For the Seahawks, this win was actually somewhat of a struggle. The team had multiple chances to pull away from the Falcons, yet the Seahawks put themselves in a situation where they had to kick a 54-yard field goal to win the game. Part of the problem actually was the kicking game today. Steven Hauschka went 2-for-3 on field goals and 2-for-3 on extra points. The field goal miss was not his fault; long snapper Nolan Frese, an undrafted free agent, threw a bad snap that holder Jon Ryan could not handle. However, Hauschka's kick on the extra point was too low, and as a result, it was blocked by the Falcons. That was absolutely critical, as the score was 24-23 when the kick was blocked. Regardless, Hauschka saved the team with his field goal, so he deserves some credit.    Russell Wilson had a pretty good day. He went 25-of-37 for 270 yards total, with no touchdowns and no picks. However, his bigger impact was his ability to move around the pocket. Wilson was only sacked once during the game, which is huge considering the sorry state of his offensive line. Granted, he only ran 6 times for 7 yards, but he was able to avoid negative plays. Wilson is still 1 of the better quarterbacks in the NFL, but the front office needs to upgrade the offensive line. Otherwise, he will get hurt. Wilson's top receiver during the contest was Jimmy Graham, who caught 6 passes for 89 yards. Graham appears to have been reborn in this his second season with the Seahawks. After suffering a nasty patellar 10.on tear, he has bounced back nicely. Graham is becoming the matchup nightmare who he was in New Orleans, and he should continue to be the top receiving option moving forward.    The Seahawks' trio of wide receivers were decent during the game. Doug Baldwin (4-31), Jermaine Kearse (3-35) and Tyler Lockett (3-23) all got 5 targets and will continue to split Wilson's targets. The veteran quarterback likes to spread it around, and that likely will not change.    In the running game, the Seahawks got some solid production out of Christine Michael. It appears as though Michael is the team's lead running back moving forward. Though the back only got 64 yards on 18 carries, he did total 2 touchdowns and ran with a physical nature. Michael is becoming the back the team envisioned him to be when it took him in the second round back in 2013. He just needed to grow up, and being released changed that. When Thomas Rawls comes back from injury, I think Michael should still be the leader. That will put the Seahawks in a good position.    C.J. Spiller looked terrific today for the Seahawks. He is a perfect fit as the team's third-down back, given his explosiveness and his pass-catching ability. Spiller only ran the ball once for minus-3 yards, but he caught 3 passes for 38 yards. He should continue to operate in this role, and general manager John Schneider looks like a genius for signing the veteran recently.    Seattle's defense looked good today. Cliff Avril was particularly strong, and he managed to sack Matt Ryan twice. Avril was able to beat Atlanta's tackles easily, and he is a huge part of the Seattle's defense. The Seahawks were also without Kam Chancellor today, but Deshawn Shead filled in admirably, recording 8 tackles and defensing 3 passes. The Seahawks should continue to be 1 of the best defensive units in the league. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. Ryan then lofted in a perfect 50-yard bomb to Jones, and on third-and-13, Ryan threw a frozen rope to Jacob Tamme for a 17-yard touchdown."

Conversely, Ryan gave further evidence of his MVP candidacy with a dominant performance against Carolina. Conversely, Cam Newton was terrible versus Atlanta. His field vision was horrible, as he stared down receivers, missed other wideouts open downfield, and let poor footwork lead to inaccurate passing. Atlanta's offense, on the other hand, was clicking on the ground and through the air, as the Falcons illustrated they will be a very tough opponent in the playoffs. Ryan is playing the best football of his career and has an excellent supporting cast. NFC defenses will face a tough challenge with the Falcons in January.

The Falcons were missing their talented right tackle, but that didn't matter at all against the Lions. Atlanta's offense did whatever it wanted to in this contest, quickly jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the middle of the second quarter. Seemingly getting double-digit yards on every single play, Detroit had no answer for the Falcons without rookie middle linebacker Jarrad Davis, as the tackling efforts were atrocious. This was apparent on the opening drive when Matt Ryan converted a third-and-16 to Devonta Freeman after taking a sack."

This gave the Dolphins the victory, allowing them to improve to 3-2 on the year.    Cutler finally showed signs of life in this game. He struggled in the opening half - his pick was a forced throw while under pressure - but he did a good job of moving the chains after intermission. Cutler, who finished 19-of-33 for 151 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception, was fiery, showing signs of energy that wasn't there during the loss to the Saints in London.    The reason the Dolphins won this game, aside from Atlanta's second-half blunders, was Ajayi. Though Ajayi had some early drops, he punished the Falcons with some terrific running. The Dolphins opened up huge lanes for Ajayi, who gained 130 yards on 26 carries. Credit the Dolphins for sticking with the run despite being down 17-0 in the second half.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jarvis Landry (8-62) and Kenny Stills (4-49). Landry would've had a bigger day had he not committed 3 drops. As for Stills, he was a greater factor with DeVante Parker out. Only 2 other Dolphins caught multiple passes.    Ryan, meanwhile, had just a middling performance against a weak back 7. He finished 24-of-35 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick at the end of the game. The issue I had with Atlanta's game plan was that the team ran the ball so often on first down, putting Ryan in constant long-yardage situations. Ryan converted those in the opening half, but didn't have nearly as much success after the break. Prior to the final drive, Atlanta mustered only 45 yards in the second half!    "

Still, even if he were successful in that regard, there was a marked improvement from the New England secondary, which blew countless coverages against the Jets last week. Ryan finished 23-of-33 for 233 yards and a touchdown. He didn't play poorly, but the Patriots were able to easily diagnose whatever Atlanta happened to be doing. It's clear that the Falcons are missing Kyle Shanahan, and his replacement, Steve Sarkisian, might be the worst offensive coordinator in the NFL. His play-calling was so predictable that I felt like Tony Romo watching the game. And on the rare occasions when Sarkisian did something unexpected, it was often stupid, such as a failed sweep with Tayor Gabriel at the goal line to ruin a scoring opportunity. It's fair to wonder if the Falcons should just consider Sarkisian a sunk cost and fire him right away. The Falcons are now just 3-3, so there's still time to save their season.
