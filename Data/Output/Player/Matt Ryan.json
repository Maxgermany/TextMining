They struggled throughout the entire game, but Chris Redman was able to put together a final drive, connecting with Roddy White on a 5-yard touchdown on 4th-and-5 with 26 seconds remaining in regulation. Redman was solid on Atlanta's last possession, and his numbers look good on the stat sheet (23-of-41, 243 yards, 2 TDs). However, Redman took far too many sacks (6), which stalled a lot of drives and allowed the Buccaneers to hang around. Redman played relatively well, but there's no way the Falcons will be able to beat the Eagles or Saints without Ryan under center.    Ryan's toe wasn't the only major injury for Atlanta. "

   "comment":"Ryan was sacked and fumbled the ball from a hit by blitzing linebacker Dekoda Watson. Cornerback Ronde Barber covered the fumble for Tampa Bay and set the Bucs up at the Atlanta 17-yard line. Josh Freeman gave it right back a few plays later as threw a terrible pass to tight end Kellen Winslow that was intercepted safety Thomas DeCoud in the back of the end zone. Freeman was off for most of the first half. A 16-yard pass to Mike Williams and some quality runs by LeGarrette Blount got Tampa Bay on the board first with a field goal. Freeman got into more of a groove late in the second quarter to lead a 14-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. He connected on a few passes to rookie tight end Luke Stocker and Williams. Freeman dived into the end zone from a yard out to give Tampa Bay 10-3 lead. A turnover set Tampa Bay up for 3 more points just before halftime and a lead of 16-3. To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off the hands of wide receiver Arrelious Benn and into the hands of safety William Moore, who returned the interception to midfield. Freeman finished the game 22-of-32 for 180 yards and 2 interceptions. Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.    The Falcon defensive line got some pressure on Freeman but never sacked him. Defensive end Ray Edwards was held in check by Bucs right tackle Jeremy Trueblood. Left tackle Donald Penn was called for a holding on John Abraham, but otherwise, he limited Abraham to 1 hit on Freeman. Atlanta's defensive line did not defend the run that well either.    Matt Ryan answered the first 3 points from the Bucs with a field goal on an 84-yard drive midway through the first half. Ryan moved the ball by throwing the ball up and letting his receivers make some plays. "

Atlanta went up 14-0 almost instantly and led at the half, 14-6. The Packers looked like they were in trouble. They couldn't stop the Falcons, while left tackle Chad Clifton was knocked out of the game with a leg injury. Aaron Rodgers seemed a bit discombobulated. He apparently didn't trust the protection and hurried some of his throws. And then the second half happened. Rodgers was on fire after the break, finishing 26-of-39 for 396 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dom Capers, meanwhile, made a great adjustment, switching to more man coverage to really slow down Matt Ryan. After starting 8-of-10, Ryan completed fewer than 50 percent of his attempts.

After that, linebacker Sean Weatherspoon blitzed and got his own sack. A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference."

   "comment":"Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the fourth quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control. Up against it, Matt Ryan (29-of-52 351 yards 2 TD 1 INT) came out firing from the shotgun, connecting with Gonzalez (6 receptions for 71 yards) to start the drive picking up 18 yards and to finish it with a 20-yard score. New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6-point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line. Forced to third down, "

   "comment":"Ryan to Tony Gonzalez. The Falcon defense was really playing well in the first half and forced a series of punts. Atlanta had a 13-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, a miraculous catch along the sideline by Roddy White led to a touchdown run by Michael Turner. White kept up the heat on the Titans' defense with a 32-yard wide receiver screen that led to another Matt Bryant field goal. In the third quarter, Matt Hasselbeck left the game with a sprained right elbow. Rookie quarterback Jake Locker came in the game with his team down 23-3. He quickly got the Titans in the end zone. Locker threw a deep out to Nate Washington about 20 yards downfield on the sideline. He cut back to the middle of the field and ran by a couple defenders for a 40-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, rookie linebacker Colin McCarthy forced a fumble from Turner when Tennessee was backed up deep in their own territory. That helped keep the Titans in the game. Locker made a big play downfield after scrambling to buy time. He tossed a ball deep for Lavelle Hawkins and the 5-foot-11 wide out caught the pass over a defensive back for a 32-yard gain. It set up Tennessee at the Atlanta 4-yard line with 4 minutes left and down by 13. Locker made a good throw on third-and-goal to Washington for his second touchdown pass. Locker finished the game 9-of-19 for 140 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons' offense ran out the clock with some tough runs by Turner. Atlanta's offense played a balanced game. Turner ran for 100 yards on 21 carries with a score. Ryan was 22-of-32 for 316 yards and 1 touchdown. White led Atlanta with 7 receptions for 147 yards. It could have been an even bigger game but he dropped a couple of passes. The Falcons' defense really played well. Conversely, the Titans' offensive line played like crap. They weren't winning at the point of attack, and had only 41 yards rushing in the game. They looked very predictable for the Atlanta defense. "

The next Buccaneers' drive was almost as fruitless as the previous 1, since on the fifth play, defensive end John Abraham strip-sacked Freeman to set up another Falcons touchdown. Michael Turner has looked slow and washed up the last 5 weeks or so, but Tampa Bay's anemic run defense was the perfect remedy for him. He ran into the end zone on a fourth-and-goal to put Atlanta up 28-0. The Buccaneers got the ball back for less than a minute since Falcons linebacker Curtis Lofton intercepted Freeman (31-of-45, 274 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) on the drive's third play, returning the pick 26-yards for a touchdown. It was an ugly play where Tampa Bay running back Kregg Lumpkin got blasted by teammate, Kellen Winslow, leaving Lofton as the only player in position to catch the ball. On Atlanta's next possession, Turner capped the Falcons' collection of 42 unanswered points, with an 81-yard touchdown run. The Buccaneers finally got on the board with a short touchdown from Freeman to Briscoe on the next drive. At halftime Falcons were up 42-7, and Ryan had already been replaced by backup Chris Redmond.    Ryan was 6-of-9 for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns.

   "comment":"Ryan was stuffed, and the entire Falcon sideline reportedly was completely deflated. Three plays later, Manning hit Hakeem Nicks for a 72-yard touchdown, blowing this contest open. Michael Turner was stuffed on 3rd-and-1 on the ensuing possession. The Falcons had to punt, and New York would find the end zone a few minutes later. The 2 New York scores put the game out of reach, but you have to wonder what would have happened if Atlanta opted for the field goals. With 2 successful kicks, the team would have trailed 10-8, and the players wouldn't have been sulking on the bench.    While you could argue that Mike Smith made the right decision in being aggressive and going for it, no 1 can defend his antics at the end of the first half. Following an odd New York possession that featured a terrible spot by the officials, the Falcons were doing a decent job of moving the chains. They advanced to their own 45, but after being tackled inbounds, Smith inexplicably refused to take a timeout. The Falcons ran out of time and had to attempt a Hail Mary, and they went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. Remember when I said that Atlanta could have been down 10-8 with 2 kicks? Well, if Smith used a timeout and his team was able to drive down to field-goal range, the Falcons could have led 11-10 at the end of the third quarter. It's amazing how significant inept coaching decisions can be in an NFL game.    Regardless of the bad coaching, Matt Ryan was simply awful. He went 24-of-41 for just 199 yards, now owning an 0-3 playoff record. He suffered through some "

There was no way Ryan wasn't going to pass for at least 300 yards and 4 touchdowns. Well, I guess that's why Chris Berman invented the saying, That's why they play the games. Ryan, who had just 3 interceptions entering this contest, tossed 3 picks in the first half alone. Though the first 2 were his fault - he was hit as he heaved the third 1 - pass protection was the main culprit. The Raiders, who have struggled getting to the quarterback all season, somehow put good pressure on Ryan. It really looked like the Falcons were going to lose. Ryan couldn't really get anything going for the most part (24-of-37, 249 yards, TD, 3 INTs), especially in the red zone where his team squandered several opportunities. The Raiders, who were gashing the Falcons on the ground all afternoon, decided to throw the ball for some strange reason inside the Atlanta 30-yard line with only a few minutes remaining. "

   "comment":"Ryan was nearly perfect. He was 12-of-13 for 157 yards and a trio of scores on those drives. The Eagle corners were no match for him, as Julio Jones torched Nnamdi Asomugha. Based on this, you have to believe that Asante Samuel received some sort of vindication after being traded for a mid-round draft pick this offseason.    Ryan finished 22-of-29 for 262 yards and the 3 touchdowns. Those numbers don't indicate all of the defensive penalties the Eagles committed, and it's also worth noting that he had just 65 passing yards in the second half because his team was so far ahead. Ryan was a machine on third down, converting 7-of-13 attempts. Though he was sacked twice, he had a clean pocket most of the afternoon. The Eagles just had no chance, especially with their poor tackling.    Ryan's scores went to Jones (5-123), "

   "comment":"Ryan's new unit surrendered just 7 points in the final 3 frames and had an awesome goal-line stand to secure a victory. This was especially impressive because the Saints lost several defenders in this contest, including nose tackle Brodrick Bunkley and starting cornerback Keenan Lewis. Of course, Drew Brees had a big say in this victory. He went 26-of-35 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, absolutely torching a secondary featuring 2 rookie cornerbacks. Asante Samuel was out, so Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford were tasked with stopping New Orleans' aerial attack. Yeah, that wasn't happening.    Brees' scores went to the usual suspects: Marques Colston (5-68) and Jimmy Graham (4-45). Rookie wideout Kenny Stills caught a 67-yard bomb, but he had just 2 receptions on the afternoon. Darren Sproles (6-88) led the team in receiving yardage.    Sean Payton told the media that he wants to run the ball more often this season. He kept his word, as Pierre Thomas (9-43), Sproles (8-22) and Mark Ingram (9-11) combined for 26 carries. It's always good to be balanced, but Payton may have run the ball a little too much early on. The Saints failed on a fourth-and-inches try in the first half because Ingram was stuffed in the backfield. With Brees matched up versus 2 rookie corners, the Saints should have exploited that advantage.    The Falcons, meanwhile, didn't run the ball enough. Steven Jackson had just 11 carries for 77 yards, including a 50-yard scamper. Atlanta never trailed by more than 6 points, so I'm not sure why the team abandoned its rushing attack, especially since Jackson was such a prized offseason acquisition. It's worth noting though that Jackson dropped 2 passes, including a key 1 on the team's final drive.    Matt Ryan threw the ball 38 times. He completed 25 passes for 304 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Ryan's an excellent quarterback, but the constant passing was a bad idea because the Saints did a great job of applying pressure on him. New Orleans recorded 3 sacks, but the number could've been much higher if Ryan wasn't capable of releasing the ball so quickly. Ryan took a shot to the ribs early on and appeared to be hurt.    Ryan's scores went to "

   "comment":"Ryan Tannehill simply came through in the clutch. He was 8-of-11 for 67 yards on the final possession, capping it off with a 1-yard score to rookie tight end Dion Sims. Tannehill had some accuracy issues at times throughout the afternoon - his overall numbers were 24-of-35 for 236 yards, 2 touchdowns, a lost fumble and an ugly interception thrown off his back foot - but he was sharp when it mattered most. The Falcons helped Miami clinch an improbable victory with mistakes. Harry Douglas fumbled a punt return deep in Dolphins' territory, which led to a game-tying touchdown in the third quarter. A missed, chip-shot field goal by Matt Bryant also took 3 points off the board. Worst of all, Mike Smith had issues with clock management. The Dolphins were bleeding the clock while driving for their decisive touchdown. Smith used only 1 of his timeouts. As a consequence, the Falcons missed out on 1:20 to try to win the game. They went into the locker room with 2 timeouts in their pocket. That's inexcusable.    These mental lapses ruined a great effort by Atlanta's rushing attack. Jacquizz Rodgers (18-86) and Jason Snelling (11 carries, 53 rush yards; 4 catches, 58 rec. yards, 1 TD) both ran extremely well. A major reason for this was that 3 Miami front-7 players were knocked out of the lineup. Cameron Wake, Philip Wheeler and Koa Misi all suffered injuries. It should be noted though that rookie Dion Jordan did a great job of setting the edge to stuff the Falcons in the red zone. He didn't register a sack, however.    Matt Ryan didn't have Sam Baker at his disposal. "

   "comment":"Ryan attended Boston College, while Matt Flynn went to LSU, so it could be argued that the former was more prepared to play in this weather. That was certainly the case early on. It appeared as though Flynn would ruin yet another potential victory with some awful mistakes. He was strip-sacked in the first half when Eddie Lacy missed a blitz pick-up, which ultimately led to a Tony Gonzalez touchdown. Flynn was then pick-sixed by Sean Weatherspoon, who missed some action with a shoulder injury. The interception was a weird 1, as it bounced off linebacker Paul Worrilow's foot. Ryan, meanwhile, misfired on just 4 passes in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 85 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons were up 21-10 and appeared as though they'd cruise to victory, effectively eliminating Green Bay from playoff contention. Mike McCarthy and his coaching staff made some awesome adjustments at halftime, however, which is something I never thought I'd write. Flynn was simply unbelievable in the second half, going 10-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown. Of course, much of this can be attributed to the ineptitude of the Atlanta defense, but the important thing is that Flynn bought his team another week for Aaron Rodgers to return. With the Lions losing, Green Bay is just half a game out of the division lead. Rodgers could return next week, which would give the team a great chance to claim the NFC North.    Flynn ultimately finished 24-of-32 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-6. His score went to tight end "

   "comment":"Ryan, who didn't see much pressure early on, was suddenly feeling lots of heat and couldn't make a comeback as a consequence. He tossed 2 picks late, both of which were made out of desperation.    Of course, the most prevalent injury that occurred came when Teddy Bridgewater limped toward the sideline and was carted off to the locker room. It's a shame because Bridgewater had a brilliant performance in his first NFL start. He went 19-of-30 for 317 passing yards as well as 27 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Bridgewater made some great plays, including 1 where he juked to avoid a sack and rushed upfield to move the chains. He had the fans in a frenzy, who chanted, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! throughout the afternoon. The FOX sideline reporter said that Bridgewater gave her 2 thumbs up when he was being wheeled off, so hopefully that's a good sign. It would be a shame if Bridgewater missed significant time after this excellent display, albeit against a crappy defense. However, 1 of the few reasons Bridgewater fell in the 2014 NFL Draft was because some teams were worried about his durability. This might be something Minnesota fans will just have to get used to, unfortunately. Bridgewater opened the game with mostly short throws to Jarius Wright. The speedy receiver had a huge afternoon, hauling in 8 balls for 132 yards. Bridgewater also missed him for a possible touchdown. Meanwhile, it was surprising to see Cordarrelle Patterson (2 catches, 38 yards) do very little once again. Norv Turner talked about designing plays for Patterson, but save for the season opener, the 2013 first-rounder hasn't been much of a factor.    It really helped Bridgewater that his team was able to run the ball so well. Matt Asiata (20-78) scored thrice, but Jerick McKinnon was much more impressive. He gained 135 yards on 18 carries, including a 55-yard burst. He didn't face much of a challenge against Atlanta's pathetic front, but McKinnon still needs to get more touches going forward.    Moving back to the Falcons, Ryan was sharp early on, but as mentioned, his offensive line issues prevented him from doing anything late. Ryan finished 25-of-41 for 298 yards, 3 touchdowns and the 2 meaningless picks. He was terrific on third downs, converting 10-of-15 opportunities.    The Vikings didn't seem to have an answer for any of the 3 primary receivers, as "

Another Atlanta drive led to a tie score after Matt Bryant drilled a 54-yard field goal. After blowing a game at Carolina a week ago in the fourth quarter, the Bears showed some heart by turning the momentum in their direction after Atlanta came out strong following halftime. Cutler and his offense were continuing their trend of struggling in the second half until a 74-yard bomb to Alshon Jeffery (5-136) turned everything around. On the next play, Matt Forte squirted into the end zone from 6 yards out. Falcons' defensive tackle Ra'Shede Hageman blocked the extra point. Cutler kept moving the ball and threw a short touchdown pass to Jeffery, but the big wideout stepped out of bounds before the reception. Forte finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown run up the middle. Cutler threw a fastball to Martellus Bennett (4-52) for the 2-point conversion. To close out the game, the Falcons had 2 possessions to do something. The first 1 ended when Jared Allen and Willie Young combined for a sack. Ryan was under pressure on fourth-and-14, and he threw into triple coverage for Julio Jones (4-68), but the pass picked off by Damontre Hurst."

That transitioned to the field, as he opened things up for a 23-yard reception right away, leaping over solid corner Keenan Lewis. Jones finished with a team-high 7 catches for 107 yards. He wasn't on the field for every snap, but the Falcons will likely have him at full strength for the Carolina contest. As for Ryan, the Falcon signal-caller went 30-of-40 for 322 yards and a touchdown. He was highly efficient, helping his offense convert nearly half of their first downs (7-of-15) and average 6.4 yards per play, which is an excellent figure. The Saints couldn't get any pressure on him; he wasn't sacked on a single occasion.    The rest of Ryan's receiving corps posted meager numbers. "

That would totally work, right?    Finally, someone found a way to slow down Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. The Texans threw all sorts of coverage at Jones and held him to 4 catches for 38 yards. It didn't matter. The 4-0 Falcons still hammered the Texans with running back Devonta Freeman, showing last week's effort wasn't a flash in the pan. For the second straight week, Freeman scored 3 rushing touchdowns. Freeman became the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score 3 rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. He also became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to have 7 rushing touchdowns in the first 4 games of a season. Freeman has made himself into a must-start in any fantasy league. He finished with 68 yards on 14 carries and also caught 5 passes for 81 yards. Freeman's numbers could have been even higher, but the Falcons replaced him with Terron Ward (19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown) once the game got out of hand.    Even with Jones being held quiet, quarterback Matt Ryan had an efficient day.

The Falcons are 5-0 for only the second time in franchise history. They started 8-0 in 2012. However, this victory wasn't easy for Atlanta. The Falcons trailed for much of the game as quarterback Matt Ryan uncharacteristically struggled at home for much of the day. But Ryan got hot at the end to put the Falcons ahead with less than a minute left in regulation. The Redskins (2-3) forced overtime when "

   "comment":"Ryan fumbled a snap on a fourth down of the opening drive. After that, Tevin Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a fourth turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns.

And now, Atlanta lost to the crappy Buccaneers at home. We've all been fooled, and they are not a good football team.    Maybe someday the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will look back at what happened Sunday as a watershed moment in franchise history. Maybe Sunday's overtime victory will do for coach Lovie Smith what a 1996 victory at San Diego did for Tony Dungy. Smith got what was easily the biggest victory of his short tenure in Tampa Bay on a day when the Bucs (3-4) came dangerously close to blowing another big lead. Dungy's victory in San Diego marked a turning point for the franchise, and the victory against the Falcons (6-2) could do the same thing. After building a 20-3 lead in the third quarter, the Bucs looked like they were ready to choke the way they did at Washington last week when they squandered a 24-point lead. But this time ended up being different. This time, the Bucs hung on. But it wasn't easy. The Bucs let the Falcons back in the game in the second half, and a Matt Ryan touchdown pass to Julio Jones with 16 seconds remaining in regulation sent the game to overtime."

   "comment":"Ryan on the food chain of NFC South quarterbacks. Well, he's still clearly behind Drew Brees. Winston's accuracy was an issue in this contest, though he was still better than Ryan this particular week.    Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver "

   "comment":"Ryan and the Falcons have been so bad in the red zone for 3 years now. I don't get how they can be so efficient in between the 20s, yet come up short when it matters most.    This game had absolutely no playoff implications for either team. But you couldn't tell that by watching what transpired. This turned out to be a typical game in a matchup of the NFC South's 2 biggest rivals. Both teams were sharp throughout. But the Saints, who could have been ending an era, came out on top. New Orleans safety Jamarca Sanford came up with an interception of a Matt Ryan pass with just under 2 minutes left in the game. That cleared the way for a game-winning field goal by "

   "comment":"Ryan continues to surprise his critics. Although many wrote him off prior to the season, Ryan has been extremely impressive. He came into the game as the league leader in passing yards with 1,740 yards, and he added to that total today. Ryan went 27-of-42 on the day with 335 yards and 3 total touchdowns. He did throw 1 pick on a deflected ball, but that was virtually his only mistake. Ryan looks to have regained his form from past seasons, and he is putting the Falcons in position to contend for a playoff spot. It also helps that his protection has improved significantly. Of course, it does help Ryan's cause that he has 1 of the best receivers in the league at his disposal. "

All of these things have crushed Philadelphia, but things finally went the Eagles' way in this contest. The Falcons were the team that made the mental errors this Sunday. A good amount of them, anyway. Matt Bryant whiffed on a field goal and uncharacteristically missed an extra point. Julio Jones dropped a pass on a crucial third-and-12 in the fourth quarter. Austin Hooper dropped a ball as well. Matt Ryan couldn't connect with Jones on a fourth down at the end of the afternoon and also threw an interception. The Falcons appeared to be close in this game, but just couldn't quite get there. Despite Atlanta's blunders, the Eagles allowed them to hang around for most of the afternoon because they kept making mistakes of their own. "

The 49ers simply had no chance to stop Ryan, given their problems at inside linebacker. "

   "comment":"Ryan gave further evidence of his MVP candidacy with a dominant performance against Carolina. Conversely, Cam Newton was terrible versus Atlanta. His field vision was horrible, as he stared down receivers, missed other wideouts open downfield, and let poor footwork lead to inaccurate passing. Atlanta's offense, on the other hand, was clicking on the ground and through the air, as the Falcons illustrated they will be a very tough opponent in the playoffs. Ryan is playing the best football of his career and has an excellent supporting cast. NFC defenses will face a tough challenge with the Falcons in January.    On the opening drive, Ryan ripped the ball down the field, distributing it to a variety of weapons before throwing open tight end Josh Perkins (2-34-1) over "

Given that Atlanta's offense is so lethal, the Packers couldn't screw up on offense and blow opportunities on defense. This game could've gone a lot differently, and in most permutations, this wouldn't have been so lopsided.    That said, Ryan is playing on another level. He's resembling Peyton Manning in his prime, and the AFC representative in the Super Bowl will have immense issues dealing with him. Ryan, abusing the Packers cerebrally, went 27-of-38 for 392 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Three of his 11 incompletions were dropped, so his numbers could've looked even better. On the other hand, he made a couple of poor throws that should've been intercepted, but the Packer defensive backs dropped the ball. Ryan will have a tougher matchup in the Super Bowl by default. He won't be battling a stop unit that has absolutely no idea what it's doing.

   "comment":"Ryan Schraeder). Clay Matthews had success with Schraeder's backup, but that barely slowed down Atlanta. Matt Ryan's numbers don't look great - 19-of-28, 252 yards and a touchdown - but only because he barely threw following intermission. Out of 252 yards, 201 came prior to halftime. Ryan didn't do much in the second half, but he was effective on the 8 throws, as he completed 6 of them. They involved moving the chains and keeping the Packers off the field, chewing up enough clock for Atlanta to hold on to a giant lead for a change. Why the Packers never attempted an onside kick is beyond me. The Atlanta defense, meanwhile, did a tremendous job, although the stats don't show it. Rodgers finished 33-of-50 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 10-of-18 for 85 yards and a pick in the first half. The Falcons changed their defensive philosophy when they were way ahead, playing way off Green Bay's receivers. This allowed the Packers to accumulate tons of garbage yardage, but it also took a ton of time as well. Helping the Falcons' defense's cause was the play that occurred right before halftime. Rodgers, hit by "

   "comment":"Ryan pass to Austin Hooper was picked because cornerback Cordrea Tankersley popped the ball out of Hooper's hands and into the arms of safety Reshad Jones. This gave the Dolphins the victory, allowing them to improve to 3-2 on the year.    Cutler finally showed signs of life in this game. He struggled in the opening half - his pick was a forced throw while under pressure - but he did a good job of moving the chains after intermission. Cutler, who finished 19-of-33 for 151 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception, was fiery, showing signs of energy that wasn't there during the loss to the Saints in London.    The reason the Dolphins won this game, aside from Atlanta's second-half blunders, was Ajayi. Though Ajayi had some early drops, he punished the Falcons with some terrific running. The Dolphins opened up huge lanes for Ajayi, who gained 130 yards on 26 carries. Credit the Dolphins for sticking with the run despite being down 17-0 in the second half.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jarvis Landry (8-62) and Kenny Stills (4-49). Landry would've had a bigger day had he not committed 3 drops. As for Stills, he was a greater factor with DeVante Parker out. Only 2 other Dolphins caught multiple passes.    Ryan, meanwhile, had just a middling performance against a weak back 7. He finished 24-of-35 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick at the end of the game. The issue I had with Atlanta's game plan was that the team ran the ball so often on first down, putting Ryan in constant long-yardage situations. Ryan converted those in the opening half, but didn't have nearly as much success after the break. Prior to the final drive, Atlanta mustered only 45 yards in the second half!    "

   "comment":"Ryan may have gotten to that milestone in garbage time had he been given 1 more drive. Still, even if he were successful in that regard, there was a marked improvement from the New England secondary, which blew countless coverages against the Jets last week. Ryan finished 23-of-33 for 233 yards and a touchdown. He didn't play poorly, but the Patriots were able to easily diagnose whatever Atlanta happened to be doing. It's clear that the Falcons are missing Kyle Shanahan, and his replacement, Steve Sarkisian, might be the worst offensive coordinator in the NFL. His play-calling was so predictable that I felt like Tony Romo watching the game. And on the rare occasions when Sarkisian did something unexpected, it was often stupid, such as a failed sweep with Tayor Gabriel at the goal line to ruin a scoring opportunity. It's fair to wonder if the Falcons should just consider Sarkisian a sunk cost and fire him right away. The Falcons are now just 3-3, so there's still time to save their season. Otherwise, Atlanta will continue to struggle offensively.    "

   "comment":"Ryan had an open Julio Jones running free downfield. Ryan would've hit Jones if this were 2016, but he overshot the star receiver by just a bit. The second play came with 8 minutes remaining in regulation. Ryan once again had Jones open in the end zone. He launched a pass toward Jones, and this time, it was perfect. Jones, however, returned the favor from earlier by dropping the ball. A catch there may have won the game for the Falcons, who scored a touchdown later in the fourth quarter to draw to within 20-17 rather than to take a 24-20 lead. The Panthers, meanwhile, look to be the team to challenge the Saints for the NFC South crown. There were some questions about how they would move the chains in the wake of the Kelvin Benjamin trade, but they did a good job of doing so in this contest, generating 330 yards of offense. A 20-point output may not seem like much, but the Panthers would've had better success on the scoreboard if it weren't for 2 turnovers in Atlanta territory.    "
