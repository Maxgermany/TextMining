   "comment":"Goodwin. The ball was perfectly placed by Taylor despite the fact that he was dealing with pressure. Taylor launched the ball downfield and got crushed as soon as he released it. The pass hit Goodwin perfectly in stride and allowed the receiver to speed into the end zone. It was a 67-yard score that gave the Bills a 17-6 lead.    Goodwin was the best of the receivers for the Bills on the day. He caught 4 passes for 93 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. He appears to be Taylor's favorite target right now. "

   "comment":"Goodwin (4-35) were both decent, but they just did not have enough time to make plays. Charles Clay sat out today's game as he attended the birth of his child. Watkins is the only member of the Bills' passing attack who is worth owning in fantasy as of right now.    Though the passing attack sputtered, the ground game was as strong as ever. McCoy once again led the way for the team, posting 130 yards on 17 carries. He was elusive as ever, though he did give the team a scare when he briefly left due to cramps. McCoy will continue to be a top-5 back in fantasy, though his touchdowns are being vultured right now. Speaking of the vulturing, "

   "comment":"Goodwin made circus catches along the sidelines to help Hoyer, who was gaining more confidence with every throw. A Pharoh Cooper fumbled kickoff return helped, setting up the 49ers with the opportunity to tie the game, deep in Rams territory. They managed to score on fourth down with a tough Carlos Hyde run, but missed on the 2-point conversion, as the receiver Hoyer threw to ran a bad route. The 49ers still had a chance after that because they recovered an onside kick. However, Aaron Donald closed out the game, sacking Hoyer on fourth down.    Gurley was an absolute monster for the Rams. He rushed for 113 yards on 28 carries, and he was once again a big-time factor in the passing game, catching 5 of his 7 targets for 36 receiving yards. He scored thrice, but would've had 5 touchdowns had he not been stuffed on the goal line on 2 separate drives. A major reason for this was center John Sullivan getting knocked out with an injury. Backup Austin Blythe couldn't get as much of a push. It'll be important for the Rams to have Sullivan in next week's game against the Cowboys.    Goff continued to improve, as he misfired on just 6 occasions. Granted, this was against San Francisco's inept defense, but he looked so much better than last year, going 22-of-28 for 292 yards and 3 touchdowns. Goff still holds on to the ball too long, and as Cris Collinsworth mentioned, he drifts back in the pocket too often. That said, he works hard, so he should be able to improve in these facets. Until he does, however, he'll be in trouble when battling tough defenses. The 49ers simply couldn't get to the quarterback very often, but some other teams - like the Redskins last week - will be able to.    Two of Goff's touchdowns went to Sammy Watkins (6-106), who finally had a big game. He and Robert Woods (6-108) weren't met with much resistance, as safety Eric Reid was inactive. The only Ram who disappointed was Cooper Kupp, who snatched just 2 balls for 17 yards.    Going back to the 49ers, Hoyer shook off his initial pick to have a solid outing otherwise. He went 23-of-37 for 322 yards and 2 touchdowns. As a reminder, the Rams lost a couple of star players, but Hoyer did a good job of bouncing back from a horrible throw to start the game. He could've melted down quite easily, but didn't.    Hoyer was locked in on Garcon, which wasn't surprising at all. Garcon snared 7 of his 10 targets for 142 yards. Goodwin (2-62) hauled in a 50-yard grab, while fifth-round rookie Trent Taylor (3-32) secured a touchdown after suffering what appeared to be a possible concussion."

   "comment":"Goodwin ran by Mathieu to make a 55-yard reception, and that set up a Robbie Gould 42-yard field goal. Arizona answered with Adrian Peterson leading the way down the field. To cap the drive, Jermaine Gresham (2-23-1) snatched a touchdown in front of Akhello Witherspoon to put Arizona up 14-3. The Cardinals were led by Adrian Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald down the field for more points, but Eric Reid outfought Gresham on a jump ball in the end zone for an interception. That kept the 49ers down by 11 entering the half. The 49ers got moving in the third quarter when C.J. Beathard hit wideout Kendrick Bourne (2-39) for 25 yards and Goodwin for 13 yards. The drive finished with Beathard, taking a short read-option run into the end zone. Twice in the fourth quarter, Arizona got field goal on a drives led by Peterson and Fitzgerald to take a 20-10 lead. The Cardinals were in position to salt the game away midway through the fourth quarter, but Peterson fumbled the ball away. After a hit going to the head of Beathard, a big fight erupted between the 2 teams with punches thrown. "
