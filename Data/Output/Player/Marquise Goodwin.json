It was a 67-yard score that gave the Bills a 17-6 lead.    Goodwin was the best of the receivers for the Bills on the day. He caught 4 passes for 93 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.

   "comment":"Marquise Goodwin (4-35) were both decent, but they just did not have enough time to make plays. Charles Clay sat out today's game as he attended the birth of his child. Watkins is the only member of the Bills' passing attack who is worth owning in fantasy as of right now.    Though the passing attack sputtered, the ground game was as strong as ever. McCoy once again led the way for the team, posting 130 yards on 17 carries. He was elusive as ever, though he did give the team a scare when he briefly left due to cramps. McCoy will continue to be a top-five back in fantasy, though his touchdowns are being vultured right now. Speaking of the vulturing, "
