   "comment":"Derrick Kindred like a rented mule the entire contest. Mariota finished 17-of-24 for 284 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception to go along with 64 rushing yards on 7 attempts. By my count, Mariota threw only 2 poor passes on the afternoon. One was a dangerous heave into heavy traffic in the first half.

He made a similar pass at Houston, but it's a positive that Mariota limited his mistakes in this contest.    As mentioned, Mariota targeted Kendall Wright heavily. Wright looked like his former self, and if you were somehow asleep over the past several years, you may have assumed that he has performed this way the entire time. Wright caught 8 of his 9 targets for 133 yards and a touchdown, as no 1 on the Browns could cover him with Joe Haden out of the lineup. Rishard Matthews (3-70) and "
