   "comment":"Chris Redman was able to put together a final drive, connecting with Roddy White on a 5-yard touchdown on 4th-and-5 with 26 seconds remaining in regulation.Redman was able to put together a final drive, connecting with Roddy White on a 5-yard touchdown on 4th-and-5 with 26 seconds remaining in regulation. Redman was solid on Atlanta's last possession, and his numbers look good on the stat sheet (23-of-41, 243 yards, 2 TDs). However, Redman took far too many sacks (6), which stalled a lot of drives and allowed the Buccaneers to hang around. Redman played relatively well, but there's no way the Falcons will be able to beat the Eagles or Saints without Ryan under center.    Ryan's toe wasn't the only major injury for Atlanta. "
