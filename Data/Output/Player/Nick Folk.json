Folk missed 7 points' worth of kicks, though the FOX announcing crew, which featured both Tiki and Ronde Barber, blamed Folk's poor performance on the sloppy field surface, which was messed up because of a heavy downpour at kickoff. Why the NFL scheduled a 4 p.m. start time in the lightning capital of the world, I have no idea. At any rate, "

   "comment":"Nick Folk, who converted a high percentage of his kicks with the Jets. Folk, however, struggled versus the Giants last week before drilling the game-winner, and his struggles continued Thursday night. He whiffed on all 3 of his field goal attempts. The first 1 wasn't on him, as it was from the mid-50s, but he then misfired from 49 and then 31. The latter kick was inexcusable. Had he converted the easy attempt, the Buccaneers may have won this game. It was a shame that the Buccaneers lost as a result of their kicker because their defense had a great game despite missing 2 starting linebackers and the top safety. Their pass rush was terrific, swarming "
