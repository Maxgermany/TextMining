Ingram had 51 yards to Thomas' 41, but the YPC discrepancy is misleading because Ingram had the short-yardage work, and thus a few minimal gains.    There was some terrible officiating in this game on both sides. Roman Harper was whistled for a horrible roughing-the-passer call on Chicago's second drive that set up a touchdown. Meanwhile, in the 4.h quarter, Darren Sproles stepped out of bounds on his way to the end zone. This was completely obvious to Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, yet the booth refused to review it. The Bears couldn't challenge because of the NFL's stupid, new touchdown-replay rule.   "

   "comment":"Darren Sproles and many other starters in the game very late despite facing a 40-point deficit. I'm not sure if Kelly still thinks he needs to impress clueless AP poll voters, but he's extremely fortunate that his team didn't suffer any injuries late in meaningless action, because that would've been catastrophic.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look bad - 26-of-44, 346 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions - but most of his positive stats came in garbage time. He had accuracy issues, fumbled an exchange, lost another fumble on a high snap, took bad sacks and tossed a pick-six right to "

The Eagles won with a Mathews-Sproles time share against a solid New York defense, so I'd question this usage if Chip Kelly didn't happen to be such an offensive genius. I'd also discuss Philadelphia's time-of-possession woes - Washington held the ball for about 41 minutes - but Kelly is such a great offensive mind that criticizing him would be extremely foolish.    The Eagles' kicking woes continue. Cal Sturgis whiffed on a 33-yard field goal and also missed an extra point. That was the difference in this game.    The Redskins were more effective moving the ball throughout the afternoon, and it began with Christian Thompson picking up 42 yards on a third-and-forever run. This was a harbinger of things to come, as the Redskins, as mentioned controlled the clock for most of the game. It didn't help that the Eagles lost some defenders to injury, including "

The thing is, Griffin wasn't even battling a defense that gave him much of an issue in terms of a pass rush. I actually thought the Eagles would get to him frequently, but that wasn't the case.

   "comment":"Darren Sproles was predictably stuffed. That wasn't all for Pederson, as he constantly called ineffective read plays for Wentz, which didn't do anything. Pederson also had a horrible challenge on 1 play in the third quarter, burning a timeout. It was 1 of 2 timeouts Pederson wasted in the second half, costing the Eagles 1 more possession. Despite all of this, as well as a blocked field goal, the Eagles still had a chance to win at the very end. They had 2 possessions deep in Giants territory, but high passes, drops and quarterback pressures ultimately allowed the Giants to win.    Wentz finished 27-of-47 for 364 yards and the 2 picks. Wentz managed to play well in between the 20s after the 2 early turnovers, but he constantly sailed passes over his receivers' heads in the red zone. He also made some dumb mental mistakes. For instance, he took a 5-yard sack by running out of bounds and not throwing the ball away. He also threw short of the third-down marker on third down on a couple of occasions. He was lucky to have just 2 interceptions, as he was nearly picked off a couple more times. He also underthrew "

Mathews saw 15 carries for 60 yards, but was mostly bottled up in the second half. Mathews is only a mediocre runner, and he is not a recommended start in most fantasy formats. If you are desperate, use him as a FLEX. Normally, I would prefer Darren Sproles, who saw 5 carries for 27 yards and caught a touchdown, but he got knocked out in the second half by a pretty dirty Deshazor Everett hit. Sproles was getting ready to return a punt when Everett put a massive blow on him. He got there a split second before the ball and gave Sproles a knock to the head.    There was actually some long snapper drama in this game for the Eagles. Their long snapper, "

   "comment":"Darren Sproles returning from injury. As it turns out, we still don't have a clear answer. This was a tightly contested game that could've gone either way. The Eagles led throughout the entire evening, while the Giants won the yardage battle, 470-286. Yards per play was even, however, with New York edging out Philadelphia, 5.3-5.2, and the Giants had 2 opportunities to take the lead on consecutive 4.h-quarter drives. New York has been 1 of the luckiest teams in the NFL this year, pulling out close victories against bad and mediocre opponents, so it appeared as though it would do that again. That would not be the case, however. On the first drive, guard "

   "comment":"Darren Sproles then fumbled a punt return, setting up a field goal for the Chiefs. Speaking of field goals, Jake Elliott missed a 30-yard kick. The worst mistake came late, when Carson Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a Vinny Curry sack to scramble for a first down. His 4 rushing attempts went for 21 yards.    Smith's sole score went to Travis Kelce, who hauled in 8 of his 10 targets for 103 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was amazing, seemingly hurdling every Philadelphia defender he could find throughout the afternoon. The numbers would've been surprising prior to the game, given that the Eagles defended tight ends so well last year and were able to shut down Jordan Reed in Week 1. However, the Eagles lost several defensive players throughout the afternoon, including Rodney McLeod. Elsewhere in Kansas City's receiving corps, Chris Conley and Tyreek Hill each caught 4 balls for 55 and 43 yards, respectively.    Kansas City's big star, aside from Kelce, was Kareem Hunt once again. Hunt couldn't get anything going in the opening half - 5 carries, 8 yards - but he finished with 81 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 attempts, thanks to a 53-yard burst. Hunt also snatched 3 receptions for 28 receiving yards.    The dark cloud over this victory is Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles. Darren Sproles (10-48) was next, followed by Wendell Smallwood (3-4)."
