Ingram had 51 yards to Thomas' 41, but the YPC discrepancy is misleading because Ingram had the short-yardage work, and thus a few minimal gains.    There was some terrible officiating in this game on both sides. Roman Harper was whistled for a horrible roughing-the-passer call on Chicago's second drive that set up a touchdown. Meanwhile, in the 4.h quarter, Darren Sproles stepped out of bounds on his way to the end zone. This was completely obvious to Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, yet the booth refused to review it. The Bears couldn't challenge because of the NFL's stupid, new touchdown-replay rule.   Sproles, especially early on. Sproles finished with 8 receptions for 43 yards and a score.    "

The Falcons started working the ball to Douglas who would have more success later in the half, but nevertheless kept the chains moving. They didn't have to worry about blowing it in the red zone because a dump pass to Sproles on a screen pass and then going back to Graham for the 21-yard score. I joked on Twitter that Graham's plan was to drop passes on third down to set up the defense. It sure looked that way considering how open he was. Another exchange of punts left the Falcons stuck at their own 1-yard line. At first, the Saints were trying to get the ball back, calling timeout after a quick screen was completed to Jones, who would not play down the stretch after his hamstring flared up. However, Turner rumbled 10 yards around the edge to flip the script and put them on the offensive. After a penalty, slot receiver Harry Douglas ripped up the middle of the field for 46 yards. The big play helped put them in position for a field goal attempt at the gun, but Matt Bryant missed it to leave New Orleans up 10-6 at the half. The Saints felt a similar sting when their first drive of the second half ended in a failed field goal. Robert Meachem turned in a 36-yard reception to get them down the field, but Pierre Thomas was locked up in the backfield and Darren Sproles got nothing on a screen to stop the march.

As great as Brees was, Panthers' safety Sherrod Martin was equally terrible. He was solely responsible for 2 of New Orleans' touchdowns. He took a horrible angle on Chris Ivory's 29-yard scoring scamper, and then blew a coverage when Brees hit Marques Colston on a 43-yard bomb.    Colston found the end zone twice, catching 7 passes for 145 yards. One of his touchdowns was a great, leaping grab, which obviously didn't hurt in his pursuit to land an enormous contract in free agency this offseason.    Brees' other touchdowns went to Jimmy Graham (8-97), Darren Sproles (5-29) and Jed Collins."

   "comment":"Darren Sproles came up gimpy on the play, but was on the field in the second half, so the injury wasn't serious, apparently.    As great as Brees was, Panthers' safety Sherrod Martin was equally terrible. He was solely responsible for 2 of New Orleans' touchdowns. He took a horrible angle on Chris Ivory's 29-yard scoring scamper, and then blew a coverage when Brees hit Marques Colston on a 43-yard bomb.    Colston found the end zone twice, catching 7 passes for 145 yards. One of his touchdowns was a great, leaping grab, which obviously didn't hurt in his pursuit to land an enormous contract in free agency this offseason.    Brees' other touchdowns went to Jimmy Graham (8-97), Darren Sproles (5-29) and Jed Collins."

Wentz managed to play well in between the 20s after the 2 early turnovers, but he constantly sailed passes over his receivers' heads in the red zone. He also made some dumb mental mistakes. For instance, he took a 5-yard sack by running out of bounds and not throwing the ball away. He also threw short of the third-down marker on third down on a couple of occasions.

If there's a silver lining for the Eagles, it's that Wentz finally developed a connection with Zach Ertz. The talented tight end had done nothing all year, but he caught all 8 of his targets for 97 yards, eating the Giants' linebacking corps alive. Ertz missed some action with a minor injury, but he wasn't out long. Matthews (6-88) was next on the receiving chart. Nelson Agholor, meanwhile, dropped some passes and fumbled the ball, but was fortunate enough to recover it.    Sproles once again carried the load for the Eagles. He gained 57 yards on 13 carries, but was stuffed on that aforementioned 4.h-and-1 play. He also nearly scored on a punt return, but barely stepped out of bounds. "

   "comment":"Darren Sproles returning from injury. As it turns out, we still don't have a clear answer. This was a tightly contested game that could've gone either way. The Eagles led throughout the entire evening, while the Giants won the yardage battle, 470-286. Yards per play was even, however, with New York edging out Philadelphia, 5.3-5.2, and the Giants had 2 opportunities to take the lead on consecutive 4.h-quarter drives. New York has been 1 of the luckiest teams in the NFL this year, pulling out close victories against bad and mediocre opponents, so it appeared as though it would do that again. That would not be the case, however. On the first drive, guard Sproles returning from injury. As it turns out, we still don't have a clear answer. This was a tightly contested game that could've gone either way. The Eagles led throughout the entire evening, while the Giants won the yardage battle, 470-286. Yards per play was even, however, with New York edging out Philadelphia, 5.3-5.2, and the Giants had 2 opportunities to take the lead on consecutive 4.h-quarter drives. New York has been 1 of the luckiest teams in the NFL this year, pulling out close victories against bad and mediocre opponents, so it appeared as though it would do that again. That would not be the case, however. On the first drive, guard John Jerry false started on a 4.h-and-1, and the next pass fell incomplete to Sterling Shepard, though Nolan Carroll committed an uncalled pass-interference penalty. The next possession concluded with an Eli Manning interception thrown up for grabs.    Manning had a very mixed performance. He began the game 1-of-6 for only 1 yard and a pick-six in which he didn't see Malcolm Jenkins. Manning caught fire after that, as he seemed to figure out what the Eagles were doing defensively. He engineered some scoring drives, but his hot streak fizzled when he threw his second of 3 picks, as he telegraphed a throw that was snatched by Malcolm Jenkins. Manning finished 38-of-63, 356 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It certainly wasn't a horrible showing, but his first 2 picks were absolute killers and allowed the Eagles to prevail. Manning is a weak spot on the Giants' roster as it stands, but he's not getting much help from his offensive line. That said, the blocking has been better with Justin Pugh on the field.    Despite facing constant double teams, Odell Beckham Jr. saw a whopping 20 targets. He snatched 11 of them for 150 yards. Beckham dropped a pass in the third quarter, but he should've caught a touchdown, as Manning overthrew him in the final frame. Shepard and Victor Cruz were targeted a ton as well, which isn't a surprise considering that Manning threw the ball 63 times. Shepard (7-61) hauled in Manning's sole touchdown, while Cruz caught 8 balls for 84 yards.    The Giants ran better than expected once again, thanks in part to Pugh's return. Paul Perkins and Rashad Jennings combined for 112 rushing yards, as Perkins out-carried Jennings, 15-9, winning the yardage battle as well, 68-44.    Speaking of improved blocking, the Eagles were happy to welcome back Lane Johnson, who had been suspended when the team was 3-1. Philadelphia had gone 2-8 since, as missing its top offensive lineman certainly took its toll. Johnson made a big impact right away, as the Eagles ran behind him very successfully on the opening touchdown drive. I was perplexed that they shied away from that as the evening had progressed, but Johnson's presence allowed Carson Wentz to have better protection. Wentz saw some pressure, but wasn't sacked on a single occasion. Wentz finished 13-of-24 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which occurred when he danced around the pocket forever and then fired carelessly downfield. Wentz made some mistakes - he nearly had a second pick, but the ball was dropped - and had to leave the game for a bit because of a potential concussion, but he had a solid game overall. He was victimized by some drops, of course, while his best play occurred when he somehow ducked underneath 2 pass-rushers and scrambled for a first down. Philadelphia fans have to feel very optimistic about Wentz going forward. Wentz went through a rookie funk after beginning the year ablaze, but it's evident that the potential is there, and he'll have more success as long as Johnson stays on the field. Wentz is now 4-1 with Johnson blocking for him, with wins over the Giants and Steelers.    Sproles also returned, and he had a significant impact. He rushed for 40 yards and a touchdown on 7 carries, and he also caught a pair of passes for 23 receiving yards. "

   "comment":"Darren Sproles then fumbled a punt return, setting up a field goal for the Chiefs. Speaking of field goals, Jake Elliott missed a 30-yard kick. The worst mistake came late, when Carson Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a Vinny Curry sack to scramble for a first down. His 4 rushing attempts went for 21 yards.    Smith's sole score went to Travis Kelce, who hauled in 8 of his 10 targets for 103 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was amazing, seemingly hurdling every Philadelphia defender he could find throughout the afternoon. The numbers would've been surprising prior to the game, given that the Eagles defended tight ends so well last year and were able to shut down Jordan Reed in Week 1. However, the Eagles lost several defensive players throughout the afternoon, including Rodney McLeod. Elsewhere in Kansas City's receiving corps, Chris Conley and Tyreek Hill each caught 4 balls for 55 and 43 yards, respectively.    Kansas City's big star, aside from Kelce, was Kareem Hunt once again. Hunt couldn't get anything going in the opening half - 5 carries, 8 yards - but he finished with 81 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 attempts, thanks to a 53-yard burst. Hunt also snatched 3 receptions for 28 receiving yards.    The dark cloud over this victory is Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles. Darren Sproles (10-48) was next, followed by Wendell Smallwood (3-4)."
