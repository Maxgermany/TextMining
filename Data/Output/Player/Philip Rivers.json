   "comment":"Rivers, coming off a worse injury (ACL) than Jake Delhomme, also put up solid numbers. He was 17-of-27 for 217 yards and 3 scores, including a 44-yard bomb to Chris Chambers.    Keeping with the theme, Antonio Gates, off foot surgery, led the Chargers with 4 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown.    So, can we go 4-for-4? Would Shawne Merriman also have a solid performance despite playing with a shredded knee? As you can tell by Carolina's offensive output, not at all. Merriman rotated in and out of the lineup, and manged only 1 tackle. The Chargers couldn't contain the Panthers, much like they struggled to stop the Charlie Frye-led Seahawks in the preseason. Hey, I have the Broncos winning the division, so even though San Diego lost, the team performed better than I expected them to, given that Rivers and Gates looked sharp.    As for Carolina's skill players, "

   "comment":"Rivers had a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage that fell into the arms of Larry Foote. A few minutes later, a punt hit Eric Weddle in the helmet, allowing Pittsburgh to recover deep in San Diego territory.    While recovering those turnovers was huge, the most important element for the Steelers, at least going forward, was their dynamic pass protection. They surrendered just 1 sack to San Diego, and Ben Roethlisbeger pretty much had a clean pocket all evening.    Speaking of Roethlisberger, I was concerned about his ability to play off a concussion. While my worries were validated early on - he had more punt yardage (25) than passing yardage (24) as of the 2.minute warning in the second quarter - he finished strong, going 17-of-26 for 181 yards and a score. And in the third quarter alone, Big Ben converted a third-and-seven, third-and-11, third-and-eight and a third-and-three.    Willie Parker stole the show in this contest, rushing for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns on 27 attempts. Hines Ward paced the team with 4 receptions and 70 yards.    While Pittsburgh ran the ball extremely well, the Chargers could do nothing on the ground, managing 15 yards on 12 attempts. Darren Sproles was effective aerially, catching 5 balls for 91 yards and a score. Philip Rivers was 21-of-35 for 308 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick.    The Steelers will match up with the Ravens in the AFC Championship. If I'm Mike Tomlin, I sneak Walt Coleman into Heinz Field, knock out the official slated to call the game, stuff him into a closet and suggest that Coleman referee the contest in the other zebra's absence.

   "comment":"Rivers, and poor, predictable play-calling down at the goal line. The Cowboys had 1st-and-goal on San Diego's 4-yard line in the second quarter. Instead of calling a play-action fake or a bootleg, offensive coordinator Jason Garrett gave Marion Barber 4 consecutive carries. Barber ran for 3, 0, 0 and 0 yards, and Dallas turned it over on downs. Apparently, Jerry Jones' desire to see Barber receive more carries came to fruition. Barber had a 10-yard gain on a draw and 13 other ineffective runs for 37 yards. As I've been saying, Barber should have gotten a week or 2 of rest earlier so his quad injury could heal. Instead, the team keeps feeding the ball to a runner who isn't anywhere near 100 percent. Meanwhile, Felix Jones was much more effective, gaining 51 yards on 10 attempts. Tashard Choice for some reason received only 2 carries, which he transformed into 11 yards.    Solid numbers for both of Snowmo's receivers. Roy Williams had 4 grabs for 74 yards, while Miles Austin-Jones had 6 catches for 71 yards and a score. Jason Witten had 4 grabs for just 49 yards.    Philip Rivers was 21-of-32 for 272 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Rivers made several completions to "

San Diego, like Indianapolis on Saturday night, looked completely out of synch after taking numerous weeks off. But unlike the Ravens, the Jets didn't debaclize themselves with careless fumbles and dumb penalties, and give the game away.

I'll have those in my    It's a shame that San Diego's once-promising season has to end like this; the Chargers actually outgained the Jets, 344-262, but were simply plagued by all of those errors and missed field goals. New York didn't even get its initial first down until 7 minutes into the second quarter. Having said that, the Jets deserve a lot of credit for sticking to their game plan. Even though they fell behind early, they kept on running the ball with Shonn Greene and Thomas Jones. Greene once again had more rushes (23) than Jones (14), and also outgained the veteran, 128-53. Greene's 53-yard score in the 4.h quarter sealed the victory for New York.    Mark Sanchez made a couple questionable throws in this contest and looked rattled early on, but later made enough third-down conversions to keep Rivers off the field. Sanchez finished 12-of-23 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.   "

Hester didn't realize that it was a lateral, and just stood around with his hands on his hips. The Patriots were much more aware; 3 players pounced on the ball. 3. The Chargers had a chance to kick a game-tying, 45-yard field goal at the end of the game. A false start, however, moved the ball back 5 yards. Backup kicker Kris Brown doinked it off the right upright. San Diego also hurt itself with numerous drops - at least a half dozen.

   "comment":"Rivers and back-to-back infractions for 12 men on the field killed San Diego. At 6-6, the Chargers have their work cut out for them. They're no longer in control of their own destiny.    Credit has to be awarded to the Raiders though, as they played a terrific game after not showing up at all against the Dolphins last week. Oakland rammed the ball down San Diego's throat, as Darren McFadden (19-97, TD) and Michael Bush (23-95, TD) couldn't be tackled.    Jason Campbell went 10-of-16 for 117 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a minor injury and was replaced by Kyle Boller in the second half. Fortunately for the Raiders, Campbell reentered the game shortly afterward.    The Chargers, meanwhile, couldn't do anything on the ground despite the fact Oakland's defense ranked 26th against the rush entering the weekend. San Diego didn't get many attempts to run the ball, but Mike Tolbert still had only 16 yards on 7 carries. Ryan Mathews did not play.    Rivers went 23-of-39 for 280 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. As indicated, he was erratic all afternoon, though it didn't help that his offensive line couldn't keep the Raiders out of the backfield; Oakland sacked Rivers 4 times.   "

   "comment":"Rivers tossed a bomb to Vincent Jackson. After beating Shaun Smith and safety Yeremiah Bell, Jackson made a diving catch around the 10-yard line, got up and ran into the end zone for a 55-yard score. They connected again for another long reception on the next drive that set up a field goal.    In the second quarter, the Dolphins were set up with great field position, but had to settle for a field goal. The reason is because the Miami offensive line stinks, specifically left guard Richie Incognito and right tackle Marc Colombo. Incognito made a mistake in blitz pickup to let Moore get sacked on a rush through Incognito's gap. Colombo gave up a sack to Larry English, who has had made the case for being a first-round bust. English's sack was the big play that forced the field goal. English also recorded his second sack of the season. It was a coverage sack when Moore stepped up in the pocket next to English, and he took a couple steps to the quarterback away from left tackle Jake Long.    Rivers led a field goal drive just before halftime, and to start the second half, he contributed to a touchdown possession that gave San Diego a 20-10 lead. A 42-yard screen pass to "

Throughout the afternoon, he just stood there bundled up in his puffy coat looking like a moron the whole time. It's sickening that he hasn't been fired yet. Rivers sucks. He's a cocky douche bag who never takes any of the blame for himself. He's physically gifted and is able to make pretty throws when he's not under pressure, but when the game is on the line, he chokes like a female porn star. Whether it's throwing into double coverage or sailing a pass into an opposing player's arms when trying to throw the ball away, Rivers has a knack for doing the perfect stupid thing when his team needs him most. This Charger team is done. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms discussed San Diego still being alive in the AFC West race, but that's just dumb. San Diego is just too dumb and too poorly coached to make any sort of run.    Let's get through these numbers before I have an aneurysm. Rivers went 21-of-31 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Despite all the injuries to the offensive line going into this contest, Rivers wasn't under pressure all that much.

   "comment":"Rivers moved the Chargers down the field and threw a strike to Antonio Gates for a 6-yard score. Late in the second quarter, Royal made up for it with a big punt return across midfield. Tebow moved the ball down the field with a 2 good passes. He finished the drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker. In the third quarter, the teams traded field goals. Ryan Mathews broke off a 39-yard run on a pitch around the edge. San Diego couldn't finish the drive as Nick Novak missed a field goal. Denver had a promising drive of its own go for nothing. Tebow ran for a first down on a critical third down but a holding call canceled it out. He then threw a good deep pass to Decker just in front of the end zone, but Chargers defensive back Paul Oliver got away with a pass interference that caused an incompletion. On their next drive, Tebow hooked up with Decker for a 39-yard gain. It was a good pass and he made a superb catch. A few plays later, Tebow moved the ball inside the Chargers 20 with a 23-yard pass to Donate Rosario. The San Diego defense shored up and forced Denver into a game-tying field goal. The Broncos' defense came up with a clutch stop of the Chargers. A sack by Elvis Dumervil was the key play to kill the drive for San Diego. In overtime, Denver got the ball and got close to midfield before Tebow was stopped on a third-and-short run. The Chargers moved the ball into Broncos' territory and lined up for a 53-yard attempt. Denver blocked a field goal, but their head coach John Fox had called a time out, and the San Diego offensive line heard the whistle, so the Broncos busted through and blocked the kick easily. It didn't matter as Nick Novak missed the field goal on the actual play. Denver got great field position at their 43-yard line and finished the game in short order. Tebow ran for 16 yards on 2 carries and Willis McGahee ran up the middle for 24 yards. Broncos kicker Matt Prater made a 37-yard field goal to eke out another win for Denver. All game, San Diego's pass rush was pathetic. Tebow had all day to throw the ball on many pass plays. The Chargers' offensive line also struggled with the Broncos edge rushers. Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 3 sacks on the afternoon. Rivers was only 19-of-36 for 188 yards and 1 touchdown. Mathews ran for 137 yards on 22 carries. Gates had 6 catches for 50 yards and a score. Denver's play-calling is at best a work in progress. They don't mix in enough play-action passing. San Diego was selling out to stop the run and at the same time they couldn't get any pass rush. Tebow threw some good deep balls, and he is better at throwing deep than at precision passing in the short to intermediate part of the field. Tebow finished the game 9-of-18 for 143 yards and 1 touchdown. He also ran for 67 yards on 22 carries. McGahee had a good game with 117 yards on 23 carries.   "

   "comment":"Rivers has all of his receivers back and heats up in December, but Baltimore's stop unit looked terrible. It couldn't get any sort of pressure on the quarterback or cover anyone downfield. Tackling was also a big issue. Even Ray Lewis whiffed a couple of times.    Rivers went 17-of-23 for 270 yards and a touchdown. He hit his wideouts repeatedly for long gains downfield. Thanks to a retooled offensive line featuring Jared Gaither, he wasn't even sacked; Rivers was brought down once, but that was negated by a rare illegal slap penalty. Perhaps the Ravens should have tried tackling instead of hitting like little girls.    San Diego's defense, meanwhile, was outstanding. It took 2 interceptions from "

   "comment":"Rivers tossed a lazy interception after the other. If that wasn't bad enough, Cassel followed everything up with 2 interceptions late in the first half. One was way behind Tony Moeaki and returned for 6 by emerging inside linebacker Donald Butler. The other was tipped off the hands of Dexter McCluster. The crowd was booing fiercely beforehand, but they barely made a sound after that last 1. It was just sad at that point. Cassel finished 24-of-42 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Cassel's yardage numbers are bogus; he was able to compile them when the Chargers were playing prevent in the second half. Kansas City needs to move on from Cassel after this season. The team cannot bench him now, unfortunately, because it doesn't have anyone behind him.    Jamaal Charles had a nice fantasy day, rushing for 92 yards on just 17 carries, catching 3 balls for 23 more yards and scoring a pair of touchdowns. Unfortunately, those 2 aforementioned fumbles really cost his team.    Dwayne Bowe caught 7 balls for 108 yards. He was the only Chief with more than 4 receptions and 50 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Chargers surprised many by giving Jackie Battle and LeRon McClain carries instead of Ryan Mathews on their opening drive. Mathews fumbled the ball inside the opposing 5-yard line last week, so this was apparently punishment for that. Mathews was cheated out of a rushing touchdown when Battle (15-39, TD) scored, but Mathews had way more yardage (61 yards on 14 carries). Mathews is the best runner on the roster though, so don't expect this Battle charade to last much longer. In fact, he's a nice buy-low target this week.    Philip Rivers didn't have to do much because he had a lead the entire afternoon. He threw just 5 incompletions, going 18-of-23 for 209 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Not included in those numbers was a drawn pass interference to "

He could have easily run into the end zone had he came up with the grab, and that might have been the game-winning score because the Browns struggled to move the chains in the second half. Meachem didn't catch a single pass, further proving that he's a colossal waste of money - something that was incredibly obvious when the signing was made.    Rivers went 18-of-34 for 154 yards. Meachem screwed up on that 1 play, but Rivers made mistakes of his own. He made some poor decisions with some of his throws and was lucky he wasn't picked off a couple of times, though the wind and rain didn't help.

   "comment":"Rivers, who loves Norv Turner and obviously didn't want to hear that his head coach was going to be fired, told his squad that this was their chance to make history. And so history was made. The Chargers dominated this game. They had Pittsburgh outgained 226-153 when the score was 27-3. The Steelers continuously screwed up. For example... - They were offside multiple times on 1 San Diego scoring drive. - Mike Wallace had a drop for what would have been a big completion, prompting the crowd to boo him. Antonio Brown then had a deep pass fall through his hands. - The defense surrendered a converted first down on a 3rd-and-13 run when the Chargers were just trying to get into better field goal position. - San Diego scored a defensive touchdown when Ben Roethlisberger carelessly threw a lateral pass that doinked off a player's rear end.    The Steelers lost by only 10 points, but don't be fooled by that. As mentioned, the score was 27-3 at 1 point, but Pittsburgh padded its stats with meaningless junk-time numbers. For example, Roethlisberger finished 22-of-42 for 285 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 9-of-20 for 105 yards, no scores and no picks at halftime. Likewise, Wallce (7-112, 2 TDs) and Brown (4-35, TD) both look good in the box score, but killed their team with the aforementioned drops.    Other Steelers of note: Heath Miller (5-66) had an average statistical performance, but it could have been much better because he fell inches short of the goal line in the 4.h quarter. Jonathan Dwyer rushed for 32 yards on just 8 carries. Plaxico Burress caught an 18-yard pass on a 3rd-and-12. This was his first reception as a Steeler since the 2004 AFC Championship.    Rivers, meanwhile, had a solid performance especially in the second half. He finished 21-of-41 for 200 yards and 3 touchdowns, with just 5 incompletions and 2 scores coming after intermission.    Two of Rivers' touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Rivers was then whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty, which gave San Diego a second-and-goal at the 25-yard line. The Chargers made some other mistakes throughout the afternoon, including a hold as the team was trying to run out the clock late in the 4.h quarter. However, no error was worse than a dropped interception on Tennessee's final drive. The ball bounced off Delanie Walker and into the arms of a San Diego defender, who let a potential pick fall out of his hands. Locker found Hunter a few plays later for the decisive touchdown. I'm also not sure why the Titans didn't have any safety help on the Hunter score, though it should be noted that Hunter pushed off. The officials could've called offensive pass interference, but kept all yellow flags in their pockets.    It's remarkable San Diego lost this contest considering that Philip Rivers misfired on just 4 attempts. He went 20-of-24 for 184 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had a second score nullified by offensive pass interference. Rivers couldn't really look downfield in the second half because 2 of his starting linemen - "

   "comment":"Rivers' first interception. Pryor ultimately completed his first 10 passes for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns. Not included in this was a 19-yard completion to Denarius Moore in which he rolled out and found his wideout downfield. Pryor later had a similar play for 20 yards to Brice Butler to convert a crucial third-and-14 in the final quarter. Pryor went on to finish 18-of-23 for 221 yards and the pair of scores to go along with 11 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. He also should've thrown a third touchdown, but Moore stepped out of bounds prior to catching the ball. Pryor's only real blemish was when he fumbled the ball trying to desperately do something while wrapped up in a sack. He's fortunate that 1 of his teammates recovered the ball.    As mentioned, Moore (5-84) and Streater (3-56) caught the touchdowns. Marcel Reece was the only Raider with more than 2 receptions. He had 3 catches for 25 receiving yards to go along with 32 rushing yards on 7 carries. Rashad Jennings (10-41) handled the workload early on, but he was knocked out of the game with a hamstring.    Philip Rivers, meanwhile, completed 36-of-49 passes for 411 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, the turnovers absolutely killed the team. Rivers tossed 3 interceptions, though 1 occurred at the end of the contest. A red-hot Rivers was effortlessly leading San Diego down the field to draw within 1 possession, but "

Thomas continued to dominate early in the second half as he took a screen pass 34 yards for his third touchdown of the game. San Diego's Tourek Williams came through with a huge play as he beat left tackle Chris Clark on a speed rush to get a blindside strip-sack that was recovered by Donald Butler at the Broncos 11-yard line.

A potential touchdown turned into a field goal. - Eric Weddle foolishly hit Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback "

   "comment":"Rivers looked terrible, and it didn't appear as though Detroit's offense could be stopped. The Lions were shut down, however, as Matthew Stafford sucked in the second half. If he doesn't be careful, he's going to transform into Jay Cutler in the near future. There are just too many #yolo throws from him. He's not on a Cutler level yet, but he might be getting there.    This game looked like the Lions were going to roll to victory early after taking a quick 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter, but then Melvin Ingram caused an interception with a nasty hit on Matthew Stafford. The Chargers preceded to go on a 30-0 run before Detroit made it look a bit closer with a late touchdown that finished out the game with a 33-28 San Diego win.    The Lions' offense looked unstoppable early on; rookie running back Ameer Abdullah ran for a 24-yard touchdown in a fashion that made Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle look like he was the rookie in the open field. Abdullah appeared to have an extra gear in in all aspects of the game as he finished with 7 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, 4 receptions on 4 targets for 44 yards and 105 yards on 3 kickoff returns. Maybe the Lions should have given him Joique Bell's 6 carries, which resulted in 14 yards.    Turnovers were a big part of this game as both Philip Rivers and Matthew Stafford threw a pair of interceptions, and rookie Melvin Gordon lost a fumble."

A stiff arm and a nasty cut into the middle of the field plus speed that a 30-year-old man of his size shouldn't have, and there was his second touchdown of the game. He went on to have a couple more nice runs and also got vultured at the goal line by Zach Line for what should have been his third touchdown of the game, but the Vikings had built too large a lead, and they rested him for part of the 4.h quarter. Feel good about that fantasy pick.    Teddy Bridgewater on the other hand, didn't look sharp early, as the Vikings went to the air instead of pounding the ball on the ground with Peterson. But as soon as the running game got going, Bridgewater had a much easier time with a better pocket to work from. He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant. He was hurried and sacked all game, while his offensive line limped off the field seemingly every other play. "

   "comment":"Rivers on the third play of the game, and returned it to the 1-yard line, where Latavius Murray layed-up the easy goal-line touchdown. It was all down hill from there for the Chargers, well, unless you count garbage time, which you do in fantasy!    Derek Carr was on point in this 1. making perfect pass after perfect pass. This was the Carr we saw in Weeks 2 and 3. With the score still within reach, Carr hit Clive Walford with a pretty over-the-shoulder pass for a 23-yard touchdown to make it 17-3 Raiders. It was then on.    Amari Cooper was the next to get in on the fun, as he caught a pass on a crossing route and then went on to make multiple defenders miss on his way to a 51-yard touchdown. San Diego had been holding No. 1 receivers down for just 50 receiving yards a game coming into Sunday, but Cooper ended up with 5 receptions on 6 targets for 133 yards and that touchdown. He hadn't topped 49 yards receiving in his last 2 games, so it was nice to see him take a good pass defense to school this week.    Michael Crabtree was next in line for a touchdown, when he caught a 25-yarder from Carr in the third quarter to put the Raiders up 37-6. The blowout had arrived. That is, until the 4.h quarter.    Carr finished the day with 24-of-31 attempts for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns. That 77.4 percent completion rate was his highest of the season and is especially nice considering the Chargers were allowing a 61 percent completion rate coming into the game. This performance puts him right back up in the conversation of up-and-coming quarterbacks; now, if he can just find some consistency.    The Raiders let off the gas, and Philip Rivers gave it a run, making 3 touchdown passes in the last quarter. There never really was much of a chance San Diego would be able to come back all the way, but there were a couple times that it felt like it was in the realm of possibility.    After an ugly start, Rivers finished the game having gone 38-of-58 for 336 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. This wasn't a game he'll remember fondly, but he has now topped 300 yards in 5-of-7 games, and has multiple touchdown passes in 6-of-7.    "

It was dropped, and San Diego was able to tie the game with about 2 minutes remaining in regulation. Unfortunately for him, his defense betrayed him and couldn't send the game into overtime.    I mentioned that Allen was knocked out. It was a shame for his fantasy owners, as it appeared as though he was on pace for a solid performance. He caught all 5 of his targets for 35 yards and a touchdown in less than a half of action. Rivers' other scores both went to Malcom Floyd (4-92)."

Dunlap was so bad that he was even worse than his replacements, prompting the Chargers to bench him. Tamba Hali and Justin Houston exposed the horrible blocking, as Rivers was constantly under pressure. Here's a sequence at the beginning of the second half: First drive: Dunlap was flagged for a hold, then Rivers took a sack. Second drive: Dunlap surrendered a sack to Hali, then Rivers missed a wide-open Gates for a potential touchdown. Third drive: Rivers tossed a pick-six on a play in which he effectively just handed the ball to Houston because he was under so much pressure. Fourth drive: Never happened because some idiot named "

   "comment":"Rivers, Malcom Floyd and Antonio Gates - exit early to a standing ovation from a crowd that was comprised of a 50-50 mix of Chargers and Dolphins fans. It was a nice moment. If you're looking at this glass-half-empty, the Chargers' insistance on focusing on the past may have cost them greatly in the future. By winning, they lost out on the opportunity to draft Laremy Tunsil, the top left tackle in this upcoming class. Considering San Diego's glaring holes on the front, the team desperately needed Tunsil, but now it appears as though the Titans will secure him, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    Philip Rivers had an easy time delivering the ball to his open wideouts. He misfired just 10 times, going 26-of-36 for 311 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Rivers had a few poor throws. He was nearly picked in the end zone and underthrew an open Floyd for a score. One of Rivers' interceptions was heaved into triple coverage. "

   "comment":"Rivers off the field, as their pass rush was absent without Justin Houston. Alex Smith, however, made some incredible throws during the comeback and overtime after misfiring often early, converting some key third and 4.h downs. Smith finished 34-of-48 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception.    While Smith will get all the acclaim, Kansas City's best offensive player was Spencer Ware. Yes, Spencer Ware! Replacing the injured Jamaal Charles, Ware was amazing. He rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown on only 11 carries, but what he did in the passing game provided much more of an impact. He caught 7 passes for a whopping 129 receiving yards. Ware was like a bull, seemingly impossible to bring down. He's going to be a big producer this year, perhaps even when Charles is healthy enough to play.    As for Smith's downfield options, Travis Kelce logged 6 catches for 74 yards, including a big 4.h-down conversion in the final quarter. Jeremy Maclin, meanwhile, hauled in 5 balls for 63 yards and a score. Maclin took a crushing helmet-to-helmet hit at the end of regulation and had trouble getting up afterward, but was able to re-take the field after being cleared for a concussion.    Going back to the Chargers, Rivers' stat lines were significantly different pre- and post-Allen. Rivers, in the first half, was 16-of-20 for 151 yards and a touchdown. He was unstoppable, as he had all the time in the world. Without Allen, however, he was 9-of-16 for 82 yards. Considering this dichotomy, it's fair to say that San Diego would've held on for the victory had Allen remained on the field.    With Allen presumably done for the season, Rivers will target "

   "comment":"Rivers-to-Tyrell Williams slants. The Colts were able to take over, however, and because of a concussion Brandon Flowers sustained, they scored on a 63-yard touchdown to T.Y. Hilton, who blew by 2 San Diego defenders to score a 63-yard, go-ahead touchdown. The Chargers still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Hunter Henry fumbled near midfield, giving Indianapolis its first victory. Though the Colts prevailed, it didn't seem like they should have won. They made numerous mistakes throughout the afternoon. Frank Gore started by dropping a pass. Dwayne Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, Phillip Dorsett was a disappointment, catching 3 passes for 27 yards. Jack Doyle (6-65) and Dwayne Allen (3-35) picked up the slack with Donte Moncrief being out. Allen, as mentioned, dropped a touchdown.    Right after Allen missed out on a score, Frank Gore took advantage with an end zone trip of his own. He gained 82 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. Robert Turbin (4-9) vultured a score. The Colts may have run the ball better had guard Jack Mewhort not sustained an injury in the second half.    The Chargers gave this game away at the end, but they also made some mistakes earlier in the afternoon. An unsportsmanlike penalty allowed the Colts to turn an early field goal into a touchdown. Philip Rivers missed an open Dexter McCluster for a score."

The Chargers had another chance to score off their defense, but Casey Hayward dropped a potential interception returned for a touchdown of his own. San Diego had more bad luck following intermission, as another Rivers pass was tipped - this time by Travis Benjamin - and that set up a Devontae Booker touchdown."

The Chargers are a good team, and if it weren't for games they gave away at the beginning of the season, they could be a dangerous team in January.    Early in the first quarter, a questionable holding call took an interception away from Houston's A.J. Bouye. The punters were getting a lot of use before the second quarter when the Texans got moving thanks to a 16-yard run by Akeem Hunt. Osweiler dropped in a 33-yard pass to Will Fuller (4-60), and the Texans' quarterback used his big frame to leap over the top for a 1.yard touchdown. The Chargers tied it up right away though, as Rivers and Dontrelle Inman burned safety Quintin Demps on a double move for a 52-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Rivers had a mixed performance in his final game of the 2016 season. He went 22-of-38 for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 picks. However, the stats are a little misleading. One of Rivers' touchdown drives came with the Chiefs already up 17 points, so it was essentially garbage-time numbers. Still, Rivers did make some nice throws on the day. With an upgraded offensive line, he could be a top-10 quarterback once again. The major issue with Rivers was his decision-making on his picks. He threw into double coverage far too often, and while the ball placement was decent, he needed to be better about throwing to open receivers. Frankly, he should have thrown the ball out of bounds in the end zone on the "

   "comment":"Rivers 3 times, and it nearly had a 4.h interception that was overturned by replay review. Rivers underthrew the ball on his first interception. He forced his second pick into double coverage, and it allowed the Chiefs to score a quick touchdown. Rivers' next pick occurred because he stared down his receiver. Rivers, who has poor pass protection, struggled in the backfield once again. The Chargers really need to improve their blocking, as Rivers never had a chance. He could've been more careful with the football, but I don't know how much more differently this game could've gone for the undermanned Chargers. Rivers was held to 20-of-40 passing for 237 yards and the 3 interceptions. Some of his yardage came on the final drive when the Chiefs moved to a prevent defense because they were up a pair of touchdowns with just 2 minutes remaining.    The other primary storyline concerning this game was the poor tackling by the Chargers. They allowed the Chiefs to pick up chunks of yardage, and they're lucky that they weren't trailing by 20-plus points throughout the afternoon. Kansas City couldn't get out of its own way, as the team was constantly flagged for careless penalties. Most of this occurred on offense, but "

He also had an offensive touchdown on his only reception, a 42-yarder. However, this occurred late in the game when it looked like Denver's defense stopped trying. Henry was the only player to record more receiving yardage than Benjamin, hauling in 4 balls for 73 yards. As referenced earlier, he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. "

   "comment":"Rivers and Melvn Gordon, it would've made sense to have the offense on the field on a snap in New England territory. Instead, head coach Anthony Lynn called for a 51-yard field goal with a kicker he tried to replace this week. Yes, this actually happened. The Chargers are stupid. Very stupid.    The Patriots emerged from this game victorious, but they are still obviously a work in progress. For the second time this season, their opponent had a chance to have a late comeback in the 4.h quarter. New England's defense bent but didn't break, and that's how the team won.    Instead of utilizing a traditional running attack, the Patriots opted to use their backs mostly as receivers. Tom Brady threw a great deal of short passes to the receiving backs for the team, and that, in effect, was the Patriots' rush offense. Both Rex Burkhead (7-68) and James White (5-85) had big days as receivers, and they were Brady's favorite targets for most of the game. Burkhead looked particularly good, as his elusive ability was on display and he was able to get a great deal of yards after the catch. Burkhead is worth a speculative add if you need a depth running back. Meanwhile, in terms of actual carries, the Patriots split the carries 4 ways. The aforementioned Burkhead and White only saw a combined 5 carries, so that left most of the workload for Dion Lewis and Mike Gillislee. Lewis was used as the primary running back and showed some of the ability that made him a dangerous weapon 2 years ago. He was able to make men miss at the line of scrimmage and turn gains that should have been gone nowhere into 4.to-five-yard gains. Lewis took 15 carries for 44 yards and also handled most of the goal-line work, a trend that has continued since Gillislee fumbled a couple of weeks ago. Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit Chris Hogan down the field for a touchdown. He nearly was able to get the ball to Hogan, but the more impressive thing is that Brady threw the ball 60 yards in the air with good accuracy. Brady's other excellent throw came on the final offensive drive of the game. On a second-and-20, he lofted a perfect ball over a linebacker to Rob Gronkowski to get the first down. That allowed the Patriots to run more time off the clock and seal the win. Overall, Brady finished 32-of-47 for 333 yards and a touchdown. He has been carrying the Patriots so far this season and is currently 1 of the leaders of the MVP race.    Aside from the running backs, Brady's top receivers were Gronkowski (5-57, 1 TD) and Hogan (5-60). Gronkowski didn't make a lot of catches, but he had the touchdown catch and made the big play on the final drive when it counted. He is still the best tight end in football and should have some big performances as the year goes along. Meanwhile, Hogan made a nice catch over the middle of the field and continued to operate as the team's top deep threat. Elsewhere, Brandin Cooks (5-26) had a decent performance. He was able to find open space in the first half, but he had to deal with Casey Hayward for some of the contest.    For the Chargers, this was a strong showing. While they were unable to ultimately win the contest, their defense played very well, and they had a chance to beat the Patriots late in the 4.h quarter. Philip Rivers did as much as he could to help the Chargers win. Rivers was his usual solid self, and showed great accuracy during the contest. His ability to hit receivers on out routes to the sideline was very strong, and that allowed him to methodically move the ball down the field. At the same time, Rivers was forced to throw mostly short passes against the Patriots, as the team did well to protect against the deep ball. As a result, the Chargers ended up with a lot of third-and-shorts, but they couldn't convert them. Part of this was due to Rivers' inability to find open receivers in these situations, and some of it was due to Matt Patricia's ability to call the right plays at the right time. Overall, Rivers went 17-of-30 for 212 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a solid game, but he was unable to lead the team to victory at the end of the day. He had a chance on the final drive, but he was killed by a lack of timeouts and a key drop.    Rivers' top receivers during the contest were "

Bouye ran toward the end zone and nearly scored. After a couple of runs, the Jaguars tried a field goal, which was blocked. Except, Josh Lambo, who was cut by the Chargers in the summer in favor of Younghoe Koo, still somehow made the kick anyway. This gave Jacksonville its 6.h victory of the season.    Rivers' interception wasn't the Chargers' only stupid sequence. They allowed a touchdown on a fake punt in the opening half, and before you say that any team could've done that, Jacksonville scored on the same exact play it ran versus the Ravens in London back in Week 3. Of course, the inept Charger coaches didn't recognize this, and they couldn't put their players in a position to stop it. Another huge mistake was "

Allen then caught a 2-yard touchdown pass to put up Los Angeles 24-7. The Chargers added a field goal before Melvin Gordon took off on a 10-yard touchdown run. Peterman was pressured again and threw his fifth interception of the first half. In the third quarter, the Chargers added a field goal, and Taylor replaced Peterman. McCoy ripped off some yards, and the Bills turned it into a 50-yard field goal. At the end of the third quarter, Joey Bosa beat the right tackle to get a strip-sack. Melvin Ingram scooped up loose ball and ran it 38 yards for a touchdown. Taylor led a touchdown drive, throwing a corner route to McCoy for a 12-yard touchdown.    Rivers completed 20-of-32 passes for 251 yards and 2 touchdowns. Allen has 12 receptions for 159 yards and 2 scores.    Gordon totaled 80 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown.

McCoy was the lone bright spot for the Bills, totaling 114 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown catch.    The Chargers' defense got an excellent game from their pass-rushing tandem of Ingram and Bosa.
