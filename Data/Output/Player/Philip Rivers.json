   "comment":"Philip Rivers had a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage that fell into the arms of Larry Foote. A few minutes later, a punt hit Eric Weddle in the helmet, allowing Pittsburgh to recover deep in San Diego territory.    While recovering those turnovers was huge, the most important element for the Steelers, at least going forward, was their dynamic pass protection. They surrendered just 1 sack to San Diego, and Ben Roethlisbeger pretty much had a clean pocket all evening.    Speaking of Roethlisberger, I was concerned about his ability to play off a concussion. While my worries were validated early on - he had more punt yardage (25) than passing yardage (24) as of the 2.minute warning in the second quarter - he finished strong, going 17-of-26 for 181 yards and a score. And in the third quarter alone, Big Ben converted a third-and-seven, third-and-11, third-and-eight and a third-and-three.    Willie Parker stole the show in this contest, rushing for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns on 27 attempts. Hines Ward paced the team with 4 receptions and 70 yards.    While Pittsburgh ran the ball extremely well, the Chargers could do nothing on the ground, managing 15 yards on 12 attempts. Darren Sproles was effective aerially, catching 5 balls for 91 yards and a score. Philip Rivers was 21-of-35 for 308 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick.    The Steelers will match up with the Ravens in the AFC Championship. If I'm Mike Tomlin, I sneak Walt Coleman into Heinz Field, knock out the official slated to call the game, stuff him into a closet and suggest that Coleman referee the contest in the other zebra's absence.

The Chargers had a chance to kick a game-tying, 45-yard field goal at the end of the game. A false start, however, moved the ball back 5 yards.

They're no longer in control of their own destiny.    Credit has to be awarded to the Raiders though, as they played a terrific game after not showing up at all against the Dolphins last week. Oakland rammed the ball down San Diego's throat, as Darren McFadden (19-97, TD) and Michael Bush (23-95, TD) couldn't be tackled.    Jason Campbell went 10-of-16 for 117 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a minor injury and was replaced by Kyle Boller in the second half. Fortunately for the Raiders, Campbell reentered the game shortly afterward.    The Chargers, meanwhile, couldn't do anything on the ground despite the fact Oakland's defense ranked 26th against the rush entering the weekend. San Diego didn't get many attempts to run the ball, but Mike Tolbert still had only 16 yards on 7 carries. Ryan Mathews did not play.

   "comment":"Philip Rivers tossed a bomb to Vincent Jackson.Rivers tossed a bomb to Vincent Jackson. After beating Shaun Smith and safety Yeremiah Bell, Jackson made a diving catch around the 10-yard line, got up and ran into the end zone for a 55-yard score. They connected again for another long reception on the next drive that set up a field goal.    In the second quarter, the Dolphins were set up with great field position, but had to settle for a field goal. The reason is because the Miami offensive line stinks, specifically left guard Richie Incognito and right tackle Marc Colombo. Incognito made a mistake in blitz pickup to let Moore get sacked on a rush through Incognito's gap. Colombo gave up a sack to Larry English, who has had made the case for being a first-round bust. English's sack was the big play that forced the field goal. English also recorded his second sack of the season. It was a coverage sack when Moore stepped up in the pocket next to English, and he took a couple steps to the quarterback away from left tackle Jake Long.    Rivers led a field goal drive just before halftime, and to start the second half, he contributed to a touchdown possession that gave San Diego a 20-10 lead. A 42-yard screen pass to "

He continuously had his punter kick to Devin Hester. He wasted timeouts in the second half. Throughout the afternoon, he just stood there bundled up in his puffy coat looking like a moron the whole time. It's sickening that he hasn't been fired yet. Rivers sucks. He's a cocky douche bag who never takes any of the blame for himself. He's physically gifted and is able to make pretty throws when he's not under pressure, but when the game is on the line, he chokes like a female porn star. Whether it's throwing into double coverage or sailing a pass into an opposing player's arms when trying to throw the ball away, Rivers has a knack for doing the perfect stupid thing when his team needs him most. This Charger team is done. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms discussed San Diego still being alive in the AFC West race, but that's just dumb. San Diego is just too dumb and too poorly coached to make any sort of run.    Let's get through these numbers before I have an aneurysm. Rivers went 21-of-31 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Despite all the injuries to the offensive line going into this contest, Rivers wasn't under pressure all that much.

Even Rivers has all of his receivers back and heats up in December, but Baltimore's stop unit looked terrible. It couldn't get any sort of pressure on the quarterback or cover anyone downfield. Tackling was also a big issue. Even Ray Lewis whiffed a couple of times.    Rivers went 17-of-23 for 270 yards and a touchdown. He hit his wideouts repeatedly for long gains downfield. Thanks to a retooled offensive line featuring Jared Gaither, he wasn't even sacked; Rivers was brought down once, but that was negated by a rare illegal slap penalty. Perhaps the Ravens should have tried tackling instead of hitting like little girls.    San Diego's defense, meanwhile, was outstanding. It took 2 interceptions from "

One was way behind Tony Moeaki and returned for 6 by emerging inside linebacker Donald Butler. The other was tipped off the hands of Dexter McCluster. The crowd was booing fiercely beforehand, but they barely made a sound after that last 1. It was just sad at that point. Cassel finished 24-of-42 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Cassel's yardage numbers are bogus; he was able to compile them when the Chargers were playing prevent in the second half. Kansas City needs to move on from Cassel after this season. The team cannot bench him now, unfortunately, because it doesn't have anyone behind him.    Jamaal Charles had a nice fantasy day, rushing for 92 yards on just 17 carries, catching 3 balls for 23 more yards and scoring a pair of touchdowns. Unfortunately, those 2 aforementioned fumbles really cost his team.    Dwayne Bowe caught 7 balls for 108 yards. He was the only Chief with more than 4 receptions and 50 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the Chargers surprised many by giving Jackie Battle and LeRon McClain carries instead of Ryan Mathews on their opening drive. Mathews fumbled the ball inside the opposing 5-yard line last week, so this was apparently punishment for that. Mathews was cheated out of a rushing touchdown when Battle (15-39, TD) scored, but Mathews had way more yardage (61 yards on 14 carries). Mathews is the best runner on the roster though, so don't expect this Battle charade to last much longer. In fact, he's a nice buy-low target this week.    Philip Rivers didn't have to do much because he had a lead the entire afternoon. He threw just 5 incompletions, going 18-of-23 for 209 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick.

Meachem didn't catch a single pass, further proving that he's a colossal waste of money - something that was incredibly obvious when the signing was made.    Rivers went 18-of-34 for 154 yards. Meachem screwed up on that 1 play, but Rivers made mistakes of his own. He made some poor decisions with some of his throws and was lucky he wasn't picked off a couple of times, though the wind and rain didn't help.

And so history was made. The Chargers dominated this game. They had Pittsburgh outgained 226-153 when the score was 27-3. The Steelers continuously screwed up. For example... - They were offside multiple times on 1 San Diego scoring drive. - Mike Wallace had a drop for what would have been a big completion, prompting the crowd to boo him. Antonio Brown then had a deep pass fall through his hands. - The defense surrendered a converted first down on a 3rd-and-13 run when the Chargers were just trying to get into better field goal position. - San Diego scored a defensive touchdown when Ben Roethlisberger carelessly threw a lateral pass that doinked off a player's rear end.    The Steelers lost by only 10 points, but don't be fooled by that. As mentioned, the score was 27-3 at 1 point, but Pittsburgh padded its stats with meaningless junk-time numbers. For example, Roethlisberger finished 22-of-42 for 285 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but he was just 9-of-20 for 105 yards, no scores and no picks at halftime. Likewise, Wallce (7-112, 2 TDs) and Brown (4-35, TD) both look good in the box score, but killed their team with the aforementioned drops.    Other Steelers of note: Heath Miller (5-66) had an average statistical performance, but it could have been much better because he fell inches short of the goal line in the 4.h quarter. Jonathan Dwyer rushed for 32 yards on just 8 carries. Plaxico Burress caught an 18-yard pass on a 3rd-and-12. This was his first reception as a Steeler since the 2004 AFC Championship.    Rivers, meanwhile, had a solid performance especially in the second half. He finished 21-of-41 for 200 yards and 3 touchdowns, with just 5 incompletions and 2 scores coming after intermission.    Two of Rivers' touchdowns went to "

The Chargers made some other mistakes throughout the afternoon, including a hold as the team was trying to run out the clock late in the 4.h quarter. However, no error was worse than a dropped interception on Tennessee's final drive. The ball bounced off Delanie Walker and into the arms of a San Diego defender, who let a potential pick fall out of his hands. Locker found Hunter a few plays later for the decisive touchdown. I'm also not sure why the Titans didn't have any safety help on the Hunter score, though it should be noted that Hunter pushed off. The officials could've called offensive pass interference, but kept all yellow flags in their pockets.    It's remarkable San Diego lost this contest considering that Philip Rivers misfired on just 4 attempts. He went 20-of-24 for 184 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had a second score nullified by offensive pass interference. Rivers couldn't really look downfield in the second half because 2 of his starting linemen - "

A red-hot Rivers was effortlessly leading San Diego down the field to draw within 1 possession, but Rivers' first interception. Pryor ultimately completed his first 10 passes for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns. Not included in this was a 19-yard completion to Denarius Moore in which he rolled out and found his wideout downfield. Pryor later had a similar play for 20 yards to Brice Butler to convert a crucial third-and-14 in the final quarter. Pryor went on to finish 18-of-23 for 221 yards and the pair of scores to go along with 11 scrambles for 31 rushing yards. He also should've thrown a third touchdown, but Moore stepped out of bounds prior to catching the ball. Pryor's only real blemish was when he fumbled the ball trying to desperately do something while wrapped up in a sack. He's fortunate that 1 of his teammates recovered the ball.    As mentioned, Moore (5-84) and Streater (3-56) caught the touchdowns. Marcel Reece was the only Raider with more than 2 receptions. He had 3 catches for 25 receiving yards to go along with 32 rushing yards on 7 carries. Rashad Jennings (10-41) handled the workload early on, but he was knocked out of the game with a hamstring.

Well, as I always say, the hardest thing for coaches to do is to make in-game adjustments for key injuries. Kansas City suffered 2 big losses in this contest, both in the second quarter, and both at the same position.

His own teammate, D.J. Fluker, accidentally punched the ball out in a scrum. - Ryan Mathews dropped a screen pass in the red zone with plenty of blockers in front of him. A potential touchdown turned into a field goal. - Eric Weddle foolishly hit Joe Flacco late on a third-down incompletion, drawing a penalty that gave Baltimore a first down and a subsequent touchdown. Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback "

   "comment":"Philip Rivers looked terrible, and it didn't appear as though Detroit's offense could be stopped. The Lions were shut down, however, as Matthew Stafford sucked in the second half. If he doesn't be careful, he's going to transform into Jay Cutler in the near future. There are just too many #yolo throws from him. He's not on a Cutler level yet, but he might be getting there.    This game looked like the Lions were going to roll to victory early after taking a quick 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter, but then Melvin Ingram caused an interception with a nasty hit on Matthew Stafford. The Chargers preceded to go on a 30-0 run before Detroit made it look a bit closer with a late touchdown that finished out the game with a 33-28 San Diego win.    The Lions' offense looked unstoppable early on; rookie running back Ameer Abdullah ran for a 24-yard touchdown in a fashion that made Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle look like he was the rookie in the open field. Abdullah appeared to have an extra gear in in all aspects of the game as he finished with 7 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, 4 receptions on 4 targets for 44 yards and 105 yards on 3 kickoff returns. Maybe the Lions should have given him Joique Bell's 6 carries, which resulted in 14 yards.    Turnovers were a big part of this game as both Philip Rivers and Matthew Stafford threw a pair of interceptions, and rookie Melvin Gordon lost a fumble."

A stiff arm and a nasty cut into the middle of the field plus speed that a 30-year-old man of his size shouldn't have, and there was his second touchdown of the game. He went on to have a couple more nice runs and also got vultured at the goal line by Zach Line for what should have been his third touchdown of the game, but the Vikings had built too large a lead, and they rested him for part of the 4.h quarter. Feel good about that fantasy pick.    Teddy Bridgewater on the other hand, didn't look sharp early, as the Vikings went to the air instead of pounding the ball on the ground with Peterson. But as soon as the running game got going, Bridgewater had a much easier time with a better pocket to work from. He finished with a paltry line of 13 completions on 24 attempts for 121 yards, 1 interception and no touchdowns. He'll have better days, but establishing the run is needed for him and this passing game.    Philip Rivers' day was not pleasant. He was hurried and sacked all game, while his offensive line limped off the field seemingly every other play. "

   "comment":"Philip Rivers on the third play of the game, and returned it to the 1-yard line, where Latavius Murray layed-up the easy goal-line touchdown. It was all down hill from there for the Chargers, well, unless you count garbage time, which you do in fantasy!    Derek Carr was on point in this 1. making perfect pass after perfect pass. This was the Carr we saw in Weeks 2 and 3. With the score still within reach, Carr hit Clive Walford with a pretty over-the-shoulder pass for a 23-yard touchdown to make it 17-3 Raiders. It was then on.    Amari Cooper was the next to get in on the fun, as he caught a pass on a crossing route and then went on to make multiple defenders miss on his way to a 51-yard touchdown. San Diego had been holding No. 1 receivers down for just 50 receiving yards a game coming into Sunday, but Cooper ended up with 5 receptions on 6 targets for 133 yards and that touchdown. He hadn't topped 49 yards receiving in his last 2 games, so it was nice to see him take a good pass defense to school this week.    Michael Crabtree was next in line for a touchdown, when he caught a 25-yarder from Carr in the third quarter to put the Raiders up 37-6. The blowout had arrived. That is, until the 4.h quarter.    Carr finished the day with 24-of-31 attempts for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns. That 77.4 percent completion rate was his highest of the season and is especially nice considering the Chargers were allowing a 61 percent completion rate coming into the game. This performance puts him right back up in the conversation of up-and-coming quarterbacks; now, if he can just find some consistency.    The Raiders let off the gas, and Philip Rivers gave it a run, making 3 touchdown passes in the last quarter. There never really was much of a chance San Diego would be able to come back all the way, but there were a couple times that it felt like it was in the realm of possibility.    After an ugly start, Rivers finished the game having gone 38-of-58 for 336 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. This wasn't a game he'll remember fondly, but he has now topped 300 yards in 5-of-7 games, and has multiple touchdown passes in 6-of-7.

He only made 1 bad decision, which was flipping the ball carelessly while in field goal range at the end of the game, and the pass was nearly pick-sixed. It was dropped, and San Diego was able to tie the game with about 2 minutes remaining in regulation. Unfortunately for him, his defense betrayed him and couldn't send the game into overtime.    I mentioned that Allen was knocked out. It was a shame for his fantasy owners, as it appeared as though he was on pace for a solid performance. He caught all 5 of his targets for 35 yards and a touchdown in less than a half of action. Rivers' other scores both went to "

Alex Smith, however, made some incredible throws during the comeback and overtime after misfiring often early, converting some key third and 4.h downs. Smith finished 34-of-48 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception.    While Smith will get all the acclaim, Kansas City's best offensive player was Spencer Ware. Yes, Spencer Ware! Replacing the injured Jamaal Charles, Ware was amazing. He rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown on only 11 carries, but what he did in the passing game provided much more of an impact. He caught 7 passes for a whopping 129 receiving yards. Ware was like a bull, seemingly impossible to bring down. He's going to be a big producer this year, perhaps even when Charles is healthy enough to play.    As for Smith's downfield options, Travis Kelce logged 6 catches for 74 yards, including a big 4.h-down conversion in the final quarter. Jeremy Maclin, meanwhile, hauled in 5 balls for 63 yards and a score. Maclin took a crushing helmet-to-helmet hit at the end of regulation and had trouble getting up afterward, but was able to re-take the field after being cleared for a concussion.    Going back to the Chargers, Rivers' stat lines were significantly different pre- and post-Allen. Rivers, in the first half, was 16-of-20 for 151 yards and a touchdown. He was unstoppable, as he had all the time in the world. Without Allen, however, he was 9-of-16 for 82 yards. Considering this dichotomy, it's fair to say that San Diego would've held on for the victory had Allen remained on the field.    With Allen presumably done for the season, Rivers will target "

   "comment":"Philip Rivers finished completing 17-of-24 passes for 220 yards with 4 touchdowns. Travis Benjamin was superb as San Diego's leading receiver, replacing Keenan Allen. Benjamin caught 6 passes for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns.    Melvin Gordon ran extremely well for the Chargers as he totaled 102 yards on 24 carries with a touchdown. He had 3 receptions for 18 yards as well. Danny Woodhead suffered a leg injury in the first quarter and had to be helped off the field before being carted into the locker room, so Gordon should take on a bigger role in the weeks to come.    Rivers took advantage with a few completions and a 6-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin. The Jaguars moved the ball into San Diego territory thanks to a completion to Allen Hurns (5-64), but Jason Myers missed a 54-yard field goal. The Chargers got Benjamin matched up on Paul Posluszny, and that led to a 43-yard completion for San Diego. The Jaguars jumped offsides on a 4.h-and-1 at the 4-yard line, and a play, later Rivers hit Antonio Gates (3-15) for a 2-yard score."

   "comment":"Philip Rivers then put together a good drive with passes to Gordon, Tyrell Williams and Antonio Gates (4-63-1) to get the ball to the Miami 11-yard line. Rivers finished the drive by throwing a bullet to Gates for the touchdown. Late in the second quarter, Tannehill threw a tremendous pass to Kenny Stills for a 39-yard touchdown to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-7 at halftime. Jay Ajayi had only 16 yards on 11 carries by halftime, but not long into the third quarter, he broke off a 40-yard run behind Laremy Tunsil. A 25-yard pass to Jarvis Landry (6-53) put the ball at the 2-yard line, and Damien Williams plunged into the end zone to give Miami the lead. San Diego responded with a completion to Tyrell Williams, a run from Gordon, and a pass interference in the end zone. On third-and-goal, Rivers connected with Hunter Henry (2-11-1) to put San Diego up 17-14. Miami quickly responded thanks to a 21-yard run from Ajayi and Tannehill had about a 15-yard run to convert a critical third-and-11. Tannehill lofted in an 18-yard touchdown pass to Williams get the Dolphins back on top 21-17. After a Miami stop, the Dolphins' Jakeem Grant muffed a punt at 5-yard line, and Darrell Stuckey recovered it for San Diego. The Dolphins had a pass interference after a third-down stop, but Rivers had a pass thrown off the mark, and it was intercepted by Tony Lippett. The Chargers were able to get the ball back, and Rivers used Dontrelle Inman (5-43) to move into Miami territory, but then he had an overthrow picked off by Byron Maxwell to deny San Diego. A good punt return set up Rivers close to midfield with 5 minutes remaining, and less than a minute later, San Diego had a 24-21 lead as Rivers hit Tyrell Williams on the run for a 51-yard touchdown. Miami came right back though, as Tannehill stepped into a hit and threw another dime deep down the field to connect with DeVante Parker for 56 yards with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Corey Liuget tacked on to put the Dolphins at the 10-yard line. Miami had to settled for a field goal though, but that still tied the game at 24. A run by Gordon of 13 yards and a screen to him of 20 yards moved the ball across midfield, but then disaster struck for Rivers as Kiko Alonso undercut a route to pick off the pass and return it 60 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Rivers had 1 minute remaining, but Tony Lippett added his second interception to clinch the Miami victory.    Philip Rivers completed 23-of-44 passes for 326 yards with 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Tyrell Williams led San Diego with 5 receptions for 125 yards and a score.    Melvin Gordon was contained by the Dolphins' talented defensive line. He had 70 yards on 24 carries, but also contributed 5 receptions for 62 yards.    Ryan Tannehill completed 17-of-24 for 240 yards on 2 touchdowns. The numbers don't illustrate that Tannehill made some phenomenal throws, and he threw the deep ball better than any game I've ever seen from him.    Jay Ajayi (19-79) was contained by the Chargers' defense. DeVante Parker (5-103) led Miami in receiving.    "

With an upgraded offensive line, he could be a top-10 quarterback once again. The major issue with Rivers was his decision-making on his picks.

He also had an offensive touchdown on his only reception, a 42-yarder. However, this occurred late in the game when it looked like Denver's defense stopped trying. Henry was the only player to record more receiving yardage than Benjamin, hauling in 4 balls for 73 yards. As referenced earlier, he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. "

   "comment":"Philip Rivers and Melvn Gordon, it would've made sense to have the offense on the field on a snap in New England territory. Instead, head coach Anthony Lynn called for a 51-yard field goal with a kicker he tried to replace this week. Yes, this actually happened. The Chargers are stupid. Very stupid.    The Patriots emerged from this game victorious, but they are still obviously a work in progress. For the second time this season, their opponent had a chance to have a late comeback in the 4.h quarter. New England's defense bent but didn't break, and that's how the team won.    Instead of utilizing a traditional running attack, the Patriots opted to use their backs mostly as receivers. Tom Brady threw a great deal of short passes to the receiving backs for the team, and that, in effect, was the Patriots' rush offense. Both Rex Burkhead (7-68) and James White (5-85) had big days as receivers, and they were Brady's favorite targets for most of the game. Burkhead looked particularly good, as his elusive ability was on display and he was able to get a great deal of yards after the catch. Burkhead is worth a speculative add if you need a depth running back. Meanwhile, in terms of actual carries, the Patriots split the carries 4 ways. The aforementioned Burkhead and White only saw a combined 5 carries, so that left most of the workload for Dion Lewis and Mike Gillislee. Lewis was used as the primary running back and showed some of the ability that made him a dangerous weapon 2 years ago. He was able to make men miss at the line of scrimmage and turn gains that should have been gone nowhere into 4.to-five-yard gains. Lewis took 15 carries for 44 yards and also handled most of the goal-line work, a trend that has continued since Gillislee fumbled a couple of weeks ago. Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit Chris Hogan down the field for a touchdown. He nearly was able to get the ball to Hogan, but the more impressive thing is that Brady threw the ball 60 yards in the air with good accuracy. Brady's other excellent throw came on the final offensive drive of the game. On a second-and-20, he lofted a perfect ball over a linebacker to Rob Gronkowski to get the first down. That allowed the Patriots to run more time off the clock and seal the win. Overall, Brady finished 32-of-47 for 333 yards and a touchdown. He has been carrying the Patriots so far this season and is currently 1 of the leaders of the MVP race.    Aside from the running backs, Brady's top receivers were Gronkowski (5-57, 1 TD) and Hogan (5-60). Gronkowski didn't make a lot of catches, but he had the touchdown catch and made the big play on the final drive when it counted. He is still the best tight end in football and should have some big performances as the year goes along. Meanwhile, Hogan made a nice catch over the middle of the field and continued to operate as the team's top deep threat. Elsewhere, Brandin Cooks (5-26) had a decent performance. He was able to find open space in the first half, but he had to deal with Casey Hayward for some of the contest.    For the Chargers, this was a strong showing. While they were unable to ultimately win the contest, their defense played very well, and they had a chance to beat the Patriots late in the 4.h quarter. Philip Rivers did as much as he could to help the Chargers win. Rivers was his usual solid self, and showed great accuracy during the contest. His ability to hit receivers on out routes to the sideline was very strong, and that allowed him to methodically move the ball down the field. At the same time, Rivers was forced to throw mostly short passes against the Patriots, as the team did well to protect against the deep ball. As a result, the Chargers ended up with a lot of third-and-shorts, but they couldn't convert them. Part of this was due to Rivers' inability to find open receivers in these situations, and some of it was due to Matt Patricia's ability to call the right plays at the right time. Overall, Rivers went 17-of-30 for 212 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a solid game, but he was unable to lead the team to victory at the end of the day. He had a chance on the final drive, but he was killed by a lack of timeouts and a key drop.

Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit Chris Hogan down the field for a touchdown. He nearly was able to get the ball to Hogan, but the more impressive thing is that Brady threw the ball 60 yards in the air with good accuracy. Brady's other excellent throw came on the final offensive drive of the game. On a second-and-20, he lofted a perfect ball over a linebacker to Rob Gronkowski to get the first down. That allowed the Patriots to run more time off the clock and seal the win. Overall, Brady finished 32-of-47 for 333 yards and a touchdown. He has been carrying the Patriots so far this season and is currently 1 of the leaders of the MVP race.    Aside from the running backs, Brady's top receivers were Gronkowski (5-57, 1 TD) and Hogan (5-60). Gronkowski didn't make a lot of catches, but he had the touchdown catch and made the big play on the final drive when it counted. He is still the best tight end in football and should have some big performances as the year goes along. Meanwhile, Hogan made a nice catch over the middle of the field and continued to operate as the team's top deep threat. Elsewhere, Brandin Cooks (5-26) had a decent performance. He was able to find open space in the first half, but he had to deal with Casey Hayward for some of the contest.    For the Chargers, this was a strong showing. While they were unable to ultimately win the contest, their defense played very well, and they had a chance to beat the Patriots late in the 4.h quarter. Philip Rivers did as much as he could to help the Chargers win. Rivers was his usual solid self, and showed great accuracy during the contest. His ability to hit receivers on out routes to the sideline was very strong, and that allowed him to methodically move the ball down the field. At the same time, Rivers was forced to throw mostly short passes against the Patriots, as the team did well to protect against the deep ball. As a result, the Chargers ended up with a lot of third-and-shorts, but they couldn't convert them. Part of this was due to Rivers' inability to find open receivers in these situations, and some of it was due to Matt Patricia's ability to call the right plays at the right time. Overall, Rivers went 17-of-30 for 212 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. It was a solid game, but he was unable to lead the team to victory at the end of the day. He had a chance on the final drive, but he was killed by a lack of timeouts and a key drop.    Rivers' top receivers during the contest were "

Benjamin wasn't open, and A.J. Bouye hauled in the pass. Bouye ran toward the end zone and nearly scored. After a couple of runs, the Jaguars tried a field goal, which was blocked. Except, Josh Lambo, who was cut by the Chargers in the summer in favor of Younghoe Koo, still somehow made the kick anyway. This gave Jacksonville its 6.h victory of the season.    Rivers' interception wasn't the Chargers' only stupid sequence. They allowed a touchdown on a fake punt in the opening half, and before you say that any team could've done that, Jacksonville scored on the same exact play it ran versus the Ravens in London back in Week 3. Of course, the inept Charger coaches didn't recognize this, and they couldn't put their players in a position to stop it. Another huge mistake was "
