   "comment":"Floyd (3-40) where I just said wow out loud. The 2 wideouts continuously made really impressive receptions.    LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for 50 yards on 21 carries. He also scored his 10th touchdown of the year. He had a nice 10-yard run from his own goal line, but was otherwise ineffective outside of the red zone. He just doesn't have the blocking, and Dallas' defense was geared up to stop the rush in this contest.    Unlike the Cowboys, the Chargers had some creative play-calling. On 1 play, they came out in a Wildcat formation with Tomlinson in the shotgun. They ran a double reverse, giving Rivers the ball. Rivers launched a deep throw downfield toward Jackson. The pass fell incomplete, but drew a 38-yard pass-interference flag.    Two last notes: First, the officials were terrible in this contest. They screwed up on multiple pass interference calls on both sides, including an obvious infraction where Floyd was blatantly tackled by Dallas defensive backs. The refs didn't see it, which really cost the Chargers because Rivers tossed a pick on the next play. And second, "

   "comment":"Floyd with runs by Curtis Brinkley and Mike Tolbert to put the team in plus territory. From there, Rivers hit Antonio Gates for a 38-yard touchdown, tying the game at 7. As the first quarter ended, a rare failed drive followed. Palmer threw short to Kevin Boss and Oakland punted into the end zone. The Chargers quickly got into the Raiders' territory with a 37-yard pass to Gates, and Tolbert finished the drive with a 1-yard plunge, putting the visitors up 14-7. They would never relinquish the lead. Oakland got another big play from Heyward-Bey (9-130, TD) who finished just short of 1,000 yards on the season at 975. After a 19-yard reception from Murphy, the drive looked promising, but stalled. After a long field goal by Sebastian Janikowski (52 yards) made it 14-10, there was reason for optimism as Kansas City led Denver 7-0 a couple hours to the east. However, Richard Goodman returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to provide San Diego with a 21-10 cushion. The Raiders, of course, turned to Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. Palmer found him down the middle for 22 yards, and after some short gains, another Janikowski field goal trimmed the lead to 21-13. The Chargers' offense never let off the pedal (463 total yards) in this 1 though. In 5 plays, they were at the Oakland 33-yard line. The defense held, forcing 3 straight San Diego incompletions, but Nova's long field goal put the Chargers ahead 24-13. Typically, the Raiders would answer in a 2.minute drill, having done so all year. This looked like no exception when Heyward-Bey caught a pass for a gain of 23 followed by a 9-yard pass to Bush, but with 11 seconds left and no timeouts to stop the clock, Palmer inexplicably completed a short pass to Murphy for a gain of 6. Instead of a long, but certainly makeable 55-yard field goal attempt, Oakland entered the locker room for halftime to a chorus of boos from the home fans. The offenses kept piling up stats in the second half, but field goals never beat touchdowns. Palmer dropped a bomb to Denarius Moore who went 78 yards but needed to go a few more. A short Bush run and 2 completions put Janikowski back on the field to slice the San Diego lead to 24-16. The response was a touchdown drive. The Chargers' big receivers used their height advantage all afternoon to school the small defensive backs trying to cover them. After a nice kickoff return set them up at the 34-yard line, Rivers completed all 5 passes he attempted for 51 yards including the 13-yard score to Vincent Jackson (2-29, TD), who played sidekick to Floyd (7-127, TD) and Gates (5-106 yards, TD) most of the game. Midway through the third quarter, it was looking bleak in the Black Hole. The Raiders got another big play, a 28-yard pass to Murphy, but again failed to finish with a touchdown. Janikowski's 4.h field goal closed them to within 31-19 as the third quarter wound down. Again, Oakland's defense couldn't really hold, but caught a break when Norv Turner started running the clock with Brinkley, who was given 4 consecutive carries. Rivers' first pass of the drive came on third-and-two and fell incomplete. Then, "

In the second quarter, Manuel made a great play as he broke 3 tackles in the backfield before dumping off a pass to Scott Chandler (5-74), who broke downfield for a 37-yard gain. It was really the only special play that Manuel made all day. That led to a Buffalo field goal. Rivers came back to hit Floyd for a 49-yard catch after he beat Leodis McKelvin down the middle of the field."

   "comment":"Floyd and Antonio Gates - exit early to a standing ovation from a crowd that was comprised of a 50-50 mix of Chargers and Dolphins fans. It was a nice moment. If you're looking at this glass-half-empty, the Chargers' insistance on focusing on the past may have cost them greatly in the future. By winning, they lost out on the opportunity to draft Laremy Tunsil, the top left tackle in this upcoming class. Considering San Diego's glaring holes on the front, the team desperately needed Tunsil, but now it appears as though the Titans will secure him, which is what I have happening in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft.    Philip Rivers had an easy time delivering the ball to his open wideouts. He misfired just 10 times, going 26-of-36 for 311 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Rivers had a few poor throws. He was nearly picked in the end zone and underthrew an open Floyd for a score. One of Rivers' interceptions was heaved into triple coverage. "

   "comment":"Floyd on a downfield shot. The Raiders tried to make Woodson the hero by giving him the ball and rolling him out during a trip to the red zone in overtime. Nothing was open, so Woodson took a slight loss, but it didn't matter because Oakland ultimately prevailed. Woodson addressed the fans after the game, thanking them for welcoming him back as if he never left.    The Raiders were able to win because of a great overtime drive. They couldn't get much going on offense throughout the entire night because Amari Cooper was injured. Derek Carr overcame this in the extra session, leading his team to a close field-goal try. Carr finished 23-of-38 for 204 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was tipped at the line of scrimmage and caught by Kendall Reyes, which set up a San Diego score. Carr also scrambled 4 times for 30 rushing yards. He couldn't get anything going in the second half. The Chargers had some nice blitzes dialed up, and as mentioned, Cooper wasn't any sort of factor.    With Cooper banged up, Michael Crabtree led the way with just 6 catches for 39 yards and a touchdown, a perfect fade pass from Carr. As for Cooper, he murdered his fantasy owners with just 2 catches for 10 yards. Jim Nantz mentioned that Cooper would be credited with a reception of minus-20 yards because of a Stanford Band-type play at the end of the first half, but the box score apparently didn't penalize him for this.    Latavius Murray ran well, gaining 79 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. He was also second on the team in receiving, catching 5 balls for 38 yards. Murray became the first Oakland back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season for the first time in 5 years. However, the Raiders made the mistake of not running the ball nearly enough. They were never down by double digits, so there was no reason to have a 2:1 pass-to-rush ratio.    As for the Chargers, they once again battled hard, but had nothing to show for it. They had a lead for the majority of the contest, but tight end David Johnson lost a fumble near midfield with about 4 minutes in regulation, which the Raiders recovered and returned inside the 5-yard line. This set up the Crabtree touchdown that helped send the game into overtime. San Diego appeared to be in complete control before that; they were actually running out the clock at that moment. They also made another atrocious mistake when they were flagged for unnecessary roughness on a second-and-29 in overtime. It's both a shame and a blessing for San Diego. The loss was crushing, but could end up being beneficial, as another victory would have ruined draft positioning.    Philip Rivers was sharp, going 31-of-49 for 277 yards and a touchdown. Those aren't the best numbers, but consider the following 3 items: First, Rivers' top options at receiver were Dontrelle Inman and a banged-up Malcom Floyd. Second, stud guard "
