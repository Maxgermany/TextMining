   "comment":"Keenan Lewis, who limited DeSean Jackson to just 1 short catch, was knocked out with a concussion in the third quarter. Nick Foles couldn't get anything going before that, but he suddenly began pushing the ball downfield. Replacement Corey White had no chance of covering Jackson, as he immediately gave up a 40-yard reception to the speedy wideout. White was later whistled for a 40-yard pass interference on Jackson, allowing the Eagles to score 2 plays later.    Nick Foles played relatively well in his first postseason appearance. He went 23-of-33 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns. Proving Cris Collinsworth right, he took some bad sacks, including 1 where he seemingly had 10 seconds in the pocket and failed to throw the ball away. This was huge because a first-and-10 at the New Orleans 15-yard line ultimately transformed into a 48-yard field goal that was missed. Foles was also flagged for a horrible intentional-grounding penalty that disrupted a drive. Foles could've had a much better day if it wasn't for a Riley Cooper third-down drop during the third quarter. Cooper was set up for a very long gain because of a well-timed pick, but he simply let the ball slip through his hands. It was a crushing drop for the Eagles, who likely would've been set up for a field goal at the very least.    It was surprising to see LeSean McCoy so limited. He gained just 77 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He also caught 4 balls, but for only 15 receiving yards. The Saints were porous against the run during the weeks heading into this matchup, so McCoy's struggles were shocking.    Chip Kelly made a couple of mistakes in his first playoff game. He carelessly burned a timeout in the second half. I also thought he made an error by kicking a field goal on 4.h-and-1 at the 7-yard line, down 20-14 in the 4.h quarter. Kelly had to know that Brees would score again, so going for it would've been the right move.    Foles' touchdowns went to Cooper (6-68) and Ertz (3-22). Cooper's score came immediately following an Ertz drop in the end zone, so the rookie tight end was very close to snatching 2 touchdowns.    Some other notes/stats for the Saints: - Sproles led New Orleans in receptions with 4 for 31 receiving yards. He was 1 of the heroes, as he had a nice return prior to the final drive, which was aided by a Cary Williams horse-collar tackle, putting the ball around midfield. - Jimmy Graham (3-44) appeared to lose a fumble in Philadelphia territory at 1 point during the first half, but he was ruled down after a review. - Brees' sole aerial score went to Lance Moore (2-31). - I'd like to note that the Philadelphia crowd booed when Keenan Lewis was getting up after being down on the ground for so long. Sorry, I just had to troll my Eagle fan friends. - The Saints, who won their first playoff road game in franchise history, now have to play at the Seahawks, who own the greatest homefield advantage in the NFL. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Lewis, who limited DeSean Jackson to just 1 short catch, was knocked out with a concussion in the third quarter.
