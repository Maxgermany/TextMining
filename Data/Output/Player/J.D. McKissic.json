  "comment":"J.D. McKissic handled the passing role and 26 scrimmage yards. As long as this is a committee, none of Seattle's backs are viable options as starters in fantasy.    As mentioned earlier, Walsh whiffed on 3 field goals, missing from 49, 48 and 35. Walsh's confidence could be shattered, so the Seahawks may opt to look for another kicker this week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",
