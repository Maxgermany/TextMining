   "comment":"McKissic, who lateralled it back to Wilson. The Seahawks quarterback then launched the ball downfield to Paul Richardson, who went up and caught the ball. Landon Collins also got his hands on it as well, and shades of the Fail Mary game surfaced as the officials reviewed the call. Ultimately, Richardson's 38-yard touchdown stood, and that was the difference-maker for this contest. Still, this was not a great performance for the Seahawks. They once again struggled in the first half, and their blocking wasn't good for yet another week. Wilson was under pressure from the Giants' edge rushers for most of the day and constantly had to move outside the pocket. He was called for intentional grounding a couple times and a less-mobile quarterback would have been sacked far more than once. Against a stronger team, the Seahawks may not have emerged victorious in this contest.    Wilson's final numbers look very good; he went 27-of-39 for 334 yards and 3 touchdowns. But he did have some issues of his own. He had some overthrows on passes, and notably missed Doug Baldwin for what would have been a wide-open touchdown. That said, the positives far outweighed the negatives. Wilson made some beautiful touch passes and was able to have great ball placement on almost all of his accurate throws. On 1 of his touchdowns, he found Baldwin over the middle of the field and lofted a perfect touch pass to him for the 22-yard score. The ball lofted over the linebackers and was 1 of his best throws on the day. In fact, all his touch passes were near perfect today, and that was his biggest strength. Wilson will continue to perform well, but the Seahawks need to get him help so he doesn't have to carry the team.    Wilson's top receivers on the day were Doug Baldwin (9-92, 1 TD) and Jimmy Graham (3-51, 1 TD). Baldwin led the team with a whopping 12 targets. He demonstrated great chemistry with Wilson and was able to find space all across the field and use his elusiveness to gain extra yards. Baldwin has a lot of upside in fantasy, and can be a WR1 some weeks. Meanwhile, Graham's performance was a mixed bag, but he also had a couple of drops. On 1 play, he dropped a touchdown that hit him in the chest. The defender was close to him, but it was a makeable grab. The more egregious 1 came when Wilson hit him in the chest on a deep ball. Graham let it hit the ground, but he could have had a touchdown. Graham is still a TE1, but he needs to improve his hands to help the team.    The run offense was once again an issue for the Seahawks. They used multiple running backs, but it's clear that they are missing Chris Carson. Eddie Lacy saw 11 carries, but only notched 34 yards. Thomas Rawls also saw 11 carries and did about the same, garnering 36 yards. Perhaps the most impressive of the group was J.D. McKissic, who had 5 touches for 33 scrimmage yards. He has explosive play-making ability, so he may have a chance to earn a bigger role with the team. ,li&gt; For the Giants, they deserve praise for keeping pace with the Seahawks early on. But it's clear that their offense is not going to be able to keep the team competitive this year. Eli Manning had a poor performance against the Seahawks. The veteran quarterback has regressed, and he's looking like 1 of the worse signal-callers in the NFL. At halftime, Manning only had 17 passing yards despite the Giants having the lead. Manning's arm strength is no longer there, and his downfield accuracy has suffered as a result. Of course, Manning has been operating without his top-3 passing options in the past couple weeks, but the Giants still had no chance against the Seahawks. Manning was dinking and dunking against a defense known for solid tackling and pursuit abilities. That was not a recipe for success. Overall, Manning went 19-of-39 for 134 yards and 1 touchdown. He also fumbled. Manning's numbers are indicative of his declining ability. Manning isn't capable of leading the Giants to the playoffs, so they need to think about replacing him this offseason.    The top target for Manning on Sunday was far and away "
