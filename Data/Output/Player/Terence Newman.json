Denard Robinson had a nice run, and Toby Gerhart (3-19 rushing, 3-49 receiving) converted a third-and-16 by breaking tackles and dragging defenders for the yards. That led to a field goal. The Bengals answered with a drive that featured a few completions to A.J. Green, a clutch reception by Cedric Peerman, a chunk run by Hill, and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanu. Cincinnati's next score was set up by Rex Burkhead, getting a piece of a punt to shorten the field. Dalton dropped in a rainbow to Sanu, who made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 32-yard gain to the 10-yard line. On the next play, Sanu recovered a fumble by A.J. Green to maintain the scoring opportunity that ended with a field goal by Andy Dalton. The Jaguars went 3.and-out, thanks to a sack by Carlos Dunlap and Jaguars punter Bryan Anger had his second consecutive punt blocked, which Taylor Mays turned into a safety. Cincinnati could have broken the game open as Bortles had another interception dropped; this time by linebacker Emmanuel Lamur before the half. In the third quarter, Dalton went right back to Sanu for a 36-yard reception to the 11-yard line. Sanu (4-95) ran a great route and beat safety Josh Evans for the ball. Hill finished the drive with a short touchdown run. The Jaguars answered with Bortles throwing a 40-yard touchdown to Allen Hurns. Hurns had a step on Leon Hall, but the ball was underthrown, and Hurns had to adjust to make the reception in front of Hall. Dalton helped the Jaguars out with a poorly thrown ball that was picked off by Sherrod Martin. The Bengals' defense came up with a stop despite, once again, dropping an interception. That near-turnover was around Jacksonville's 20-yard line. Pacman Jones then returned a punt 31 yards to set up a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Green (3-44). Jacksonville fought back with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Hurns (7-112). He made a great adjustment to outfight Terrance Newman for the ball in the front of the end zone. In response, Dalton had a ball slip out of his hands, and linebacker "
