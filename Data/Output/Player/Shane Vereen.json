   "comment":"Vereen also coughed the ball up for New England. The 49ers, meanwhile, had issues with the snap. Colin Kaepernick bobbled the ball on an attempted fourth-down sneak - 1 of his 4 botched snaps. The difference between the 2 squads was the quarterback play. Save for 1 interception, Kaepernick was on fire, connecting on multiple downfield strikes. He completed 5 passes of 24 yards or longer. Tom Brady, meanwhile, was a mess early on. He was just 10-of-19 for 76 yards and an interception that was his fault at halftime. He tossed a second pick in the third quarter, but that was on Aaron Hernandez, whose alligator arms allowed the 49ers tip the pass and intercept it. The Patriots had just 6 first downs at intermission, but moved the chains a whopping 26 times afterward. Brady ultimately finished 36-of-65 for 443 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 picks. He nearly led an amazing comeback from down 31-3, but fell just a bit short. Brady was magnificent for the most part in the second half, but uncharacteristically missed some manageable throws. He threw way high on a key 4th-and-2 inside his own 20, which gave the 49ers a chip-shot field goal that put this contest out of reach. Brady did lead the team completely back though - he tied the game at 31 in the middle of the fourth quarter, but following a great return, Kaepernick hit Michael Crabtree for a 38-yard touchdown which ended up being the decisive score. Kaepernick finished 14-of-25 for 216 yards, a whopping 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He also rushed 7 times for 28 yards.    Two of Kaepernick's scores went to Crabtree (7-102), who now has 23 catches for 301 yards and the 2 touchdowns in the past 3 weeks. Kaepernick also found Randy Moss (2-36) and Delanie Walker in the end zone. Vernon Davis hauled in 1 reception for 10 yards. Kaepernick actually had him for a potential score, but overshot him during 1 of his rare poor attempts.    The 49ers ran the ball extremely well. In addition to Kaepernick, 2 other 49ers averaged about 4 yards per carry: Frank Gore (21-83) and LaMichael James (7-28).    As for New England's ground attack, Belichick benched both Ridley and Vereen because of their fumbles. He turned to the reliable "

The Lions, meanwhile, seemed like they were going to hang around early on. They lost the yardage battle by only 50 in the first half, as they were able to generate some solid-looking drives until they stalled deep in New England territory. Jim Caldwell, however, made 2 curious decisions at the Patriots' 35. He punted on fourth-and-3 at that spot late in the second quarter. The Patriots were going to score anyway, so why not try to move the chains? Later in the game, when his team was down 21, Caldwell opted to attempt a field goal with his shaky kicker. Granted, it was fourth-and-long, but trimming the deficit from 21 to 18 was meaningless; Detroit still needed 3 scores to win, so Comatose Caldwell effectively waved the white flag despite there being 14 minutes remaining in regulation. He didn't even try an onside kick following the conversion, which was even more puzzling. It's like he was coaching in the preseason and wanted to see if "

   "comment":"Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3-and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1-on-1. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Vereen, meanwhile, logged 23 yards on 6 carries. He didn't catch a single ball, partly because he dropped a key pass deep in Washington territory. Vereen is just a reserve in PPR formats.    In addition to Lauvao, DeAngelo Hall sustained an injury. He hurt his foot and had to be helped off the field. He couldn't put any pressure on his leg.    One last note: The officials were terrible in this game. They didn't make any shady calls, or anything, but they repeatedly picked up flags they threw. This happened on at least 5 occasions. Additionally, a late Washington touchdown should've been reviewed. It wasn't, and a pissed-off Tom Coughlin threw the challenge flag. At the time, it looked like a dumb move on his part because he was trying to review something illegally, but he was probably just pissed off that the officials were so incompetent.   "

Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.

   "comment":"Vereen's hands; the running back should've secured the ball on an easy catch. The second was actually a reception by Dwayne Harris, but he was hit so hard that the ball fell out of his arms and floated into the arms of Will Blackmon. The errors continued as the game progressed. A John Jerry hold ruined field goal position, and then Manning was guilty of a third interception when he tried to fire a tight throw to Rueben Randle. As a result of all of this, the Giants ultimately trailed 17-0. They tried to mount a comeback, and they actually took over with possession down 6 points, but they just ran out of time.    Manning couldn't get anything going until late. He just didn't have the protection, thanks to 4 starting offensive linemen being hurt. He caught fire at the end, but the Redskins were playing prevent, so I don't know how much I'd read into it. Manning finished 26-of-51 for 321 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 interceptions.    Odell Beckham Jr. may have made the catch of the year. I'm sure you've all seen it by now; Beckham dived for the ball in the end zone and was able to reel it in with just 1 hand. As this happened, I shouted, What? Nooo... I couldn't believe he caught it, but I should've known better, given how ridiculously talented he is. Beckham had a huge game otherwise, finishing with 9 catches for 142 yards and that touchdown. With all of the linemen being out, Manning spent most of the afternoon heaving balls up for Beckham, so if you want to know why Beckham had 18 targets, well, there it is.    Only 1 other Giant had more than 40 receiving yards. That was tight end Will Tye, who snatched 6 balls for 74 yards. Tye was on the field with Larry Donnell being out. Meanwhile, Randle snatched Manning's other touchdown, but that was the only pass he hauled in of his 6 targets.    The Giants, as usual, struggled to run the ball. Rashad Jennings (6-14) didn't even have much of an opportunity because Washington led throughout. Shane Vereen (2-15) led the team in rushing yardage.    I haven't discussed the victors yet, but perhaps I should, given that they are now tied for first in the NFC East. "

   "comment":"Vereen lost a fumble near midfield. Cruz also lost a fumble at the end of a long reception. Eli Manning was strip-sacked. Beckham dropped a late score. The offense struggled in the red zone, which drew numerous boos from the crowd by the end of the afternoon. Had the Giants been sharp and played to their potential, they could've prevailed by at least 2 touchdowns.    Save for the lost fumble, Eli Manning didn't deserve blame for this. He didn't throw a touchdown, but came close to doing so on multiple occasions. His passing numbers were still impressive, as he went 32-of-41 for 368 yards. Of course, this was to be expected, given that the Saints' already-dreadful defense was missing its top cornerback, Delvin Breaux. Making matters even worse, the team's other starting corner, P.J. Williams, was down on the field for a while after getting knocked in the head twice. He was eventually taken to the hospital, but was able to move his limbs.    Beckham's dropped touchdown prevented him from leading the Giants in receptions. Instead, he was tied in that regard with Sterling Shepard. Each snatched 8 balls, with Shepard winning the yardage battle, 117-86. Cruz, meanwhile, made a big reception to set up the Giants with the decisive field goal, but made some crucial errors that I referenced earlier.    The Giants were expected to give Rashad Jennings the majority of the workload this season, but Jennings was actually out-touched by Vereen in this contest. Jennings was very ineffective, mustering only 27 yards on 13 carries against a woeful New Orleans front. Vereen was better (14-42), but had the aforementioned fumble. He also caught 3 balls for 24 receiving yards.    This game was expected to be a shootout. The Giants, as mentioned, shot themselves in the foot, but what about the Saints? The reason they couldn't do anything was that they were unable to pass protect at all. New York struggled to put pressure on the Cowboys last week, but were able to bring plenty of heat on Brees. The Saints, as a result, couldn't sustain drives. Brees got off to a slow start as a result, but was able to catch fire near the end of the game when the Giant pass-rushers were fatigued. Brees ended up finishing with a middling stat line of 29-of-44, 263 yards and 1 touchdown.    Brees' sole score went to "

   "comment":"Vereen. Beckham ended up catching 7 passes for 121 yards. He truly redeemed himself following last year's performance, but he once again ended up losing to Norman's team. This was a huge victory for the Redskins, who couldn't afford to fall to 0-3. It didn't appear as though they were impacted at all by the seemingly bogus locker room-related story reported by the NFL's tabloid man.    Even if there happened to be conflict in the locker room surrounding Kirk Cousins, it won't manifest itself this week. Cousins played somewhat well for the most part, going 21-of-35 for 296 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, Cousins appeared to have cost his team the game following a huge mental blunder just prior to intermission. He showed horrible clock management, failing to use a timeout after converting a long play. He finally spiked the ball with 11 seconds remaining. Following an incompletion, there were 6 seconds left, and it was clear Cousins had to fire a short pass and then have his kicker try a field goal. Cousins, however, held the ball for an eternity and was strip-sacked. It was almost as dumb as the time he kneeled instead of spiking the ball. Cousins has a nice skill set, but it's quite apparent that he struggles with the mental part of the game. In addition to that red-zone blunder, he also threw way short of the line to gain on multiple third downs. He was nearly picked on 1 occasion, so it's not like he was just being safe. Cousins made some great throws as well, but the mistakes can't keep happening if he wants to receive the huge contract he's been pining for.    Cousins had long touchdowns of 55 and 44 to Jamison Crowder (4-78) and DeSean Jackson (5-96), respectively, with the latter catching a true bomb. Jackson got hurt in the second half, however, prompting Troy Aikman to say that Jackson has spent his entire career being banged up. Pierre Garcon (5-59) tied Jackson for the team lead in receptions, while Jordan Reed caught 4 balls for 56 yards. Reed's numbers weren't impressive, but he had a great play in which he reeled in a pass thrown behind him, broke 2 tackles and then sprinted for the first down.    Matt Jones didn't have a great stat line either, mustering 65 yards on 17 carries. However, he was huge at the end of the game, running powerfully and breaking tackles. He was instrumental in Washington's victory. Jones appeared to suffer a concussion at 1 point, but didn't miss much action. Robert Kelley (4-7) took his place for a bit.    The Redskins sustained multiple injuries in this contest. The maligned Bashaud Breeland was helped off the field early on when he couldn't put pressure on his leg. Later, center Kory Lichtensteiger got knocked out with a calf malady. DeAngelo Hall sustained the worst injury of them all, tearing his ACL.    Moving on to the Giants, it's safe to say that they absolutely blew this game. I mentioned the Manning interception at the goal line and Beckham's offensive pass interference, but there were numerous other plays where they made mistakes. Manning was strip-sacked early, but a teammate recovered. Shane Vereen fumbled, which would've led to Washington points had Cousins not screwed up at the end of the first half. Following the break, Manning threw an interception in the red zone, but the officials ruled it to be incomplete for some strange reason. They then weren't prepared for a Redskins fake punt conversion, which ended up costing them 3 points. The Giants blocked a punt after that which would've set them up for at least 3 points, but an unnecessary roughness penalty negated it. And speaking of unnecessary roughness, center "
