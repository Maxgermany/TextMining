As for the Texans, things seemed very promising early on when Danieal Manning took the opening kickoff to the New England 12-yard line. However, they settled for 3 instead of 7. which has been a theme for them of late. Matt Schaub threw a perfect pass to James Casey in the end zone, but the tight end dropped it. Schaub then missed Andre Johnson (8-95) on third down, so Houston had to kick a field goal. Schaub finished 34-of-51 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, but don't be fooled by those stats because they were padded in 4.h-quarter garbage time. Schaub wasn't terrible, but he could have been much better. He missed some open targets and fumbled the ball when he was moving out of the pocket and carrying it around loosely. His interception was a killer; his team was in field-goal range down 11 in the third quarter. He carelessly lofted a pass over the middle of the field, but didn't see "

After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Shane Vereen, meanwhile, logged 23 yards on 6 carries. He didn't catch a single ball, partly because he dropped a key pass deep in Washington territory. Vereen is just a reserve in PPR formats.    In addition to Lauvao, DeAngelo Hall sustained an injury. He hurt his foot and had to be helped off the field. He couldn't put any pressure on his leg.    One last note: The officials were terrible in this game. They didn't make any shady calls, or anything, but they repeatedly picked up flags they threw. This happened on at least 5 occasions. Additionally, a late Washington touchdown should've been reviewed. It wasn't, and a pissed-off Tom Coughlin threw the challenge flag. At the time, it looked like a dumb move on his part because he was trying to review something illegally, but he was probably just pissed off that the officials were so incompetent. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

He was crucial on the final drive, picking up gains of 11, 16 and 24. It's amazing that the 49ers made the mistake of not doubling Vereen. Who else could they possibly be scared of?    Vereen actually saw some carries, handling 5 attempts for 24 rushing yards. "

   "comment":"Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York."

   "comment":"Shane Vereen's hands; the running back should've secured the ball on an easy catch. The second was actually a reception by Dwayne Harris, but he was hit so hard that the ball fell out of his arms and floated into the arms of Will Blackmon. The errors continued as the game progressed. A John Jerry hold ruined field goal position, and then Manning was guilty of a third interception when he tried to fire a tight throw to Rueben Randle. As a result of all of this, the Giants ultimately trailed 17-0. They tried to mount a comeback, and they actually took over with possession down 6 points, but they just ran out of time.    Manning couldn't get anything going until late. He just didn't have the protection, thanks to 4 starting offensive linemen being hurt. He caught fire at the end, but the Redskins were playing prevent, so I don't know how much I'd read into it. Manning finished 26-of-51 for 321 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 interceptions.    Odell Beckham Jr. may have made the catch of the year. I'm sure you've all seen it by now; Beckham dived for the ball in the end zone and was able to reel it in with just 1 hand. As this happened, I shouted, What? Nooo... I couldn't believe he caught it, but I should've known better, given how ridiculously talented he is. Beckham had a huge game otherwise, finishing with 9 catches for 142 yards and that touchdown. With all of the linemen being out, Manning spent most of the afternoon heaving balls up for Beckham, so if you want to know why Beckham had 18 targets, well, there it is.    Only 1 other Giant had more than 40 receiving yards. That was tight end Will Tye, who snatched 6 balls for 74 yards. Tye was on the field with Larry Donnell being out. Meanwhile, Randle snatched Manning's other touchdown, but that was the only pass he hauled in of his 6 targets.    The Giants, as usual, struggled to run the ball. Rashad Jennings (6-14) didn't even have much of an opportunity because Washington led throughout. Shane Vereen (2-15) led the team in rushing yardage.    I haven't discussed the victors yet, but perhaps I should, given that they are now tied for first in the NFC East. "

   "comment":"Shane Vereen. Beckham ended up catching 7 passes for 121 yards. He truly redeemed himself following last year's performance, but he once again ended up losing to Norman's team. This was a huge victory for the Redskins, who couldn't afford to fall to 0-3. It didn't appear as though they were impacted at all by the seemingly bogus locker room-related story reported by the NFL's tabloid man.    Even if there happened to be conflict in the locker room surrounding Kirk Cousins, it won't manifest itself this week. Cousins played somewhat well for the most part, going 21-of-35 for 296 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, Cousins appeared to have cost his team the game following a huge mental blunder just prior to intermission. He showed horrible clock management, failing to use a timeout after converting a long play. He finally spiked the ball with 11 seconds remaining. Following an incompletion, there were 6 seconds left, and it was clear Cousins had to fire a short pass and then have his kicker try a field goal. Cousins, however, held the ball for an eternity and was strip-sacked. It was almost as dumb as the time he kneeled instead of spiking the ball. Cousins has a nice skill set, but it's quite apparent that he struggles with the mental part of the game. In addition to that red-zone blunder, he also threw way short of the line to gain on multiple third downs. He was nearly picked on 1 occasion, so it's not like he was just being safe. Cousins made some great throws as well, but the mistakes can't keep happening if he wants to receive the huge contract he's been pining for.    Cousins had long touchdowns of 55 and 44 to Jamison Crowder (4-78) and DeSean Jackson (5-96), respectively, with the latter catching a true bomb. Jackson got hurt in the second half, however, prompting Troy Aikman to say that Jackson has spent his entire career being banged up. Pierre Garcon (5-59) tied Jackson for the team lead in receptions, while Jordan Reed caught 4 balls for 56 yards. Reed's numbers weren't impressive, but he had a great play in which he reeled in a pass thrown behind him, broke 2 tackles and then sprinted for the first down.    Matt Jones didn't have a great stat line either, mustering 65 yards on 17 carries. However, he was huge at the end of the game, running powerfully and breaking tackles. He was instrumental in Washington's victory. Jones appeared to suffer a concussion at 1 point, but didn't miss much action. Robert Kelley (4-7) took his place for a bit.    The Redskins sustained multiple injuries in this contest. The maligned Bashaud Breeland was helped off the field early on when he couldn't put pressure on his leg. Later, center Kory Lichtensteiger got knocked out with a calf malady. DeAngelo Hall sustained the worst injury of them all, tearing his ACL.    Moving on to the Giants, it's safe to say that they absolutely blew this game. I mentioned the Manning interception at the goal line and Beckham's offensive pass interference, but there were numerous other plays where they made mistakes. Manning was strip-sacked early, but a teammate recovered. Shane Vereen fumbled, which would've led to Washington points had Cousins not screwed up at the end of the first half. Following the break, Manning threw an interception in the red zone, but the officials ruled it to be incomplete for some strange reason. They then weren't prepared for a Redskins fake punt conversion, which ended up costing them 3 points. The Giants blocked a punt after that which would've set them up for at least 3 points, but an unnecessary roughness penalty negated it. And speaking of unnecessary roughness, center "
