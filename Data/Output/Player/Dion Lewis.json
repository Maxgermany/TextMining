   "comment":"Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, "

Lewis, meanwhile, had just 8 carries, but turned those into 37 yards and a touchdown. If this game were closer, Lewis would've handled more of a workload. In fact, he didn't even touch the ball after the break. It's a sign that Bill Belichick values him. Lewis also caught 5 passes for 30 receiving yards. Lewis was great, breaking many ankles on his touches. It's a shame that we didn't get to see him in the second half.    As for the Jaguars, they had their chances early, despite what this score says. A holding penalty ruined their first drive, which looked promising. An illegal formation did the same on the next possession. "

   "comment":"Lewis was knocked out with a knee issue, which appears to be serious. It's a dark cloud over a victory that allowed New England to improve to 8-0. Despite what this score and the stats say, Tom Bady didn't have a great game, though it wasn't primarily his fault. He had poor blocking from his offensive line, and he often looked uncomfortable when he wasn't able to dink and dunk. This forced many errant throws, including his interception in which he didn't see Keenan Robinson. At 1 point, Brady was under heavy pressure and lofted up a helpless punt. Brandon LaFell actually had to stop for several seconds to wait for the pass, though he managed to reel in the ball for 48 yards. Any competent secondary would've picked off the pass, but Brady had the great fortune of battling a defensive backfield that's in shambles. Brady finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He easily could've thrown a third score, as Dion Lewis dropped a sure touchdown. Then again, his afternoon could've been a lot worse if the Redskins' miserable secondary managed to intercept him on that pseudo-punt. The pass protection is an issue, but not against crap opponents like Washington and the 3 other awful teams in the AFC East.    Brady's touchdowns went to "

For the Jets, this was certainly a disappointing loss. The team put together a very strong effort, but they could not do enough to take down the Patriots. It is hard to blame Ryan Fitzpatrick for the results of today's game. The veteran got the start, despite some cries for Bryce Petty, and actually played relatively well. Fitzpatrick went 22-of-32 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. He displayed excellent accuracy and touch on his passes, and was able to limit his mistakes.

Hackenberg was inactive for some strange reason, though perhaps it had to do with Todd Bowles' hospitalization. Bowles clearly didn't have all of his mental faculties intact when he made the decision to deactivate Hackenberg. Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way and was his usual, pedestrian self. Fitzpatrick's numbers were awful - 8-of-21 for 136 yards, 2 interceptions - but he should've thrown a touchdown, as Seferian-Jenkins had the aforementioned drop. If Petty can't play in Week 17, Hackenberg needs to start. There's absolutely no reason to keep trotting out a woeful, bearded quarterback with no future within the organization.

As for the Dolphins, Matt Moore didn't have a bad game, going 24-of-34 for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick really hurt, as it occurred when he hurled an underthrown pass while scrambling left. With the Patriots limiting Miami's possessions, every drive was going to be crucial, so the Dolphins couldn't afford that mistake. The same goes for the aforementioned Damien Williams fumble.

   "comment":"Lewis and Mike Gillislee. Lewis was used as the primary running back and showed some of the ability that made him a dangerous weapon 2 years ago. He was able to make men miss at the line of scrimmage and turn gains that should have been gone nowhere into 4.to-five-yard gains. Lewis took 15 carries for 44 yards and also handled most of the goal-line work, a trend that has continued since Gillislee fumbled a couple of weeks ago. Speaking of Gillislee, he took 11 carries for 34 yards. He saw more action later in the contest as the Patriots tried to wear down the Chargers' defense. Gillislee seems likely to continue in this role, and he won't have any fantasy value until he regains his goal-line role.    In the passing game, the Patriots had a solid performance, and much of that was thanks to the efforts of Brady. The future Hall of Famer continued to look sharp, as he has for most of the season. For all of the contest, Brady was able to throw accurate, well-placed balls that only his receivers had a chance at grabbing. Brady spent a lot of the day working the short and intermediate part of the field to hit his receivers. He never had trouble finding an open player. A couple of plays stood out from Brady's performance. One actually came on an incompletion when he heaved a ball from his own 35-yard line in an attempt to hit "

   "comment":"Lewis take it the distance to give his team a 14-3 advantage. The special-teams gaffes didn't even stop after that, as the Patriots blocked a punt when they were up 17-6. The nail in the coffin was the Broncos being whistled for a hold to negate a C.J. Anderson touchdown in the third quarter. The Patriots capitalized on all of these errors and were able to win in a blowout as a result.    Of course, Brady was terrific as usual, despite battling the No Fly Zone. Picking up where Carson Wentz left off last week, Brady torched the Broncos, going 25-of-34 for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady, who had fantastic pass protection for most of the evening, should've thrown a 4.h touchdown, but the officials incorrectly ruled that Rob Gronkowski let the ball hit the ground. Replay showed that Gronkowski made the reception, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to overturn the call.    Gronkowski ended up scoreless as a result of this horrible officiating, though he tied for the team lead with 74 receiving yards with Brandin Cooks. This wasn't the type of performance Gronkowski fantasy owners were looking for, considering how poor the Broncos have been against tight ends this year. Part of the problem was that the newly signed Martellus Bennett took away 3 receptions, which he turned into 38 yards. Also, Dwayne Allen vultured a touchdown on his only reception, an 11-yarder.    In addition to scoring on his kickoff return, Lewis found the end zone on offense, dashing for 55 yards on 14 carries. Rex Burkhead (10-36), who had the aforementioned blocked punt, also scored as a receiver, catching 3 balls for 27 yards. "
