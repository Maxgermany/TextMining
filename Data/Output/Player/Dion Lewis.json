   "comment":"Dion Lewis, thanks to awful coverage by Nigel Bradham, who was horrible in this contest. Taylor ended the first half with a pick on a very late throw across the middle. Did Rex Ryan manage to fix things after halftime? Nope. It just got worse. On 1 drive alone, the Bills saw Sammy Watkins drop a pass and commit offensive pass interference. The Bills then were called for 2 other infractions: an unsportsmanlike penalty and a hold by Cordy Glenn. Taylor then had Percy Harvin open downfield, but overshot him. Then, on a third-and-9, Taylor dumped a short pass to Robert Woods that was way short of the line to gain. Woods had no chance to get to the first-down marker. Again, all of this happened on just 1 possession. Unreal. Adding injury to insult, Aaron Williams was knocked out on an ensuing New England touchdown and had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. And if that wasn't bad enough, the team gave its fans false hope by mounting a near-comeback. The Bills drew to within 5. but more incompetence (pass interference, interception by Taylor that tipped off Watkins' hands) sealed things for New England.    The Bills gift-wrapped this victory for the Patriots with their countless, embarrassing blunders, but Tom Brady deserves all the praise in the world for his performance. Brady looked like a rotting corpse in the preseason, but has somehow been revived without any (known) cheating tactics. Brady sliced and diced Buffalo's alleged top defense, going 38-of-59 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. It didn't start well for Brady, who tossed a pair of checkdowns and then floated a ball out of bounds downfield. However, he fired a perfect, 36-yard strike to Rob Gronkowski down the seam, who was covered well. That was a sign that he'd go on to have a great afternoon, and surely enough, the Bills couldn't stop him whatsoever. He helped tally 507 net yards of offense, and his team punted just once as a result.    Brady threw 2 touchdowns to a single player, but it wasn't Rob Gronkowski. Julian Edelman snared 11 receptions for 97 yards and 2 scores. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets, which was double the amount of Buffalo's team leader (Sammy Watkins, 8). One of Edelman's scores came on a double team; he was able to get open when the 2 Buffalo players collided with each other.    It should not be a surprise that Gronkowski still had a dominant performance despite not catching a majority of Brady's touchdowns for once. Gronkowski tallied 7 catches for 113 yards and a score. The touchdown came on single coverage against Stephon Gilmore, who foolishly told the media that he wanted to cover the league's best tight end 1.on-one.    Despite Brady's great performance, he's not going to throw the ball 59 times, so it's safe to ignore Aaron Dobson and his 7.catch, 87-yard performance. Scott Chandler (3-23) should also be left on waivers.    One player you should have picked up last week (or drafted) is Dion Lewis, who once again was very impressive. Lewis had 138 total yards, 40 rushing (with a touchdown) and 98 receiving (on 6 catches). Something very telling was that Bill Belichick continued to use Lewis after he fumbled. Belichick has been notorious for benching fumblers, so he must have a lot of faith in Lewis. On the flip side, "

   "comment":"Dion Lewis getting most of the work. Blount plunged into the end zone thrice following intermission, and much of his yardage (18 carries, 78 yards) came when this game was well out of hand. Lewis, meanwhile, had just 8 carries, but turned those into 37 yards and a touchdown. If this game were closer, Lewis would've handled more of a workload. In fact, he didn't even touch the ball after the break. It's a sign that Bill Belichick values him. Lewis also caught 5 passes for 30 receiving yards. Lewis was great, breaking many ankles on his touches. It's a shame that we didn't get to see him in the second half.    As for the Jaguars, they had their chances early, despite what this score says. A holding penalty ruined their first drive, which looked promising. An illegal formation did the same on the next possession. "

   "comment":"Dion Lewis was knocked out with a knee issue, which appears to be serious. It's a dark cloud over a victory that allowed New England to improve to 8-0. Despite what this score and the stats say, Tom Bady didn't have a great game, though it wasn't primarily his fault. He had poor blocking from his offensive line, and he often looked uncomfortable when he wasn't able to dink and dunk. This forced many errant throws, including his interception in which he didn't see Keenan Robinson. At 1 point, Brady was under heavy pressure and lofted up a helpless punt. Brandon LaFell actually had to stop for several seconds to wait for the pass, though he managed to reel in the ball for 48 yards. Any competent secondary would've picked off the pass, but Brady had the great fortune of battling a defensive backfield that's in shambles. Brady finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He easily could've thrown a third score, as Dion Lewis dropped a sure touchdown. Then again, his afternoon could've been a lot worse if the Redskins' miserable secondary managed to intercept him on that pseudo-punt. The pass protection is an issue, but not against crap opponents like Washington and the 3 other awful teams in the AFC East.    Brady's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Dion Lewis nearly split the workload evenly. Blount ended up with more carries than Lewis, 20-16, but only because the Patriots fed Blount while running out the clock. Lewis had more attempts in the opening half, 9-7. Lewis also outgained Blount, 52-50, but Blount scored twice.    As for the pathetic Jets, Petty was knocked out without completing a pass; he was 0-of-3 with a pick. As mentioned, the interception wasn't his fault, but it was still disappointing that the Jets couldn't use Christian Hackenberg once Petty left the game. Hackenberg was inactive for some strange reason, though perhaps it had to do with Todd Bowles' hospitalization. Bowles clearly didn't have all of his mental faculties intact when he made the decision to deactivate Hackenberg. Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way and was his usual, pedestrian self. Fitzpatrick's numbers were awful - 8-of-21 for 136 yards, 2 interceptions - but he should've thrown a touchdown, as Seferian-Jenkins had the aforementioned drop. If Petty can't play in Week 17, Hackenberg needs to start. There's absolutely no reason to keep trotting out a woeful, bearded quarterback with no future within the organization.    The Jets wanted to establish "

   "comment":"Dion Lewis was able to vulture a touchdown away from him. Lewis gained 52 yards on 11 carries otherwise, while Gillislee tallied 44 yards on 10 attempts.    As for the Jets, McCown had a terrific stat line, going 31-of-45 for 354 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 aforementioned interceptions. This is nothing new for the Patriots' defense, which hasn't been able to stop the pass all year. It's a bad sign that Bill Belichick hasn't been able to figure anything out during his 9 days off. It's amazing that New England continued to blow tons of coverage with lots of time to prepare for this game, and it didn't help that McCown had an eternity in the pocket. Perhaps the Patriots shouldn't have cut "
