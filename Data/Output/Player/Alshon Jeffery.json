   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery. That may not have been Cutler's fault, but he did have 2 interceptions dropped by DeAngelo Hall. All hope seemed to be lost when Josh McCown stepped onto the field, but he proved to be a capable replacement. He went 14-of-20 for 204 yards and a touchdown to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. He consistently kept drives going, as Chicago punted the ball only once when McCown was in the game. I don't want to make it sound like the Bears will be better with McCown because they won't be - remember how bad Washington's defense is - but they'll still be a functional football team.    Of course, it helped McCown's cause that he could hand the ball off to Matt Forte, who had 91 yards on 16 carries. He didn't do much in the passing game - 2 catches, 18 yards - but he found the end zone on 3 occasions.    Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery had to hate seeing Cutler leave with an injury, but their numbers weren't affected. They had statistical lines of 6-75 and 4-105, respectively.    "

He seemed to suffer an injury in the second half when he was tackled awkwardly, but he returned to the field shortly afterward.    There was a humorous event in this game.

The Bears made a strong effort to run the ball. In fact, on the opening drive of the third quarter, they gave 1 of their backs a carry on every play, and it worked - until Matt Forte was stuffed on a third-and-3. Forte gained 84 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, and he also caught 5 balls for 39 receiving yards. Jeremy Langford, meanwhile, had a better YPC, accumulating 59 yards on 12 carries, but he was guilty of dropping a pass.    Save for Forte, the only Chicago receiver to register more than 35 yards was Alshon Jeffery, who logged 4 receptions for 85 yards. However, he dropped several balls, including 1 that would've moved the chains on a third down. "

Cutler tossed the ball off his back foot and didn't really look where he was throwing the pass. He followed that up by being strip-sacked in the red zone, showing absolutely zero awareness. On an ensuing drive, Cutler sailed a pass toward Alshon Jeffery that was way too high, and he later took a safety because he was stripped in his own end zone. He also had another potential pick that was dropped. Cutler finished 16-of-30 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a pair of fumbles. Sadly, those numbers are misleading because Cutler threw a 50-yard touchdown at the end of the first half that was a Hail Mary, with the ball popping into the air and landing into "

   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way."

The Eagles were backed up deep in their own territory when Wentz threw a perfect touch pass Ertz's way just over the defender. Ertz will continue to be a TE1 each week. As for Agholor and Jeffery, they were a bit less consistent. Much of Agholor's damage came on a 36-yard catch at the beginning of the contest. Jeffery had to deal with "
