   "comment":"Jeffery slipped, allowing Josh Robinson to take it back into the end zone. The replay review showed that Robinson stepped out of bounds near the 5-yard line, but Minnesota scored an easy touchdown. In the third quarter, Cutler overthrew his intended target in Minnesota territory, giving Harrison Smith a pick-six. It was amazing how inept Chicago was once they crossed midfield. They were in Vikings' territory 7 times and were able to come away with just 2 touchdowns and no field goals - though the latter became improbable when Robbie Gould suffered a minor injury in pre-game warmups. He was still able to attempt extra points, but wasn't going to try any long kicks.    Cutler went 22-of-44 for 260 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. Most notably, he left the game with an injury in the 4.h quarter. At first glance, it appeared as though it was a concussion because Everson Griffen went helmet to helmet on him, but it's reportedly a neck or a shoulder malady.    Brandon Marshall eclipsed 100 receptions on the year, breaking a Chicago single-season record, previously owned by Marty Booker. He finished with 10 grabs for 160 yards and a late touchdown from Jason Campbell (6-9, 64 yards, TD). Jeffery (3-57) caught the other score.    "

   "comment":"Jeffery. The Bears' defense couldn't keep Drew Brees from putting up points, while the Saints' defense came up with some clutch stops to keep New Orleans undefeated. The game really wasn't as close as the score, as Chicago got a late touchdown and 2.point conversion. Saints' defensive coordinator Rob Ryan has done a tremendous job this season, leading a complete turnaround to give his organization a balanced team for the first time in years. Early in the game, Brees used the unstoppable Jimmy Graham to move the ball down the field. The standout tight end dominated Chicago's safeties. After a New Orleans drive for a field goal, Malcolm Jenkins came on a safety blitz to get a sack fumble that was recovered by Cam Jordan to set up the Saints for their second field goal. Brees hit Graham for 38 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Pierre Thomas (19-36, 9-55 receiving). In the final seconds before halftime, Thomas took a 25-yard screen pass to the end zone. The Bears' defense adjusted to play better in the second half and kept New Orleans to only 2 more Garrett Hartley field goals.    Brees completed 29-of-35 passes for 288 yards with 2 touchdowns in this game. He was highly efficient and didn't make any mistakes to set up Chicago's offense. Darren Sproles (3-10 rushing, 3-31 receiving) didn't have big totals, but he churned out clutch yards. Bears cornerback Charles Tillman led the way to shut down Marques Colston (2-15).    Chicago's offense was carried by Jeffery, as New Orleans sold out to stop Brandon Marshall (4-30) and limit Matt Forte (12-55)."

All hope seemed to be lost when Josh McCown stepped onto the field, but he proved to be a capable replacement. He went 14-of-20 for 204 yards and a touchdown to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. He consistently kept drives going, as Chicago punted the ball only once when McCown was in the game. I don't want to make it sound like the Bears will be better with McCown because they won't be - remember how bad Washington's defense is - but they'll still be a functional football team.    Of course, it helped McCown's cause that he could hand the ball off to Matt Forte, who had 91 yards on 16 carries. He didn't do much in the passing game - 2 catches, 18 yards - but he found the end zone on 3 occasions.    Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery had to hate seeing Cutler leave with an injury, but their numbers weren't affected. They had statistical lines of 6-75 and 4-105, respectively.    "

   "comment":"Jeffery had a disappointing outing with just 4 grabs for 42 yards, though he had a 27-yard run wiped out by a questionable hold.    I've mentioned Forte a lot already. He managed 77 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 40 receiving yards. He seemed to suffer an injury in the second half when he was tackled awkwardly, but he returned to the field shortly afterward.    There was a humorous event in this game. There was a scrum in the first half. "

   "comment":"Jeffery had a drop, while Dante Rosario lost a fumble. Perhaps the worst thing Chicago did was show absolutely no sense of urgency despite being in a position to mount a comeback in the 4.h quarter. Down 17 and in Miami territory with 8 minutes left, Cutler lackadaisically ran the offense, letting the clock tick down. It's almost as if he was resigned to losing at that point.    Meanwhile, Chicago's defense struggled once again. Jay Ratliff was a monster with 3.5 sacks - 1 took the Dolphins out of field-goal range at the end of the first half - but barely anyone else performed well. The Bears allowed Ryan Tannehill to fire just 7 incompletions, as the Miami quarterback went 25-of-32 for 277 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 48 rushing yards, which included a 30-yard scamper on a 4.h-down read-option play. Tannehill's only real mistake on the afternoon was holding the ball too long on 1 of his sacks that, as mentioned, put his team out of kicking range prior to intermission. Tannehill's scores went to Mike Wallace (5-46) and Charles Clay (4-58). Rookie Jarvis Landry, who had an impressive showing last week, was the only other Dolphin with more than 3 receptions (4-46).    Lamar Miller couldn't break any long gains, but he had some consistent runs, picking up 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. He also caught 2 balls for 22 receiving yards. He had a second score negated by a hold.    Some stats for the Bears: - Cutler went 21-of-34 for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick and lost fumble. - Forte, as discussed, wasn't given much of an opportunity in the opening half. However, he still scored twice (once rushing, once receiving), gaining 49 yards on the ground (12 carries) and 60 yards through the air (6 catches). The Dolphins have a strong ground defense, but there's no excuse for Forte not rushing the ball more than twice. - Both Jeffery (2-9) and Brandon Marshall (6-48) both had disappointing afternoons."

   "comment":"Jeffery hobbled with a hamstring injury - he was limping around despite the fact that he caught 6 balls for 95 yards and a touchdown - Jay Cutler had no 1 to throw to on most plays besides Martellus Bennett and Matt Forte. Cutler finished 32-of-46 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and a late interception when he underthrew his receiver in the end zone. Most of his yardage came when Dallas essentially had this game in hand, as he just couldn't get going without Marshall. As was the case last week, penalties and mistakes ruined Chicago drives. Matt Forte's lost fumble at the beginning of the third quarter was especially painful. Down 14-7, the Bears got close to midfield, but Forte coughed the ball up, and the Cowboys returned it deep into Chicago's territory. They scored a touchdown, increasing their lead to double digits.    Cutler's touchdowns went to Jeffery and Bennett (12-84). Forte, meanwhile, did most of his damage as a pass-catcher, hauling in 8 balls for 74 receiving yards. He surprisingly was extremely limited on the ground, gaining just 26 yards on 13 carries, though he did score once. He also had the aforementioned fumble (his second of the year), which, along with Marshall's injury, absolutely killed the Bears' chances of pulling the upset.   "

   "comment":"Jeffery for a potential deep touchdown, and he later nearly tossed a second pick in overtime, but Corey Lemonier dropped a ball that fell right into his lap.    The Bears made a strong effort to run the ball. In fact, on the opening drive of the third quarter, they gave 1 of their backs a carry on every play, and it worked - until Matt Forte was stuffed on a third-and-3. Forte gained 84 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, and he also caught 5 balls for 39 receiving yards. Jeremy Langford, meanwhile, had a better YPC, accumulating 59 yards on 12 carries, but he was guilty of dropping a pass.    Save for Forte, the only Chicago receiver to register more than 35 yards was Alshon Jeffery, who logged 4 receptions for 85 yards. However, he dropped several balls, including 1 that would've moved the chains on a third down. "

Jordan Howard, meanwhile, was excellent in his initial start, gaining 111 yards on 23 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 21 receiving yards. He also drew a pass-interference flag near the goal line. Howard thrived in the preseason, so it's hardly a surprise that he looked so dynamic in his first start. If he keeps performing like this, Jeremy Langford won't be getting his job back.    As for the Bears' dynamic receivers, both are dealing with injuries, which would explain the meager stat totals. Jeffery caught 3 balls for 46 yards and didn't look like quite himself. White, meanwhile, had been enjoying a solid afternoon - 6 grabs, 55 yards - but left the game with an ankle injury and never returned.    It needs to be mentioned that "

   "comment":"Jeffery in the end zone. Instead, he hurled an inaccurate ball toward 1 of his other targets, which fell incomplete.    As for Andrew Luck, he threw a number of beautiful passes against Chicago's injury-ravaged defense. He lofted a perfect touch pass to Phillip Dorsett on a third-and-12 right outside the red zone, which ultimately led to a touchdown thrown to Dwayne Allen. Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2.and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as Willie Young logged a trio of sacks. Luck took 6 sacks the week before by the Jaguars, who put no pressure on quarterbacks, so this is obviously an issue. Ryan Grigson discussed not being able to build a championship defense because of Luck's contract... so what about the offensive line?    Luck's 2 touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (10-171) and Dwayne Allen (6-50). They were the only Indianapolis players to eclipse the 30-yard mark. This includes Dorsett, who was once again disappointing. He caught 2 balls for 26 yards, only seeing 3 targets. He was expected to be a greater factor with Donte Moncrief out with an injury, but that hasn't been the case.    The Colts didn't run the ball very much, but when they did, they had success doing so. Frank Gore gained 75 yards on 14 carries. He had just 4 rushes in the opening half, which is puzzling, to say the least.    Moving back to the Bears, Meredith will be seen as the goat for losing that key fumble, so it's a shame that it spoiled such a terrific afternoon. He caught a whopping 9 passes for 130 yards and a touchdown. He served as Hoyer's favorite target, as Jeffery (5-77) once again didn't look 100 percent, though he was certainly improved. Remember, Jeffery should've had a game-winning score, but Hoyer didn't see him. Meanwhile, "

He followed that up by being strip-sacked in the red zone, showing absolutely zero awareness. On an ensuing drive, Cutler sailed a pass toward Alshon Jeffery that was way too high, and he later took a safety because he was stripped in his own end zone. He also had another potential pick that was dropped. Cutler finished 16-of-30 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a pair of fumbles. Sadly, those numbers are misleading because Cutler threw a 50-yard touchdown at the end of the first half that was a Hail Mary, with the ball popping into the air and landing into "

   "comment":"Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way."

   "comment":"Jeffery, setting up a touchdown. Following a poor Arizona drive, Kenjon Barner took a punt deep into Cardinals' territory to set up another score. On Philadelphia's next possession, Torrey Smith finally didn't drop a deep pass, hauling in a 59-yard touchdown. The Eagles sputtered a bit after that through the end of the opening half, but they put the clamps on Arizona following intermission, outscoring them 13-0 in the second half.    Wentz was excellent, going 21-of-30 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half, which was a deep shot into the end zone. Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to Nelson Agholor (4-93), Smith (3-70), Zach Ertz (6-61) and Trey Burton (2-16). Jeffery didn't join in the party, but a 16-yard reception of his helped set up a touchdown. He caught 3 balls for 31 yards, as "
