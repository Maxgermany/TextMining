   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery. That may not have been Cutler's fault, but he did have 2 interceptions dropped by DeAngelo Hall. All hope seemed to be lost when Josh McCown stepped onto the field, but he proved to be a capable replacement. He went 14-of-20 for 204 yards and a touchdown to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. He consistently kept drives going, as Chicago punted the ball only once when McCown was in the game. I don't want to make it sound like the Bears will be better with McCown because they won't be - remember how bad Washington's defense is - but they'll still be a functional football team.    Of course, it helped McCown's cause that he could hand the ball off to Matt Forte, who had 91 yards on 16 carries. He didn't do much in the passing game - 2 catches, 18 yards - but he found the end zone on 3 occasions.    Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery had to hate seeing Cutler leave with an injury, but their numbers weren't affected. They had statistical lines of 6-75 and 4-105, respectively.    "

   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery for a potential deep touchdown, and he later nearly tossed a second pick in overtime, but Corey Lemonier dropped a ball that fell right into his lap.    The Bears made a strong effort to run the ball. In fact, on the opening drive of the third quarter, they gave 1 of their backs a carry on every play, and it worked - until Matt Forte was stuffed on a third-and-3. Forte gained 84 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, and he also caught 5 balls for 39 receiving yards. Jeremy Langford, meanwhile, had a better YPC, accumulating 59 yards on 12 carries, but he was guilty of dropping a pass.    Save for Forte, the only Chicago receiver to register more than 35 yards was Alshon Jeffery, who logged 4 receptions for 85 yards. However, he dropped several balls, including 1 that would've moved the chains on a third down. "

   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery. To end the drive, Jeremy Langford plunged into the end zone from a yard out and gave the Bears a quick 7-0 lead. Chicago's defense quickly got off the field and Eddie Royal had a 31-yard punt return to the Texans' 40-yard line, but the Texans stopped the Bears on 4.h-and-1 to get the ball back. Houston was able to get a field goal drive thanks to Miller's running. The Texans took the lead with a 23-yard touchdown to Hopkins as, once again, he made a phenomenal contested catch. At the end of the second quarter, Will Fuller dropped what would have been an 83-yard touchdown, and the Bears responded by hitting Jeffery for a 54-yard gain. With only a play before having to settle a field goal, Cutler threw a perfect strike to Royal for a 19-yard touchdown after he worked over Kareem Jackson. That gave the Bears a 14-10 halftime lead. At the start of the third quarter, Kevin White ran the wrong route, and that let Andre Hal pick off a pass to set up the Texans in Chicago territory. Houston had to settle for a field goal. Late in the third quarter, Fuller caught a 27-yard pass to get into Bears territory. He finished the drive by making a shoestring catch on a wide receiver screen before using his speed to dart down the field for an 18-yard touchdown. Shortly later on a third down, Fuller made a superb leaping grab of about 30 yards and set up a short field goal for Nick Novak. Houston's defense then slammed the door for the win.    Brock Osweiler completed 22-of-35 for 231 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He threw the ball better than the numbers illustrate, and he easily could have had a couple more touchdown passes.    Lamar Miller ran for 106 yards on 28 carries with 4 receptions for 11 yards.    DeAndre Hopkins had 5 catches for 54 yards with a score. Will Fuller (5-107-1) had a great debut aside from his drop. Chicago's corners couldn't run with Fuller, especially in the second half. Osweiler targeted Fuller heavily, at times more than Hopkins, and if you need a wideout for your fantasy team, Fuller could be an adept pickup.    Jay Cutler was 16-of-29 for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He played better than the numbers illustrate as well. The Bears' offensive tackles got whipped in the second half.    Jeremy Langford ran for 57 yards on 17 carries, but bailed out his fantasy owners with a score.    Alshon Jeffery had 4 catches for 105 yards. Eddie Royal (4-57-1) chipped well in the first half, and Kevin White (3-34) flashed at times.    Chicago's front 7 played well overall, but the secondary struggled. "

   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery, who wasn't open. His next pick occurred soon after, and it was even worse. Cutler tossed the ball off his back foot and didn't really look where he was throwing the pass. He followed that up by being strip-sacked in the red zone, showing absolutely zero awareness. On an ensuing drive, Cutler sailed a pass toward Alshon Jeffery that was way too high, and he later took a safety because he was stripped in his own end zone. He also had another potential pick that was dropped. Cutler finished 16-of-30 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a pair of fumbles. Sadly, those numbers are misleading because Cutler threw a 50-yard touchdown at the end of the first half that was a Hail Mary, with the ball popping into the air and landing into "

   "comment":"Alshon Jeffery down the field on a play that would have been a touchdown. In other circumstances, Wentz just misfired by a bit, but he was bailed out by a couple of pass interference calls. Despite all this, Wentz still had some bright spots. In 1 instance, he made a nice 11-yard run that saw him put a terrific juke move on a Giants defender. Additionally, he had a couple of nice throws in the red zone to Zach Ertz and deserves credit for that. The Giants are a solid defensive unit, but Wentz will have a chance to improve in their next matchup.    For the second straight week, Ertz (8-55) was the top target for Wentz. Though he caught the lone touchdown pass of the contest, Ertz had his fair share of issues. He dropped a touchdown pass on which he was wide open, though he did get the score 1 play later. However, his worst play came when he fumbled the ball to the Giants and gave them great field position on their game-tying drive. Ertz still put up TE1 numbers, but he could have had a much-better performance. As for the other receivers, Alshon Jeffery (4-56) and Torrey Smith (4-29) led the way."

Moving on to the Broncos, it was another rough game for them, as they couldn't generate any semblance of offense. Ignore the 23-point total; the Eagles were up 44-9 when they pulled Wentz. Denver scored a touchdown in garbage time, and then the defense reached the end zone on a strip-six when "
