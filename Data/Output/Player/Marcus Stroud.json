   "comment":"Marcus Stroud ate them both alive. Taylor caught 2 balls for 17 yards. Kent had no receptions.    Impressive performance by the Bills despite losing Angelo Crowell for the year earlier this week. Buffalo sacked Matt Hasselbeck 5 times and limited the Seattle quarterback to a 4.6 YPA.   "
