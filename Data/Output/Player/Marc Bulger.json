Seneca Wallace engineered 2 4.h quarter drives of 80 and 60 yards to score the final 10 points of this contest.    This was a must-lose game for both teams in terms of NFL Draft consideration, so Seahawks fans have to be disappointed. They can blame Seneca Wallace (15-of-25 for 226 yards), Maurice Morris (15 carries, 86 yards), and Deion Branch and John Carlson (5 catches, 76 yards each).    As for the Rams, Marc Bulger finished 19-of-32 for 207 yards and a score. Bulger located "

Moss once again had a lackluster performance, catching just 3 balls for 35 yards. Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.    Two guys who didn't disappoint were Steven Jackson and Laurent Robinson. The former mustered 104 yards on 17 rushes, while the latter hauled in 6 balls for 54 yards and a touchdown.    Marc Bulger was a horrific 15-of-28 for 125 yards and a score, giving him a YPA of 4.5. There is no doubt that Bulger's starting days in the NFL are numbered.    "
