   "comment":"Bulger threw an ugly duck to Steven Jackson in the second quarter.    The Rams had the last laugh though, somehow pulling the upset on the road despite the fact that Washington was the largest favorite this week. St. Louis' 19-17 victory was very inexplicable, especially considering that the team failed to score an offensive touchdown. The only time the Rams reached the end zone was on a 75-yard O.J. Atogwe fumble recovery on a Jason Campbell tipped pass that landed in the arms of offensive lineman Pete Kendall. Instead of falling on the ground, Kendall started running and was subsequently stripped.    No overly impressive numbers from anyone on St. Louis' offense, though Donnie Avery had 4 catches and 73 yards, including a great, 1.handed, 43-yard grab that set the Rams up for their winning field goal. Torry Holt had 5 catches for 23 yards. Jackson finished with 79 yards on 22 carries. Bulger was 15-of-26 for 136 yards.    Entering this game, the Redskins' offense had no turnovers on the season, which would explain their impressive and unexpected 4-1 record. Well, they had 3 on Sunday, which would explain this loss. This was a tough spot for Washington, coming off 2 consecutive divisional victories on the road. I can't really blame them for being unfocused. That said, there's no excuse for losing to the awful Rams. I thought this game would be close, but allowing Jim Haslett, a makeshift offensive line, a crippled Bulger and a Swiss cheese defense to beat you is inexcusable.    "

This was a must-lose game for both teams in terms of NFL Draft consideration, so Seahawks fans have to be disappointed. They can blame Seneca Wallace (15-of-25 for 226 yards), Maurice Morris (15 carries, 86 yards), and Deion Branch and John Carlson (5 catches, 76 yards each).

Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.    Two guys who didn't disappoint were Steven Jackson and Laurent Robinson. The former mustered 104 yards on 17 rushes, while the latter hauled in 6 balls for 54 yards and a touchdown.    Marc Bulger was a horrific 15-of-28 for 125 yards and a score, giving him a YPA of 4.5. There is no doubt that Bulger's starting days in the NFL are numbered.    "
