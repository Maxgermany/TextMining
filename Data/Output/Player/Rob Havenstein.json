That put the Falcons up 42-0 late in the third quarter. In garbage time, the Rams moved the ball versus Atlanta's backups, and on the first play of the 4.h quarter, Todd Gurley plunged into the end zone. Matt Schaub took over at quarterback for Ryan in the 4.h quarter. Goff laid out a 50-yard touchdown pass to Brian Quick, but that was called back by a very questionable pass interference. Still, it was a nice throw from the rookie signal-caller. Goff ended up having a short touchdown run with under 3 minutes remaining.    Ryan finished the game having completed 18-of-28 for 237 yards with 3 touchdowns with just 3 quarters of action. Gabriel led the Falcons in receiving with 3 receptions for 82 yards and a touchdown.    Coleman ran for 36 yards on 8 carries for a touchdown on the ground with 2 receptions for 19 yards and a score through the air. Devonta Freeman (6-6 rushing, 2-12 receiving) was held in check.    Goff ended up 24-of-41 for 235 yards, 2 interceptions and a rushing touchdown. He made some nice passes, but had a lot of problems with holding onto the ball too long as he took some terrible sacks. His offensive line struggled as well, especially Havenstein. Goff needs to make the process much faster and work off his primary read. The rest of the 2016 season will be all about Goff learning, but he been very unimpressive thus far.    Gurley compiled 61 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown. "
