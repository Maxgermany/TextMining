However, the punt sailed into the end zone, which basically saved Kansas City only 16 yards. Haley, perhaps thinking about this decision, went for it on 4th-and-2 on the next drive. "

   "comment":"Santana Moss got into the face of 1 ref and was ejected as a consequence. It seemed like a terrible call, and the 2 penalties Washington drew just made things worse. The Giants kicked off on their own 35-yard line following halftime, so they effectively had a free onside kick. New York recovered the ball and converted on a subsequent field goal. That ultimately helped them go up 2 scores. Griffin later made 1 mistake during his comeback attempt. Following a scramble in which he had an awesome stiff-arm, he was strip-sacked on a 4.h down. However, the officials once again screwed up, as they missed what should've been a 15-yard face mask penalty.    Though the Giants got a ton of help from the officials, they deserve credit for this victory. Following that horrible game against the Jaguars in which they blew a huge lead, they've come back to win a pair of games, both by double digits.
