I don't want to take everything away that long strike, but that was all Moss, who was wide open. Mike Shanahan spent a 4.h-round pick on Cousins for some strange reason, so much more was expected out of the Michigan State product, even though it was his debut. The fact remains that the Redskins, who could have possibly won this game with Griffin, had no chance with the other rookie at the helm. Griffin, by the way, went 10-of-15 for 91 passing yards and just 7 rushing yards. He barely had any time to throw.    The Redskins ran the ball well, as expected. "

   "comment":"Santana Moss for a touchdown, finishing 20-of-28 for 258 yards, 2 scores and an interception along with 89 rushing yards on 9 scrambles - stats that would've been much better had Leonard Hankerson not short-armed a deep pass. Manning, meanwhile, hit Cruz for the 77-yard game-winner and was also extremely sharp on third downs, going 8-of-12 on those situations.    Cruz caught 7 balls for 131 yards. Two other Giants snagged more than 4 passes: Martellus Bennett (5-79) and Hakeem Nicks (5-53). Nicks didn't look like himself, struggling to get open because his knee injury was still plaguing him.    Ahmad Bradshaw, who was questionable coming into this game with a foot malady, received just 12 carries. He tallied 43 yards and a touchdown. Immediately afterward, he and Tom Coughlin engaged in a verbal fight on the sideline. Perhaps Bradshaw was angry that Coughlin allowed Andre Brown (5-17) to vulture a score earlier in the contest.    Alfred Morris rushed for 120 yards on 22 carries, but also was guilty of a fumble. This occurred after a long run of his was negated by a leg whip penalty.    Both of Griffin's scores went to Santana Moss (3-67), but before you get too excited, he received just 4 targets. There's not much here, as his touchdowns were fluky. He also had the game-losing fumble near midfield. Hankerson led the team with 6 catches for 70 yards.    The Redskins suffered 2 injuries in this contest. The first was to "

   "comment":"Santana Moss in the end zone.    Ponder, despite the dubious first possession, had a pretty solid outing. He let the ball hit the ground just 3 times, going 17-of-21 for 174 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was going up against a putrid defense, but the fact remains that he played very well after the ugly interception. Ponder also had a 14-yard scramble that appeared to be another score, but replay showed that the ball was fumbled and dribbled out of bounds just short of the goal line. Unfortunately, Ponder suffered an injury on the dive and had to leave the game. "

   "comment":"Santana Moss got into the face of 1 ref and was ejected as a consequence. It seemed like a terrible call, and the 2 penalties Washington drew just made things worse. The Giants kicked off on their own 35-yard line following halftime, so they effectively had a free onside kick. New York recovered the ball and converted on a subsequent field goal. That ultimately helped them go up 2 scores. Griffin later made 1 mistake during his comeback attempt. Following a scramble in which he had an awesome stiff-arm, he was strip-sacked on a 4.h down. However, the officials once again screwed up, as they missed what should've been a 15-yard face mask penalty.    Though the Giants got a ton of help from the officials, they deserve credit for this victory. Following that horrible game against the Jaguars in which they blew a huge lead, they've come back to win a pair of games, both by double digits. "
