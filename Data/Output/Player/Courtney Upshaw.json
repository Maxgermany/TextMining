   "comment":"Upshaw, fumbling the ball away with 54 seconds to go in a tie game.    Flacco then came in and moved the ball into field goal range, but in the process, tore his ACL and possibly his MCL, ending his season. He had never missed a game in his 8 years in the league, so I guess that's why they invested in the likes of Schaub to back him up. Justin Tucker was then able to hit a game-winning 47-yard field goal, but it was a hollow victory, having already lost Forsett and Flacco.    Schaub will take over as quarterback, which hurts the Ravens' chances of winning, while also hurting the offensive players all around. The only possible upside of Schaub playing is that opposing defenses should be able to average a pick-6 or 2 against him.    The Rams totaled 213 yards on the day for a measly 3.8 yards per play with Keenum at the helm, and they continued to waste a good defense and a great running back. It had looked like there was some chance the Rams could win games based solely on those 2 parts of their offense, but the incredibly poor quarterback play was just not able to sustain even a run-based offense with a stud running back. Becoming 1-dimensional on offense is not going to be sustainable.    The Ravens' defense had been their Achilles heel this season, but once Steve Smith Sr. went out for the year, it felt somewhat hopeless if you wanted to see Flacco and company to have any consistency moving the ball. Of course now, they are without Flacco and Forsett, which means they are truly done, just as the Rams look to be with no startable quarterback in the building.   "
