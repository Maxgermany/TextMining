Considering that he had no reps during the week, nothing should be read into this outside of the fact that the Moore experiment has to conclude immediately. He's not talented to begin with, and he's making too many dumb throws. John Fox has to start Clausen next week.    Speaking of Fox, I really can't understand what he's doing.

Despite the win, the Saints just don't look like themselves. They're struggling to keep drives alive; they can't convert in the red zone; and they're turning the ball over too much. In terms of the latter, New Orleans had 2 giveaways deep in Carolina territory, including a Lance Moore fumble right at the goal line. Moore (5-37) would later redeem himself by catching a touchdown.    Drew Brees went 33-of-48 for 275 yards and the touchdown to Moore. He spread the ball around, as 6 targets caught at least 4 balls: Devery Henderson (6-59), Jeremy Shockey (6-58), David Thomas (5-42), Moore, Marques Colston (4-36) and Ladell Betts (4-23).    Pierre Thomas didn't play, so Chris Ivory (12-67) and Betts (13-47) split carries evenly. Aside from the aforementioned fumble, Ivory ran pretty well.    As for the Panthers, Jimmy Clausen (or Clawesome, as he was nicknamed in the live in-games thread) went 11-of-21 for 146 yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"Clausen! The former Notre Dame quarterback played well, and more importantly, he actually showed heart - something Jay Cutler completely lacks. Marc Trestman should've made the change earlier.    The Lions clinched a playoff spot on Saturday night with the Eagles loss to the Redskins, so this was a tune-up for Detroit with seeding and playoff positioning on the line. The Lions played a sloppy game filled with bone-headed penalties, blowing great opportunities for points and taking cheap shots at the opposition. It was a throwback game, as Detroit played like it did during the Jim Schwartz era, but against an overmatched Bears team, the Lions had too much talent to lose on the road.    The Lions got a scoring drive going midway through the first quarter. They converted a 4.h-and-5 with a screen pass to Reggie Bush (7-54 rushing, 6-44 receiving) for 21 yards, and he finished the drive with a touchdown run from 13 yards out. The Bears answered with Jimmy Clausen leading a nice drive, but they failed to produce points as Darius Slay slapped away a pass on 4."
