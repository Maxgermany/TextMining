   "comment":"Cole Beasley let the ball hit the ground inside the 10-yard line. Jason Witten's drop was also key, as it ruined a drive at the end of the second quarter. - Tony Romo (34-of-51, 337 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) had a decent game overall, but he cost his team some points by taking 2 consecutive sacks in the red zone during the first half. His pick, which came much later, was a terrible 1. - Jason Garrett screwed up a couple of times. He had to waste a timeout on defense, prompting heavy boos from the crowd, and he also failed to challenge a play in which DeMarco Murray seemed to achieve a first down. Murray seemingly hit the ground, but was actually on top of a Minnesota player. Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. Lance Dunbar and Joseph Randle combined for 4 more carries. I have no idea why Dallas didn't bother with its ground attack. - The defense let Christian Ponder look like an elite quarterback on most occasions. He completed 25-of-37 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Ponder also had a 19-yard scramble early on a third-and-9. However, he really cost his team with a late interception and a strip-sack fumble by George Selvie in the end zone, which was recovered by Nick Hayden for a score. Ponder was able to be effective most of the time because of Adrian Peterson, who seemed like he was running with extra motivation. He gained 140 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, as he dragged defenders on many of his attempts. He also caught 3 balls for 37 receiving yards. Peterson was stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 in the beginning of the second quarter when the Vikings were in the red zone. I disagreed with the call, as the correct move would've been kicking the field goal to establish a 6-3 lead.    Ponder's sole aerial touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (2-35), thanks to missed tackles by safeties Jeff Heath and Barry Church. Unfortunately, Rudolph injured his foot. It looked like it could be serious. Minnesota's leading receiver was Greg Jennings (6-56).    Minnesota right tackle Phil Loadholt was knocked out of the game with a concussion.    Going back to the Cowboys for a second, Jason Witten (8-102) had a big game despite the prior drop. Cole Beasley (6-68), Bryant and Murray (6-19) all caught 6 balls. "

Elliott burst for some tremendous runs in this contest, and he had a long gain negated by a shaky holding call.

Prescott's only mistake on the afternoon was overthrowing a wide-open Brice Butler for a potential touchdown in the second quarter.    Ezekiel Ellott was dominant, as usual. He trampled the Redskins, gaining 97 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. He also caught 2 passes for 23 receiving yards. The Redskins managed to stuff him in the backfield on some instances, but Elliott's tough running sparked many of Dallas' successful drives.    I mentioned earlier that Bryant was guilty of a drop. He still managed to lead the Cowboys in receiving, hauling in 5 balls for 72 yards. However, he was kept out of the end zone, thanks to Josh Norman's coverage. Beasley (5-56) was next on the chart.
