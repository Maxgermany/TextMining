   "comment":"Beasley let the ball hit the ground inside the 10-yard line. Jason Witten's drop was also key, as it ruined a drive at the end of the second quarter. - Tony Romo (34-of-51, 337 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) had a decent game overall, but he cost his team some points by taking 2 consecutive sacks in the red zone during the first half. His pick, which came much later, was a terrible 1. - Jason Garrett screwed up a couple of times. He had to waste a timeout on defense, prompting heavy boos from the crowd, and he also failed to challenge a play in which DeMarco Murray seemed to achieve a first down. Murray seemingly hit the ground, but was actually on top of a Minnesota player. Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. Lance Dunbar and Joseph Randle combined for 4 more carries. I have no idea why Dallas didn't bother with its ground attack. - The defense let Christian Ponder look like an elite quarterback on most occasions. He completed 25-of-37 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Ponder also had a 19-yard scramble early on a third-and-9. However, he really cost his team with a late interception and a strip-sack fumble by George Selvie in the end zone, which was recovered by Nick Hayden for a score. Ponder was able to be effective most of the time because of Adrian Peterson, who seemed like he was running with extra motivation. He gained 140 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, as he dragged defenders on many of his attempts. He also caught 3 balls for 37 receiving yards. Peterson was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 in the beginning of the second quarter when the Vikings were in the red zone. I disagreed with the call, as the correct move would've been kicking the field goal to establish a 6-3 lead.    Ponder's sole aerial touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (2-35), thanks to missed tackles by safeties Jeff Heath and Barry Church. Unfortunately, Rudolph injured his foot. It looked like it could be serious. Minnesota's leading receiver was Greg Jennings (6-56).    Minnesota right tackle Phil Loadholt was knocked out of the game with a concussion.    Going back to the Cowboys for a second, Jason Witten (8-102) had a big game despite the prior drop. Cole Beasley (6-68), Bryant and Murray (6-19) all caught 6 balls. "

Williams drew a taunting penalty following his touchdown and that allowed the Dolphins to drive the field when they were struggling, but they didn't really have many successful drives other than that, so it didn't matter.    With Romo back under center, things opened up for Darren McFadden, who was able to gash the Dolphins for 129 yards on 29 carries. Robert Turbin was mixed in with 7 attempts for 35 yards. McFadden converted a big fourth down in the opening quarter when Dallas was on its side of midfield, which was a big statement that established the tempo of the game.    As for the Dolphins, they had yet another ugly showing. "

   "comment":"Beasley even mimicked Bryant, dropping a touchdown. Prescott finished 25-of-45 for 227 yards. He also rushed twice for 12 yards. Prescott's stat line would've been much better if it weren't for all of the drops, and it needs to be noted that he was battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL. Despite this, Prescott nearly led the Cowboys on a game-winning drive, but Terrance Williams stupidly did not get out of bounds as the clock was ticking down. Prescott attempted to spike the ball, but ran out of time.    As for his rookie teammate, Elliott didn't have as much success, mustering only 51 yards on 20 carries, though he did score once. What needs to be factored in is that Elliott was going against what could be the top run defense in the NFL. No 1 is going to rush the ball successfully against Snacks Harrison and Johnathan Hankins.    Prescott's top target was Jason Witten, who saw 14 balls go his way. Witten snatched 9 of them for 66 yards, and he would've secured a 10th if he didn't lose the ball in the sunlight. It needs to be emphasized how much of a problem this was, as the light was blinding for the Cowboys in the direction they were moving in during the fourth quarter. The Cowboys need to reconsider ever having a 4 p.m. home start time again in September and October. That, or Jerry Jones needs to throw another billion dollars into his precious monstrosity.    Beasley was next on the receiving chart, catching 8 passes for 65 yards. As mentioned he dropped a touchdown, much like Bryant, who hauled in only 1 ball for 8 yards. Both had drops in the sunlight. It was embarrassing, and it epitomized Jones' ownership in the post-Jimmy Johnson era. Jones likes to think big, but doesn't take care of all the smaller, important details.    OK, that was the last time I'll rip Jones, so let's just begin discussing the Giants. New York's offensive line was seen as a big problem area heading into the year, but I don't think we learned anything. The Cowboys had zero pass rush in this game, though that was to be expected because all of their key players were missing. One of the FOX announcers said it best when he noted that there were drug suspensions all over their defense. With no defenders in his face, "

Elliott burst for some tremendous runs in this contest, and he had a long gain negated by a shaky holding call.

He trampled the Redskins, gaining 97 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. He also caught 2 passes for 23 receiving yards. The Redskins managed to stuff him in the backfield on some instances, but Elliott's tough running sparked many of Dallas' successful drives.    I mentioned earlier that Bryant was guilty of a drop. He still managed to lead the Cowboys in receiving, hauling in 5 balls for 72 yards. However, he was kept out of the end zone, thanks to Josh Norman's coverage. Beasley (5-56) was next on the chart.

Beasley caught a double-tipped pass by stretching his arm behind his head and pinning the ball behind the back of his jersey. If you somehow haven't seen it, make sure you look it up. It was ridiculous.   "
