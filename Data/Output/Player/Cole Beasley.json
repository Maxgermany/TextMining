   "comment":"Cole Beasley let the ball hit the ground inside the 10-yard line. Jason Witten's drop was also key, as it ruined a drive at the end of the second quarter. - Tony Romo (34-of-51, 337 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) had a decent game overall, but he cost his team some points by taking 2 consecutive sacks in the red zone during the first half. His pick, which came much later, was a terrible 1. - Jason Garrett screwed up a couple of times. He had to waste a timeout on defense, prompting heavy boos from the crowd, and he also failed to challenge a play in which DeMarco Murray seemed to achieve a first down. Murray seemingly hit the ground, but was actually on top of a Minnesota player. Had Garrett threw the red flag, the Cowboys could've kept a drive alive. - Dez Bryant (6-64) had a miserable second half. It started when he committed offensive pass interference. The call was questionable, but Bryant made it worse by taking his helmet off, which drew a personal-foul flag. Bryant later dropped a pass that hit him right in the numbers. - Offensive coordinator Bill Callahan had DeMarco Murray run the ball just 4 times. FOUR times! Murray gained 31 yards on those attempts. Lance Dunbar and Joseph Randle combined for 4 more carries. I have no idea why Dallas didn't bother with its ground attack. - The defense let Christian Ponder look like an elite quarterback on most occasions. He completed 25-of-37 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Ponder also had a 19-yard scramble early on a third-and-9. However, he really cost his team with a late interception and a strip-sack fumble by George Selvie in the end zone, which was recovered by Nick Hayden for a score. Ponder was able to be effective most of the time because of Adrian Peterson, who seemed like he was running with extra motivation. He gained 140 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, as he dragged defenders on many of his attempts. He also caught 3 balls for 37 receiving yards. Peterson was stuffed on a 4.h-and-1 in the beginning of the second quarter when the Vikings were in the red zone. I disagreed with the call, as the correct move would've been kicking the field goal to establish a 6-3 lead.    Ponder's sole aerial touchdown went to Kyle Rudolph (2-35), thanks to missed tackles by safeties Jeff Heath and Barry Church. Unfortunately, Rudolph injured his foot. It looked like it could be serious. Minnesota's leading receiver was Greg Jennings (6-56).    Minnesota right tackle Phil Loadholt was knocked out of the game with a concussion.    Going back to the Cowboys for a second, Jason Witten (8-102) had a big game despite the prior drop. Cole Beasley (6-68), Bryant and Murray (6-19) all caught 6 balls. "

Williams drew a taunting penalty following his touchdown and that allowed the Dolphins to drive the field when they were struggling, but they didn't really have many successful drives other than that, so it didn't matter.    With Romo back under center, things opened up for Darren McFadden, who was able to gash the Dolphins for 129 yards on 29 carries. Robert Turbin was mixed in with 7 attempts for 35 yards. McFadden converted a big 4.h down in the opening quarter when Dallas was on its side of midfield, which was a big statement that established the tempo of the game.    As for the Dolphins, they had yet another ugly showing. "
