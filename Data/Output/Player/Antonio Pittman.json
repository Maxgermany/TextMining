Kenneth Darby actually out-gained him (32 yards) but carried the ball only 4 times.    What pisses me off about this game is that FOX continued to air it despite the score being 40-0. Did it ever occur to the geniuses who run the network that people wouldn't be watching a 40-point blowout? FOX didn't take me to a different contest until this debacle - yes, I used that word correctly - was over. Did the producer tease the Rams down to +43.5 or something? If so, I'm glad he lost.   "
