Rudi Johnson had twice as many carries (8) as Johnson scored the opening touchdown of the game, it marked the first time the Lions have scored in the first quarter this season! It was also Detroit's first lead of the year! Hooray!    When the Lions kicked a field goal to extend their lead to 10-3, I wondered if I could say that they were running up the score. As Chris Berman would declare on the old <i> NFL Primetime</i>, Frisky Lions! Courageous Lions! I want courage! I want courrrrage!    Unfortunately, Detroit never made it to the Wizard. They eventually relinquished their lead - they held a 10-9 advantage late in the third quarter - and lost by 8. Of course, Washington had to kick that last field goal to screw me. Thanks a lot, jerks!    But hey... I can't blame the Redskins for being too good for the crappy Lions. Detroit converted just 2-of-12 third-down opportunities and punted on every single possession in the third quarter.    I don't know why Dan Orlovsky didn't go to Calvin Johnson more.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a Gosder Cherilus illegal motion. The next play was an interception.    Aside from not allowing the Lions to win, Payton refused to bench Drew Brees, even when the score was 42-7 late in the 4.h quarter. Payton continued to call pass plays, embarrassing a team facing the worst type of humiliation possible. Brees consequently was 30-of-40 for 351 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Brees found Colston 9 times for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jeremy Shockey (5 catches, 37 yards) and Lance Moore (4 catches, 36 yards) disappointed.    Pierre Thomas owners had to be pretty pissed off that Deuce McAllister robbed them of 9 rushes and a score. However, the Frenchman was still able to tally 93 total yards and a touchdown.    The leading rusher in this contest was Kevin Smith, who compiled 111 yards and a score on 24 carries. Meanwhile, Calvin Johnson had just 4 grabs for 64 yards.    The Lions have become the first 0-15 team in NFL history. They have a chance to make history when they travel to Lambeau Field next week.    Brees, meanwhile, needs 402 yards to eclipse Dan Marino's single-season record for passing yards. Brees has thrown for at least that amount twice this season. He'll have to do so against the Panthers, unfortunately.   Johnson touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a Gosder Cherilus illegal motion. The next play was an interception.

He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson. Ryan Grant. Jahvid Best... Yeah, not so much. The Lions were already missing their top 2 quarterbacks, while the Packers had to use backup, Matt Flynn, because Aaron Rodgers suffered a concussion in the second quarter when he was hit in the head while going to the ground. Rodgers finished the game 7-of-11 for 46 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault (Jennings dropped a perfect pass). This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back James Starks looked good last week. Neither Starks (6-8) nor Brandon Jackson (7-19) found much success. In fact, Green Bay's leading rusher was Rodgers with 25 yards, which is sad because he played just a quarter and a half.    While Flynn struggled, Drew Stanton wasn't any better. He went 10-of-22 for 117 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 bone-headed interceptions. Like last week, Stanton continuously dropped back 5,000 yards in the pocket and took a 19-yard sack on 1 occasion. Stanton also couldn't get the ball to Calvin Johnson, whose only catch (44 yards) came with 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. In fact, only 2 Lions caught more than 1 pass: "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson (6 receptions for 102 yards) is on his team right? The kick gave them a 13-12 lead. The 49ers answered immediately with another long run from Gore covering 55 yards plus an extra 15 on a questionable horse-collar personal foul. This time, the Lions stood up in the red zone, forcing a pair of incompletions, though an Akers field goal put the visitors back ahead 15-13. Johnson started the next drive with a 23-yard reception, but after getting another first down by penalty, the threat was over. Eventually, I figured Smith would throw an interception even though he entered the game with just 1 on the season. An exchange of punts later, I was right. It looked like the 16-0 dream would continue for Detroit when they took over at the San Francisco 49-yard line just before the end of the third quarter. They took small gains to march down for the touchdown, then failed at math by trying for 2 points after taking a 19-15 lead with a Stafford-to-Burleson touchdown pass. Were they worried about a pair of field goals tying them? The pass to Megatron failed. Four punts later San Francisco had the ball on the Detroit 35 after a great punt return covering 40 yards from Ted Ginn Jr., who already won a game earlier this year against Seattle or at least clinched it. Runs alternated between Kendall Hunter (8 carries for 33 yards) and Gore on the next 5 plays before the game was put on the arm of Smith. 49er fans would usually expect Smith to choke in this spot, from the 10-yard line with 2:15 to play needing a touchdown facing second-and-goal. He passed left to Crabtree, missed his next throw under pressure and, with the game on the line, got the ball to tight end Delanie Walker on 4.h down. Walker did the rest, barely stretching for the end zone and a 22-19 lead. At this point, I fully expected Stafford to find a groove with 1:51 to play and San Francisco playing soft. Instead, he followed a short 5-yard pass to Pettigrew with incompletions intended for Young, Pettigrew and Burleson to turn the ball over on downs. Notice none of those went to Johnson, who was doubled up. Does that really matter though given his physical ability? San Francisco ran Gore 3 times for 6 yards forcing Detroit to run through their timeouts. Another Akers field goal made it 25-19. Still, Stafford would pull something out right? Wrong, he was sacked by Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, who had a great game, to start a mess of a final drive when given 1:02 to scramble for a comeback. Maurice Morris, who tried to give them a power-running game (5 carries for 20 yards) they sorely lacked, caught a pass for 7 yards. Then an incompletion to Young and a far-too-late completion to Johnson on the final play brought this 1 to a merciful end. The aftermath was far more exciting. Harbaugh was overly exuberant as he strutted over to shake Schwartz's hand. He gave him an obnoxiously hard handshake and patted, some might say shoved, him on the back. Schwartz took exception and kind of ran after him as almost everyone reading this has probably seen. There were way too many people on the field for anything to happen, but it was an interesting moment. Schwartz knows all about big celebrations with his punching motion deal he does, so I am not sure why he was so offended by Harbaugh's excitement. This was a big road win by the 49ers, who controlled this game with their defense. Rookie Mikel LeShoure might have given Detroit more of a running threat, but once Calvin Johnson was prevented from taking over the game, the Lions struggled to move the ball. It didn't even matter that Smith was 17-for-32 passing for just 125 yards. The 49ers also lost the turnover battle 2-0 and committed 15 penalties for 120 yards. Getting the ball twice on turnovers and picking up better than a football field in penalty yardage should be enough to win a game at home. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Johnson (6 receptions for 102 yards) is on his team right? The kick gave them a 13-12 lead. The 49ers answered immediately with another long run from Gore covering 55 yards plus an extra 15 on a questionable horse-collar personal foul. This time, the Lions stood up in the red zone, forcing a pair of incompletions, though an Akers field goal put the visitors back ahead 15-13. Johnson started the next drive with a 23-yard reception, but after getting another first down by penalty, the threat was over. Eventually, I figured Smith would throw an interception even though he entered the game with just 1 on the season. An exchange of punts later, I was right.

They took small gains to march down for the touchdown, then failed at math by trying for 2 points after taking a 19-15 lead with a Stafford-to-Burleson touchdown pass. Were they worried about a pair of field goals tying them? The pass to Megatron failed. Four punts later San Francisco had the ball on the Detroit 35 after a great punt return covering 40 yards from Ted Ginn Jr., who already won a game earlier this year against Seattle or at least clinched it. Runs alternated between Kendall Hunter (8 carries for 33 yards) and Gore on the next 5 plays before the game was put on the arm of Smith. 49er fans would usually expect Smith to choke in this spot, from the 10-yard line with 2:15 to play needing a touchdown facing second-and-goal. He passed left to Crabtree, missed his next throw under pressure and, with the game on the line, got the ball to tight end Delanie Walker on 4.h down. Walker did the rest, barely stretching for the end zone and a 22-19 lead. At this point, I fully expected Stafford to find a groove with 1:51 to play and San Francisco playing soft. Instead, he followed a short 5-yard pass to Pettigrew with incompletions intended for Young, Pettigrew and Burleson to turn the ball over on downs. Notice none of those went to Johnson, who was doubled up. Does that really matter though given his physical ability? San Francisco ran Gore 3 times for 6 yards forcing Detroit to run through their timeouts. Another Akers field goal made it 25-19. Still, Stafford would pull something out right? Wrong, he was sacked by Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, who had a great game, to start a mess of a final drive when given 1:02 to scramble for a comeback. Maurice Morris, who tried to give them a power-running game (5 carries for 20 yards) they sorely lacked, caught a pass for 7 yards. Then an incompletion to Young and a far-too-late completion to Johnson on the final play brought this 1 to a merciful end. The aftermath was far more exciting. Harbaugh was overly exuberant as he strutted over to shake Schwartz's hand. He gave him an obnoxiously hard handshake and patted, some might say shoved, him on the back. Schwartz took exception and kind of ran after him as almost everyone reading this has probably seen. There were way too many people on the field for anything to happen, but it was an interesting moment. Schwartz knows all about big celebrations with his punching motion deal he does, so I am not sure why he was so offended by Harbaugh's excitement. This was a big road win by the 49ers, who controlled this game with their defense. Rookie Mikel LeShoure might have given Detroit more of a running threat, but once Calvin Johnson was prevented from taking over the game, the Lions struggled to move the ball. It didn't even matter that Smith was 17-for-32 passing for just 125 yards. The 49ers also lost the turnover battle 2-0 and committed 15 penalties for 120 yards.

Megatron regularly made big plays against a defense that seemed confused about his status as an elite force of nature. After an exchange of punts, Oakland started to open up the passing game, which was open against a defense weakened by the loss of free safety Chris Harris. Darrius Heyward-Bey had a 35-yard gain to bail the Raiders out of poor field position, and then he caught a 43-yard touchdown to put Oakland back on top 14-7. Heyward-Bey (8-155 yards, TD) broke loose from Chris Houston's attempt to knock him over and sprinted to the end zone. Another exchange of punts, Detroit got its offense in gear again. Johnson was covered by Rolando McClain and responded with a 17-yard reception."

Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by Julius Peppers, who beat Riley Reiff. Stafford's numbers could've been a lot better though; he missed a wide-open Ryan Broyles for a touchdown, and as mentioned, Megatron (4-44, TD) just missed out on a score.    With Stafford and Johnson not playing their best, Reggie Bush was a huge spark for this offense. He made the Bears look silly, rushing for 139 yards and a touchdown on just 18 carries. He also caught 4 balls for 34 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson both lost fumbles in Dallas territory. The Lions were whistled for unnecessary roughness on top of the Megatron cough-up, which gave the Cowboys 3 free points because they couldn't move the chains, but were set up in field-goal range. The Cowboys kicked a field goal to go up 30-24 with a minute remaining, but there would've been 20 seconds or so on the clock had they not committed a holding penalty. Jim Schwartz smartly declined the infraction, saving 40 seconds. This gave Matthew Stafford enough time to hit Kris Durham for a 40-yard bomb, ultimately setting up a 1-yard sneak for the go-ahead sneak score in which he fooled everyone - including his own linemen - by faking to spike the ball. This is a great win for the Lions, who needed to prevail like this. They need to avoid mistakes - 4 turnovers against quality opponents usually won't cut it - but perhaps this victory can be used as momentum to fix things going forward. On the flip side, there's no telling what a defeat like this will do for the Cowboys. Sure, it's just a non-divisional loss, and Dallas still has control of the NFC East, but Dez Bryant's sideline tirade could really hurt the team. Bryant spent so much of the second half incoherently yelling at coaches and players. It all started when Bryant shouted get me the ball to Tony Romo repeatedly. He then barked at some coaches and Romo some more. Following Detroit's touchdown, Bryant was seen screaming at Jason Witten, with DeMarcus Ware trying to break the 2 up. Ware then grabbed Bryant and yelled at him. It was an ugly scene, reminiscent of Terrell Owens' antics. Bryant has been a good soldier this season, but this could be a very dark cloud hovering over the team in the second half of the year, despite what the Cowboy players may have told the media.    The most prominent number in this contest was 329.

Just before halftime, the Bears put together a good drive with Cutler using Alshon Jeffery (9-114) to move the chains on some clutch conversions. However, the possession was ruined by an Ndamukong Suh tipped pass that was caught by DeAndre Leavy for an interception in the end zone. Cutler wasn't same by the end of the first half as he hobbled with his hip injury, a new ankle injury and a swollen hand. In the third quarter, Reggie Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte."

Matthew Stafford was also on pace for a record-setting day, as he was 16-30 for 327 yards and 2 touchdowns at intermission. - I was excited to think about what sort of numbers Stafford and Megatron could compile. After all, Ike Taylor looked completely helpless trying to cover Megatron - not included in the stats were consecutive penalties on Taylor - but Johnson was remarkably held to no catches in the second half. He was targeted just 3 times, with 1 of the passes resulting in an interception on what was a desperation into double coverage. The Steelers made the proper adjustments to take Megatron out of the game, prompting Stafford to force poor throws elsewhere. Stafford was dreadful as a result, going just 3-of-16 for 35 yards and the pick after the break, though he was hurt by some drops. His final numbers (19-of-46, 362 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) were disappointing considering what he had going on at halftime. The Steelers, meanwhile, couldn't be stopped. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown. This was followed by 1 of the botched field goal tries. - Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson made his return in this game, so it's not a surprise that the Lions prevailed. They nearly lost though in typical Detroit fashion despite limiting the Dolphins to negative yardage in the first quarter. They hurt themselves with the normal sort of blunders, but they ultimately won this contest to improve to 7-2. What Detroit's defensive line did in the early going was just amazing. Ndamukong Suh blasted Lamar Miller for a loss of 2 yards on the first play, and then he followed that up by sacking Ryan Tannehill for a loss of 10 on the ensuing snap, as he was able to beat Mike Pouncey with a power rush. Ziggy Ansah then took over on the next drive. He snuffed out a reverse and was able to tackle Jarvis Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - "

About 2.thirds of that yardage came in the second half, as Stafford did enough on 1 drive to set up the team with a game-winning field goal.    Another reason why Stafford couldn't connect with Megatron was because Johnson. The athletic wideout continued to shine, as he caught 5 passes for 72 yards. He was 1 of 3 players to draw 7 targets. The others were Kyle Rudolph (7-69) and Matt Asiata (7-50). Greg Jennings (3-43) hauled in Bridgewater's sole touchdown. He mad a great adjustment on 1 of Bridgewater's throws, but it appeared as though he had 1 foot out of bounds. Jim Caldwell challenged, but he strangely did not win the review.    Though Asiata had a nice performance as a pass-catcher, he did very little as a runner, as he struggled to find room against Detroit's ferocious front line. He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds. That ended up costing Minnesota precious seconds.    As for the Lions, they were really fortunate to get those turnovers from Bridgewater because they did nothing offensively all afternoon. They converted just 2-of-11 third downs, as Matthew Stafford faced a ridiculous amount of pressure from Minnesota's ferocious pass rush. He struggled with his accuracy as a result, failing to find Calvin Johnson for most of this contest. Stafford went 17-of-28 for just 153 yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate, going.Johnson and Golden Tate, going. The Chargers concentrated on bracketing Megatron out of the game, and Tate ended up with the most targets, 8. but only caught 4 for 24 yards. No Lions' player topped 53 yards receiving, and Stafford never looked quite the same after taking the hard hit from Ingram, which caused Detroit's first interception. There's nothing to point toward that would prove Stafford has an injury, but the outlook of the game changed after that hit.    The 1 pass-catcher who put up decent numbers was tight end Eric Ebron, who caught 4 of 5 targets for 53 yards and a touchdown. His touchdown was a wide-open 18-yarder down the seam, while his 1 missed target was a bad drop. He still has work to do, but seems to have his arrow pointing up.    D.J. Fluker had his left leg rolled up and was carted off the field. If he misses any time, it will be a blow to San Diego's running game.    With 400-plus yards passing, there were plenty of Chargers players who put up nice numbers, and interim tight end Ladarius Green was 1 of them. It looked during the week as if Green wouldn't play due to a concussion, but he was a surprise active and caught 5 of 6 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown; a touchdown that gave the Chargers the lead for good. Green's physical ability is off the charts, and anytime he catches the ball, you know he is going to tack on a bunch of yards after the catch, and he did just that this afternoon. Green made Stephen Tulloch look like a rag doll as he stiff-armed him to the ground, and defenders appear to be moving in slow motion around him. If Green is relegated to a handful of snaps after Antonio Gatrs returns, it will be a shame.    Stevie Johnson was the other San Diego receiver to pile up yards and a touchdown as he caught all 6 of his targets, totaling 83 yards and a touchdown. He was also tackled at the 1-yard line on 1 catch before Danny Woodhead finished off the touchdown.    Neither defense dominated, but the Chargers made plays when they needed them and tightened up after the early deficit.   "

Both Johnson (3-10) were each targeted on 3 occasions. It's nice that they secured all of the passes thrown to them, but they never had much of a chance, given that Bridgewater launched the ball just 18 times. I still like Johnson more than Wallace, despite the disparity in yardage. Wallace is unreliable and inconsistent, while Johnson is Bridgewater's favorite wideout.    Meanwhile, the Lions are now 0-2.

Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown."

The officials blew a penalty that canceled out a Quandre Diggs interception, and Carr used his legs to run ball inside the 5-yard line. To finish the drive, Latavius Murray plunged into the end zone. Carr quickly led 2 field goal drives to take a 13-9 lead with 1 of the 3.pointers being a 56-yarder from Sebastian Janikowski. Detroit's offense finally started moving again thanks to a shovel pass to Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead.

His decision to bring back Mark Sanchez this past offseason was a head-scratcher at the time, especially when he traded for the injury-prone Sam Bradford. It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. Jeremy Maclin, LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and 1 of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was Jordan Matthews, who caught 3 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came very late in garbage time. Matthews dropped a pass in the third quarter, but that was a result of a brutal, but legal hit.    Excluding Matthews and someone named Trey Burton (2-49), no other Eagle had more than 21 receiving yards. Cooper (2-16) was barely a factor, while disappointing rookie Nelson Agholor (2-15) was flagged at 1 point for taking off his helmet following a first-down conversion.    It wasn't surprising to see DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. Matthew Stafford then threw behind Calvin Johnson, and that was followed by an Ameer Abdullah drop.Johnson 1.on-one with no safety help.

Megatron, who couldn't get open whatsoever against Johnson, caught just 1 of the 5 targets thrown to him for 16 yards. He was guilty of a brutal drop as well. "

The Bears had no answer for him, as he secured 10 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown. Stafford and Johnson connected on a beautiful back-shoulder connection in the first half. Stafford, meanwhile, went 28-of-39 for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Bears couldn't do anything to stop him, especially during the latter stages of the second half. They need to improve their linebacking corps and pass rush this offseason. Adding another cornerback wouldn't hurt either.    With Megatron dominating all of the targets, no other Lion registered more than 49 receiving yards. Thus, it was a disappointing showing by "
