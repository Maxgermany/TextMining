Hooray!    When the Lions kicked a field goal to extend their lead to 10-3, I wondered if I could say that they were running up the score. As Chris Berman would declare on the old NFL Primetime, Frisky Lions! Courageous Lions! I want courage! I want courrrrage!    Unfortunately, Detroit never made it to the Wizard. They eventually relinquished their lead - they held a 10-9 advantage late in the third quarter - and lost by 8. Of course, Washington had to kick that last field goal to screw me. Thanks a lot, jerks!    But hey... I can't blame the Redskins for being too good for the crappy Lions. Detroit converted just 2-of-12 third-down opportunities and punted on every single possession in the third quarter.    I don't know why Dan Orlovsky didn't go to Calvin Johnson more. Actually, I do know why - terrible arm strength and accuracy - but let's pretend that I'm clueless so I can keep complaining. Megatron caught 4 balls for 57 yards and a touchdown. Johnson also hurt his back from carrying the team.    Rudi Johnson had twice as many carries (8) as "

The Lions wouldn't start someone like that over a guy they drafted in the second round last year, right? But that's why the Lions are the Lions, and they haven't had a winning season in 5 billion years. Culpepper finished 5-of-10 for 104 yards and the pick. Stanton, playing in garbage time in the second half, was 6-of-8 for 94 yards and a touchdown, though to be fair, Stanton took 5 sacks. But 1 has to wonder why Stanton didn't start in the first place. The answer to that is the same reason why Detroit is a dreadful organization.    Aside from the aforementioned long completion to Johnson, the ultra-talented wideout caught just 1 other pass, finishing with 92 yards. "

   "comment":"Johnson touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a Gosder Cherilus illegal motion. The next play was an interception.    Aside from not allowing the Lions to win, Payton refused to bench Drew Brees, even when the score was 42-7 late in the 4.h quarter. Payton continued to call pass plays, embarrassing a team facing the worst type of humiliation possible. Brees consequently was 30-of-40 for 351 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Brees found Colston 9 times for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jeremy Shockey (5 catches, 37 yards) and Lance Moore (4 catches, 36 yards) disappointed.    Pierre Thomas owners had to be pretty pissed off that Deuce McAllister robbed them of 9 rushes and a score. However, the Frenchman was still able to tally 93 total yards and a touchdown.    The leading rusher in this contest was Kevin Smith, who compiled 111 yards and a score on 24 carries. Meanwhile, Calvin Johnson had just 4 grabs for 64 yards.    The Lions have become the first 0-15 team in NFL history. They have a chance to make history when they travel to Lambeau Field next week.    Brees, meanwhile, needs 402 yards to eclipse Dan Marino's single-season record for passing yards. Brees has thrown for at least that amount twice this season. He'll have to do so against the Panthers, unfortunately.   "

He did a great job converting third downs, as he connected on a pair of 3rd-and-11s on the opening drive. Detroit was 11-of-18 on third down. What's amazing about Culpepper's numbers is that he was frequently pressured; the Steelers sacked him 7 times. James Harrison made Jeff Backus look like a helpless child, sacking Culpepper 3 times.    Without Megatron, Dennis Northcutt led the Lions in receptions with 5 for 70 yards and a late backdoor touchdown. Bryant Johnson had 4 grabs for 35 yards.    As you might expect, "

   "comment":"Johnson made an amazing catch in the end zone, maintained control and had his knee on the ground with the ball still in his hand. It was a catch. I don't care what the rule is. I don't want to hear this second action crap. It was a catch. The only reason the ball hit the ground is because Megatron seemingly tossed the ball aside on purpose after he made the grab, as he wanted to celebrate with his teammates. I've never had a problem with official Gene Steratore, but he should be reprimanded for calling it an incompletion and robbing Detroit of a rare win.    Stafford wasn't very good overall when he was in the game (11-of-15, 83 yards), but he looked like he was getting more comfortable in the second quarter when he led his team on a 60-yard touchdown drive. It's really a shame for the Lions that they have to suffer this setback. Shaun Hill (9-of-19, 88 yards, INT) will start while Stafford is out.    Jahvid Best scored twice. That's the good news. The bad news is that he rushed for just 20 yards on 14 carries. He also chipped in with 5 catches for 16 receiving yards.    Calvin Johnson had 4 catches for 45 yards. He also was robbed of that aforementioned touchdown. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, he won't be as productive with Hill under center.    "

   "comment":"Johnson combined for just 5 catches.    Fred Jackson did it all. It seemed like every 5 minutes, NFL.com would have a Big Play Alert highlighting a long Jackson gain. Jackson rushed for 133 yards on 25 carries, and also caught 6 balls for 37 receiving yards. He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon. He had some passes dropped, but should have also tossed a couple more picks.    Calvin Johnson had 10 grabs for 128 yards and a score. "

   "comment":"Johnson. Ryan Grant. Jahvid Best... Yeah, not so much. The Lions were already missing their top 2 quarterbacks, while the Packers had to use backup, Matt Flynn, because Aaron Rodgers suffered a concussion in the second quarter when he was hit in the head while going to the ground. Rodgers finished the game 7-of-11 for 46 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault (Jennings dropped a perfect pass). This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back James Starks looked good last week. Neither Starks (6-8) nor Brandon Jackson (7-19) found much success. In fact, Green Bay's leading rusher was Rodgers with 25 yards, which is sad because he played just a quarter and a half.    While Flynn struggled, Drew Stanton wasn't any better. He went 10-of-22 for 117 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 bone-headed interceptions. Like last week, Stanton continuously dropped back 5,000 yards in the pocket and took a 19-yard sack on 1 occasion. Stanton also couldn't get the ball to Calvin Johnson, whose only catch (44 yards) came with 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. In fact, only 2 Lions caught more than 1 pass: "

   "comment":"Johnson and Ndamukong Suh. And a special congratulations to Matt Millen, whose foul stench is finally gone from this franchise. Despite Detroit's long losing streak, this is not much of an upset. The Lions have played very well this year, but have shot themselves in the foot seemingly every week. It was nice to see them not beat themselves for once.    Drew Stanton was awful last week, but rebounded against a Tampa Bay defense missing key personnel (Aqib Talib, Gerald McCoy, etc.) Stanton finished 23-of-37 for 252 yards and a touchdown.    Detroit's 2 studs on offense: Maurice Morris had 109 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Meanwhile, Calvin Johnson didn't score, but he hauled in 10 balls for 152 yards.    I want to give the Lions' offensive line some props. For the first time all year, they didn't allow a sack.    Detroit held the Buccaneers to just 20 points, but didn't tackle particularly well. "

   "comment":"Johnson end-zone grabs with a 51-yard field goal to steal a win from Dallas. It was the biggest collapse in a single game from the Cowboys in team history. The Lions played terribly in the first half, only to be out done by the Cowboys playing even worse football in the third and 4.h quarter.    To start the game, Matthew Stafford threw an interception to Cowboys safety Gerald Sensabaugh. Stafford threw behind Calvin Johnson and the ball flew directly into the stomach of Sensabaugh. Early on, Stafford was struggling and was feeling consistent pressure from the Cowboys front. The normally accurate Stafford was throwing a lot of passes short and heaved a number of passes away rather than pushing the ball downfield. In the first half, the Lions offense produced only 3 points. Stafford was 9-of-23 for 88 yards and an interception. Javhid Best had 21 yards on only 3 carries in the first half. Megatron had 3 receptions for 38 yards with "

Darrius Heyward-Bey had a 35-yard gain to bail the Raiders out of poor field position, and then he caught a 43-yard touchdown to put Oakland back on top 14-7. Heyward-Bey (8-155 yards, TD) broke loose from Chris Houston's attempt to knock him over and sprinted to the end zone. Another exchange of punts, Detroit got its offense in gear again.

Stafford converted a 3rd-and-19 with a 30-yard pass to Nate Burleson to the San Diego 3-yard line. A play later, Stafford tossed a short touchdown pass to Kevin Smith. Just before halftime, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 14-yard score. The first half ended with the Detroit up 24-0. It was utter domination on both sides of the ball by the Lions.

And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"Johnson had 1 foot inbounds in the end zone, Tony Scheffler dropped a pass on third down that could've moved the chains, and Matthew Stafford was throwing late and inaccurately. Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by Julius Peppers, who beat Riley Reiff. Stafford's numbers could've been a lot better though; he missed a wide-open Ryan Broyles for a touchdown, and as mentioned, Megatron (4-44, TD) just missed out on a score.    With Stafford and Johnson not playing their best, Reggie Bush was a huge spark for this offense. He made the Bears look silly, rushing for 139 yards and a touchdown on just 18 carries. He also caught 4 balls for 34 receiving yards.   "

   "comment":"Johnson both lost fumbles in Dallas territory. The Lions were whistled for unnecessary roughness on top of the Megatron cough-up, which gave the Cowboys 3 free points because they couldn't move the chains, but were set up in field-goal range. The Cowboys kicked a field goal to go up 30-24 with a minute remaining, but there would've been 20 seconds or so on the clock had they not committed a holding penalty. Jim Schwartz smartly declined the infraction, saving 40 seconds. This gave Matthew Stafford enough time to hit Kris Durham for a 40-yard bomb, ultimately setting up a 1-yard sneak for the go-ahead sneak score in which he fooled everyone - including his own linemen - by faking to spike the ball. This is a great win for the Lions, who needed to prevail like this. They need to avoid mistakes - 4 turnovers against quality opponents usually won't cut it - but perhaps this victory can be used as momentum to fix things going forward. On the flip side, there's no telling what a defeat like this will do for the Cowboys. Sure, it's just a non-divisional loss, and Dallas still has control of the NFC East, but Dez Bryant's sideline tirade could really hurt the team. Bryant spent so much of the second half incoherently yelling at coaches and players. It all started when Bryant shouted get me the ball to Tony Romo repeatedly. He then barked at some coaches and Romo some more. Following Detroit's touchdown, Bryant was seen screaming at Jason Witten, with DeMarcus Ware trying to break the 2 up. Ware then grabbed Bryant and yelled at him. It was an ugly scene, reminiscent of Terrell Owens' antics. Bryant has been a good soldier this season, but this could be a very dark cloud hovering over the team in the second half of the year, despite what the Cowboy players may have told the media.    The most prominent number in this contest was 329. That's the amount of receiving yards Calvin Johnson accumulated, highlighted by an 87-yard gain in which Brandon Carr missed a tackle and Barry Church took a horrible angle."

Just before halftime, the Bears put together a good drive with Cutler using Alshon Jeffery (9-114) to move the chains on some clutch conversions. However, the possession was ruined by an Ndamukong Suh tipped pass that was caught by DeAndre Leavy for an interception in the end zone. Cutler wasn't same by the end of the first half as he hobbled with his hip injury, a new ankle injury and a swollen hand. In the third quarter, Reggie Bush broke off a 40-yard run - and a horse collar penalty on Charles Tillman - to move the ball to the 4-yard line. Stafford dropped in a fade pass to Megatron, who beat Tillman for the score. The Bears answered with a 44-yard bomb to Marshall and a 17-yard toss to Jeffery to get a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Stafford overthrew Johnson in the deep middle of the field and the ball was picked off by Chris Conte."

Matthew Stafford was also on pace for a record-setting day, as he was 16-30 for 327 yards and 2 touchdowns at intermission. - I was excited to think about what sort of numbers Stafford and Megatron could compile. After all, Ike Taylor looked completely helpless trying to cover Megatron - not included in the stats were consecutive penalties on Taylor - but Johnson was remarkably held to no catches in the second half. He was targeted just 3 times, with 1 of the passes resulting in an interception on what was a desperation into double coverage. The Steelers made the proper adjustments to take Megatron out of the game, prompting Stafford to force poor throws elsewhere. Stafford was dreadful as a result, going just 3-of-16 for 35 yards and the pick after the break, though he was hurt by some drops. His final numbers (19-of-46, 362 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) were disappointing considering what he had going on at halftime. The Steelers, meanwhile, couldn't be stopped. "

This was followed by 1 of the botched field goal tries. - Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

   "comment":"Johnson made his return in this game, so it's not a surprise that the Lions prevailed. They nearly lost though in typical Detroit fashion despite limiting the Dolphins to negative yardage in the first quarter. They hurt themselves with the normal sort of blunders, but they ultimately won this contest to improve to 7-2. What Detroit's defensive line did in the early going was just amazing. Ndamukong Suh blasted Lamar Miller for a loss of 2 yards on the first play, and then he followed that up by sacking Ryan Tannehill for a loss of 10 on the ensuing snap, as he was able to beat Mike Pouncey with a power rush. Ziggy Ansah then took over on the next drive. He snuffed out a reverse and was able to tackle Jarvis Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - "

The others were Kyle Rudolph (7-69) and Matt Asiata (7-50). Greg Jennings (3-43) hauled in Bridgewater's sole touchdown. He mad a great adjustment on 1 of Bridgewater's throws, but it appeared as though he had 1 foot out of bounds. Jim Caldwell challenged, but he strangely did not win the review.    Though Asiata had a nice performance as a pass-catcher, he did very little as a runner, as he struggled to find room against Detroit's ferocious front line. He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds. That ended up costing Minnesota precious seconds.    As for the Lions, they were really fortunate to get those turnovers from Bridgewater because they did nothing offensively all afternoon. They converted just 2-of-11 third downs, as Matthew Stafford faced a ridiculous amount of pressure from Minnesota's ferocious pass rush. He struggled with his accuracy as a result, failing to find Calvin Johnson for most of this contest. Stafford went 17-of-28 for just 153 yards and a touchdown. About 2.thirds of that yardage came in the second half, as Stafford did enough on 1 drive to set up the team with a game-winning field goal.    Another reason why Stafford couldn't connect with Megatron was because "

He makes these amazing catches in pre-game warmups, and he's so athletic that the sky's the limit for him. It's almost scary to imagine what Beckham will be capable of in 2 or 3 years.    One would have thought that with the Giants' weak offensive line and the Rams' awesome defensive front, "

   "comment":"Johnson and Golden Tate, going. The Chargers concentrated on bracketing Megatron out of the game, and Tate ended up with the most targets, 8. but only caught 4 for 24 yards. No Lions' player topped 53 yards receiving, and Stafford never looked quite the same after taking the hard hit from Ingram, which caused Detroit's first interception. There's nothing to point toward that would prove Stafford has an injury, but the outlook of the game changed after that hit.    The 1 pass-catcher who put up decent numbers was tight end Eric Ebron, who caught 4 of 5 targets for 53 yards and a touchdown. His touchdown was a wide-open 18-yarder down the seam, while his 1 missed target was a bad drop. He still has work to do, but seems to have his arrow pointing up.    D.J. Fluker had his left leg rolled up and was carted off the field. If he misses any time, it will be a blow to San Diego's running game.    With 400-plus yards passing, there were plenty of Chargers players who put up nice numbers, and interim tight end Ladarius Green was 1 of them. It looked during the week as if Green wouldn't play due to a concussion, but he was a surprise active and caught 5 of 6 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown; a touchdown that gave the Chargers the lead for good. Green's physical ability is off the charts, and anytime he catches the ball, you know he is going to tack on a bunch of yards after the catch, and he did just that this afternoon. Green made Stephen Tulloch look like a rag doll as he stiff-armed him to the ground, and defenders appear to be moving in slow motion around him. If Green is relegated to a handful of snaps after Antonio Gatrs returns, it will be a shame.    Stevie Johnson was the other San Diego receiver to pile up yards and a touchdown as he caught all 6 of his targets, totaling 83 yards and a touchdown. He was also tackled at the 1-yard line on 1 catch before Danny Woodhead finished off the touchdown.    Neither defense dominated, but the Chargers made plays when they needed them and tightened up after the early deficit.   "

   "comment":"Johnson 1.on-one with no safety help. Rowe, consequently, was beaten like a drum, yet Davis made no adjustments. Kelly's offense, meanwhile, continued to be a mess. His decision to bring back Mark Sanchez this past offseason was a head-scratcher at the time, especially when he traded for the injury-prone Sam Bradford. It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. Jeremy Maclin, LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and 1 of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was "
