The Lions wouldn't start someone like that over a guy they drafted in the second round last year, right? But that's why the Lions are the Lions, and they haven't had a winning season in 5 billion years. Culpepper finished 5-of-10 for 104 yards and the pick. Stanton, playing in garbage time in the second half, was 6-of-8 for 94 yards and a touchdown, though to be fair, Stanton took 5 sacks. But 1 has to wonder why Stanton didn't start in the first place. The answer to that is the same reason why Detroit is a dreadful organization.    Aside from the aforementioned long completion to Johnson, the ultra-talented wideout caught just 1 other pass, finishing with 92 yards. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a Gosder Cherilus illegal motion. The next play was an interception.    Aside from not allowing the Lions to win, Payton refused to bench Drew Brees, even when the score was 42-7 late in the 4.h quarter. Payton continued to call pass plays, embarrassing a team facing the worst type of humiliation possible. Brees consequently was 30-of-40 for 351 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Brees found Colston 9 times for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jeremy Shockey (5 catches, 37 yards) and Lance Moore (4 catches, 36 yards) disappointed.    Pierre Thomas owners had to be pretty pissed off that Deuce McAllister robbed them of 9 rushes and a score. However, the Frenchman was still able to tally 93 total yards and a touchdown.    The leading rusher in this contest was Kevin Smith, who compiled 111 yards and a score on 24 carries. Meanwhile, Calvin Johnson had just 4 grabs for 64 yards.    The Lions have become the first 0-15 team in NFL history. They have a chance to make history when they travel to Lambeau Field next week.    Brees, meanwhile, needs 402 yards to eclipse Dan Marino's single-season record for passing yards. Brees has thrown for at least that amount twice this season. He'll have to do so against the Panthers, unfortunately.   "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson made an amazing catch in the end zone, maintained control and had his knee on the ground with the ball still in his hand. It was a catch. I don't care what the rule is. I don't want to hear this second action crap. It was a catch. The only reason the ball hit the ground is because Megatron seemingly tossed the ball aside on purpose after he made the grab, as he wanted to celebrate with his teammates. I've never had a problem with official Gene Steratore, but he should be reprimanded for calling it an incompletion and robbing Detroit of a rare win.    Stafford wasn't very good overall when he was in the game (11-of-15, 83 yards), but he looked like he was getting more comfortable in the second quarter when he led his team on a 60-yard touchdown drive. It's really a shame for the Lions that they have to suffer this setback. Shaun Hill (9-of-19, 88 yards, INT) will start while Stafford is out.    Jahvid Best scored twice. That's the good news. The bad news is that he rushed for just 20 yards on 14 carries. He also chipped in with 5 catches for 16 receiving yards.    Calvin Johnson had 4 catches for 45 yards. He also was robbed of that aforementioned touchdown. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, he won't be as productive with Hill under center.    "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson. Ryan Grant. Jahvid Best... Yeah, not so much. The Lions were already missing their top 2 quarterbacks, while the Packers had to use backup, Matt Flynn, because Aaron Rodgers suffered a concussion in the second quarter when he was hit in the head while going to the ground. Rodgers finished the game 7-of-11 for 46 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault (Jennings dropped a perfect pass). This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back James Starks looked good last week. Neither Starks (6-8) nor Brandon Jackson (7-19) found much success. In fact, Green Bay's leading rusher was Rodgers with 25 yards, which is sad because he played just a quarter and a half.    While Flynn struggled, Drew Stanton wasn't any better. He went 10-of-22 for 117 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 bone-headed interceptions. Like last week, Stanton continuously dropped back 5,000 yards in the pocket and took a 19-yard sack on 1 occasion. Stanton also couldn't get the ball to Calvin Johnson, whose only catch (44 yards) came with 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter. In fact, only 2 Lions caught more than 1 pass: "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson and Ndamukong Suh. And a special congratulations to Matt Millen, whose foul stench is finally gone from this franchise. Despite Detroit's long losing streak, this is not much of an upset. The Lions have played very well this year, but have shot themselves in the foot seemingly every week. It was nice to see them not beat themselves for once.    Drew Stanton was awful last week, but rebounded against a Tampa Bay defense missing key personnel (Aqib Talib, Gerald McCoy, etc.) Stanton finished 23-of-37 for 252 yards and a touchdown.    Detroit's 2 studs on offense: Maurice Morris had 109 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Meanwhile, Calvin Johnson didn't score, but he hauled in 10 balls for 152 yards.    I want to give the Lions' offensive line some props. For the first time all year, they didn't allow a sack.    Detroit held the Buccaneers to just 20 points, but didn't tackle particularly well. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson end-zone grabs with a 51-yard field goal to steal a win from Dallas. It was the biggest collapse in a single game from the Cowboys in team history. The Lions played terribly in the first half, only to be out done by the Cowboys playing even worse football in the third and 4.h quarter.    To start the game, Matthew Stafford threw an interception to Cowboys safety Gerald Sensabaugh. Stafford threw behind Calvin Johnson and the ball flew directly into the stomach of Sensabaugh. Early on, Stafford was struggling and was feeling consistent pressure from the Cowboys front. The normally accurate Stafford was throwing a lot of passes short and heaved a number of passes away rather than pushing the ball downfield. In the first half, the Lions offense produced only 3 points. Stafford was 9-of-23 for 88 yards and an interception. Javhid Best had 21 yards on only 3 carries in the first half. Megatron had 3 receptions for 38 yards with "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson (6 receptions for 102 yards) is on his team right? The kick gave them a 13-12 lead. The 49ers answered immediately with another long run from Gore covering 55 yards plus an extra 15 on a questionable horse-collar personal foul. This time, the Lions stood up in the red zone, forcing a pair of incompletions, though an Akers field goal put the visitors back ahead 15-13. Johnson started the next drive with a 23-yard reception, but after getting another first down by penalty, the threat was over. Eventually, I figured Smith would throw an interception even though he entered the game with just 1 on the season. An exchange of punts later, I was right. It looked like the 16-0 dream would continue for Detroit when they took over at the San Francisco 49-yard line just before the end of the third quarter. They took small gains to march down for the touchdown, then failed at math by trying for 2 points after taking a 19-15 lead with a Stafford-to-Burleson touchdown pass. Were they worried about a pair of field goals tying them? The pass to Megatron failed. Four punts later San Francisco had the ball on the Detroit 35 after a great punt return covering 40 yards from Ted Ginn Jr., who already won a game earlier this year against Seattle or at least clinched it. Runs alternated between Kendall Hunter (8 carries for 33 yards) and Gore on the next 5 plays before the game was put on the arm of Smith. 49er fans would usually expect Smith to choke in this spot, from the 10-yard line with 2:15 to play needing a touchdown facing second-and-goal. He passed left to Crabtree, missed his next throw under pressure and, with the game on the line, got the ball to tight end Delanie Walker on 4.h down. Walker did the rest, barely stretching for the end zone and a 22-19 lead. At this point, I fully expected Stafford to find a groove with 1:51 to play and San Francisco playing soft. Instead, he followed a short 5-yard pass to Pettigrew with incompletions intended for Young, Pettigrew and Burleson to turn the ball over on downs. Notice none of those went to Johnson, who was doubled up. Does that really matter though given his physical ability? San Francisco ran Gore 3 times for 6 yards forcing Detroit to run through their timeouts. Another Akers field goal made it 25-19. Still, Stafford would pull something out right? Wrong, he was sacked by Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, who had a great game, to start a mess of a final drive when given 1:02 to scramble for a comeback. Maurice Morris, who tried to give them a power-running game (5 carries for 20 yards) they sorely lacked, caught a pass for 7 yards. Then an incompletion to Young and a far-too-late completion to Johnson on the final play brought this 1 to a merciful end. The aftermath was far more exciting. Harbaugh was overly exuberant as he strutted over to shake Schwartz's hand. He gave him an obnoxiously hard handshake and patted, some might say shoved, him on the back. Schwartz took exception and kind of ran after him as almost everyone reading this has probably seen. There were way too many people on the field for anything to happen, but it was an interesting moment. Schwartz knows all about big celebrations with his punching motion deal he does, so I am not sure why he was so offended by Harbaugh's excitement. This was a big road win by the 49ers, who controlled this game with their defense. Rookie Mikel LeShoure might have given Detroit more of a running threat, but once Calvin Johnson was prevented from taking over the game, the Lions struggled to move the ball. It didn't even matter that Smith was 17-for-32 passing for just 125 yards. The 49ers also lost the turnover battle 2-0 and committed 15 penalties for 120 yards. Getting the ball twice on turnovers and picking up better than a football field in penalty yardage should be enough to win a game at home. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson. Detroit then recovered an onside kick, and Hill launched a Hail Mary that was answered when a crowd of players tipped the ball to Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), Nate Burleson (10-69, TD) and Brandon Pettigrew (8-61)."

Stafford then missed both Kris Durham and Ryan Broyles for potential scores because of overthrows.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson both lost fumbles in Dallas territory. The Lions were whistled for unnecessary roughness on top of the Megatron cough-up, which gave the Cowboys 3 free points because they couldn't move the chains, but were set up in field-goal range. The Cowboys kicked a field goal to go up 30-24 with a minute remaining, but there would've been 20 seconds or so on the clock had they not committed a holding penalty. Jim Schwartz smartly declined the infraction, saving 40 seconds. This gave Matthew Stafford enough time to hit Kris Durham for a 40-yard bomb, ultimately setting up a 1-yard sneak for the go-ahead sneak score in which he fooled everyone - including his own linemen - by faking to spike the ball. This is a great win for the Lions, who needed to prevail like this. They need to avoid mistakes - 4 turnovers against quality opponents usually won't cut it - but perhaps this victory can be used as momentum to fix things going forward. On the flip side, there's no telling what a defeat like this will do for the Cowboys. Sure, it's just a non-divisional loss, and Dallas still has control of the NFC East, but Dez Bryant's sideline tirade could really hurt the team. Bryant spent so much of the second half incoherently yelling at coaches and players. It all started when Bryant shouted get me the ball to Tony Romo repeatedly. He then barked at some coaches and Romo some more. Following Detroit's touchdown, Bryant was seen screaming at Jason Witten, with DeMarcus Ware trying to break the 2 up. Ware then grabbed Bryant and yelled at him. It was an ugly scene, reminiscent of Terrell Owens' antics. Bryant has been a good soldier this season, but this could be a very dark cloud hovering over the team in the second half of the year, despite what the Cowboy players may have told the media.    The most prominent number in this contest was 329. That's the amount of receiving yards Calvin Johnson accumulated, highlighted by an 87-yard gain in which Brandon Carr missed a tackle and Barry Church took a horrible angle."

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown. This was followed by 1 of the botched field goal tries. - Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson made his return in this game, so it's not a surprise that the Lions prevailed. They nearly lost though in typical Detroit fashion despite limiting the Dolphins to negative yardage in the first quarter. They hurt themselves with the normal sort of blunders, but they ultimately won this contest to improve to 7-2. What Detroit's defensive line did in the early going was just amazing. Ndamukong Suh blasted Lamar Miller for a loss of 2 yards on the first play, and then he followed that up by sacking Ryan Tannehill for a loss of 10 on the ensuing snap, as he was able to beat Mike Pouncey with a power rush. Ziggy Ansah then took over on the next drive. He snuffed out a reverse and was able to tackle Jarvis Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable. </i>    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to Tim Wright. Detroit's second possession saw Ameer Abdullah fumble the ball away courtesy of a strip from Tony Jefferson. Arizona couldn't do anything with the turnovers, and Stafford burned Jarraud Powers with a 50-yard pass to Corey Fuller (2-56) to the 6-yard line. The next play saw Stafford throw a touchdown pass to Theo Riddick (10-53-1). From there though, it was all Cardinals. Arizona's offense responded with a drive down the field. Carson Palmer hit Darren Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's "

The Bears were definitely screwed out of a victory, but perhaps this was for the best, as it'll give them a better draft choice come April.

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with Seth Roberts down the deep middle for a 43-yard gain. The officials blew a penalty that canceled out a Quandre Diggs interception, and Carr used his legs to run ball inside the 5-yard line. To finish the drive, Latavius Murray plunged into the end zone. Carr quickly led 2 field goal drives to take a 13-9 lead with 1 of the 3.pointers being a 56-yarder from Sebastian Janikowski. Detroit's offense finally started moving again thanks to a shovel pass to Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards. He also ran the ball 6 times for 31 yards and a touchdown.    Calvin Johnson caught 5 passes for 88 yards, and Golden Tate had 8 receptions for 73 yards. "

   "comment":"Calvin Johnson 1.on-one with no safety help. Rowe, consequently, was beaten like a drum, yet Davis made no adjustments. Kelly's offense, meanwhile, continued to be a mess. His decision to bring back Mark Sanchez this past offseason was a head-scratcher at the time, especially when he traded for the injury-prone Sam Bradford. It was obvious that Sanchez would start a handful of games this season, and based on what Kelly saw at the end of the 2014 season, I don't know why he would let that happen. Sanchez is even worse than he was last year, thanks to a depleted arsenal. Jeremy Maclin, LeSean McCoy and some of the offensive linemen are no longer around. Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Sanchez is barely having any success behind a poor offensive line while throwing to bums like Riley Cooper, Josh Huff and Miles Austin. It's astonishing that Austin is even on an NFL roster; let alone serving as a prominent player in an offense. That's how bad Kelly's mismanagement has been.    Sanchez's final numbers don't look too bad - 19-of-27, 199 yards, 2 touchdowns and a lost fumble - but most of his yardage and 1 of his scores came late in the game when the Lions stopped trying. For a better barometer of how Sanchez performed, take a look at his first-half numbers, when he was 8-of-14 for 106 yards and a touchdown. It's hard to just blame Sanchez for this, however. He wasn't terrible, but he just wasn't good enough to compensate for the ineptitude of the other players. It didn't help that stud left tackle Jason Peters was helped off the field during the opening drive. His absence was felt instantly, as Lane Johnson was flagged for a face mask, forcing a long field goal that doinked off the upright. Johnson also allowed a blind-side sack and fumble in the third quarter.    Sanchez's leading receiver was Jordan Matthews, who caught 3 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. However, the score came very late in garbage time. Matthews dropped a pass in the third quarter, but that was a result of a brutal, but legal hit.    Excluding Matthews and someone named Trey Burton (2-49), no other Eagle had more than 21 receiving yards. Cooper (2-16) was barely a factor, while disappointing rookie Nelson Agholor (2-15) was flagged at 1 point for taking off his helmet following a first-down conversion.    It wasn't surprising to see DeMarco Murray struggle again. Murray was awful, managing just 30 yards on 14 carries. Murray, who tripped on the turf a couple of times, can't really blame the blocking for this. The Eagles, quite simply, are using him incorrectly. Kelly continues to utilize Murray as an East-West runner, which is not the proper way to use him. This has been painfully obvious to everyone, save for Kelly, it seems. McCoy was such a better fit for this offense. Ryan Mathews is the better option as well, but he couldn't play because he has yet to pass concussion protocol.    As for the Lions, they actually began very dubiously, despite what the final score may say. Their first offensive snap was a penalty for not being aligned properly. Matthew Stafford then threw behind Calvin Johnson, and that was followed by an Ameer Abdullah drop."

Stafford, meanwhile, went 28-of-39 for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Bears couldn't do anything to stop him, especially during the latter stages of the second half.
