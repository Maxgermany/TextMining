   "comment":"Jimmy Smith, to a torn Achilles. Smith, like Richard Sherman several weeks ago, was on the field despite playing through a balky Achilles. Smith should have spent some time on the sidelines, recovering from his injury, but as with Sherman, he was penalized for pressing the issue on a short work week. This is going to hurt the Ravens going forward, as Smith had been 1 of the best cornerbacks in the NFL this year, at least prior to his injury. The ill effects of Smith's absence were felt late in the game, as the Lions generated a good amount of offense in the second half, but Baltimore was able to hold on to the lead and prevail, improving to 7-5.    Offensively, Baltimore couldn't do anything Monday night, but the team was much better in this contest despite a slow start. Joe Flacco threw behind Mike Wallace and then Jeremy Maclin dropped a pass on the third down on the opening drive. However, the Ravens picked up the slack after that and roasted Detroit's incompetent defense. Flacco finished 23-of-36 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. He has struggled for most of the season, but this was 1 of his best performances. He hit some bombs, particularly to Wallace, and he didn't make many mistakes.    Wallace ended up leading the Ravens with 5 catches and 116 yards. He snared a 66-yard reception in the second quarter to set up a short touchdown pass to Ben Watson (3-24). Maclin, meanwhile, wasn't as effective, logging 4 receptions for 41 yards.    Alex Collins didn't get to perform his Irish jig Monday night, but he was able to showcase his dance moves following his touchdowns in this contest. He found the end zone twice, finishing with 75 yards on 15 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, barely did anything; he was given 3 carries, which he turned into 9 yards, while his 2 receptions went for 14 receiving yards.    Moving on to the Lions, I saw a stat during the week that said that other than Jay Cutler, Matthew Stafford has had the worst spread record in December onward since 2003. Stafford played exactly like that in the early going, struggling against a stout Baltimore defense before Jimmy Smith got hurt. Stafford mishandled a poor snap from his backup center in the opening quarter to take the team out of field-goal position for Matt Prater. The snap was bad, but Stafford still should've caught it. That ruined a chance to get points in a scoreless game. Following a stalled drive in Baltimore territory that culminated with a missed 43-yard field goal by Prater, Stafford was strip-sacked in Baltimore territory, as he failed to sense the blind-side pressure. Stafford put together some solid drives in the second half, but his afternoon ended when he injured his hand. He went in for X-rays, but they came back negative. Jake Rudock finished the game, but Stafford, diagnosed with just a bruise, should be able to play next week in a do-or-die contest for the Lions. Of course, Stafford doesn't deserve nearly all the blame for his offense's poor showing in this contest. He was without starting center Travis Swanson, and his 2 best linemen, T.J. Lang and Ricky Wagner, left the field with injuries. They'll need to play to give the Lions a better chance against the Buccaneers. Stafford finished 24-of-29 for 292 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which he threw up for grabs in the second half. Stafford was hot following intermission with Smith gone, throwing no incompletions prior to the pick. The offensive line simply couldn't hold up.    Marvin Jones and Golden Tate each had decent stat lines. Jones caught 4 passes for 90 yards, while Tate paced the team in receptions, catching 8 balls for 69 yards.    Ameer Abdullah was out with an injury, but reports indicated that the Lions planned on going with a new running back anyway. That was Tion Green, who ran for 51 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. He'll need to be picked up in fantasy leagues this week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
