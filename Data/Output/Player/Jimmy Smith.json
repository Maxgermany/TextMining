When McCoy was able to get attempts off, his receivers often dropped passes. You might be able to blame the rain and windy conditions, but the fact remains that Cleveland's receivers absolutely suck.    The longest reception for McCoy actually went to Smith where he stared down his receiver. However, McCoy really had no help from his teammates. His offensive line couldn't block the Ravens whatsoever. When McCoy was able to get attempts off, his receivers often dropped passes. You might be able to blame the rain and windy conditions, but the fact remains that Cleveland's receivers absolutely suck.    The longest reception for McCoy actually went to Peyton Hillis, who leaked out of the backfield and caught a 52-yard bomb downfield. Hillis couldn't really find any running room, however, as he gained just 45 yards on 12 carries. Hillis, by the way, is hurt again. He wasn't in the locker room afterward, and head coach Pat Shurmur told the media that his star running back is dealing with some sort of injury.    On the contrary, Ray Rice had plenty of running lanes. He compiled a whopping 204 yards and a touchdown on 29 attempts. He missed out on a second score when he took a breather after a 67-yard scamper. Ricky Williams (16-76) vultured the touchdown.    Joe Flacco didn't have a very good outing amid the nasty weather conditions. He went just 10-of-23 for 158 yards.    Only 1 Raven had more than 2 receptions (Ed Dickson: 3-47). Anquan Boldin (2-32) and Torrey Smith (1-32) disappointed their fantasy owners.   "

That set the tone for an effective pass-first attack for the rest of the game.    Joe Flacco responded at the end of the first quarter with a touchdown pass to second-year tight end Crockett Gilmore, who went on to catch another touchdown, i.e. the Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert last week against the Raiders. That's 4 touchdowns given up by the Raiders' defense in just 2 games.    This back-and-forth scoring continued in the second half as Raiders running back Latavius Murray scored from 1 yard out and then Flacco and Gilmore responded quickly with a 9-yard touchdown pass. Add in a couple of field goals, and the score before halftime was knotted up at 20.    After halftime, the Raiders came out strong again with another field goal and a 26-yard touch strike to Michael Crabtree, who had his Raiders' breakout game with 9 receptions on 16 targets for 111 and a touchdown. He's no Amari Cooper in his skill level, but Crabtree made a lot of nice plays running the ball after the catch. It was a good sign that someone other than Cooper can put up big numbers in the receiving game.    After Crabtree's touchdown put the Raiders up by 10, the Ravens went to work scoring 13 unanswered points, with 2 field goals and a 7-yard touchdown run by Lorenzon Taliaferro. He is the no-doubt goal-line back now that he has returned from injury, but Justin Forsett still saw 19 touches, with 15 carries for 68 yards and 4 receptions for 12 yards.    The true engine for this Ravens team once again was Steve Smith, who ended the day with 16 targets, 10 receptions and 150 yards. Those numbers could have actually been better with just a couple better passes from Flacco, especially toward the end of the game with the score tied. Flacco had Smith open near the pylon late, and even though Smith made a nice catch, Flacco led him out of bounds and the Ravens had to settle for a field goal that put the game at 33-30 with 2:10 seconds left.

   "comment":"Jimmy Smith has clearly been hobbled. The team also lost Smith has clearly been hobbled. The team also lost Elvis Dumervil, Lardarius Webb and Will Davis in this contest. As a consequence, Josh McCown's 457-yard performance happened. I don't want to take much away from McCown's victory, as he put together a very impressive comeback. However, he did this versus a skeleton-crew defense that was already surrendering 350-yard performances to the Derek Carrs of the NFL. McCown began poorly; he was very fortunate to have an interception overturned because of a roughing-the-passer penalty that had nothing to do with the throw. He then took a bad sack in the red zone, and he stood at just 165 yards by intermission. Throwing on the Ravens was so much easier for McCown in the second half because of all of those injuries. He consequently finished 36-of-51 for 457 yards and 2 touchdowns. He put together a great game, as he didn't turn the ball over a single time, and he had just 7 incompletions in the second half and overtime. The Browns should still be starting Johnny Manziel, just to see what they have in him, but McCown is definitely the superior player.    Gary Barnidge had the catch of the game. It's almost pointless to describe it because I'm sure most of you have seen it already, but he somehow caught the ball when it landed in between his legs as he was falling down. He then rolled into the end zone for an inexplicable touchdown. Barnidge is quickly becoming a star; this is the third-consecutive huge outing he's enjoyed. Barnidge finished with 8 grabs for 139 yards and that score. Barnidge is owned in just 37 percent of ESPN leagues, so if he's available in yours, pick him up.    McCown completed multiple passes to 6 players. Barnidge was the leader in receiving yardage, while Travis Benjamin (6-83) was second. Benjamin saw 12 targets go his way, so once again, he has become more than just a situational deep threat, which is what he was earlier in the year. The other 4 players of the 6 were Taylor Gabriel (4-75), Duke Johnson, Andrew Hawkins (7-49) and Isaiah Crowell (2-38).    As for Johnson, he touched the ball on the first 2 plays of the game, as it was apparent that the Browns wanted to feature him more. Johnson and Crowell had the same amount of touches. The former managed just 22 yards on 9 carries to go along with 6 grabs for 55 receiving yards. Crowell, meanwhile, gained 49 yards on the ground (13 attempts) and also snatched 2 balls for 38 receiving yards and a score.    While McCown thrived after intermission, Joe Flacco was abysmal. He was just 6-of-15 for 72 yards following the break. He also took a horrible, 14-yard sack on 1 play. It's hard to blame Flacco, as his receivers couldn't get open, but then again, he was battling 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. Flacco's final passing numbers were 19-of-35 for 210 yards and a touchdown. He bailed out those who started him in fantasy with 2 rushing scores.    With Steve Smith out, Flacco's top target was Kamar Aiken, who snagged only 4 of the 9 balls thrown to him for 78 yards."

   "comment":"Jimmy Smith left the game with an injury. The Ravens managed to take the lead, but Manning once again hit Beckham for a long score, this time a 66-yarder on a 4.h-and-1 as a result of a 2 Baltimore defensive backs crashing into each other. Beckham followed that up by ripping off his helmet, running to the kicking net and proposing to it. After the net apparently said yes, he hugged the net, which collapsed as a result, so Beckham did more harm than good to his new fiancee. The Giants had a 4.point advantage with less than 2 minutes remaining, but the Ravens drove down the field and nearly reached the red zone, thanks to a very bogus roughing-the-passer penalty. Joe Flacco had an open receiver at the 5-yard line, but overthrew him. Flacco then had to try a Hail Mary, and that fell incomplete as time expired.    As you can tell, this game was insane, with so many twists and turns. Either team could have won it; the Ravens failed to convert a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Plus, these teams weren't far apart in terms of net yardage (435-391, Giants), and Baltimore won the time-of-possession battle by more than 10 minutes.    Speaking of twists and turns, that could appropriately describe Eli Manning's performance. Manning began very poorly; as mentioned, he was throwing way behind countless receivers. However, his deep connections to Beckham bolstered his stat line, and he finished 32-of-46 for 403 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first score was the 300th of his career. By the way, neither of Manning's interceptions were his fault; I mentioned Shepard fell down during 1 of them. The other occurred when Manning tried to make something happen at the end of the first half, so the turnover didn't hurt at all.    Beckham had just 2 catches for 11 yards at halftime, and as mentioned, he was dealing with a hip pointer. However, he came alive following intermission, and he finished with 8 catches for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns, as Baltimore's beleaguered secondary blew coverage after coverage.    Rashad Jennings returned from his hiatus, and he was predictably ineffective. He managed only 15 yards on 9 carries.    As for the Ravens, Flacco proved to be inconsistent, going 26-of-48 for 307 yards. He threw no touchdowns or interceptions, though he was extremely fortunate to get away with some bad throws that easily could've been picked off. However, the Giants' defensive backs, including Janoris Jenkins, dropped some potential picks. I wouldn't completely blame Flacco for this, however. His offensive line is in shambles, and it struggled to protect against a New York pass rush that couldn't generate any heat on Aaron Rodgers last Sunday night. Flacco was also without Steve Smith, so it's not a surprise that Flacco was up and down without his No. 1 threat.    With Smith out of the lineup, Mike Wallace (4-97) led the Ravens in receiving. Kamar Aiken (4-64), Breshad Perriman (3-48) and Dennis Pitta (6-36) posted middling statistics.    Terrance West posted decent fantasy stats - 23 carries, 87 yards, 4 catches, 36 receiving yards, 2 total touchdowns - but I don't think he ran very well. On a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, West could've cut upfield to potentially score, but he continued to run laterally and was consequently tackled short of the goal line. This play effectively lost the game for the Ravens. They should have tried a field goal, so they would've only needed 3 points at the very end.    Both teams are now 3-3, with the Ravens dealing with a 3.game losing streak. They can recover, however, but they need all of their injured players (Steve Smith, Jimmy Smith, Ronnie Stanley, C.J. Mosley, etc.) to return to action. They also have to stop committing senseless penalties; they racked up 111 penalty yards in this contest. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Smith left the game with an injury.

   "comment":"Jimmy Smith, to a torn Achilles. Smith, like Richard Sherman several weeks ago, was on the field despite playing through a balky Achilles. Smith should have spent some time on the sidelines, recovering from his injury, but as with Sherman, he was penalized for pressing the issue on a short work week. This is going to hurt the Ravens going forward, as Smith had been 1 of the best cornerbacks in the NFL this year, at least prior to his injury. The ill effects of Smith's absence were felt late in the game, as the Lions generated a good amount of offense in the second half, but Baltimore was able to hold on to the lead and prevail, improving to 7-5.    Offensively, Baltimore couldn't do anything Monday night, but the team was much better in this contest despite a slow start. Joe Flacco threw behind Mike Wallace and then Jeremy Maclin dropped a pass on the third down on the opening drive. However, the Ravens picked up the slack after that and roasted Detroit's incompetent defense. Flacco finished 23-of-36 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. He has struggled for most of the season, but this was 1 of his best performances. He hit some bombs, particularly to Wallace, and he didn't make many mistakes.    Wallace ended up leading the Ravens with 5 catches and 116 yards. He snared a 66-yard reception in the second quarter to set up a short touchdown pass to Ben Watson (3-24). Maclin, meanwhile, wasn't as effective, logging 4 receptions for 41 yards.    Alex Collins didn't get to perform his Irish jig Monday night, but he was able to showcase his dance moves following his touchdowns in this contest. He found the end zone twice, finishing with 75 yards on 15 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, barely did anything; he was given 3 carries, which he turned into 9 yards, while his 2 receptions went for 14 receiving yards.    Moving on to the Lions, I saw a stat during the week that said that other than Jay Cutler, Matthew Stafford has had the worst spread record in December onward since 2003. Stafford played exactly like that in the early going, struggling against a stout Baltimore defense before Jimmy Smith got hurt. Stafford mishandled a poor snap from his backup center in the opening quarter to take the team out of field-goal position for Matt Prater. The snap was bad, but Stafford still should've caught it. That ruined a chance to get points in a scoreless game. Following a stalled drive in Baltimore territory that culminated with a missed 43-yard field goal by Prater, Stafford was strip-sacked in Baltimore territory, as he failed to sense the blind-side pressure. Stafford put together some solid drives in the second half, but his afternoon ended when he injured his hand. He went in for X-rays, but they came back negative. Jake Rudock finished the game, but Stafford, diagnosed with just a bruise, should be able to play next week in a do-or-die contest for the Lions. Of course, Stafford doesn't deserve nearly all the blame for his offense's poor showing in this contest. He was without starting center Travis Swanson, and his 2 best linemen, T.J. Lang and Ricky Wagner, left the field with injuries. They'll need to play to give the Lions a better chance against the Buccaneers. Stafford finished 24-of-29 for 292 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which he threw up for grabs in the second half. Stafford was hot following intermission with Smith gone, throwing no incompletions prior to the pick. The offensive line simply couldn't hold up.    Marvin Jones and Golden Tate each had decent stat lines. Jones caught 4 passes for 90 yards, while Tate paced the team in receptions, catching 8 balls for 69 yards.    Ameer Abdullah was out with an injury, but reports indicated that the Lions planned on going with a new running back anyway. That was Tion Green, who ran for 51 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. He'll need to be picked up in fantasy leagues this week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Smith, to a torn Achilles.
