   "comment":"Kyle Orton would combine for 675 passing yards in the Buccaneers-Bears game, I would've had you institutionalized. I wouldn't have even thought about that twice. How Chicago and Tampa Bay totaled 51 points is beyond me.    Griese came 4 pass attempts and 8 completions short of breaking Drew Bledsoe's single-game records. On Nov. 13, 1994, Bledsoe was 45-of-70 for 426 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Vikings in a 26-20 overtime win. Griese also won in overtime, but his stats weren't as pretty. Griese was 38-of-67, 407 yards with 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. However, Griese didn't make his patented bone-headed play in the clutch, leading the Buccaneers to victory.    What's most impressive about Griese's performance was that he didn't have Joey Galloway at his disposal. He also didn't possess an effective running game ("

One of Orton's touchdowns went to Moreno, who also had 2 receptions for 11 more yards. Buckhalter was more active in the passing game with 5 receptions for 55 yards.    The hero of the offense was "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton, stationed in the slot, was allowed to scan the field and come in under center. It was pretty smart on McDaniels' part because it forced the Patriots to stick with their coverage. Orton completed every single pass out of the Wild Horses. Phil Simms, who called the game, was shocked by this phenomenon and opined that the Wild Horses could never be stopped. Expect every team to be running this by Halloween.    Kyle Orton did a phenomenal job moving the chains in this game, going 35-of-48 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick (off a Hail Mary). Orton played without a glove for the first time all year. If he keeps this up, he'll burn every single pair of gloves that he owns.    "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton had a decent fantasy day, going 21-of-33 for 295 yards, 1 score and a pick. There was 1 play though that really bothered me. Late in the 4.h quarter, the Broncos were in the red zone. Orton scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to pick up the first down. Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on 4.h down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    "

Tebow finished 4-of-10 for 79 yards and a touchdown. However, he also had 6 carries for 38 rushing yards and another score on the ground. The passing stats may not show it, but Tebow was amazing. He sparked both the team and the crowd. When his Hail Mary attempt fell short as time expired, the crowd chanted his name despite the loss. Tebow must start the rest of the season. He's also worth adding in all fantasy leagues even though Denver has a bye next week.    As for the Chargers, they moved the ball well the entire afternoon - except in the red zone. That figures to change if/when Antonio Gates returns.    "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton, Jackie Battle and the other crap players Kansas City has on its offense. If the Packers can't stop them, they have no chance against the elite offenses. Aaron Rodgers will have to be perfect, which will be a huge challenge given how bad the offensive line is.)    The Chiefs pulled off 1 of the biggest upsets of the year, ending the Packers bid for a perfect season. Green Bay had a generally crappy game on both sides of the ball. Every team has an off day, and the Packers definitely were not themselves against Kansas City. The Chiefs had a nice drive to start the game, but it ended with a 19-yard field goal. Kansas City then stopped the Green Bay offense, but a stupid roughing-the-punter penalty gave the Packers the ball at their own 48-yard line. Fortunately for the Chiefs, Mason Crosby missed both a 59-yard field goal, as well as a re-kick from 54 yards out after a 12-men-on-the-field penalty on Kansas City. This left the Chiefs with good field position which they converted into another Ryan Succop field goal. Aaron Rodgers was off on some passes, but he also was throwing some darts that his receivers were dropping. Tamba Hali was whipping Green Bay offensive tackle Marshall Newhouse, among others, from start to finish. Meanwhile, Kyle Orton was spreading the ball around and moving down the field with some precision passes and some runs. The Packers defense finally came up with a stop on a 4.h-and-goal that was busted by "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton we know and love! Where were these interceptions last week when I bet 3 units against him!?)    Having been to a few Chiefs-Raiders tilts in my lifetime, I know the rivalry is littered with thrilling finishes. Topping the list of games I have witnessed live would be the 1997 Week 2 Monday Night Football game won when Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac hit Andre Rison, who somehow got behind a defense in prevent mode, for a 33-yard touchdown to secure a 28-27 victory. That 1 didn't have playoff implications; this 1 did for both teams. Big plays often define big games, and the Raiders set the tone when Bryan McCann returned the opening kickoff 91 yards to the Chiefs' 14-yard line. Kansas City's defense stood up, however, and the run defense set a tone of its own. After Michael Bush picked up 4 yards on first down, he was stuffed on second down to force a passing situation. Bush (23-70) was contained all day and had a long run of just 11 yards. The Raiders' running game is totally different without Darren McFadden's speed on the outside to loosen up opposing defenses, and even quick rookie Taiwan Jones (out with a hamstring) might have helped. Instead, Palmer threw incomplete, and Sebastian Janikowski came in to put Oakland up 3-0 very early. On Kansas City's first possession, Thomas Jones went right up the middle for 22 yards on the second play from scrimmage. It was by far the longest run of the game by either team though, and after that, Jones (11-51) and Jackie Battle (14-56) combined for just 85 yards on 24 carries for a 3.54 yard average. In other words, both run defenses stepped up in what felt like a playoff game, albeit a wild card, atmosphere. Jones was stopped on the next play, and 2 incompletions later, the Chiefs were punting. At least Dustin Colquitt trapped the Raiders at their own 3-yard line. Oakland battled its way out of poor field position, but the always-entertaining Carson Palmer threw while being hit, and his pass went right at Derrick Johnson for the easy interception. Earlier in the drive, Johnson had fallen down to allow a 17-yard pickup by Bush on a screen, so it was a bit of redemption for him. Kansas City small-balled its way on the next drive toward the end zone after starting at the Raiders' 36. All 8 plays were for gains, but none covered more than 7 yards. The march stalled inside the 10, a familiar failure for this offense all season, and Ryan Succop tied the game at 3. After an exchange of punts took the game into the second quarter, Oakland had a very Oakland sequence. Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by Matt Giordano on third down, blowing a chance to take the lead."
