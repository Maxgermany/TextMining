The pass, intended for Orton heaved a weak pass with less than half a minute remaining in the 4.h quarter, down 7-6. The pass, intended for Brandon Marshall, was tipped by a Cincinnati defender, but it bounced right into Brandon Stokley's hands. Stokley ran it in for a touchdown, on what would count as an 87-yard score for Orton.    I'll never underestimate what a victory like this can do for a team, but looking at facts for a second, Orton was pretty pedestrian. He was 17-of-28 for 243 yards and a touchdown. Taking away that 87-yard score, however, Orton had just 156 yards on 27 attempts, giving him a YPA of 5.8. No surprise there - the Broncos struggled to move the chains all afternoon, converting 3-of-12 of their third downs.    "

Kyle Orton did a phenomenal job moving the chains in this game, going 35-of-48 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick (off a Hail Mary). Orton played without a glove for the first time all year.

   "comment":"Kyle Orton tossed a pick.    Speaking of picks, Orton tossed a pick.    Speaking of picks, Peyton Manning launched 3. 2 of which went to Brian Dawkins off deflections. However, the Broncos turned those all 3 of those interceptions into just 3 points. As I said, blown opportunities. Manning's stat line was otherwise very strange. He was just 20-of-42 for 220 yards, but tossed 4 touchdowns. Manning's troubles against good 3-4 defenses are well-documented, and will likely be prevalent in the postseason.    Dallas Clark caught 3 of Manning's touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 43 yards. Austin Collie (3-39) caught the other. Reggie Wayne and Pierre Garcon had just 43 and 39 yards, respectively.    Joseph Addai had a solid game, rushing for 67 yards on 16 carries, and catching 5 passes for 49 more yards. Addai left the contest with a minor ankle injury, but returned to the lineup later on.    As for the Broncos, Orton finished 29-of-41 for 277 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Amazingly, 21 of his 29 completions went to Marshall.    Knowshon Moreno couldn't do much against Indianapolis' defense. He carried the ball 23 times but for just 63 yards. He also caught 3 balls for 13 more yards. "

Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on 4.h down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton was dreadful in the first half; he went 6-of-13 for 34 yards and a really dumb interception. John Fox finally benched the should-be Miami quarterback in favor of Tebow. Tebow finished 4-of-10 for 79 yards and a touchdown. However, he also had 6 carries for 38 rushing yards and another score on the ground. The passing stats may not show it, but Tebow was amazing. He sparked both the team and the crowd. When his Hail Mary attempt fell short as time expired, the crowd chanted his name despite the loss. Tebow must start the rest of the season. He's also worth adding in all fantasy leagues even though Denver has a bye next week.    As for the Chargers, they moved the ball well the entire afternoon - except in the red zone. That figures to change if/when Antonio Gates returns.    "

   "comment":"Kyle Orton we know and love! Where were these interceptions last week when I bet 3 units against him!?)    Having been to a few Chiefs-Raiders tilts in my lifetime, I know the rivalry is littered with thrilling finishes. Topping the list of games I have witnessed live would be the 1997 Week 2 Monday Night Football game won when Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac hit Andre Rison, who somehow got behind a defense in prevent mode, for a 33-yard touchdown to secure a 28-27 victory. That 1 didn't have playoff implications; this 1 did for both teams. Big plays often define big games, and the Raiders set the tone when Bryan McCann returned the opening kickoff 91 yards to the Chiefs' 14-yard line. Kansas City's defense stood up, however, and the run defense set a tone of its own. After Michael Bush picked up 4 yards on first down, he was stuffed on second down to force a passing situation. Bush (23-70) was contained all day and had a long run of just 11 yards. The Raiders' running game is totally different without Darren McFadden's speed on the outside to loosen up opposing defenses, and even quick rookie Taiwan Jones (out with a hamstring) might have helped. Instead, Palmer threw incomplete, and Sebastian Janikowski came in to put Oakland up 3-0 very early. On Kansas City's first possession, Thomas Jones went right up the middle for 22 yards on the second play from scrimmage. It was by far the longest run of the game by either team though, and after that, Jones (11-51) and Jackie Battle (14-56) combined for just 85 yards on 24 carries for a 3.54 yard average. In other words, both run defenses stepped up in what felt like a playoff game, albeit a wild card, atmosphere. Jones was stopped on the next play, and 2 incompletions later, the Chiefs were punting. At least Dustin Colquitt trapped the Raiders at their own 3-yard line. Oakland battled its way out of poor field position, but the always-entertaining Carson Palmer threw while being hit, and his pass went right at Derrick Johnson for the easy interception. Earlier in the drive, Johnson had fallen down to allow a 17-yard pickup by Bush on a screen, so it was a bit of redemption for him. Kansas City small-balled its way on the next drive toward the end zone after starting at the Raiders' 36. All 8 plays were for gains, but none covered more than 7 yards. The march stalled inside the 10, a familiar failure for this offense all season, and Ryan Succop tied the game at 3. After an exchange of punts took the game into the second quarter, Oakland had a very Oakland sequence. Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by Matt Giordano on third down, blowing a chance to take the lead.Orton we know and love!

   "comment":"Kyle Orton, who quarterbacked the Chiefs to victory over his squad. He dealt Orton, who quarterbacked the Chiefs to victory over his squad. He dealt Brandon Lloyd away for basically nothing, so Tim Tebow had to utilize bums like Matt Willis, who dropped a long completion on the final drive of this contest. But it all doesn't matter because the Raiders lost and the Broncos still were able to win the division.    I can't imagine this is how the Broncos wanted to clinch playoff berth. Their offense couldn't do anything aerially in this contest. Tim Tebow was an abysmal 6-of-22 for 60 yards and an interception. The pass protection once again was atrocious, but Tebow held on to the ball too long on way too many occasions. He also lost a fumble in the red zone, which was huge in such a low-scoring struggle.    As mentioned earlier, the receivers sucked. You're not going to advance deep into the playoffs with bums like Willis, Daniel Fells, Spencer Larsen and Eric Decker catching passes. Demaryius Thomas (3-34) was the only Bronco with more than 1 reception.    Willis McGahee rushed for 145 yards on 28 attempts, which is impressive considering he was banged up in this contest. His heroics on the ground didn't really help the Broncos score, however. Denver's sole field goal came off a Javier Arenas muffed fair catch.    Orton, meanwhile, went 15-of-29 for 180 yards.

He threw 2 interceptions, both of which were forced carelessly into covered receivers. Orton finished 17-of-31 for 190 yards and a touchdown otherwise.    Buffalo's defense was solely responsible for this victory - with help from Hoyer, of course - as the running game didn't produce much. Orton's dreadful accuracy throughout the afternoon.
