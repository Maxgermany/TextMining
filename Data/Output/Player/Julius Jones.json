Edgerrin James actually led the Seahawks with 46 yards on 16 attempts, but all but 5 of those rushes came in the 4.h quarter when this game was well in hand.    Aside from Hasselbeck's health, the main reason why Seattle was able to move the chains so well is that Hasselbeck was seldom pressured. Jacksonville got to him only 1 time.    Conversely, David Garrard was constantly running for his life in this game. The Seahawks collected 5 sacks.    Making matters worse for Garrard, Mike Sims-Walker was suspended for this game for violating team rules. Garrard (18-of-31, 188 yards) had no No. 1 receiver to work with. He had to resort to throwing to Torry Holt, who had 7 grabs for 95 yards.    Maurice Jones-Drew had only 17 touches; he managed 34 yards on 12 carries and 5 catches for 23 more yards. The Seahawks simply killed the time-of-possession battle (34:44-25:16), so the Jaguars didn't have a chance to get Drew-Jones the ball.

   "comment":"Jones ran for 34 yards on 12 carries. Edgerrin James actually led the Seahawks with 46 yards on 16 attempts, but all but 5 of those rushes came in the 4.h quarter when this game was well in hand.    Aside from Hasselbeck's health, the main reason why Seattle was able to move the chains so well is that Hasselbeck was seldom pressured. Jacksonville got to him only 1 time.    Conversely, David Garrard was constantly running for his life in this game. The Seahawks collected 5 sacks.    Making matters worse for Garrard, Mike Sims-Walker was suspended for this game for violating team rules. Garrard (18-of-31, 188 yards) had no No. 1 receiver to work with. He had to resort to throwing to Torry Holt, who had 7 grabs for 95 yards.    Maurice Jones-Drew had only 17 touches; he managed 34 yards on 12 carries and 5 catches for 23 more yards. The Seahawks simply killed the time-of-possession battle (34:44-25:16), so the Jaguars didn't have a chance to get Drew-Jones the ball.

Remember though that he's merely a rookie with no offensive line and was playing in a hostile Seattle environment. There's no need to panic.

   "comment":"Jones. The good news is that the Saints have a bye week to get Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush healthy. New Orleans hosts Seattle in Week 11, so we should know by then if they've gotten their act together.    The final score of this contest is indicative of how dominant New Orleans was. The Saints outgained the Panthers, 284-91, in the first half, and 408-195 overall.    Drew Brees went 27-of-43 for 253 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Marques Colston (8-65) and Lance Moore (6-77) did the most damage. Close to halftime, Moore had an impressive grab on a ball that looked like it was 10 feet over his head.    Rookie tight end Jimmy Graham caught his first touchdown of his career. Jeremy Shockey had Brees' other score.    The Saints ran the ball well with Julius Jones (6-68) and Chris Ivory (12-50)."
