The decision to release Prater now looks as questionable as ever.    As for the Cardinals, Ellington was the only productive offensive player. He didn't get much on the ground (16-32), but he scored twice and was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 4 balls for 112 receiving yards, including that 81-yard sprint into the end zone.
