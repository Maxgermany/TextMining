   "comment":"Brandon McManus whiffed on a 53-yard try - which isn't as hard in altitude - and then doinked another try off an upright. The decision to release Prater now looks as questionable as ever.    As for the Cardinals, Ellington was the only productive offensive player. He didn't get much on the ground (16-32), but he scored twice and was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 4 balls for 112 receiving yards, including that 81-yard sprint into the end zone.
