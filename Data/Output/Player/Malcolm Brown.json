   "comment":"Brown. The second occurred on a tipped pass when Goff's arm was hit upon the release. The Rams set NFL offenses back half a century with this performance. The team averaged just 3.3 yards per play, and only 1.4 yards per play in the opening half. They crossed midfield for the first time with just 3 minutes remaining in the third quarter.

As someone noted on Twitter, it took Jeff Fisher 5 years and a trade up in the draft, but he has finally produced the worst offense in NFL history. It's sad, and it'll only get worse because of the news that broke Sunday morning. If you missed it, here's my Grade for the Rams extending Jeff Fisher.    On the other end of the spectrum, "
