   "comment":"Duke Johnson, the Browns could've held on to lead, or at least the cover. Like seriously, what in the world is making him think that Isaiah Crowell and Robert Turbin (especially) are better options!? It makes no sense!    This was a typical game for the Browns, as they played well for awhile before self-destructing. Cleveland built a first-half lead, but Arizona's offense came storming back. After getting hot and scoring 3 touchdowns, the Browns' offense wilted with 4 punts, an interception and a fumble in the second half before garbage time when Johnny Manziel came in. The Cardinals didn't play a complete game, thanks to turnovers and coverage issues, but they made good second half adjustments to cruise in Cleveland.    To start the game, Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper."

   "comment":"Duke Johnson for 22 yards that set up a field goal for the Browns. The Seahawks responded with 2 field goal drives to take a 20-10 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Manziel made some nice throws to Barnidge to move the chains across midfield but the drive stalled. After trading some punts, Wilson struck again with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett. Johnson soon moved the ball for the Browns with a 39-yard run. That led to a Cleveland field goal. The Seahawks responded with 3 more points, and the defense slammed the door on Cleveland. After a Michael Bennett sack, Manziel was picked off by Marcus Burley, and the Seahawks ran out the clock.    Russell Wilson was 21-of-30 for 249 yards with 3 touchdowns. He also ran for 46 yards on 5 carries. Wilson was excellent against Cleveland with accurate passing and good decision-making.    Doug Baldwin had 4 catches for 45 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jermaine Kearse (7-110) and Tyler Lockett (5-55-1) also played well for Seattle.    Christine Michael led the Seahawks' rushing attack with 84 yards on 12 carries.    Johnny Manziel was 19-of-161 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He had some nice plays and some duds, but Cleveland's offense doesn't have the talent to really challenge a defense like Seattle's.    Duke Johnson had 4 carries for 46 yards with 5 receptions for 39 yards. He continues to flash serious play-making ability, but doesn't get a lot of touches.    Cleveland tight end Gary Barnidge logged 29 yards on 3 catches with a score. The leading Browns wide receiver was "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson's hands. Those stats don't look horrible, but he was very inaccurate. Kessler (5-of-8, 62 yards, TD) at least gave Cleveland a chance of being somewhat competitive. Without him, the Browns were very stagnant until the game got well out of hand. Sadly, the Browns may have to start Whitehurst for a few weeks as both Kessler and Josh McCown recover. Whitehurst should not be in the NFL right now.    The Patriots predictably didn't respect the pass, allowing them to play extremely close to the line of scrimmage and clog all of the running lanes. As a result, Isaiah Crowell was limited to just 22 yards on 13 carries. He also dropped a pass. Duke Johnson, meanwhile, had just 3 touches, which was curious, though he was responsible for Whitehurst's interception.    Whitehurst's sole touchdown was thrown to "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson (4-18) scored the back-door touchdown and also caught 4 balls for 56 receiving yards. He also drew a long pass-interference flag.    I saw people on Twitter criticizing Hue Jackson for some bad math late in the game. Jackson went for 2 following a touchdown, down 28-19. The conversion didn't work, prompting the criticism. Jackson was correct, however, as the Browns had to go for 2 eventually, and knowing exactly what had to have been done was beneficial. People remarked the Browns would've been down just 1 score at 28-20, but they already went for 2 and failed, so what does it matter? Why would the 2.point try after the second touchdown have a better chance of being successful than the first? Simple math and logic, Twitter people. Where Jackson screwed up was not kicking a field goal at the end; instead, he wasted time with some runs, though it ultimately didn't matter because the Browns didn't convert the second onside kick. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. Terrelle Pryor pulled up on a route, and that allowed a pass to float to Marcus Gilchrist for an interception. After the Browns got the ball back deep in their own territory, McCown threw short for Duke Johnson, but a staggering hit from Calvin Pryor created a deflection that was caught by a diving Lorenzo Mauldin for an interception inside the 10-yard line."

It will only backfire for your team.    On the ground, the Browns had a very poor performance. Their offensive line could not do anything to open up holes for the backs. As a result, Isaiah Crowell had 8 carries and only turned them into a paltry 28 yards. Duke Johnson had some more success, garnering 31 yards on 5 carries. Johnson should get more carries in the last 2 weeks. Crowell has not showed much this season, and he looks like more of a backup at this point in his career.   "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson didn't receive 1 rushing attempt and ended up catching just 2 passes as he worked often from the slot. The Browns may need to get him involved as a runner again. The second half didn't pick up that much for the Steelers offensively, but Brown continued his destruction of the Browns' defensive backs and ended up sealing the game with a 36-yard reception in traffic. It was his 11th target of the day, which also made it his 11th reception, which helped him to a whopping 182 yards. Amazingly, his 182 yards on Sunday are just his 6.h-best yardage total in his career. The Steelers' second touchdown also came on a short pass from Roethlisberger, and this time it went to Jesse James, again! Sorry fantasy players, James really did rob many of you this week. After James' second touchdown, the Steelers had an 11-point lead late in the third quarter, which looked even bigger when Kizer was intercepted by "

On 1 drive, he overthrew an open Corey Coleman, then heaved a poor screen pass. And if that wasn't enough, a dump-off attempt was also off the mark. The Browns are drafting a quarterback come April, and after Josh Rosen's performance against USC, it could easily be him. Check out the for more.    Kizer, sadly, led the Browns in rushing with 5 scrambles for 22 yards. Isaiah Crowell found no running room versus Jacksonville's elite defense, as he was restricted to just 18 yards on 11 carries.    Coleman's return to the field was a successful 1. He caught 6 balls for 80 yards. He dropped a pass, but he would've posted a better stat line had Kizer not been guilty of the aforementioned overthrow. Duke Johnson (4-56) was the only other Cleveland player with more than 15 receiving yards.   "
