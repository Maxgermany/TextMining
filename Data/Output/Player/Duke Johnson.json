   "comment":"Duke Johnson, the Browns could've held on to lead, or at least the cover. Like seriously, what in the world is making him think that Isaiah Crowell and Robert Turbin (especially) are better options!? It makes no sense!    This was a typical game for the Browns, as they played well for awhile before self-destructing. Cleveland built a first-half lead, but Arizona's offense came storming back. After getting hot and scoring 3 touchdowns, the Browns' offense wilted with 4 punts, an interception and a fumble in the second half before garbage time when Johnny Manziel came in. The Cardinals didn't play a complete game, thanks to turnovers and coverage issues, but they made good second half adjustments to cruise in Cleveland.    To start the game, Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper."

At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the 4.h quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2.yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. Terrelle Pryor pulled up on a route, and that allowed a pass to float to Marcus Gilchrist for an interception. After the Browns got the ball back deep in their own territory, McCown threw short for Duke Johnson, but a staggering hit from Calvin Pryor created a deflection that was caught by a diving Lorenzo Mauldin for an interception inside the 10-yard line."

   "comment":"Duke Johnson (5-62) led the team in receiving yards. Most of his catches were checkdowns, as were the passes to Terrelle Pryor (4-19). Andrew Hawkins (1-33) had a nice downfield grab, while Corey Coleman (3-24) flashed on his catches. Do not even think about starting any of Cleveland's receivers in fantasy in the playoffs. It will only backfire for your team.    On the ground, the Browns had a very poor performance. Their offensive line could not do anything to open up holes for the backs. As a result, Isaiah Crowell had 8 carries and only turned them into a paltry 28 yards. Duke Johnson had some more success, garnering 31 yards on 5 carries. Johnson should get more carries in the last 2 weeks. Crowell has not showed much this season, and he looks like more of a backup at this point in his career.   "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson didn't receive 1 rushing attempt and ended up catching just 2 passes as he worked often from the slot. The Browns may need to get him involved as a runner again. The second half didn't pick up that much for the Steelers offensively, but Brown continued his destruction of the Browns' defensive backs and ended up sealing the game with a 36-yard reception in traffic. It was his 11th target of the day, which also made it his 11th reception, which helped him to a whopping 182 yards. Amazingly, his 182 yards on Sunday are just his 6.h-best yardage total in his career. The Steelers' second touchdown also came on a short pass from Roethlisberger, and this time it went to Jesse James, again! Sorry fantasy players, James really did rob many of you this week. After James' second touchdown, the Steelers had an 11-point lead late in the third quarter, which looked even bigger when Kizer was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Duke Johnson for a touchdown in the opening half - but accuracy problems plagued him throughout the afternoon. On 1 drive, he overthrew an open Corey Coleman, then heaved a poor screen pass. And if that wasn't enough, a dump-off attempt was also off the mark. The Browns are drafting a quarterback come April, and after Josh Rosen's performance against USC, it could easily be him. Check out the for more.    Kizer, sadly, led the Browns in rushing with 5 scrambles for 22 yards. Isaiah Crowell found no running room versus Jacksonville's elite defense, as he was restricted to just 18 yards on 11 carries.    Coleman's return to the field was a successful 1. He caught 6 balls for 80 yards. He dropped a pass, but he would've posted a better stat line had Kizer not been guilty of the aforementioned overthrow. Duke Johnson (4-56) was the only other Cleveland player with more than 15 receiving yards.   "
