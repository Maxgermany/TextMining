   "comment":"Johnson. Ivory accumulated 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 attempts. Ivory had a scoring reception wiped out by a James Carpenter hold, but he found the end zone on the same drive anyway.    I mentioned that Marshall caught 1 of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns. The other was hauled in by Eric Decker, thought he managed just 2 receptions for 37 yards. He doesn't belong on 12-team rosters.    Going back to the Browns, Manziel finished 13-of-24 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, a pick and the 2 fumbles. I mentioned all of his mistakes before. He made a couple of nice plays early on, hooking up with Travis Benjamin for a 54-yard touchdown. He had a cool-looking first-down scramble, featuring a juke move, but that was negated by a chop block. However, the first fumble of his came immediately after that. He then overshot Andrew Hawkins, who was wide open in the end zone. As for McCown, he looked much more promising, going 5-of-8 for 49 yards. It seemed like the Browns were going to be much more competitive with him under center. I know McCown isn't very good, but he's light years ahead of Manziel.    Manziel happened to be Cleveland's leading rusher; he scrambled 5 times for 35 rushing yards. More hilariously, McCown was second on the list! He managed 23 yards on 3 scrambles. Duke Johnson (7-22) and Isaiah Crowell (12-20) couldn't find any room against the Jets' stout front."

   "comment":"Johnson, the Browns could've held on to lead, or at least the cover. Like seriously, what in the world is making him think that Isaiah Crowell and Robert Turbin (especially) are better options!? It makes no sense!    This was a typical game for the Browns, as they played well for awhile before self-destructing. Cleveland built a first-half lead, but Arizona's offense came storming back. After getting hot and scoring 3 touchdowns, the Browns' offense wilted with 4 punts, an interception and a fumble in the second half before garbage time when Johnny Manziel came in. The Cardinals didn't play a complete game, thanks to turnovers and coverage issues, but they made good second half adjustments to cruise in Cleveland.    To start the game, Carson Palmer got going with a 38-yard pass to J.J. Nelson and some passes to Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out."

Duke Johnson then lost a fumble in Washington territory on the ensuing possession. An interception then set up a quick Redskins touchdown, giving Washington the undeserved cover. Duke Johnson's fumble, by the way, was recovered by a Cleveland player, who raised the ball in the air to show the officials, yet the refs ruled that Washington would obtain possession. I have absolutely no idea what happened here, and there were jokes that the officials started the Redskins defense in fantasy.    "

   "comment":"Johnson's hands. Those stats don't look horrible, but he was very inaccurate. Kessler (5-of-8, 62 yards, TD) at least gave Cleveland a chance of being somewhat competitive. Without him, the Browns were very stagnant until the game got well out of hand. Sadly, the Browns may have to start Whitehurst for a few weeks as both Kessler and Josh McCown recover. Whitehurst should not be in the NFL right now.    The Patriots predictably didn't respect the pass, allowing them to play extremely close to the line of scrimmage and clog all of the running lanes. As a result, Isaiah Crowell was limited to just 22 yards on 13 carries. He also dropped a pass. Duke Johnson, meanwhile, had just 3 touches, which was curious, though he was responsible for Whitehurst's interception.    Whitehurst's sole touchdown was thrown to "

   "comment":"Johnson (4-29 rushing, 6-87 receiving) to set up another field goal before the half. Cleveland took a 20-7 lead into the locker room. At intermission, Fitzpatrick was only 3-of-14 for 30 yards, while McCown was 16-of-27 for 228 yards with a score. The second half was a reversal for the signal-callers. Fitzpatrick finally put a drive together with passes to Brandon Marshall (4-68) for 26 yards. The possession was capped with a pass to Quincy Enunwa, who he fought through a few tackles to get into the end zone with a 24-yard score. The Jets soon got the ball back, and Fitzpatrick fired a laser to Enunwa as he beat Jamar Taylor on the deep post for a 57-yard gain. Forte scored from 4 yards out to give the Jets a 21-20 lead. The Browns defense continued to struggle into the fourth quarter and couldn't stop the Jets' offense as Fitzpatrick spread the ball around. Forte had a 15-yard screen to the 2-yard line, and then he powered it into the end zone 2 plays later. That put New York up 28-20, and the Browns continued to collapse. Terrelle Pryor pulled up on a route, and that allowed a pass to float to Marcus Gilchrist for an interception. After the Browns got the ball back deep in their own territory, McCown threw short for Duke Johnson, but a staggering hit from Calvin Pryor created a deflection that was caught by a diving Lorenzo Mauldin for an interception inside the 10-yard line."

It will only backfire for your team.    On the ground, the Browns had a very poor performance. Their offensive line could not do anything to open up holes for the backs. As a result, Isaiah Crowell had 8 carries and only turned them into a paltry 28 yards. Duke Johnson had some more success, garnering 31 yards on 5 carries. Johnson should get more carries in the last 2 weeks. Crowell has not showed much this season, and he looks like more of a backup at this point in his career.   "

It was his 11th target of the day, which also made it his 11th reception, which helped him to a whopping 182 yards. Amazingly, his 182 yards on Sunday are just his sixth-best yardage total in his career. The Steelers' second touchdown also came on a short pass from Roethlisberger, and this time it went to Jesse James, again! Sorry fantasy players, James really did rob many of you this week. After James' second touchdown, the Steelers had an 11-point lead late in the third quarter, which looked even bigger when Kizer was intercepted by "

And if that wasn't enough, a dump-off attempt was also off the mark. The Browns are drafting a quarterback come April, and after Josh Rosen's performance against USC, it could easily be him. Check out the 2018 NFL Draft Quarterback Prospect Rankings for more.    Kizer, sadly, led the Browns in rushing with 5 scrambles for 22 yards. Isaiah Crowell found no running room versus Jacksonville's elite defense, as he was restricted to just 18 yards on 11 carries.    Coleman's return to the field was a successful 1. He caught 6 balls for 80 yards. He dropped a pass, but he would've posted a better stat line had Kizer not been guilty of the aforementioned overthrow. Duke Johnson (4-56) was the only other Cleveland player with more than 15 receiving yards.   "
