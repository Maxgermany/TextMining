   "comment":"Trumaine McBride, and I just don't know what Cousins was possibly thinking on that play. The 4.h was a dying pass because Cousins had pressure in his face and couldn't step up in the pocket. Cousins finished 19-of-33 for 257 yards, 1 touchdown and the 4 picks. He was solid at times early on, but by the end of the evening, he looked defeated as he sat on the bench. It appears as though all of his confidence is gone, so it's a good thing that he'll have 10 days of rest to figure things out before the next game. The bad news? Washington has Seattle in Week 5.    As mentioned, Paul was knocked out of the game on a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit over the middle of the field. Paul (3-60) appeared to lose consciousness. He was helped off the field and never returned.    Neither of the primary Washington wideouts did anything. Garcon hauled in 2 balls for 28 yards, while Jackson reeled in just 1 pass for 9 yards. Jackson had a nice sideline catch taken away from him by a poor officiating ruling. McBride, and I just don't know what Cousins was possibly thinking on that play.
