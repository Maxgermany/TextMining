   "comment":"Randy Moss fumbled - both of which happened on the same play.    You may argue that the Patriots' slim 7-point victory was the result of Tom Brady getting hurt, and I'm not sure I can really argue that all that much, except for the fact that the game was scoreless when Brady had to leave with his knee injury. It looks like Brady is out with a torn ACL.    Besides, Matt Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason. Cassel went 13-of-18 for 152 yards and a score. Before Patriots fans are relieved that they have a capable backup, 2 things should be noted: 1) The Chiefs didn't gameplan for Cassel and didn't know what to expect. Not that Herm Edwards is capable of gameplanning for anything... 2) Cassel was playing the Chiefs, arguably the worst team in the NFL that happens to maintain a young, but awful defense.    While Tom Brady and Matt Cassel shared stats, the same could be said for Laurence Maroney and Sammy Morris to the chagrin of Maroney's fantasy owners. Both carried the ball 10 times, as Morris actually out-rushed Maroney, 53-51.    Randy Moss' stats didn't deteriorate with Matt Cassel in the game. He had 6 catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. Moss eclipsed 13,000 yards in this contest, as he passed Jimmy Smith for 13th of all time.    QUOTE OF THE GAME: If "

There was a great chance Moss would quit on the team if the Patriots were ever eliminated from the playoffs, but at 2-1? Unreal.    Streaks Snapped: New England's 21-game regular-season winning streak. Miami's 11-game road losing streak.

By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and 3 touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting 8 times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, Wes Welker (108 yards) and Jabar Gaffney (86 yards and a touchdown) each caught 7 balls. Randy Moss had just 3 receptions for 26 yards, but caught an amazing, game-tying touchdown with 1 second remaining, where he somehow tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of the field of play.

There was never denying Moss' talent. He's still 1 of the best receivers in the game. But last week's effort was still really disgusting. He jogged down the field on routes. He short-armed some potential catches. He fumbled away his only reception. There's absolutely no doubt that Moss dogged last week's game. He rebounded by trying hard here. Whoop dee freaking doo.

   "comment":"Randy Moss and the other starters played the entire way. I'm not saying the other starters should have been pulled as well; a victory would have given the Patriots the No. 3 seed, which would have ensured a home game in the AFC Championship if Cincinnati would have made it as well.    Brady was 17-of-26 for 186 yards and an interception to Bernard Pollard of all people. Without Welker, Brady appeared to struggle at times. He tried to get Julian Edelman involved and was successful (10-103), but it was a noticeable downgrade that will be huge in the playoffs.    Fred Taylor led the Patriots in rushing despite receiving only 7 carries. Taylor was impressive, compiling 33 yards and 2 touchdowns on such few limited attempts. Randy Moss, meanwhile, caught 5 balls for 75 yards. Brady took multiple downfield shots to Moss, but they were able to hook up only once (41 yards).    You have to give a lot of credit to the Texans for actually not choking for a change. "
