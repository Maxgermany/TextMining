You may argue that the Patriots' slim 7-point victory was the result of Tom Brady getting hurt, and I'm not sure I can really argue that all that much, except for the fact that the game was scoreless when Brady had to leave with his knee injury. It looks like Brady is out with a torn ACL.    Besides, Matt Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason. Cassel went 13-of-18 for 152 yards and a score. Before Patriots fans are relieved that they have a capable backup, 2 things should be noted: 1) The Chiefs didn't gameplan for Cassel and didn't know what to expect. Not that Herm Edwards is capable of gameplanning for anything... 2) Cassel was playing the Chiefs, arguably the worst team in the NFL that happens to maintain a young, but awful defense.    While Tom Brady and Matt Cassel shared stats, the same could be said for Laurence Maroney and Sammy Morris to the chagrin of Maroney's fantasy owners. Both carried the ball 10 times, as Morris actually out-rushed Maroney, 53-51.    Randy Moss' stats didn't deteriorate with Matt Cassel in the game. He had 6 catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. Moss eclipsed 13,000 yards in this contest, as he passed Jimmy Smith for 13th of all time.    QUOTE OF THE GAME: If "

Brady later tossed 2 interceptions, 1 of which was horribly thrown in the end zone. We learned an important lesson: Vegas knows everything. The next time a spread mysteriously drops 2.5 points in the span of 30 minutes, don't bet on the game. It's no accident that the sportsbooking industry makes millions upon millions every year. They knew Brady's finger would affect him, and they were right on, despite ESPN and other media outlets scoffing at the rumors.    That said, the Patriots could have won and covered if they didn't repeatedly screw up in the red zone. Up 7 in the second quarter, New England eschewed a field goal to go for it on 4th-and-1. They failed on a rush with Sammy Morris. Early in the fourth quarter, Brady heaved a weakly thrown pass toward Moss that was intercepted by Vontae Davis."

   "comment":"Moss shut it down. He quit. Those aren't my words. They are Chris Gamble's (paraphrased). But I agree with Gamble. Moss didn't look like he was exerting too much effort on the field against the Panthers. He dropped multiple passes and had alligator arms a few times. He caught only 1 pass (16 yards) and fumbled the ball right away. Brady approached Moss a couple of times on the sideline. Brady looked like he was trying to encourage his receiver, but Moss didn't even look at his quarterback, sitting silently most of the time. It appears as though the locker-room toad everyone was expecting back in 2007 is finally festering in New England.    Including Moss' fumble, the Patriots had 2 turnovers in the red zone. That killed their chances of covering. Had they just scored 3 points on 1 of those 2 red-zone trips, they would have pushed.    The Patriots have other problems aside from Moss' lack of effort. Brady isn't even close to 100 percent. He could be playing with a broken finger and/or cracked ribs. He consequently was just 19-of-32 for 192 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also missed a wide-open Moss in the end zone, though Moss probably would have dropped that pass anyway.    As for Brady's counterpart, "

He short-armed some potential catches. He fumbled away his only reception. There's absolutely no doubt that Moss dogged last week's game. He rebounded by trying hard here. Whoop dee freaking doo.

   "comment":"Moss and the other starters played the entire way. I'm not saying the other starters should have been pulled as well; a victory would have given the Patriots the No. 3 seed, which would have ensured a home game in the AFC Championship if Cincinnati would have made it as well.    Brady was 17-of-26 for 186 yards and an interception to Bernard Pollard of all people. Without Welker, Brady appeared to struggle at times. He tried to get Julian Edelman involved and was successful (10-103), but it was a noticeable downgrade that will be huge in the playoffs.    Fred Taylor led the Patriots in rushing despite receiving only 7 carries. Taylor was impressive, compiling 33 yards and 2 touchdowns on such few limited attempts. Randy Moss, meanwhile, caught 5 balls for 75 yards. Brady took multiple downfield shots to Moss, but they were able to hook up only once (41 yards).    You have to give a lot of credit to the Texans for actually not choking for a change. "
