   "comment":"Asante Samuel really whiffed on his attempt.    Fifty-five of Russell's yards went to fullback Gary Russell. Russell will be Oakland's fullback going forward and he'll be heavily relied upon in the aerial attack until Darren McFadden comes back from his injury.    Justin Fargas rushed for 87 yards on 23 carries. Not the most impressive numbers, but the Eagles are usually stingy against opposing ground attacks. It was nice to see that Tom Cable actually stuck with his running game for a change.    I lost this as a 4-unit play, but I'm happy to report that I was right about my prediction that Asante Samuel and Sheldon Brown would have more combined interceptions than Darrius Heyward-Bey would have catches."

Those numbers don't indicate all of the defensive penalties the Eagles committed, and it's also worth noting that he had just 65 passing yards in the second half because his team was so far ahead. Ryan was a machine on third down, converting 7-of-13 attempts. Though he was sacked twice, he had a clean pocket most of the afternoon. The Eagles just had no chance, especially with their poor tackling.    Ryan's scores went to Jones (5-123), "

   "comment":"Asante Samuel were injured too. Abraham's injury looked the most significant for Atlanta's first playoff game in 2 weeks, and he is an essential player for the team's defense.    After trading field goals in the first quarter, the Bucs took the lead with an 8-yard pass from Josh Freeman to Mike Williams (6-65). The Falcons punted the ball into the back of 1 of their blockers and that set up another field goal for Tampa Bay. The Bucs' offense had success moving the ball between the 20s throughout the afternoon. Freeman looked improved as he made better decisions and spread the ball around to a variety of teammates.    Atlanta showed some signs of life in the third quarter when Asante Samuel picked off a dumb pass by Freeman. That set up the offense at the Bucs' 21-yard line. "
