   "comment":"Johnson call on the David Garrard-Mike Thomas Hail Mary. It's only fitting that Kansas City would finally score this way. Despite the addition of Kyle Orton, Todd Haley stubbornly named Palko the starter, but benched him early on. Orton's first pass was an underthrown flea flicker, and he injured his finger when he banged it on a Chicago Bear player's helmet. Palko would finish a nondescript 17-of-30 for 157 yards and that score.    Of course, the big injury was to Matt Forte, who was knocked out when Derrick Johnson's shoulder pad collided with his knee. If Forte's is out for more than 2 weeks, Chicago's chances of going to the playoffs are severely diminished. Forte was the team's entire offense, and Chicago was completely lost when he left the game. "

He missed a series with a hamstring injury, but the issue may have affected him throughout the duration of the contest. As mentioned, Hilton had a 40-yard reception negated by a hold. He dropped a deep ball and 2 other passes as well.    Constantly trailing, Gore didn't get too many opportunities to carry the ball. He gained 37 yards on just 9 tries. He and Luck were responsible for a fumble early in the game on a botched exchange, but the Chiefs couldn't score because "
