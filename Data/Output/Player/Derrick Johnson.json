Orton was bad despite not having any pressure in face, but to be fair, he didn't have Brandon Marshall, Eddie Royal and Tony Scheffler at his disposal. Jabar Gaffney played the role of Marshall, catching 14 balls for 213 yards.    Knowshon Moreno had a great performance to close out the season, rushing for 50 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 14 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 48 more yards. Correll Buckhalter (6-18) didn't contribute much.    But compared to Jamaal Charles, both Moreno nor Buckhalter were non-factors. Charles carried the ball 25 times for 259 yards and 2 scores. I've talked about this before; Charles has to be in the mix as a first-round fantasy running back next summer. He's incredibly talented, and it's a disgrace that Todd Haley waited until Larry Johnson berated motorcycle riders to utilize him.    Save for 1 horrific interception, "

It's only fitting that Kansas City would finally score this way. Despite the addition of Kyle Orton, Todd Haley stubbornly named Palko the starter, but benched him early on. Orton's first pass was an underthrown flea flicker, and he injured his finger when he banged it on a Chicago Bear player's helmet. Palko would finish a nondescript 17-of-30 for 157 yards and that score.    Of course, the big injury was to Matt Forte, who was knocked out when Derrick Johnson's shoulder pad collided with his knee.

Later, Fitzpatrick's pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and went toward Marcus Peters. Peters reeled in the poor pass for his second pick of the day. The final pick came at midfield with just a few minutes left in the game. Fitzpatrick once again did not spot Johnson, and he undercut a route to make the play. He then returned the pick for a touchdown to make the game 24-3. That was the final dagger for the Jets. Fitzpatrick simply has to play better than he did today for the Jets. He was absolutely terrible and was a huge liability for the team. He really is not the answer at the quarterback position, and it appears as though his success last season was just a fluke.    Because of Fitzpatrick's struggles, New York's receivers did not do much. Quincy Enunwa (4-37) was targeted 11 times by the quarterback, while Bilal Powell (6-41) ended up leading the team in catches and yardage. However, most of that came in garbage time, so Powell's stats were inflated as a result. Brandon Marshall (3-27) could not do much because of his banged-up knee, while Eric Decker (1-31) disappointed during the game.    Matt Forte continues to be a solid back for the Jets. The ageless wonder once again was good for the team, and he carried the ball 15 times for 65 yards. He was able to rip off a few big plays, and he would have done better if the Jets were not trailing. Forte looks good now, but the Jets need to make sure that they do not overwork him early in the season. They need to have him healthy down the stretch if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs.    For the Chiefs, this was a huge win. The way they approached the game was quintessential Alex Smith. The team played in an efficient manner, and they were led by their veteran quarterback. Smith had a solid performance 1 the day for Kansas City. He went 25-for-33 during the contest for 237 yards and 1 touchdown. Smith made very few mistakes, and most of his throws were accurate. It was a perfect game for the game manager, and though he struggles against tougher competition, he really helps to dominate weaker opponents.    It is no surprise that Travis Kelce was the top target for Smith during the game. Kelce caught 6 of his 7 targets for 89 yards and a touchdown. At 1 point, he snagged a long pass that moved the Chiefs into the red zone. He used his athleticism to beat the coverage and then used his speed to motor into the red zone. The possession resulted in an important field goal, and the Chiefs can thank Kelce for helping them to get there.    Elsewhere, Jeremy Maclin was decent, catching 4-of-7 targets for 35 yards. Maclin struggled to get open against New York's secondary, but he still remains 1 of Smith's favorite targets. Rookie Tyreek Hill saw some action today as well, catching 3 passes for 26 yards. He also was active on returns, and it looks like Andy Reid wants to get him involved on offense in the future.    The running game for the Chiefs was once again very strong as Spencer Ware led the way. Ware received 20 carries for 75 yards during the contest. Though he lost a fumble, Ware was able to rip off chunks of yards at various points. He showed excellent burst and strength, and he may have done better against a weaker defense. Ware has made a case to keep the starting job even when Jamaal Charles returns, and he will continue to be a threat in fantasy as a result.    The Chiefs played some terrific defense during the game and really racked up some serious numbers during the game. One of the best stat lines came from the aforementioned Derrick Johnson. Johnson led the team in tackles with 11. In pass defense, he was great as well, recording 2 passes defensed and an interception. Johnson also scored a touchdown and caused another pick off of 1 of his pass defenses. He looked explosive and still has elite instincts. The 33-year-old is showing no signs of dropping off. Marcus Peters also was great for the Chiefs. He grabbed 2 more interceptions to move his season total to 4. Through 18 career games, Peters has 12 interceptions. He is definitely developing into 1 of the best young cornerbacks in the league and should be a force for the Chiefs in years to come.    One of the strangest plays of the day came on a kickoff return. Rookie Johnson dropping into coverage. Johnson got into Fitzpatrick's passing lane and tipped the ball into the air. "
