   "comment":"Greene fumble returned 48 yards. The other 2 scores were both by Ted Ginn on successive 100- and 101-yard kickoff returns. Of course, Ginn couldn't do this last week; instead, he ruined 5 more units of mine with numerous drops.    Despite the loss and poor play-calling by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, Mark Sanchez played pretty well. He went 20-of-35 for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns, continuously driving the Jets down the field in the second half. Of course it didn't matter because Ginn scored on a kickoff right after every second-half possession.    Dustin Keller caught 8 balls for 76 yards and a score. Braylon Edwards was also solid, grabbing 4 balls for 74 yards and a touchdown. Jerricho Cotchery, off a hamstring injury, had 3 receptions for 70 yards.    Thomas Jones did all of the work on the ground for the Jets in this contest, gaining 102 yards on 27 attempts. Greene, who had the aforementioned fumble-six, carried the ball only 8 times for 18 yards.    As noted, the Dolphins had only 104 net yards, so there isn't much to say in terms of their offensive numbers. "

As I wrote in the forums, The Steelers haven't looked this good against any playoff team all year. I don't get it. The Jets simply didn't have an answer for Roethlisberger's scrambling. Big Ben's passing numbers were hardly impressive (10-of-19, 133 yards, 2 INTs), but he evaded enough pass rushers in the backfield and picked up a few key first downs (and a touchdown) to keep the ball out of Sanchez's hands.

Two incompletions later, the 43-yard drive resulted in no points. The answer from Oakland was dramatic. On the play's third drive, McFadden had a pass option and instead ran left for 27 yards.

   "comment":"Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback Mark Sanchez out of rhythm. He soon threw an interception to Drayton Florence on a post intended for Santonio Holmes. The Bills took advantage of the great field position at the New York 20 needing just 3 plays for Johnson to beat Revis again on a 5-yard touchdown for the 14-7 lead. What happened next turned the game around though. Johnson did a touchdown dance mocking Plaxico Burress' shooting incident, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. While it amused a lot of people on Twitter, it cost the Bills 15 yards on the kickoff. Backup kicker Dave Rayner flubbed the kickoff, hitting Emanuel Cook who was up on the front line. It looked almost like he was trying to knock the ball off an unsuspecting player and get a surprise onside kick, but up 14-7 with the half close to ending, it would make no sense. The Jets went to Greene who picked up 7 yards on a reception and another 15 was added on a personal foul by rookie Marcell Dareus."

Ironically, the play that got New York in charge also hurt them. Jets safety Jim Leonhard snagged an interception in plus territory, but injured his knee and is reportedly done for the season. Perhaps it is a case of d?j? vu, since he went down late in 2010, yet the team still rallied to make the AFC Championship Game.
