Landon Collins also got his hands on it as well, and shades of the Fail Mary game surfaced as the officials reviewed the call. Ultimately, Richardson's 38-yard touchdown stood, and that was the difference-maker for this contest. Still, this was not a great performance for the Seahawks. They once again struggled in the first half, and their blocking wasn't good for yet another week. Wilson was under pressure from the Giants' edge rushers for most of the day and constantly had to move outside the pocket. He was called for intentional grounding a couple times and a less-mobile quarterback would have been sacked far more than once. Against a stronger team, the Seahawks may not have emerged victorious in this contest.    Wilson's final numbers look very good; he went 27-of-39 for 334 yards and 3 touchdowns. But he did have some issues of his own. He had some overthrows on passes, and notably missed "
