   "comment":"Paul Richardson that hung up just long enough in the perfect place for the receiver to haul it in. Overall, Wilson ended up going 14-for-27 with 158 yards and a fumble. It wasn't the best stat line but again, it wasn't his fault. Seattle needs to get him some offensive line help, or it is not going to be able to compete in the postseason.    The Seahawks got a pretty nice performance from their receivers in this contest. Doug Baldwin (4-63) and Paul Richardson (4-59) both looked good on the field. Baldwin was an efficient player as always and ran crisp routes for the team. However, he will be limited in fantasy because of the lack of time Wilson has in the pocket. For that reason, Baldwin is capped as a WR2 most weeks. Meanwhile, Richardson keeps improving with each game he plays. He is worth monitoring for now, but Wilson seems to like throwing to him. "
