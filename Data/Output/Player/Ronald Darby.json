   "comment":"Ronald Darby picked off. The second was a desperation try at the end of the contest that was tipped into the air. Luck finished 26-of-49 for 243 yards and 2 touchdowns otherwise, but a lot of that came late in meaningless action. He couldn't even complete half of his attempts in the opening 2 quarters, going just 11-of-23 for 124 yards and a pick by intermission.    Indianapolis fans have to be upset by the offense's lack of production. Granted, Buffalo may have the top defense in the NFL, but it's clear that the offensive line is a big problem. This was obvious heading into the offseason, yet Indianapolis' front office did nothing to fix it. An injury to Hilton is problematic as well. He sustained a knee bruise, ruining his 7.catch, 88-yard day. Jim Irsay said afterward that Hilton could be out for a few games. Darby picked off.

   "comment":"Ronald Darby, both of whom are very talented, were torched mercilessly. Darby, both of whom are very talented, were torched mercilessly. Ryan Fitzpatrick was mostly unstoppable. If the Bills couldn't contain such a pedestrian quarterback, how are they going to deal with some of the better signal-callers in the NFL? Fitzpatrick finished 24-of-34 for 374 yards and a touchdown. This was 1 of the best performances of his career. He was so incredibly accurate, especially on third down. The Jets were 8-of-13 in those situations. Fitzpatrick is going to wilt when the weather gets cold, like he usually does, but he at least proved that he has mentally recovered from his horrific Week 17 showing from last year.    All 3 of Fitzpatrick's primary receivers caught 6 passes. Brandon Marshall led the way with 101 yards, though there was a scary instance in which he was tackled awkwardly and was taken into the locker room. He didn't miss much time, however. Meanwhile, Eric Decker and Quincy Enunwa accumulated 126 and 92 yards, respectively. Decker had a big gain nullified by a penalty, while Marshall dropped a long pass, though he did draw an interference flag on Darby. As for Enunwa, I listed him as an add in fantasy heading into Week 2, and I obviously stand by that after his performance at Buffalo. Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    "
