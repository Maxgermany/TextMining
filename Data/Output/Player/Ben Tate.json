   "comment":"Tate run). Now down 17-0, the Colts really needed to put a nice drive together and score at least a field goal to give themselves a chance. Collins moved the team to midfield and things were looking good until starting guard Joe Reitz committed a 15-yard face mask penalty. The infraction killed the drive and Indianapolis kicked the ball away, allowing Houston to score another touchdown. Game over.    In total, Collins lost 3 fumbles. You really have to wonder why the Colts didn't just start Curtis Finger Painter. I'm not sure it would have made a difference in the outcome, but at least Painter is familiar with Jeff Saturday and the receivers. Maybe this game would have been closer.    Reggie Wayne was the only Colt unaffected by Collins' presence. He caught 7 passes for 106 yards and a very impressive touchdown in which he inexplicably tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of play. He still has it.    As for the team that didn't give up, Ben Tate rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He looked great, as expected. The reason I had him so low in my Week 1 Fantasy Football Rankings was because I wasn't sure what Gary Kubiak would do with his running backs. Tate was amazing, but Derrick Ward (11-39, TD) was the 1 who started and scored the first touchdown. The 2 backs split carries evenly until Ward left with a minor injury. Tate drew heavy praise from Kubiak, so he'll probably be the main guy if Arian Foster misses Week 2.    "

Tate totaled 103 yards on 23 carries. It was unclear when Foster could return to the lineup.    After dropping a potential touchdown pass, Johnson came back to catch a 23-yard touchdown strike from Schaub. The Texans established Tate in the second half, and Schaub's job was pretty easy. He only threw 7 passes after halftime. He finished the game with 21-of-29 passes for 230 yards and 2 scores.    Johnson paced Houston with 7 receptions for 93 yards and 1 touchdown. Daniels did not record a reception in the second half. "

Colt McCoy didn't threaten the secondary, and it didn't help that Chris Ogbonnaya (13-28), starting in place of Peyton Hillis and Montario Hardesty, coughed up the ball right away. Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. If it wasn't obvious before, Cleveland has to look for a new quarterback this offseason.    Only 1 Cleveland receiver (Josh Cribbs) had more than 2 receptions (5-50, TD). Greg Little (2-33) was not a factor, outside of the fact that he spent some time arguing with McCoy on the sideline.    None of the Houston wideouts did much either, only because Matt Schaub (14-23, 119 yards, 1 INT) didn't have to throw much. Owen Daniels (3-32) had the most yardage, while Foster actually led the team in receptions (5-26).    Speaking of Foster, he barely had more rushing yardage (19-124, TD) than Tate (12-115, TD). It's amazing how easily they both ran the ball against Cleveland.   "

   "comment":"Tate fumbled on first-and-goal on the Cincinnati 1-yard line, and the Texans dropped a potential pick-six from Andy Dalton in the first quarter. Houston actually outgained Cincinnati, 412-285.    What Yates did was incredible when you consider that he didn't have Andre Johnson. Owen Daniels (7-100) and Kevin Walter (6-76, TD) were his top targets.    I don't want to take anything away from Dalton though, who played well again. He went 16-of-28 for 189 yards and a touchdown. He hooked up 5 times with A.J. Green for 59 yards, as the rookie wideout once again secured 1 of his patented jump balls over a defender. Green also drew a deep pass interference penalty on top corner Johnathan Joseph.    Yates was amazing in the final couple of minutes, but Houston's defense also deserves credit for the comeback. Cedric Benson rushed for 92 yards on 13 carries in the first half. The Texans locked down after halftime though, limiting Benson to 1 yard on his final 8 attempts.    As for Houston's running game, Arian Foster had just 41 yards on 15 tries. Tate was more effective (8-67), thanks to a 44-yard scamper, but as mentioned, he had that key fumble.    Oh, and I almost forgot - congratulations to the Texans for making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history!   "

   "comment":"Tate (12-74, 2 TDs) both gashed the defense. Matt Schaub, meanwhile, completed a high percentage of his passes (26-of-35, 195 yards), though he didn't throw for much yardage. He didn't need to though with his 2 runners trampling the opposing stop unit. Jacksonville will be better defensively once it gets several of its key players back (linebacker Daryl Smith, cornerback Derek Cox), but Gabbert simply doesn't give this team a chance to win. Gene Smith needs to be fired for taking a homoclitic approach to his quarterbacking situation this offseason.    The Texans had a really clean game, but screwed up just before halftime. They didn't have any timeouts, and the clock was ticking down on what would have been a 4th-and-5. Gary Kubiak hesitated in terms of making his decision, and by the time he called the play in to Schaub, it was too late. The play clock expired, and Houston was whistled for a delay of game. This sort of sloppiness needs to be cleaned up if Houston wants to make a deep playoff run.    Some fantasy players of note: - Maurice Jones-Drew rushed for 60 yards on 12 carries, but saved his fantasy owners with a weird, short touchdown reception in the third quarter. - Andre Johnson barely did anything, catching just 3 balls for 21 yards. Houston's leading receiver was tight end Owen Daniels (6-47). - I mentioned earlier that Tate scored twice. He nearly found the end zone a third time. A run of his was ruled a touchdown, but was overturned by replay. He was stuffed at the 1-yard line on the next carry. Foster then entered the contest and waltzed into the end zone on the ensuing play. I'd say Tate owners were cheated, but he did have 2 touchdowns. - "

   "comment":"Tate had 93 yards on 9 carries. Arian Foster recorded 79 yards on 19 attempts. Why is Foster receiving more than double the amount of carries than his superior teammate? It makes no sense.    There is no doubt that the 2-0 Texans have some fight in them. Houston had a vigorous comeback against San Diego last Monday night, but looked dead in the water late in the 4.h quarter this week before some great throws by Matt Schaub to rookie DeAndre Hopkins led to an overtime win. The Titans came close to being 2-0 with road wins at Houston and Pittsburgh, but the Tennessee secondary couldn't close out the win for the team to now be 1-1. The Titans were down 14-10 at the start of the 4.h quarter when Chris Johnson was stopped in his own end zone for a safety. Tennessee started its next next drive at its own 1.yard line and moved the ball 99 yards for the lead. Jake Locker hit some big throws to Nate Washington (3-50) and Kendall Wright (7-54). The Titans took a 1.point lead when Locker fired a bullet to Delanie Walker for a 10-yard touchdown. On the next third down, Schaub threw a weak pass off his back foot and it floated right to Alterraun Verner, who cruised into the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown. Hopkins ran the wrong route to set up the interception. The Texans responded by moving the ball with passes to Hopkins and a gain to Andre Johnson to the 3-yard line. Johnson (8-76) was injured on the play and headed into the locker room to end his game with what looked like a possible concussion courtesy of a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bernard Pollard. That set up a short touchdown run from Arian Foster. Foster carried a defender to convert the 2.point conversion to tie it at 24. Houston got the ball back, and a 34-yard pass play to Keshawn Martin set up a last-ditch field goal from 46 yards out that was missed by Randy Bullock, his third miss of the game. The first 2 were from 51 yards. In overtime, runs by Foster (19-79) and Ben Tate (9-93) set up a miraculous catch by Hopkins to get the Texans to the 2.yard line. Houston won the game on third-and-goal when Schaub threw a ball along the sideline to Hopkins (7-117), and the rookie made a fabulous reception while tapping his feet in bounds for the score. Schaub finished 26-of-48 for 298 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. "

   "comment":"Tate and Josh Harris are fine runners, but they can't do what Bell is capable of on third downs. As a consequence, Ben Roethlisberger was under siege more than usual. Roethlisberger has enjoyed a clean pocket most of the season, but that wasn't the case Saturday night. He had time to throw on occasion, but the Ravens, particularly Haloti Ngata and Terrell Suggs, were able to harass him quite frequently. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh's secondary was worse than Baltimore's beleaguered defensive backfield. The Steelers couldn't cover the Baltimore wideouts, as Joe Flacco was able to dissect Pittsburgh's stop unit, including on third-and-long situations; Flacco converted several of those with impressive passes, keeping Roethlisberger off the field. The Steelers definitely have to address the secondary early and often, which is what I have happening in my 2015 NFL Mock Draft.    Flacco finished 18-of-29 for 259 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was sharp for most of the game, with his only blemish being a dropped interception in the second half. As mentioned, Flacco was fantastic on third-and-long situations, and he even converted a key 4.h-and-1 near midfield with a sneak.    Steve Smith must have wanted revenge on someone on Pittsburgh in a rubber match, so he was in 1 of his psychopathic modes. Smith was snatching everything out of the air and spinning the ball with fervor after being tackled. He caught 5 balls for 101 yards and just missed out on a touchdown when Flacco overthrew him in the second quarter. Torrey Smith, meanwhile, snatched just 2 passes for 28 yards, but came down with 1 of Flacco's scores. He nearly had a second when he got just 1 foot inbounds in the end zone.
