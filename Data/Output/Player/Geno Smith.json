Freeman came back to answer and get the Bucs a 17-15 lead with a field goal. But the backbreaking mistake was a 15-yard penalty on Lavonte David to give the Jets 15 critical yards so Nick Folk could hit a 48-yard field goal with 7 seconds remaining. Smith scrambled for about 8 yards and had stepped out of bounds when David gave Smith an extra shove to the ground. The penalty was reminiscent of Dwayne Rudd's helmet toss from 11 years ago. In total, Tampa Bay was penalized 13 times for 102 yards versus 6 infractions for 45 yards on New York.    The mistakes wiped out a great performance by "

   "comment":"Smith has been awful each time New York has gone down prior to this contest, but it was the defense that let the team down in this contest. New York simply had no answer for Andy Dalton, which sounds very odd. It started off a bit shaky for him, as Mohamed Sanu dropped a deep pass, but Dalton finished 19-of-30 for 325 yards, 5 touchdowns and an interception that was an odd pass that he tried to fit in between 2 defenders. This was highlighted by a perfect 53-yard bomb to A.J. Green, but the former first-round pick wasn't the most productive Cincinnati receiver in this contest. Marvin Jones caught 4 touchdowns against the Jets, and that was no fluke. A 2012 fifth-round pick out of California, Jones' quartet of scores were accompanied with 8 catches for 122 yards. His previous 2 contests saw him achieve decent stat lines of 3-71-1 and 4-57-1. He's a talented wideout and needs to be picked up in all fantasy formats, as he has grown into Dalton's second-favorite target.    Dalton's fifth score went to Jermaine Gresham (2-14). The other Bengal tight end, Tyler Eifert, also caught a pair of passes (2-23).    Giovani Bernard disappointed from a fantasy perspective. He carried the ball only 5 times for 18 yards. He appeared to fumble the ball just prior to crossing the goal line, which was initially called a touchback, but the officials ruled that he was down by contact after checking the replay. The Bengals didn't score, however, as BenJarvus Green-Ellis (11-33) was stuffed at the goal line. I thought going for it was a mistake because at 14-0, a field goal would've made it a 3.possession affair regardless, but it ultimately didn't matter. It's crazy to think Cincinnati could've posted even more points.    Of course, it helped the Bengals' point total that Geno Smith gave them 14 in the second half with a pair of pick-sixes. However, the Jets were down big at that point and Smith was just truing to make something happen. I'm not trying to imply that he played well, but he wasn't awful either. Smith finished 20-of-30 for 159 yards and the 2 interceptions. Oddly enough, Smith had fewer rushing yards (8 yards on 2 scrambles) than backup "

   "comment":"Smith was 4-of-15 for 42 yards and an interception. It seems like he hits a new low each week. - The Jets, at that point in the game, were just 1-of-12 on third downs. They achieved 3 first downs in the opening half. - New York was outgained, 212-73, in the first half. The team mustered only 137 net yards at that aforementioned point in the final period. - Greg Salas was the only Jet receiver to finish with more than 1 catch. He logged 2 receptions for 48 yards. I listed Smith's numbers at that particular stage because he compiled some junk yardage in the final few minutes when the Ravens stopped caring. He ultimately finished 9-of-22 for 127 yards and 2 picks. He also caught a 13-yard pass on the second drive, as New York showed tons of Wildcat formations early on, with Joshua Cribbs taking plenty of snaps. Cribbs went 1-of-2 for 13 yards and also had 20 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. Smith could be benched next week, by the way. Rex Ryan was non-committal on whether Smith would get the nod versus the Dolphins.    The Jets didn't run the ball well. Both "

   "comment":"Smith didn't look completely incompetent as many expected him to because he was battling a top defense on the road. Despite all of this, Carolina essentially won by 17 points, with a New York garbage-time, backdoor score making this a 10-point affair. That speaks volumes about the disparity between these 2 teams. Carolina didn't seem to take the Jets seriously. It bypassed field goals when those made sense, which drew the ire of Joe Namath on Twitter, while many of the players didn't show much urgency. Of course, you can't exactly blame the Panthers for being a bit lethargic; they were playing a non-conference opponent with a losing record in between battles against the arch-rival Saints. This game simply didn't mean as much as next week's battle against New Orleans.    Cam Newton went 16-of-24 for 273 yards and a touchdown along with 7 scrambles for only 12 rushing yards. Newton was chased down and was wincing in pain on a tackle at the end of the second quarter, so perhaps that's why he didn't run very much. Newton's passing yardage is impressive, but 72 yards came on a DeAngelo Williams screen that was turned into Newton's sole score. Williams sprinted toward the end zone, as David Harris looked like he was running in slow motion as he was trying to chase him. Dee Milliner was also at fault, being unable to get off his block.    In addition to his 72-yard receiving touchdown, Williams also had 81 rushing yards on 15 carries. That's the good news. The bad news is that Williams saw Mike Tolbert (12-18, TD) steal his goal-line carries yet again.    Greg Olsen led Carolina in receiving with 5 catches for 88 yards. Steve Smith, meanwhile, didn't do very much, hauling in 3 receptions for 20 yards.    As for the Jets, I mentioned that Smith didn't look completely incompetent, but he wasn't any good either. His final numbers - 15-of-28, 167 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (with 6 scrambles, 44 rushing yards) - don't tell the whole story.

   "comment":"Smith ran out of bounds after a scamper, and a Cleveland player shoved him when he was well out of the field of play. The official nearest to the action initially didn't throw a flag, which drew the ire of Rex Ryan. The Jets' coach looked like he was going to have a heart attack as he barked at the ref, and upon seeing a flag come in from elsewhere, he then went to the Cleveland defender and yelled at him. This seemed to energize the Jets - Smith in particular, who went 10-of-16 for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. The rookie ultimately finished 20-of-36 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) to go along with 48 rushing yards on 10 scrambles.    "

   "comment":"Smith at home, they just needed either a Baltimore loss at Cincinnati or a San Diego victory over the Kansas City backups. Miami got what it needed otherwise, but failed to take care of business on its end. There's blame to go all around for this loss. Beginning with Ryan Tannehill, the second-year quarterback completed just half of his passes, going 20-of-40 for 204 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. The picks obviously weren't good, but Tannehill hurt his team most with regular misfires. He had Mike Wallace wide open for an 80-yard touchdown, but completely missed him. Wallace torched Dee Milliner, but Tannehill couldn't hit him with a pass any quality quarterback should convert. Tannehill also made a mistake when he slid feet first just shy of the first-down marker. Instead of moving the chains, Tannehill's action forced a 4.h-and-inches situation. The Dolphins called for a Charles Clay run, which was predictably stuffed by David Harris. The Jets consequently took over on a very short field. A number of drops hurt Miami as well. Clay had a huge third-down drop on the opening drive. Rishard Matthews then let the ball fall through his hands in the second quarter. These are just some examples, and it didn't help Tannehill at all that he lost Brian Hartline to a knee injury after a 25-yard reception in the opening half. Two areas that hurt the Dolphins last week that weren't prevalent in this matchup were pass protection and the running game. Tannehill wasn't sacked a single time, and that isn't a fluke stat - Miami's beleaguered offensive line held up pretty well for the most part. It allowed some pressures, but Tannehill had enough time to operate in the pocket. Meanwhile, Lamar Miller ran well, gaining 73 yards on 17 carries.    As for the Jets, things looked bleak early on for Geno Smith when he threw late or behind some receivers. However, he got his act together and finished the game with 3 strong quarters. It started when he hit "

   "comment":"Smith looked completely awful without Eric Decker, going 4-of-12 for 27 yards and an interception. QBDK entered the game in the third quarter but wasn't any better, finishing 8-of-19 for 47 yards. He appeared to throw a touchdown late to save the shutout, but he was over the line of scrimmage when he fired the ball. Rex Ryan announced afterward that Smith would be the team's starting quarterback going forward. It really doesn't matter whom he gives the nod to because the Jets have no receiving talent to work with.    New York doesn't have much in the backfield either. "

   "comment":"Smith touchdown to Jeremy Kerley on their opening drive was wiped out by holding penalty. Another holding infraction negated a Chris Ivory 9-yard run in the red zone on the ensuing possession, and this was immediately followed by a Jace Amaro drop on what would've set up a manageable third-down situation near the goal line. Amaro, who saw the ball hit him right in the chest, was responsible for Geno Smith's first incompletion. More errors were prevalent throughout the evening. The Jets bobbled a handoff on second-and-1 in the red zone, which ultimately led to 1 of many field goals in the red zone. Rex Ryan also burned 2 timeouts in the third quarter. He needed those stoppages at the end of the game, as he was forced to try an onside kick. The Jets consequently had to march down from inside their own 20. Smith did a good job of at least putting the team into the edge of field-goal range, but the attempt was blocked.    Smith had a great outing. He made some mistakes, as he held on to the ball too long on a few occasions, and he sailed a pass over Amaro's head during a 2.point try that would've tied the game, but he was mostly sharp. He went 20-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he should've had a second score, but it was wiped out by a hold. Smith also scrambled 7 times for 37 rushing yards, as he had a pair of a clutch runs to move the chains. Smith, who has been much better this season when he's been able to target an "

   "comment":"Smith, I figured New York would completely quit, but the team put forth more effort in this contest than the Dolphins did - and yet this game was infinitely more important for Miami. Ryan hilariously gave the proverbial middle finger to John Idzik by not letting Smith throw the ball. While Idzik wanted to see what he had in his quarterback, Ryan called run play after run play. The Jets, at 1 point, called 14 consecutive rushes, and there was a span in which 23 of their 24 plays were kept on the ground. In total, New York finished with 45 running plays compared to 13 pass attempts from Smith. The thing is, you can't really blame the Jets for keeping it on the ground because they were able to pound it so effectively. The Dolphins even stacked the box, yet New York was gashing them for big gains, at least in the first half. "

   "comment":"Smith play in manageable situations, gaining 53 yards on 11 attempts.    Speaking of Smith, he definitely had 1 of his better games. Oddly enough, he usually plays his best against the Patriots despite numerous other outings in which he'll throw 3 picks in half a quarter of action. Smith went 17-of-27 for 210 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick was brutal, as it came when the Jets maintained a 13-10 lead in the 4.h quarter. It was a poor decision, as he released the ball off his back foot as he was getting hit. Smith had numerous nice moments, but that mistake, as well as an error in which he took a sack to move his team into poor field-goal range - the subsequent kick was short after Ryan wasted a timeout - helped derail this potential huge upset for the Jets.    Smith spread the ball around, with a quartet of players seeing 4 or more targets. Those were: "

   "comment":"Smith just had the best game of his career. He opened the contest 8-of-8, and then followed that up with a 40-yard bomb to Eric Decker, who beat Cortland Finnegan. Chris Ivory was then wide open for a touchdown when he leaked out of the backfield. The bewildered Dolphins didn't look like they knew what hit them, and it wouldn't get any better. The Jets generated 494 net yards of offense and gained a whopping 8 yards per play. Smith finished 20-of-25 for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a fumble that occurred because of terrible ball security. Granted, the Dolphins were extremely lethargic, but Smith had an amazing performance. Perhaps it'll give the Jets some optimism that he can turn into a decent quarterback with some good offensive coaching. They better hope so, as they'll probably be out of position to take either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as you can see in my .    It helped Smith that Eric Decker came alive. The former Bronco didn't produce numbers anywhere close to what he posted in Denver, but his season finale was exceptional. He caught 10 of the 11 targets thrown his way for a whopping 221 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught a number of deep bombs, including a 74-yarder where he easily beat coverage, and a 50-yarder, which he snagged over "
