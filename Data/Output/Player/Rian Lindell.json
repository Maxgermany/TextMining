   "comment":"Rian Lindell was wide right (shocker) on a 46-yard field goal at the end of regulation. The Jets won the coin toss and took the ball deep into Buffalo territory. Unfortunately, a long Jones run was nullified by a holding penalty. On the subsequent field goal attempt, there was an errant snap, so the holder had to try a pass on the botched play. The Bills intercepted it.   "

Hey, I'm not being facetious; the Texans have the No. 1 seed locked up, while Buffalo is a disgrace, so what did this final result matter? There are so many things the Bills did wrong in this contest against the sleepwalking Texans. This includes: - "
