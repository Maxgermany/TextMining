   "comment":"Rian Lindell was wide right (shocker) on a 46-yard field goal at the end of regulation. The Jets won the coin toss and took the ball deep into Buffalo territory. Unfortunately, a long Jones run was nullified by a holding penalty. On the subsequent field goal attempt, there was an errant snap, so the holder had to try a pass on the botched play. The Bills intercepted it.   "

Hey, I'm not being facetious; the Texans have the No. 1 seed locked up, while Buffalo is a disgrace, so what did this final result matter? There are so many things the Bills did wrong in this contest against the sleepwalking Texans. This includes: - Lindell just hit a 37-yard field goal, the Bills would have covered, which is obviously the most important thing to occur in this contest. Hey, I'm not being facetious; the Texans have the No. 1 seed locked up, while Buffalo is a disgrace, so what did this final result matter? There are so many things the Bills did wrong in this contest against the sleepwalking Texans. This includes: - Fred Jackson (6-21) and C.J. Spiller (6-39) received just 12 total carries even though the Texans were never up by more than 8 points until the 4.h quarter. On the bright side, they each caught 5 passes for 14 and 63 yards, respectively, so they were at least utilized in the passing game. - The Bills dropped several passes, particularly in the second half. Steve Johnson (3-29) and Donald Jones had the ball slip through their hands on plays that would have moved the chains. Scott Chandler (3-51) had 2 drops. Johnson was banged up; he took a fierce hit from safety Glover Quin in the second quarter and didn't look like himself after that. - Ryan Fitzpatrick was decent overall - 25-of-38, 239 yards - but had a crucial fumble in Houston territory in the 4.h quarter, as Whitney Mercilus stripped the ball out of his hand as he was trying to scramble for yardage. - As mentioned, Lindell completely whiffed on a 37-yard try. In a dome. It wasn't even close. - The defense was epically fooled on 1 play-action bootleg play. Every single defender bit on what they thought was an "
