Amazingly, the ball bounced right back up to Smith, who threw deep, almost connecting for a touchdown and getting a pass interference call on the Cowboys to boot. Breaks like that helped San Francisco scrap its way to a 14-0 lead. A pass interference penalty (25 yards) set them up at the 1-yard line for a short "

   "comment":"Smith moved the ball well and threw a perfect strike to Delanie Walker for a 26-yard touchdown. Walker was in the middle of 3 Tampa Bay players and went up to make a nice catch for the first score of the game. The Buccaneers responded with a 33-yard wide receiver screen to Arrelious Benn that set up a field goal. After that drive, and for the rest of the game, Tampa Bay's offense struggled.    The 49ers successfully drove the ball into Buccaneers' territory on the next drive, but Frank Gore fumbled the ball away, sacrificing a scoring opportunity. Josh Freeman gave it right back. He dropped back and had plenty of time to throw, but made a bad read on a throw to Kellen Winslow. The pass was picked off by Carlos Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.    Early in the third quarter, Smith and Gore kept moving the ball against the Buccaneers. Smith threw a nice pass to "

Cribbs caught a ball down the sideline and shed a tackle racing for a 46-yard touchdown. Leading by just 1 score, it was time for San Francisco's offense to regain their first-half form. This could mean only 1 thing - a pass to defensive tackle Sopoaga on third down from Cleveland's 32. It went for 18 yards and more importantly, allowed them to chew more time off the clock. The drive took 4:05 and concluded with a short Akers field goal to seal it at 20-10. Cleveland managed some garbage time yards and that was that. There really was not much to this game. Alex Smith (15-for-24 177 yards 1 TD) did his usual thing, taking just 1 sack with no turnovers. McCoy (22-for-34 241 yards 1 TD 1 INT) was on his back 4 times and had the key fumble on the opening drive. The 49ers rushed for 174 yards on the afternoon and were never legitimately in danger of losing the game even when the Browns pulled close late. Their conservative style might not work in a playoff setting against a high-powered offense, but in the regular season, it is serving them quite well.   "

I got a good laugh when Brian Billick referred to him as Fred while making a golf analogy about him getting his swing back. Maybe he thought he was covering Fred Couples at the Masters. The Cardinals had another unsuccessful drive as the first quarter wrapped up, but the 49ers were having trouble putting them away. Smith missed Crabtree for what should have been an easy touchdown and Akers had another field goal blocked, this time by Peterson who did not make his presence felt otherwise on special teams because he only got his hands on a punt return twice. San Francisco quickly got the ball back and drove down the field yet again. This march was highlighted by wide receiver "

On the second attempt, linebacker James Laurinaitis saved a touchdown, and San Francisco went up 6-0 with a short field goal. Next time out, the 49ers converted a third down with a pass to Crabtree (4-96, TD), but tight end Vernon Davis dropped an easy touchdown pass, forcing the possession to end with yet another field goal. After getting the ball back thanks to a sack from Larry Grant, the San Francisco offense kept its collective foot on the pedal as the half wound down, however Chris Long ended the threat with a sack. To its credit, St. Louis came to play defensively. Following the break, things started to unravel for the Rams. After quickly moving down the field on passes to Steven Jackson and former 49er Brandon Lloyd on an acrobatic play, it looked like they might do something. Then Dashaun Goldson intercepted Feeley on an awful throw. San Francisco's offense decided to get creative on this series, handing the ball off to a wide receiver (Ted Ginn Jr.) and pitching to a tight end (Delanie Walker) for 2 quick first downs. Then Alex Smith dropped a 52-yard bomb to Crabtree for a touchdown and the 16-0 lead. If St. Louis had any hope, it was extinguished right there. San Francisco overcame a penalty to open their next drive and ended up with a field goal to extend its advantage, leaving it 19-0 at the end of the third quarter.

One of their many MVPs this season, kicker David Akers, couldn't make good from 52 yards out though. Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs.

   "comment":"Smith, took care of business in crunch time. With Atlanta losing to Carolina, the 49ers still have a shot at landing the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The first half of the game was a defensive battle, and the 49ers clawed to a 6-3 lead. The Dolphins' defense played excellently led by Cameron Wake, who had 3 sacks and a forced fumble. In the third quarter, Miami gifted a touchdown to the 49ers. Marcus Thigpen muffed a punt inside the 10-yard line that San Francisco recovered. Gore (16-63 rushing, 2-22 receiving) banged the ball into the end zone a few plays later.  Kaepernick then dropped in a perfectly thrown bomb in the end zone to Randy Moss, but the veteran dropped it. Gore took the drive over with some powerful runs and a 19-yard reception. He moved the ball down the field to set up a short Anthony Dixon (2-9) touchdown plunge. Kaepernick put the game on ice with a 50-yard touchdown off a of a read option with 2:10 left in regulation. Jared Odrick blew contain to open up the side of the field. Kaepernick finished 18-of-23 for 185 yards with 6 carries for 53 yards and a score. Michael Crabtree (9-93) played well, while Moss (2-30) continued to prove he's a washed-up waste of a roster spot.    Ryan Tannehill played well once again, but he doesn't have the talent around him to help put Miami over the top. The offensive line allowed way too much pressure and the receivers were pitiful. He had a third-quarter deep ball that was slightly overthrown, but still should've been caught by Marvin Miller for a huge gain. The drive still ended well as Tannehill hooked up with Anthony Fasano for a touchdown on 4.h-and-goal. Fasano (2-9) made a tremendous reception as he laid out for a diving 1.handed catch along the sideline. Tannehill's final drives were shut down. He finished 17-of-33 for 150 yards with a score and zero interceptions. Tannehill played better than his stats indicate against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL. Davone Bess (5-50), Reggie Bush (14-65 rushing, 5-38 receiving) and Brian Hartline (2-34) were kept out of the end zone.    Aldon Smith continued his tremendous season with 2 sacks. Navarro Bowman, "

   "comment":"Smith consequently collected 2 sacks. San Francisco had 4 total sacks, which is a very high number considering Wilson's mobility.    There were some strange calls in this game, as it seemed early on that the officials had a vendetta against the Seahawks. There was a phantom whistle on a first-quarter punt that allowed San Francisco to block it. The Seattle players stood up, so there should have at least been a false start called on the team. Luckily for the Seahawks, the 49ers weren't able to capitalize because of Kaepernick's first interception. Other strange calls: The refs missed a very obvious offside call on the 49ers on 4.h-and-inches. Seattle was stuffed at the line of scrimmage, but should have been awarded with a first down. Later on, Navorro Bowman elbowed Wilson in the helmet. The officials once again neglected to throw a flag. The tide turned after halftime, however. The 49ers finished with 12 penalties. They killed themselves with some costly infractions, like a deep pass interference by Nnamdi Asomugha and a roughness penalty by Aldon Smith.   "

   "comment":"Smith's DUI and drug possession arrest was for the 49ers in this game. There's no way the Colts should've beaten them by 20.    Players and coaches have told me that there are times when their teams can get a boost of momentum when their front office and ownership go all in to make it clear they will do whatever it takes to win immediately. The Colts seemed to have that lift this week as they took care of business against the 49ers, while San Francisco seemed to still be reeling from last week's loss to the Seahawks. Aside from a good drive in the second quarter, the 49ers' offense looked like it was sleepwalking against a Colts' defense that hardly looked elite in Weeks 1 and 2. Offensively, Indianapolis got some use out of newly acquired running back Trent Richardson. He plunged into the end zone from a yard out early in the first quarter. While Richardson (13-35) contributed, Ahmad Bradshaw (19-95) did the heavy lifting for the Colts' offense. He ripped off a 27-yard to set up a short touchdown run on a bootleg by Andrew Luck. That score put Indianapolis up 20-7 with 7 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter and basically finished off the 49ers. Luck took care of the football and did his job as a game-manager. He completed 18-of-27 passes for 164 yards, plus ran for 24 yards and a score. Reggie Wayne (5-63) and Darrius Heyward-Bey (5-59) led the Colts' receivers. Indianapolis offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton had a solid game plan and stayed patient with the run game.    The Colts' defense really played phenomenal football. Linebacker Jerrell Freeman was awesome, as he led the team with 8 tackles and chipped in a sack and forced fumble. Cory Redding chipped in with half a sack and a deflected pass to set up a Cassius Vaughn interception. Robert Mathis played well with 1.5 sacks, too.    49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was off all day. Indianapolis' defense stopped the read option and never let Kaepernick get in sync. He completed only 13-of-27 passes for 150 yards with an interception and lost fumble. Kaepernick ran for just 20 yards on 7 carries. The Colts' secondary stepped up to have blanket coverage with enough pass rush to keep Kaepernick pressured. Anquan Boldin (5-67) was the only receiver to catch more than 2 passes for San Francisco. The 49ers ran the ball well early, but the Colts adjusted to shut that down. Frank Gore (11-82) led the way with over 40 yards on San Francisco's lone touchdown drive. That possession was capped with by a 13-yard touchdown run by Kendall Hunter (4-14). Gore also caught 2 passes for 21 yards.    The 49ers' defense played well until its members were exhausted in the 4.h quarter. Justin Smith had a sack; Ahmad Brooks, NaVorro Bowman and Patrick Willis all were solid."

   "comment":"Smith made his return in this game, but wasn't much of a factor. He wasn't seen on the field in the early going, and ultimately finished with about 12 snaps.    Cam Newton had a rough start to this game. He completed just 1 of his first 7 attempts - a 5-yarder - and was responsible for an ugly sequence that went: delay of game, timeout, interception because of bad mechanics. Newton also saw a potential second interception fall out of Navorro Bowman's hands, but that seemed to spark him because he was solid after that. The drive in which Bowman screwed up culminated with the only a touchdown of the game, a 27-yard DeAngelo Williams score. Newton was also 11-of-18 for 115 yards following intermission despite enduring drops by Brandon LaFell and Steve Smith, who ruined a drive by botching what would have been a first-down conversion on third down. Smith, however, was able to rebound with a big catch after that, finishing with 6 grabs for 63 yards. LaFell (4-48) was the only other Panther with more than 2 catches, as "

   "comment":"Smith dropped Griffin for no gain on a third-down run to force a punt. That refrain repeated itself with a good run by Morris, but the drive ended courtesy of a Ray McDonald sack. Meriweather forced a fumble from Carlos Hyde that let the Redskins took over at their own 40, but they did nothing with the possession. Washington finally got a nice drive going thanks to passes to Andre Roberts and Pierre Garcon (3-34). Morris (21-125) charged hard with 11 yards to the 1.yard line. He then finished the drive with a plunge into the end zone. Just before the half, the 49ers moved the ball with a tremendous 25-yard catch by Michael Crabtree (5-58) to set up a 41-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Kaepernick threw a ball up for grabs in the third quarter that was picked off by Greg Ducre. The Redskins didn't get anything out of that possession, but on the next drive, they moved the ball with an 11-yard run by Morris and a 31-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (2-39). Aaron Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. Ryan Clark added a 15-yard penalty on the play with his helmet-to-helmet hit. That moved ball inside the Redskins' 20-yard line. A pass to Boldin (9-137) moved it to the 4-yard line before Hyde (7-16) darted into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. The Redskins got 2 more possessions, but the 49ers' defense slammed the door as Lynch came up with a clutch sack on the first possession and Justin Smith beat Morgan Moses for a strip-sack that was recovered by Ahmad Brooks to end the game."

   "comment":"Smith, squeezing his foot like a grape in a wine press.    The initial speculation was dire, especially after he was transported to the hospital, but it appears he once again dodged a season-ending injury, but he will be out roughly 2 weeks with a mid-foot sprain. That's great news for Steelers fans and many fantasy players alike, as the Steelers take on the Browns next week and then have a bye. Then, it looks like he'll have a decent chance to return for the game at Seattle in Week 12.    These 2 teams did play a game on Sunday, and a pretty great game at that. There were 3 early lead changes before halftime and then, after the Steelers took a 2.touchdown lead with 11:28 left in regulation, the Raiders came back to tie it up 35-35 with 1:21 to go. That's when 1 Mr. "
