   "comment":"Tony Jefferson. Arizona couldn't do anything with the turnovers, and Stafford burned Jarraud Powers with a 50-yard pass to Corey Fuller (2-56) to the 6-yard line. The next play saw Stafford throw a touchdown pass to Theo Riddick (10-53-1). From there though, it was all Cardinals. Arizona's offense responded with a drive down the field. Carson Palmer hit Darren Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's "
