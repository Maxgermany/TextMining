   "comment":"Haggan. Cassel has now taken 10 sacks in the past 3 weeks.    Something shady that happened in this game - as if the final score doesn't make you scratch your head enough - was an attempted challenge by the Chiefs on a Broncos touchdown in the first quarter. It looked like the play could be overturned (it was pretty close), but the official ruled that the replay equipment was inoperable, which allowed the Broncos score to stand. This contest eventually got out of hand so it didn't matter, but if this weren't a blowout, the Chiefs would definitely have something to complain about.   "
