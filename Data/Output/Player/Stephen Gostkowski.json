Of course, Mason Crosby was errant on a try earlier and Davante Adams dropped a touchdown, so you can't exactly call that a bad beat - just a frustrating 1.    Hats off to Rodgers through, who continued his brilliant play at home. Despite Revis locking down Nelson, save for that 1 play, Rodgers managed to go 24-of-38 for 368 yards and 2 touchdowns, with a third throw that should've gone into the end zone to Adams. Rodgers injured his hand on 1 of his scrambles (5 carries, 22 rush yards), but didn't appear to be affected by it. He was helped by his offensive line, which provided tremendous protection. The Patriots barely put any pressure on him.    With Nelson smothered - he didn't even see a target until the 7:55 mark in the second quarter - Adams and Randall Cobb tied for the team lead with 11 targets. Adams and Cobb tallied 121 and 85 yards, respectively. Neither found the end zone, but Adams easily could have twice. I already mentioned his drop; he nearly had a touchdown in the first half, but managed to get just 1 foot inbounds. Meanwhile, Nelson managed just 2 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. Richard Rodgers (2-35) secured Aaron Rodgers' other score.    The Packers ran the ball well, especially in the first half. Eddie Lacy gained 98 yards on 21 carries. He had some big gains on the opening drive that really got things rolling for Green Bay.    As for the Patriots, Brady didn't have his best outing. Unlike Rodgers, Brady didn't have very good protection and had to rush some of his throws. His offensive line cost him big time on a third down of the final offensive drive for his team. He took a sack, which ended the drive and made Gostkowski's cover-killing field goal that much harder. Brady finished 22-of-35 for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns. He made some clutch throws, including a fourth-and-3 to "

Let's take a moment to congratulate Roger Goodell for installing a new rule that allowed a conference championship to be decided by an extra point. I doubt Goodell is upset though, as he finally got his revenge on the Patriots for failing to penalize them for Deflategate.    The stats say that Brady outplayed Manning, but that was hardly the case. Brady went 27-of-56 for 310 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, while Manning finished 17-of-32 for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brady's 310 yards were a byproduct of garbage time; by halftime, he was just 9-of-20 for 87 yards and the 2 picks.

The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2-point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the fourth quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew "
