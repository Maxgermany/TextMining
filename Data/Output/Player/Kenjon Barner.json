   "comment":"Barner took a punt deep into Cardinals' territory to set up another score. On Philadelphia's next possession, Torrey Smith finally didn't drop a deep pass, hauling in a 59-yard touchdown. The Eagles sputtered a bit after that through the end of the opening half, but they put the clamps on Arizona following intermission, outscoring them 13-0 in the second half.    Wentz was excellent, going 21-of-30 for 304 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half, which was a deep shot into the end zone. Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to Nelson Agholor (4-93), Smith (3-70), Zach Ertz (6-61) and Trey Burton (2-16). Jeffery didn't join in the party, but a 16-yard reception of his helped set up a touchdown. He caught 3 balls for 31 yards, as Patrick Peterson dominated the matchup.    LeGarrette Blount had some nice runs against Arizona, gaining 74 yards on 14 carries. His fantasy owners were pleased to see him score near the end of regulation, but a holding penalty nullified the touchdown. Corey Clement (7-17) and Barner (5-23) were also involved.    The 1 dark cloud over this victory for the Eagles was that right tackle "
