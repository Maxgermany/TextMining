Yes, 66. After Bradford took a sack near midfield with less than half a minute remaining in regulation, Jeff Fisher let the clock run down before calling a timeout. He had Zuerlein attempt a kick from 66 yards out, which would have set the record for the longest field goal in NFL history had the attempt gone through the uprights. It was wide left, unfortunately, though it had the distance.    The silver lining in this loss for St. Louis is that Bradford performed well despite the absence of Danny Amendola. Bradford went 26-of-39 for 315 yards (and 34 rushing yards), as he looked toward "

   "comment":"Zuerlein drilled a 61-yard field goal. Nick Foles led 2 more field goal drives, and the Rams took a 15-10 lead into the half. After a hot start, the Vikings' offense cooled. Bridgewater threw a deep ball into the end zone that was intercepted by Trumaine Johnson. Some runs by Peterson got Minnesota righted though, and Bridgewater ran in a 6-yard touchdown. He also ran in the 2-point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown. Then, the Vikings lost Bridgewater when he got nailed by a dirty hit from Lamarcus Joyner. Bridgewater was sliding and Joyner dived at his head. That knocked Bridgewater out of the game with concussion-like symptoms. After being held in check for most of the game, Gurley started pounding the Vikings' defense and moved the ball into Minnesota territory. That set up Zuerlein, but a 48-yard field goal attempt went wide right. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, Vikings backup "
