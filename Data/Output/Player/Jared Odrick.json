   "comment":"Odrick was knocked out in the second quarter with a rib injury. He managed to return, but Miami's run defense wasn't the same after that. Cornerback Jamar Taylor also exited, but he didn't come back into the game. His absence was painful, as the Dolphins were already missing Cortland Finnegan. They were so thin at corner and didn't stand a chance against Manning and his 2 stud wideouts.    Thomas and Sanders both had stellar performances. They each saw 13 targets, with Sanders reeling in 9 balls for 125 yards. He should've had a long touchdown, but Manning missed him. He did, however, making a diving catch on third-and-20 in the 2-minute drill at the end of the first half, getting open because of a fantastic double move. Thomas, meanwhile, hogged all of the scores. He found the end zone thrice on his 10 receptions for 87 yards.    As mentioned, the Broncos ran the ball especially well in the second half once Odrick got banged up. "
