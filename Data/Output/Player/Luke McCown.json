He also has a terrible habit of not looking downfield amid a pass rush, and shows terrible body language when things aren't going well (which is often the case). Gabbert's inaccuracy doesn't help matters. It was so bad that the CBS announcers made fun of him. After a poor pass, the color analyst (I think it was Rich Gannon) said: You have throw the ball to the receiver; not close to the receiver. Gabbert actually should have thrown a touchdown, but "
