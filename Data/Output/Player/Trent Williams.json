He also should've scored a second time on the ground. He showed a willingness to run, scrambling 5 times for 46 rushing yards. McCoy (4-of-7, 39 yards) shouldn't start again unless Griffin gets hurt. - Alfred Morris didn't run the ball enough; he gained just 49 yards on 14 carries. It's surprising he didn't do better with Griffin in the backfield with him. - DeSean Jackson played despite entering this game questionable. He saw 8 targets, but secured just 3 of them for 15 yards. Pierre Garcon (4-36) was only marginally better. Washington's leading receiver was Andre Roberts (2-81). - The Redskins surrendered 7 sacks, thanks in part to Trent Williams' injury in the second half. Williams exited with a shoulder issue.   "

   "comment":"Williams are the team's best run blockers by a wide margin. Washington 10.s to pound the ball left most of the time, so not having Lauvao on the field really hurt. Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the 4.h quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    Jordan Reed led the Redskins in receiving with 96 yards on 6 catches. He was targeted 9 times. Much of his yardage came in junk time, but he'll continue to serve as a TE1 as long as he stays healthy. Reed has been injury-prone in the past, but he has changed his diet, and it appears as though it's paying off.    No 1 else on Washington's roster stood out. Pierre Garcon had an inefficient evening, catching 5 of his 12 targets for 64 yards. Don't blame Garcon though; Cousins had him open for a touchdown, but the ball was underthrown.    You might notice that someone named Chris Thompson snatched 8 receptions for 57 yards and a touchdown. Thompson is the third-down back, and he was on the field so much because the team was so far behind in the second half. He's not worth owning in any league.    As for the Giants, Eli Manning was sharp for most of the night, going 23-of-32 for 279 yards and 2 scores. He nearly threw an interception to DeAngelo Hall, but the ball luckily skipped in front of the cornerback. Manning will continue to be a decent streamer versus bad defenses.    Manning's touchdowns went to Rueben Randle and Odell Beckham Jr. Each caught 7 balls each for 116 and 79 yards, respectively. Randle's score, a 41-yarder, came very late in which Manning surprised the Redskins with a pass on a third down as he was running out the clock. Randle wasn't even open; there was good coverage, but the ball bounced right into his hands after it was tipped. Beckham, on the other hand, is a legitimate stud receiver, and this sort of production will be typical for him going forward.    Larry Donnell caught 3 passes for 32 yards. He also dropped a pass. He's not worth owning in 12-team leagues that start only 1 tight end.    The Giants struggled to run the ball against Washington's stout front. Rashad Jennings, who contributed with a blocked punt, managed only 32 yards on 11 carries. Andre Williams, meanwhile, mustered only 29 yards on 14 attempts. He scored a touchdown in the first half. Neither is really much of a fantasy option until the other gets hurt. The offensive line just isn't opening holes, and neither back is talented enough to compensate for it.    "

   "comment":"Williams hobbled off the field at the end of the game. His current status is unknown, and his absence would be a crushing blow for this team.    I mentioned that the Redskins' good news was that Cousins played better than he had in previous games. The bad news was that their defense struggled to stop the Browns, surrendering 380 net yards. If it wasn't for untimely Cleveland turnovers, the Browns probably would've prevailed. The Redskins' secondary is in shambles because of injuries, while the pass rush was non-existent after "
