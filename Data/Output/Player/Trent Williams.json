Phil Simms, the color analyst for this game, refused to say Redskins throughout the telecast. Simms, however, actually said Redskins during last week's broadcast when promoting this contest. Jim Nantz, meanwhile, seemed to mock Simms by saying Redskins as much as possible. It was pretty odd to listen to, though still much better than Brad Nessler's constant errors last year. I'll never forget when Nessler said a punter kicked it into the night sky when the game was inside Minnesota's dome. Simms is extremely bland and can be very annoying at times, but he at least actually pays attention to the game. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the 4.h quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    "
