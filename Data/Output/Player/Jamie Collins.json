However, he was beaten by Julius Thomas for a big gain in the second half, as he just didn't match up well with the athletic tight end. On the other side, Champ Bailey played extremely well in Chris Harris' absence. Bailey is going to his first Super Bowl in his 15-year career. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
