In fact, it was so bad that most of the Carolina fans fled the stadium. It was impossible to even see who had the ball. Despite the rain, Gabbert was able to hook up with Mike Thomas on a 36-yard touchdown as time expired in the first half."

The bulk of his yardage came on a wide receiver screen to Mike Thomas (5-73) that went for 47 yards. Outside of that, Gabbert didn't have a completion longer than 18 yards. He was especially bad in the second half; he had just 34 passing yards after the break, as he continuously missed wide-open receivers.    "

The Jaguars, stricken with the NFL's worst passing offense, were going against the Steelers and their league-leading aerial defense. Gabbert was 6-of-14 for 33 yards in the opening half. He was sacked 3 times in the first 20 minutes alone (5 times overall). The Jaguars as a whole mustered a pathetic 68 total yards prior to intermission. The Steelers? Just 315 total yards in the same span.    It's a miracle the Jaguars were down just 2 scores prior to the break. It could have been much, much worse. "

   "comment":"Gabbert was so bad in this contest that he was benched in favor of Luke McCown. Gabbert went 13-of-29 for 136 yards and an interception that looked like a punt. Once again, he had major issues with pocket awareness. He also has a terrible habit of not looking downfield amid a pass rush, and shows terrible body language when things aren't going well (which is often the case). Gabbert's inaccuracy doesn't help matters. It was so bad that the CBS announcers made fun of him. After a poor pass, the color analyst (I think it was Rich Gannon) said: You have throw the ball to the receiver; not close to the receiver. Gabbert actually should have thrown a touchdown, but "

He shocked me, however, by going 5-of-5 on the ensuing drive, which culminated in Jones-Drew's aforementioned score. Gabbert didn't suck for a change early on because he had no pressure in his face. The Titans have no pass rush, so this was not a surprise. Gabbert was able to keep his eyes open during his attempts with no defenders threatening to bring him down. Unfortunately for Gabbert, the rest of his afternoon was a nightmare. From that point on, he completed just 16-of 37 passes for 130 yards and an interception (total numbers: 21-42, 198 yards, INT).    If you're wondering, Gabbert's leading receiver was someone named "

   "comment":"Gabbert fumbled the ball away in the second quarter, but Dan Orlovsky was able to overcome this with key interceptions. In the wake of this win, Indianapolis has secured the first-overall pick in the <b> </b>. Great job by the players, coaching staff and owners for ensuring that this franchise will have at least another decade of outstanding quarterback play.    Speaking outstanding quarterback play, Blaine Gabbert went 11-of-19 for 92 yards and a touchdown. I'm not saying that facetiously as I am with everything else; Gabbert performed exceptionally compared to how he's looked all year. Don't be too excited, however. Gabbert went 5-of-6 for 44 yards and a score in the first quarter, which means he was just 6-of-13 for 48 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble afterward. He once again wilted under pressure in the pocket, taking 3 sacks.    The Jaguars may have lost this contest (goodbye, Justin Blackmon?) but at least "

Don't be fooled by the final numbers; his stats came in complete garbage time where the Lions were just playing prevent. It's clear by now that he's not the long-term solution at the quarterback position. They can't possibly sell their fans on him for another season.

   "comment":"Gabbert tossed an early interception because of a miscommunication with Cecil Shorts - but the defense was very anemic. Kansas City outgained the Jaguars, 170-56 by halftime, as Alex Smith and Jamaal Charles did whatever they pleased.    Charles rushed for 77 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. He also caught 3 balls for 23 yards. He could've enjoyed a much brighter afternoon, but he left the game in the third quarter with a quad injury. Charles did return to rush the ball once in the 4.h quarter, but Kansas City didn't need him on the field because this game was such a blowout. Still, it's highly encouraging that Charles was able to take the field after getting dinged.    Smith, meanwhile, went 21-of-34 for 173 yards and a pair of scores. Smith obviously didn't trail by more than 2 throughout the afternoon, so he was able to do what he does best - check the ball down to his targets. Smith will have much greater issues when facing large deficits and tougher defenses, but he lives for games like this.    The 1 player hurt by Smith's constant checkdowns is Dwayne Bowe, who caught just 4 balls for 30 yards. If you're a Bowe fantasy owner, get used to performances like this. Bowe will have the occasional big game, but he'll have pedestrian numbers for a No. 1 wideout by the end of the season.    Let's get through the Jaguars quickly. Gabbert is terrible. He went 16-of-35 for 121 yards and 2 picks. The first interception, the aforementioned miscommunication, was not really his fault. The second 1 was, as he tossed the ball right to "

   "comment":"Gabbert to their resume. The Falcons had a dream matchup against San Francisco's porous defense, but they simply couldn't produce at all. It seemed like everyone was to blame. Matt Ryan posted quality stats - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 1 touchdown - but he left several points off the board with some bad throws. One play that stood out was when he missed a wide-open Devonta Freeman in the first half. Had Ryan converted, it would've been an easy 6. Ryan also had some sketchy passes in the red zone, as Atlanta seldom converted while deep in San Francisco territory. Ryan struggled for a couple of reasons. First, he was constantly under siege. His offensive line wilted against the 49ers' pass rush. The unit surrendered just 2 sacks, but it easily could've been a much higher number had Ryan not thrown the ball away so quickly. The pressure forced Ryan into those errant throws, 1 of which could've been intercepted by NaVorro Bowman. Ryan's pass flew right toward Bowman, but he dropped the easiest interception of his life. Also, Ryan didn't get much help from his receiving corps, which dropped several passes. Even Julio Jones let a ball fall through his hands.    Speaking of Jones, he still put together a strong fantasy outing, particularly for PPR formats. Jones saw 17 targets go his way, and he caught 10 balls for 137 yards. Freeman and Jacob Tamme also saw double-digit targets; Freeman caught 8 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown, but would've had a much bigger day had Ryan seen him on that 1 aforementioned play. Tamme, meanwhile, collected 6 receptions for 61 yards. He was guilty of a crucial drop.    Another rough outing for Roddy White: Despite Leonard Hankerson being out, White caught just 1 pass for 20 yards. He's not even close to any sort of fantasy radar.    Before I move on to the Falcons, I need to mention Dan Quinn and his horrible mistake late in the game. The Falcons, down 17-13, had a 4.h-and-goal on the San Francisco 2-yard line. Quinn opted for a field goal with 3 minutes remaining. The Falcons drew to within 1. but after kicking the ball away, they never obtained possession again. I thought this was horrible. Ryan and Jones are the strength of the team. Why not rely on them rather than a defense that had been shaky at best throughout the afternoon? Even if Atlanta wouldn't have converted, the 49ers would've been stranded deep inside their own territory.    San Francisco was able to keep possession with a Blaine Gabbert designed scramble on a third down. Gabbert played well throughout, going 15-of-25 for 185 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions to go along with 9 scampers for 32 rushing yards. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as "

While Kaepernick sailed helpless passes out of bounds, Gabbert has been somewhat sharp. He's not great, but he's so much better than the craven abomination we saw in Jacksonville.

   "comment":"Gabbert made a few decent passes against Carolina's defense, making sure to release the ball quickly to nullify the pass rush. This was effective at times, but the 49ers couldn't maintain consistent drives. It didn't help that Gabbert missed several throws, including 1 where his receiver was wide open on a third down. Gabbert finished 17-of-36 for 243 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions, but a 75-yard gain of his occurred in garbage time. One of Gabbert's picks was a horrific throw in which he forced the ball into double coverage.    Save for McDonald, who had that 75-yard reception, the only 49er to accumulate more than 30 receiving yards was "

You're going to hear the biased media pining for Communist Kaepernick, but the fact remains that Red Kaep was benched last year in favor of Gabbert because of his inability to read defenses and refusal to dedicate much time into film study. Going with Kaepernick would only make things worse, which I suppose is actually a good thing for the 49ers. They can take a quarterback early, which is what I have happening in my .

   "comment":"Gabbert pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by Calais Campbell. Drew Stanton hit Larry Fitzgerald for the tying touchdown on the very next play. Then, right after halftime, the San Francisco kick returner fumbled the ball inside his own 20. The Cardinals quickly reached the end zone once again with the help of a running-into-the-kicker penalty, taking a lead that they wouldn't relinquish. If there's anything that could've been learned from this dreadful game from Arizona's perspective, it's that Stanton is 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL. Battling 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL, Stanton struggled to move the chains. He was completely inaccurate on most of his throws. Stanton finished 11-of-28 for 124 yards. He did throw 2 touchdowns, but they were set up on short fields. The 1 silver lining is that Stanton didn't turn the ball over, but he was close on a couple of occasions. Arizona converted just 5-of-16 third downs because of his incompetence. What I really don't understand is why the Cardinals opted to keep Stanton over Matt Barkley during final cuts. Barkley was unquestionably the superior quarterback in the preseason, and it wasn't even close. Stanton was simply atrocious, and if the Cardinals played a real team this week, they would've lost. I don't understand what the point of the exhibition is if coaches are unwilling to keep obvious, superior talents at the position. All of the rhetoric that players are fighting for jobs is usually complete crap. Coaches know whom they're going to keep, and it usually doesn't matter what the players do.    Two Arizona offensive play-makers were factors in this contest. David Johnson was a beast, rushing for 157 yards and 2 touchdowns on 27 carries, as the 49ers, missing NaVorro Bowman, can't stop the run at all. Larry Fitzgerald, meanwhile, also scored twice, catching 6 balls for 81 yards in the process. He also had a terrific block to spring Johnson into the end zone. The only blemish of Fitzgerald's evening was a dropped pass, though Stanton delivered that pass awkwardly.    The Cardinals' other receivers did nothing. John Brown caught only 1 pass for 11 yards, while Michael Floyd failed to log a single reception. Floyd, who dropped 3 balls last week, let another 1 fall through his hands in this game.    Before moving on to the 49ers, it's noteworthy that both of Arizona's starting guards, Evan Mathis and Mike Iupati, left the game with injuries. Fortunately for the Cardinals, they have 10 days to get them, as well as Carson Palmer, back into the lineup.    San Francisco was the better team in the opening half, outgaining the Cardinals and posting a better yards-per-play average. However, their turnovers crushed them, and the defense eventually ran out of gas, as Arizona ran the ball down their throat on 1 soul-crushing drive in the 4.h quarter. Of course, the defense was on the field a lot because Blaine Gabbert was horrible. Gabbert had 1 nice drive in this contest, but floundered otherwise. He finished 18-of-31 for 162 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He was better than Stanton, but that's not really saing anything. One of the picks wasn't his fault, but he should've thrown another in the 4.h quarter. Gabbert did move around well - he scrambled 10 times for 70 rushing yards and a late touchdown - but that didn't make up for his other deficiencies. Gabbert did his usual thing where he threw way short of the first-down marker on numerous occasions, and he sailed balls on the rare occasions in which he hurled some shots downfield. He also took 7 sacks - including 1 for a safety - but some of those occurred because he ran out of bounds for a loss, which counts as a sack. The announcers are clamoring for Colin Kaepernick, but the 49ers' controversial backup is 20 pounds underweight and was benched in favor of Gabbert last year anyway. Kaepernick refuses to put work into the mental part of the game and will ultimately be a worse option. I'd say that's for the best, as it would help the 49ers' draft position - see my for more - but it doesn't matter at all. The 49ers are so devoid of talent, thanks to Trent Baalke's mismanagement, that it's going to be difficult for them to win more than 3 games regardless.    Want an idea of how horrible Gabbert was?

   "comment":"Gabbert stepped in for Kaepernick in the second half. He went 4-of-10 for 35 yards, which sadly was light years better than what Kaepernick was able to do. I think the 49ers should give Chistian Ponder a shot.    Kaepernick's incompetence ruined what could've been a great game by "

   "comment":"Gabbert. However, Savage and his teammates made enough surprisingly spectacular plays to post 31 points on the scoreboard, as Houston came away with a double-digit victory. Things didn't look good in the early going, as a potential Savage interception was dropped by Tyrann Mathieu. Savage was also strip-sacked, setting up an Arizona touchdown. And if that wasn't bad enough, Savage was picked off, as a pass of his deflected off Deone Bucannon's hands and into Patrick Peterson's, leading to another Cardinal trip to the end zone. It seemed like the Texans made up their mind to have Savage throw DeAndre Hopkins' way in the second half. Peterson blanketed Hopkins prior to intermission, but Hopkins had 2 big plays early in the third quarter, beating Peterson on a touchdown. On an ensuing drive, Savage converted a third-and-8 while falling down. He found Stephen Anderson, which moved the Texans into the red zone. Savage finished 22-of-32 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Of his yardage total, 136 came in the second half. He was much better this week, though he was battling a lethargic Arizona team.    Hopkins finished with 4 catches for 76 yards and a touchdown, and he came up inches short of another score. He and Bruce Ellington (6-63) were the only Texans with more than 22 receiving yards.    Lamar Miller was held to 61 yards on 22 carries, though he caught a touchdown, catching 4 balls for 22 receiving yards. D'Onta Foreman was much more impressive; he outgained Miller, 65-61, despite being given just 10 carries. He also scored twice, but suffered an injury on his second touchdown run. It turned out to be a torn Achilles, so Foreman is out for the rest of the season, unfortunately. There's a chance Foreman won't be ready for training camp.    As for the Cardinals, Blaine Gabbert did some nice things, especially in the opening half. He was 11-of-14 for 120 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission. To be fair, Gabbert was set up on a couple of short fields because of Savage's turnovers. Gabbert didn't have as much success following the break; he was 11-of-20 for 137 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks in the second half. Gabbert's final numbers were 22-of-34 for 257 yards, 3 scores and a pair of interceptions.    "
