The Jaguars, stricken with the NFL's worst passing offense, were going against the Steelers and their league-leading aerial defense. Gabbert was 6-of-14 for 33 yards in the opening half. He was sacked 3 times in the first 20 minutes alone (5 times overall). The Jaguars as a whole mustered a pathetic 68 total yards prior to intermission. The Steelers? Just 315 total yards in the same span.    It's a miracle the Jaguars were down just 2 scores prior to the break. It could have been much, much worse. "

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert, well, the Jaguars were down 10-0 before he even attempted a pass, so I was expecting the worst. He shocked me, however, by going 5-of-5 on the ensuing drive, which culminated in Jones-Drew's aforementioned score. Gabbert didn't suck for a change early on because he had no pressure in his face. The Titans have no pass rush, so this was not a surprise. Gabbert was able to keep his eyes open during his attempts with no defenders threatening to bring him down. Unfortunately for Gabbert, the rest of his afternoon was a nightmare. From that point on, he completed just 16-of 37 passes for 130 yards and an interception (total numbers: 21-42, 198 yards, INT).    If you're wondering, Gabbert's leading receiver was someone named "

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert fumbled the ball away in the second quarter, but Dan Orlovsky was able to overcome this with key interceptions. In the wake of this win, Indianapolis has secured the first-overall pick in the <b> </b>. Great job by the players, coaching staff and owners for ensuring that this franchise will have at least another decade of outstanding quarterback play.    Speaking outstanding quarterback play, Blaine Gabbert went 11-of-19 for 92 yards and a touchdown. I'm not saying that facetiously as I am with everything else; Gabbert performed exceptionally compared to how he's looked all year. Don't be too excited, however. Gabbert went 5-of-6 for 44 yards and a score in the first quarter, which means he was just 6-of-13 for 48 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble afterward. He once again wilted under pressure in the pocket, taking 3 sacks.    The Jaguars may have lost this contest (goodbye, Justin Blackmon?) but at least "

In the third quarter, he had as many pass attempts (13) and passing yards. He's terrible; it's no wonder why half of Jacksonville's front office thinks he's a sunk cost.

He threw a touchdown but also was responsible for an ugly interception the 1 time he took a shot downfield. It's also worth noting that he lost a fumble on a strip-sack, but that was negated by a face mask penalty.    Gabbert's sole score went to Marcedews Lewis (3-32). Meanwhile, "

Even more laughable was his Hail Mary attempt at the end of the first half; throwing from midfield, Gabbert's weak lob sailed only 30 yards and was nearly intercepted at the Detroit 20-yard line. Gabbert would end up finishing 27-of-38 for 220 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks, 1 of which was a pathetic pass that just seemed to die in mid-air. Don't be fooled by the final numbers; his stats came in complete garbage time where the Lions were just playing prevent. It's clear by now that he's not the long-term solution at the quarterback position. They can't possibly sell their fans on him for another season.

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert to their resume. The Falcons had a dream matchup against San Francisco's porous defense, but they simply couldn't produce at all. It seemed like everyone was to blame. Matt Ryan posted quality stats - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 1 touchdown - but he left several points off the board with some bad throws. One play that stood out was when he missed a wide-open Devonta Freeman in the first half. Had Ryan converted, it would've been an easy 6. Ryan also had some sketchy passes in the red zone, as Atlanta seldom converted while deep in San Francisco territory. Ryan struggled for a couple of reasons. First, he was constantly under siege. His offensive line wilted against the 49ers' pass rush. The unit surrendered just 2 sacks, but it easily could've been a much higher number had Ryan not thrown the ball away so quickly. The pressure forced Ryan into those errant throws, 1 of which could've been intercepted by NaVorro Bowman. Ryan's pass flew right toward Bowman, but he dropped the easiest interception of his life. Also, Ryan didn't get much help from his receiving corps, which dropped several passes. Even Julio Jones let a ball fall through his hands.    Speaking of Jones, he still put together a strong fantasy outing, particularly for PPR formats. Jones saw 17 targets go his way, and he caught 10 balls for 137 yards. Freeman and Jacob Tamme also saw double-digit targets; Freeman caught 8 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown, but would've had a much bigger day had Ryan seen him on that 1 aforementioned play. Tamme, meanwhile, collected 6 receptions for 61 yards. He was guilty of a crucial drop.    Another rough outing for Roddy White: Despite Leonard Hankerson being out, White caught just 1 pass for 20 yards. He's not even close to any sort of fantasy radar.    Before I move on to the Falcons, I need to mention Dan Quinn and his horrible mistake late in the game. The Falcons, down 17-13, had a 4.h-and-goal on the San Francisco 2-yard line. Quinn opted for a field goal with 3 minutes remaining. The Falcons drew to within 1. but after kicking the ball away, they never obtained possession again. I thought this was horrible. Ryan and Jones are the strength of the team. Why not rely on them rather than a defense that had been shaky at best throughout the afternoon? Even if Atlanta wouldn't have converted, the 49ers would've been stranded deep inside their own territory.    San Francisco was able to keep possession with a Blaine Gabbert designed scramble on a third down. Gabbert played well throughout, going 15-of-25 for 185 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions to go along with 9 scampers for 32 rushing yards. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as "

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert once again proved to be an upgrade over the 2015 version of Colin Kaepernick. I can't believe I just wrote that. Gabbert went 22-of-34 for 264 yards and a touchdown. He pulled a Kaepernick early by carelessly sailing passes out of bounds, but got into a rhythm beginning in the middle of the second quarter. However, it should be noted that he was extremely fortunate to get away with 3 interceptions. "

Ever since he took over for Colin Kaepernick, the 49ers upset the Falcons, battled the Seahawks tough, nearly defeated Arizona and took down the Bears. While Kaepernick sailed helpless passes out of bounds, Gabbert has been somewhat sharp. He's not great, but he's so much better than the craven abomination we saw in Jacksonville. Gabbert went 18-of-32 for 196 yards and a touchdown, and he also did his best positive Kaepernick impression, scrambling for 75 yards and a second score, which was a 44-yard gallop to tie the game late in the 4.h quarter.

In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, Case Keenum moved the ball across midfield with a completion to Britt for 18 yards. However, Dontae Johnson blocked a 48-yard field goal to keep the 49ers alive. San Francisco took advantage with a 15-yard pass to Torrey Smith, a roughing the passer penalty, and a 33-yard screen to Quinton Patton. That set up a short field goal for Phil Dawson to mercifully end this game.    Blaine Gabbert was 28-of-44 for 354 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. He didn't play poorly, but he spent most of the afternoon checking the ball down.    DuJuan Harris had a nice game for the 49ers with 67 yards on 16 carries and 86 yards on 8 receptions.

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert is not the answer, but it's really that simple. Gabbert went 14-of-25 for 119 yards and 1 interception. Sadly, he was nearly picked on 3 other occasions. You're going to hear the biased media pining for Communist Kaepernick, but the fact remains that Red Kaep was benched last year in favor of Gabbert because of his inability to read defenses and refusal to dedicate much time into film study. Going with Kaepernick would only make things worse, which I suppose is actually a good thing for the 49ers. They can take a quarterback early, which is what I have happening in my .

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert somehow threw short of the first-down marker on 4.h down. This amused me because San Francisco's decisions to hire Kelly and go with Gabbert as the starter were ridiculous. It's apparent now that this is the worst team in football.    This historic NFL rivalry served as a backdrop of 2 great franchises going in opposite directions. Dallas enjoyed another win with rookie quarterback Dak Prescott managing the game well, while rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott ripped the 49ers' defense. San Francisco illustrated once again that it is in for a long season with a serious lack of talent to build on for the future.    The Cowboys moved the opening drive into field goal range before Dan Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal. San Francisco then marched down the field with Gabbert hitting Jeremy Kerley, who was wide open in blown coverage, for a 33-yard score. The next drive by the 49ers was led by completions to Garrett Celek (5-79) for 38 yards and a 17-yarder to Kerley. That set up a short touchdown run for Carlos Hyde. The Cowboys answered with a drive that was aided by the officials as they made a terrible roughing call on Jaquiski Tartt. Dallas took advantage with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams (4-44-1). Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock. To start the second half, Hyde rumbled for 32 yards, and Gabbert threw a beautiful pass to Celek for 29 yards. The 49ers settled for a short field goal, but that was all the offense they could muster in the final 2 quarters. Dallas got going when Elliott ripped off a 23-yard run. Prescott connected on a couple of passes, and then Elliott plunged into the end zone for the game-winning score. Early in the 4.h quarter, Gabbert threw a poorly placed pass, and it was intercepted by Morris Claiborne. Elliott continued to run wild as Dallas added on a field goal. The Cowboys' defense shut the door with Claiborne making a tackle on Torrey Smith on a 4.h down to end the game.    The star of the game offensively was Elliott. He ran for 138 yards on 23 carries with a touchdown and had 1 reception for 19 yards. Dallas was without Tyron Smith and La'el Collins, yet still controlled the line of scrimmage.    Dak Prescott was 23-of-32 for 245 yards with 2 touchdowns. Dez Bryant was out, and Cole Beasley totaled 66 yards on 3 receptions. Jason Witten (7-47) chipped in some clutch catches to move the chains.    Blaine Gabbert was 16-of-23 for 196 yards with 1 score and 1 interception. Jeremy Kerley led the 49ers in receiving with 6 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 74 yards on 15 carries with a touchdown.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Blaine Gabbert. However, Savage and his teammates made enough surprisingly spectacular plays to post 31 points on the scoreboard, as Houston came away with a double-digit victory. Things didn't look good in the early going, as a potential Savage interception was dropped by Tyrann Mathieu. Savage was also strip-sacked, setting up an Arizona touchdown. And if that wasn't bad enough, Savage was picked off, as a pass of his deflected off Deone Bucannon's hands and into Patrick Peterson's, leading to another Cardinal trip to the end zone. It seemed like the Texans made up their mind to have Savage throw DeAndre Hopkins' way in the second half. Peterson blanketed Hopkins prior to intermission, but Hopkins had 2 big plays early in the third quarter, beating Peterson on a touchdown. On an ensuing drive, Savage converted a third-and-8 while falling down. He found Stephen Anderson, which moved the Texans into the red zone. Savage finished 22-of-32 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Of his yardage total, 136 came in the second half. He was much better this week, though he was battling a lethargic Arizona team.    Hopkins finished with 4 catches for 76 yards and a touchdown, and he came up inches short of another score. He and Bruce Ellington (6-63) were the only Texans with more than 22 receiving yards.    Lamar Miller was held to 61 yards on 22 carries, though he caught a touchdown, catching 4 balls for 22 receiving yards. D'Onta Foreman was much more impressive; he outgained Miller, 65-61, despite being given just 10 carries. He also scored twice, but suffered an injury on his second touchdown run. It turned out to be a torn Achilles, so Foreman is out for the rest of the season, unfortunately. There's a chance Foreman won't be ready for training camp.    As for the Cardinals, Blaine Gabbert did some nice things, especially in the opening half. He was 11-of-14 for 120 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission. To be fair, Gabbert was set up on a couple of short fields because of Savage's turnovers. Gabbert didn't have as much success following the break; he was 11-of-20 for 137 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks in the second half. Gabbert's final numbers were 22-of-34 for 257 yards, 3 scores and a pair of interceptions.    "
