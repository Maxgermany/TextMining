   "comment":"Sambrailo, who, according to the announcers, wasn't healthy. Still, Beasley was dominant, and it made Lynch's first start extremely miserable. Lynch finished 23-of-35 for 223 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also fumbled once, but managed to recover it. The stat line doesn't look bad, but that's because Lynch generated a bunch of his yards in garbage time. He had accuracy issues, as a number of his early throws were all over the place. He also should've been picked a second time, but "
