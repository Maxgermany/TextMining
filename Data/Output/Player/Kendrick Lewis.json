The old veteran beat the bigger cornerback Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by Chris Carter moved the ball to the Bengals' 23-yard line. The Cincinnati defense tightened and forced a short field goal to cut Cincinnati's lead to 14-10. The Ravens took the lead midway through the 4.h quarter when Elvis Dumervil beat Eifert around the corner to get a blind-side strip-sack on Dalton. Linebacker C.J. Mosley scooped up the loose ball and ran it 41 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 17-14 lead. The Bengals answered in tremendous fashion. Dalton hit Green down the seam to around midfield. He broke a tackle from Smith and maintained his feet to run 80 yards for a touchdown. It was a coverage bust as safety Kendrick Lewis was lined up at corner and Will Hill was caught out of position downfield. Baltimore moved back into Cincinnati territory thanks to completions to Smith. The old veteran beat the bigger cornerback "
