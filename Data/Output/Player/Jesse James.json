   "comment":"Jesse James to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead heading into halftime. Kizer, at the very least, looked like someone who is able to win football games. He showed good escapability and poise while also being knocked down often. He does need to learn that getting out of bounds is something he should do rather than cutting it back inside so he can bypass RGIII's career. If Kizer can learn to throw the ball away and get out of bounds, he has enough ability to keep the Browns in game, like he did today. Cleveland's running game was not nearly as effective as coach Hue Jackson would have liked, as lead back Isaiah Crowell rushed 17 times for just 33 yards. The Steelers are a strong defense, but the Browns should be able to do more damage than that with a good offensive line and Crowell, who looked great when healthy last season. Duke Johnson didn't receive 1 rushing attempt and ended up catching just 2 passes as he worked often from the slot. The Browns may need to get him involved as a runner again. The second half didn't pick up that much for the Steelers offensively, but Brown continued his destruction of the Browns' defensive backs and ended up sealing the game with a 36-yard reception in traffic. It was his 11th target of the day, which also made it his 11th reception, which helped him to a whopping 182 yards. Amazingly, his 182 yards on Sunday are just his 6.h-best yardage total in his career. The Steelers' second touchdown also came on a short pass from Roethlisberger, and this time it went to Jesse James, again! Sorry fantasy players, James really did rob many of you this week. After James' second touchdown, the Steelers had an 11-point lead late in the third quarter, which looked even bigger when Kizer was intercepted by "
