   "comment":"James (5-83), Eli Rogers (5-27) and Le'Veon Bell.    Bell didn't do much aerially - his 2 receptions went for minus-4 yards - but he was exceptional as a runner, gaining 170 yards on 30 carries. He once again displayed his trademark great patience, and Kansas City's struggling run defense had no answer for him.    Pittsburgh's Killer Bees all performed well, and tha trio might now be a quartet in the wake of Chris Boswell's record-setting performance. Boswell connected on an NFL playoff record 6 field goals - the Steelers' only scores of the evening.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, once again failed to win a home playoff game, as they haven't done so since Joe Montana quarterbacked them in 1993. And no 1 is going to confuse Alex Smith with Montana, obviously, but that's not to say Smith performed poorly. Smith wasn't great - he missed some opportunities downfield because he wanted to check down instead - but he made some nice throws, including a connection to Jeremy Maclin for 20 yards on a third-and-20. Smith was also victimized by numerous drops. I counted 5. but there could've been 1 more. Smith finished 20-of-34 for only 172 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he was hit upon releasing the ball. Smith faced pressure for most of the evening, as James Harrison ate Eric Fisher for breakfast."

   "comment":"James to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead heading into halftime. Kizer, at the very least, looked like someone who is able to win football games. He showed good escapability and poise while also being knocked down often. He does need to learn that getting out of bounds is something he should do rather than cutting it back inside so he can bypass RGIII's career. If Kizer can learn to throw the ball away and get out of bounds, he has enough ability to keep the Browns in game, like he did today. Cleveland's running game was not nearly as effective as coach Hue Jackson would have liked, as lead back Isaiah Crowell rushed 17 times for just 33 yards. The Steelers are a strong defense, but the Browns should be able to do more damage than that with a good offensive line and Crowell, who looked great when healthy last season. Duke Johnson didn't receive 1 rushing attempt and ended up catching just 2 passes as he worked often from the slot. The Browns may need to get him involved as a runner again. The second half didn't pick up that much for the Steelers offensively, but Brown continued his destruction of the Browns' defensive backs and ended up sealing the game with a 36-yard reception in traffic. It was his 11th target of the day, which also made it his 11th reception, which helped him to a whopping 182 yards. Amazingly, his 182 yards on Sunday are just his 6.h-best yardage total in his career. The Steelers' second touchdown also came on a short pass from Roethlisberger, and this time it went to Jesse James, again! Sorry fantasy players, James really did rob many of you this week. After James' second touchdown, the Steelers had an 11-point lead late in the third quarter, which looked even bigger when Kizer was intercepted by "

The numbers look great, but they don't tell the whole story, as indicated by the drops. Plus, most of his stats came on a 97-yard touchdown to JuJu Smith-Schuster, who beat his man easily. Roethlisberger delivered an intermediate throw, and Smith-Schuster did the rest. Smith-Schuster was tremendous, catching 7 balls for 193 yards and the long score. It's scary how good he can become, as he's not even 21 years old yet! His only blunder was dropping a pass on a third down.    Following Smith-Schuster, Antonio Brown led the Steelers with 5 catches for 70 yards. He, Smith-Schuster and James (2-42) were the only Steelers with double-digit receiving yardage. "
