   "comment":"Brian Griese. Griese, whose arm is an upgrade over Jeff Garcia's, was 18-of-31 for 160 yards and a touchdown versus a pretty soft defense. Griese is known for his mental ineptness, so Buccaneer fans shouldn't get excited because he's bound to make tons of errors when it counts. Jon Gruden, meanwhile, should be excited because Griese's performance means he can kick sworn enemy Jeff Garcia off his roster.    While Griese's numbers weren't spectacular, "
