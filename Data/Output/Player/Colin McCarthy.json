   "comment":"Colin McCarthy and Johnson ripped off a long run for a field goal. The Buccaneers had 1 more shot. They moved the ball inside the Titans 30. On 4th-and-1, Freeman fumbled the snap and was stuffed after recovering the ball to end the game. Subtracting the fumbles, both teams running backs played well. Johnson had a huge game with 190 yards on 23 carries. Tampa Bay's offensive line played well and Blount did a good job with 103 yards on 20 carries. Tennessee left a lot of points on the field and easily could have lost this game, so they should consider themselves lucky that they won.   "
