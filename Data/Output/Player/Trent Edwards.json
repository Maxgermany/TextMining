Three NFL teams have had single plays longer than that today.    Edwards finished 18-of-34 for 139 yards and a touchdown. His refusal to throw the ball downfield - even at the end of the game when he had no choice - is really disturbing. He cannot be allowed to start any longer.    "

Bouman tossed a pick-six in the third quarter and struggled from that point on. He finished 18-of-34 for 222 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks.

   "comment":"Edwards injured. Bouman's kids were too young to remember him under center, so they got to watch to watch their dad play the Chiefs. Things started well - the camera panned to his wife and children whenever he made a good play - but it all fell apart in the second half. Bouman tossed a pick-six in the third quarter and struggled from that point on. He finished 18-of-34 for 222 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. Romeo Crennel, looking rather snazzy in a sweater vest and jacket, finally figured out how to stop the great Bouman.    "

David Garrard, meanwhile, phoned into the CBS broadcasting team in the second quarter. It was really strange hearing him talk on the phone while his team was playing.    The Jaguars were able to stick around for a while with a strong running game despite not having Maurice Jones-Drew. In the first half alone, "
