   "comment":"Trent Edwards out and put on his uniform, but those passes sure were impressive.    Edwards went 18-of-28 for 185 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick that went right through Owens' hands. That means that if you take away Owens' 2 long grabs, Edwards was just 16-of-26 for 102 yards, giving him a gaudy YPA of 3.9. Thanks for the effort, Trent.    "

   "comment":"Trent Edwards was 4-of-7 for 8 yards. When he hit his next pass, I posted the following on the forum, Trent Edwards has hit double-digit passing yards!!! - The Bills had just 9 first downs in this game. - Buffalo was 3-of-14 on third downs (as a comparison, Miami was 8-of-18). - The Bills had only 72 yards on their first 9 possessions. - Of Buffalo's first 7 possessions, 5 were 3.and-outs. - This 1 is from LeeLee: The Bills have 76 yards of offense after 3 quarters. Three NFL teams have had single plays longer than that today.    Edwards finished 18-of-34 for 139 yards and a touchdown. His refusal to throw the ball downfield - even at the end of the game when he had no choice - is really disturbing. He cannot be allowed to start any longer.    "
