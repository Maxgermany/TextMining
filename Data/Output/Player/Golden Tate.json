Brady, meanwhile, went 36-of-58 for 395 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions. Those are awesome fantasy numbers, but Brady made a number of mistakes.

   "comment":"Golden Tate to set up a 51-yard field goal from new kicker Alex Henery. The Lions took the lead, as Stafford laid out a beautiful 59-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Ross (2-65), who burned Antonio Allen and Calvin Pryor to get wide open. Just before halftime, Stafford rifled the ball down the field before hitting Eric Ebron for a 16-yard score. New York had terrible play-calling in the first half, as Ivory had only 5 carries after the first drive, while the offense produced steady 3.and-outs trying to pass the ball with Smith. The Jets moved the ball in the third quarter with a nice pass to Greg Salas. On a third-and-7, on the Detroit 11-yard line, Smith hit Eric Decker (4-48), and the big wideout dived into the end zone. Detroit came right back with a 90-yard drive as passes to Ryan Broyles, and Tate moved the ball to the goal line. Stafford ran the ball in on a rollout. Smith responded by setting up the Lions for more points as he sailed a pass over the middle for an easy interception to Darius Slay, who returned his first career interception 41 yards. The Lions then missed the field goal. Smith followed that up with a fumble on a sack by James Ihedigbo. Chris Johnson (6-44) had a fluky 35-yard touchdown run after a few missed tackles, and some Lion defenders watched the play rather than running to the ball. Detroit, however, salted the win away with Reggie Bush (12-46) to take sole possession of first place in the NFC North.    Stafford completed 24-of-34 passes for 293 yards with 2 passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. Golden Tate was Detroit's featured receiver, as he had 116 yards on 8 receptions.    Smith completed 17-of-33 passes for 209 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Decker and Ivory (17-84 rushing, 2-16 receiving) each had a few dropped passes that could have gone for nice gains. The Jets' offensive line had its hands full, as Tate to set up a 51-yard field goal from new kicker Alex Henery.

   "comment":"Golden Tate touchdown. Bridgewater then fired a pass behind his target, which Darius Slay picked off. The Lions were able to add 3 points, suddenly putting themselves within striking distance. The mistakes continued in the second half. The Vikings were in field-goal range, but Bridgewater took a terrible sack because he held on to the ball too long. That helped force a Blair Walsh kick, which was blocked. Bridgewater had a chance to lead his team back in the 4.h quarter once Detroit established the lead, but fired a pass way over an open Jarius Wright's head, ultimately forcing Walsh to try another attempt from 68 yards out. The attempt, which would've been an NFL record, went wide left, securing the victory for the Lions.    It's a shame that Bridgewater made those errors because he was great otherwise. He misfired on just 10 attempts, going 31-of-41 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. He also moved around well, scrambling thrice for 30 rushing yards. Even with the turnovers, this performance has to be encouraging because Bridgewater was battling such a tough defense.    Bridgewater's primary wide receiver once again was Charles Johnson. The athletic wideout continued to shine, as he caught 5 passes for 72 yards. He was 1 of 3 players to draw 7 targets. The others were Kyle Rudolph (7-69) and Matt Asiata (7-50). Greg Jennings (3-43) hauled in Bridgewater's sole touchdown. He mad a great adjustment on 1 of Bridgewater's throws, but it appeared as though he had 1 foot out of bounds. Jim Caldwell challenged, but he strangely did not win the review.    Though Asiata had a nice performance as a pass-catcher, he did very little as a runner, as he struggled to find room against Detroit's ferocious front line. He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds. That ended up costing Minnesota precious seconds.    As for the Lions, they were really fortunate to get those turnovers from Bridgewater because they did nothing offensively all afternoon. They converted just 2-of-11 third downs, as Matthew Stafford faced a ridiculous amount of pressure from Minnesota's ferocious pass rush. He struggled with his accuracy as a result, failing to find Calvin Johnson for most of this contest. Stafford went 17-of-28 for just 153 yards and a touchdown. About 2.thirds of that yardage came in the second half, as Stafford did enough on 1 drive to set up the team with a game-winning field goal.    Another reason why Stafford couldn't connect with Megatron was because Xavier Rhodes did a great job of covering him. Most conrerbacks struggle against the best receiver in football, but the 6-foot-1 Rhodes is tall enough - and talented enough - to deal with him. Johnson still led the team in receiving, but had just 4 catches for 53 yards. A big chunk of that came on a short crossing pattern on the game-winning drive.    Stafford's sole score was thrown to Golden Tate, who caught all 7 of his targets, but for only 38 yards.    Tate touchdown.

   "comment":"Golden Tate touchdown reception and a 99-yard drive comprised of a running-into-the-punter penalty, a Stafford scramble for a first down, and some nice runs by Joique Bell and Reggie Bush.Tate touchdown reception and a 99-yard drive comprised of a running-into-the-punter penalty, a Stafford scramble for a first down, and some nice runs by Joique Bell and Reggie Bush. The Lions, however, struggled after that despite having the luxury of Rolando McClain out of the game with an obscure injury. Stafford was nearly intercepted in the red zone at the end of the first half when he carelessly flung the ball into double coverage. He was then picked right after the break because of a tipped pass by Jeremy Mincey. Stafford topped that off with 2 fumbles on the final drive of the game. He was fortunate to get the first back because the Dallas defender also coughed up the ball, but he didn't have the same luck the second time.    Stafford finished 28-of-42 for 323 yards, 1 touchdown, the interception and 2 lost fumbles. As mentioned, he was hot early on, but was just 11-of-18 for 132 yards and 3 turnovers following halftime. Much like Romo has done in the past, Stafford choked down the stretch.    Stafford's sole score was the 51-yarder to Tate, who led the team with 89 receiving yards on 6 catches. "

The Redskins were set to tie the game at 3 thanks to completions to Jamison Crowder, but Dustin Hopkins missed a 45-yarder off the upright. On the final play of the half, Hopkins tied the game at 3. In the third quarter, the Lions got moving with an 18-yard run from Stafford and then a 52-yard bomb to Marvin Jones, who got a step on Josh Norman. Norman was injured on the play and went into the locker room with a concussion. A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10.

Stafford, however, was not penalized for the turnover because the Vikings didn't score off the give-away.    Stafford endured some drops in the opening half. Anquan Boldin dropped a pass on third down, while Marvin Jones let the ball fall through his hands shortly later. Neither player did much, save for Boldin catching a touchdown.

   "comment":"Golden Tate legally, allowing Justin Bethel to snatch an easy interception. The Lions then botched a punt attempt, where the punter ran the ball to Arizona's 13-yard line, getting hurt in the process. The Cardinals couldn't convert on 2 series, as they were given a second because of a Detroit leaping penalty. Palmer tried to help the Lions after that with a near-interception, but Haloti Ngata dropped the ball. Not to be outdone, Palmer launched a pick because he couldn't step into his throw. The Lions tried to screw themselves from taking advantage of it with a hold, but they managed to score a touchdown. Of course, they messed up the extra point. To conclude the opening half, Palmer was nearly intercepted again, but the ball hit the ground. Phil Dawson made sure Arizona would hurt itself by hitting the left upright on a 32-yard field goal. The Lions had a cleaner second half despite some Kenny Golladay drops. The Cardinals, on the other hand, continued to kill themselves. J.J. Nelson dropped a deep touchdown, then a score to Jermaine Gresham was wiped out by a hold. David Johsnon then lost a fumble and got hurt in the process. And if that wasn't enough, Palmer was pick-sixed to end Arizona's chances.    This was an ugly loss for the Cardinals, but the silver lining is that the X-rays on David Johnson's wrist came back negative. Johnson struggled as a runner, gaining 23 yards on 11 carries, though he did catch 6 passes for 68 receiving yards. His fantasy owners missed out on a touchdown because Kerwynn Williams (5-10) vultured 1 after Johnson left the game. However, they have to be thankful that Johnson might be able to play next week.    As for Palmer, his final numbers were 27-of-48 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He could've been picked on a couple more occasions, so this was an ugly start to his 2017 campaign, especially considering the sort of defense he was playing. The Lions are projected to have 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL, so if Palmer struggled against them, what's going to happen against tougher defenses?    Larry Fitzgerald saw 13 targets, but could reel in only 6 of them for 74 yards. Nelson (5-43) scored a garbage-time touchdown. John Brown trailed only Fitzgerald in targets (9), but could only convert 4 of them for 32 yards.    Adding injury to insult and injury for the Cardinals, they lost tackle D.J. Humphries, who was carted into the locker room in the early going. This was a huge loss, as Arizona struggled to block without him. His replacement, John Wetzel, looked like he didn't belong in the NFL.    While the Cardinals can't feel optimistic about their offense, Haason Reddick at least looked great. He made numerous great plays, and he always seemed to be in the correct place at the right time. Fellow rookie linebacker Jarrad Davis did well overall for Detroit, but was guilty of a couple of dumb penalties.    Stafford deserves a ton of credit for keeping the Lions in the game. He rebounded from the early pick-six and some drops to finish the afternoon on a torrid pace. His final numbers were 29-of-41 for 292 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but in the second half, he was 12-of-16 for 180 yards and 3 scores. It's nice that he was able to pick up where he left off last year prior to injuring his finger.

   "comment":"Golden Tate clearly crossed the goal line, but Walt Coleman, the most incompetent official in the NFL, summoned a replay review. The call was close, but the replay showed that Tate was barely short of the goal line when he was touched down. Coleman, who has a long history of not overturning calls when they should be, actually changed the ruling for once. Making matters worse for Detroit, he announced that because the Lions had no timeouts, they would be charged with a 10-second run-off, ending the game. It was the correct call, which in itself is remarkable because Coleman usually gets things wrong. It figures that the Lions, who have never had any great fortune throughout franchise history, would suffer as the result of this. The crowd went from chanting MVP for Stafford to showering the officials with a chorus of boos. The Lions were 3-0 for a minute, but dropped to 2-1 as a result of a horrendous rule. To not give the Lions a chance because the officials stopped the game is just awful. It's unclear if they could've gotten a snap off with 8 seconds remaining, but because everyone was close by, it may have been possible. In fact, the Lions' Twitter feed posted a video of the offense previously getting a snap off in 7 seconds, so it was definitely possible.    As for the victors, it was no Ryan Schraeder, no problem. The Falcons were missing their talented right tackle, but that didn't matter at all against the Lions. Atlanta's offense did whatever it wanted to in this contest, quickly jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the middle of the second quarter. Seemingly getting double-digit yards on every single play, Detroit had no answer for the Falcons without rookie middle linebacker Tate clearly crossed the goal line, but Walt Coleman, the most incompetent official in the NFL, summoned a replay review.

   "comment":"Golden Tate on a simple wide receiver screen, and Tate went virtually untouched down the field for the score. Kizer came back into the game late in the 4.h quarter, but he was out for some possessions, and Kessler was incompetent. In garbage time, Kizer led a drive close to Detroit's end zone before throwing an interception to Tate on the run for a 35-yard gain. A 10-yard run by Stafford set up Abdullah to finish the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run that tied the game at 10. Then, the Browns started to play like the Browns; Nevin Lawson stripped tight end Seth DeValve of the ball and scooped it up. Lawson was untouched by DeValve and was able to bolt down the sideline for a 44-yard touchdown. In the final minutes of the half, Kizer made some nice throws to move ball into Detroit territory. He took off on an 18-yard run to get the ball to the 2.5-yard line with 19 seconds remaining. On second-and-goal with 15 seconds, Cleveland ran a quarterback sneak from over 2 yards out, and it was stuffed by Detroit. Before the Browns could get set up to spike the ball, the clock ran out, and they went into the half missing out on the points opportunity. It was a horrible play call, but hilarious and typical of the Browns. Cleveland opened the third quarter by moving down the field with Isaiah Crowell, who tied the game up from a few yards out. The Browns got the ball back and moved it again with Kizer, who took off on a 20-yard run to defeat a poorly designed blitz to convert a third down. Kizer then hit DeValve (4-70) for 35 yards to the 1.yard line. Kizer then used the sneak that didn't work in the first half to get a touchdown. Cleveland's offensive line, especially the interior, was rolling Detroit at the point of attack in the third quarter. Detroit responded with Stafford hitting Kenny Golladay (2-64) for 50 yards as he beat Jamar Taylor. A couple plays later, Stafford hit Theo Reddick (3-12-1) for a short touchdown pass to tie the score at 24. Browns rookie David Njoku made a terrible play to not move his head to look to the outside. He missed a blitz on a max-protect play, and that allowed a bone-rattling hit from Quandre Diggs on Kizer. That knocked Kizer out of the game and into the locker room. The Lions took the lead with a drive that culminated with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Eric Ebron (2-39-1) as he beat Derrick Kindred down the sideline. Cody Kessler had Bryce Treggs running wide open down the sideline after he burned D.J. Hayden for what would have been about a 75-yard touchdown, but Kessler threw a terrible pass too long for Treggs. Detroit put the game away with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate on a simple wide receiver screen, and Tate went virtually untouched down the field for the score. Kizer came back into the game late in the 4.h quarter, but he was out for some possessions, and Kessler was incompetent.
