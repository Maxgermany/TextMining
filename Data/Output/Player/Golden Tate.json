Of course, Wilson was most impressive at the very end, scoring consecutive touchdowns in the final 7-and-a-half minutes to comeback from 23-10. It almost didn't happen though; the Seahawks had a 4.h-and-short in their own territory with slightly more than 3 minutes remaining. Carroll opted to punt, which I completely disagreed with at the time. I didn't think Seattle was going to get the ball back even though it was armed with 3 timeouts, but the defense did a great job of forcing the Patriots to give back possession.    Brady, meanwhile, went 36-of-58 for 395 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions. Those are awesome fantasy numbers, but Brady made a number of mistakes. One of the picks wasn't fault because "

   "comment":"Golden Tate to set up a 51-yard field goal from new kicker Alex Henery. The Lions took the lead, as Stafford laid out a beautiful 59-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Ross (2-65), who burned Antonio Allen and Calvin Pryor to get wide open. Just before halftime, Stafford rifled the ball down the field before hitting Eric Ebron for a 16-yard score. New York had terrible play-calling in the first half, as Ivory had only 5 carries after the first drive, while the offense produced steady 3.and-outs trying to pass the ball with Smith. The Jets moved the ball in the third quarter with a nice pass to Greg Salas. On a third-and-7, on the Detroit 11-yard line, Smith hit Eric Decker (4-48), and the big wideout dived into the end zone. Detroit came right back with a 90-yard drive as passes to Ryan Broyles, and Tate moved the ball to the goal line. Stafford ran the ball in on a rollout. Smith responded by setting up the Lions for more points as he sailed a pass over the middle for an easy interception to Darius Slay, who returned his first career interception 41 yards. The Lions then missed the field goal. Smith followed that up with a fumble on a sack by James Ihedigbo. Chris Johnson (6-44) had a fluky 35-yard touchdown run after a few missed tackles, and some Lion defenders watched the play rather than running to the ball. Detroit, however, salted the win away with Reggie Bush (12-46) to take sole possession of first place in the NFC North.    Stafford completed 24-of-34 passes for 293 yards with 2 passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. Golden Tate was Detroit's featured receiver, as he had 116 yards on 8 receptions.    Smith completed 17-of-33 passes for 209 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Decker and Ivory (17-84 rushing, 2-16 receiving) each had a few dropped passes that could have gone for nice gains. The Jets' offensive line had its hands full, as "

   "comment":"Golden Tate touchdown. Bridgewater then fired a pass behind his target, which Darius Slay picked off. The Lions were able to add 3 points, suddenly putting themselves within striking distance. The mistakes continued in the second half. The Vikings were in field-goal range, but Bridgewater took a terrible sack because he held on to the ball too long. That helped force a Blair Walsh kick, which was blocked. Bridgewater had a chance to lead his team back in the 4.h quarter once Detroit established the lead, but fired a pass way over an open Jarius Wright's head, ultimately forcing Walsh to try another attempt from 68 yards out. The attempt, which would've been an NFL record, went wide left, securing the victory for the Lions.    It's a shame that Bridgewater made those errors because he was great otherwise. He misfired on just 10 attempts, going 31-of-41 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. He also moved around well, scrambling thrice for 30 rushing yards. Even with the turnovers, this performance has to be encouraging because Bridgewater was battling such a tough defense.    Bridgewater's primary wide receiver once again was Charles Johnson. The athletic wideout continued to shine, as he caught 5 passes for 72 yards. He was 1 of 3 players to draw 7 targets. The others were Kyle Rudolph (7-69) and Matt Asiata (7-50). Greg Jennings (3-43) hauled in Bridgewater's sole touchdown. He mad a great adjustment on 1 of Bridgewater's throws, but it appeared as though he had 1 foot out of bounds. Jim Caldwell challenged, but he strangely did not win the review.    Though Asiata had a nice performance as a pass-catcher, he did very little as a runner, as he struggled to find room against Detroit's ferocious front line. He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds. That ended up costing Minnesota precious seconds.    As for the Lions, they were really fortunate to get those turnovers from Bridgewater because they did nothing offensively all afternoon. They converted just 2-of-11 third downs, as Matthew Stafford faced a ridiculous amount of pressure from Minnesota's ferocious pass rush. He struggled with his accuracy as a result, failing to find Calvin Johnson for most of this contest. Stafford went 17-of-28 for just 153 yards and a touchdown. About 2.thirds of that yardage came in the second half, as Stafford did enough on 1 drive to set up the team with a game-winning field goal.    Another reason why Stafford couldn't connect with Megatron was because Xavier Rhodes did a great job of covering him. Most conrerbacks struggle against the best receiver in football, but the 6-foot-1 Rhodes is tall enough - and talented enough - to deal with him. Johnson still led the team in receiving, but had just 4 catches for 53 yards. A big chunk of that came on a short crossing pattern on the game-winning drive.    Stafford's sole score was thrown to Golden Tate, who caught all 7 of his targets, but for only 38 yards.    "

   "comment":"Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.    Zach Zenner led the Lions on the ground with 10 carries for 30 yards. Ameer Abdullah had 17 yards on 6 carries with 2 fumbles (1 lost).    The lone real positive for Detroit was Calvin Johnson broke Herman Moore's record for career receptions in Lion history. Johnson had 5 catches for 67 yards. Golden Tate (8-74) led Detroit through the air.   "

   "comment":"Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.    Zach Zenner led the Lions on the ground with 10 carries for 30 yards. Ameer Abdullah had 17 yards on 6 carries with 2 fumbles (1 lost).    The lone real positive for Detroit was Calvin Johnson broke Herman Moore's record for career receptions in Lion history. Johnson had 5 catches for 67 yards. Golden Tate (8-74) led Detroit through the air.   "

   "comment":"Golden Tate seemed to catch the ball in the end zone, but it popped out of his hands, landing into the arms of a Chicago defender for an interception. It was reviewed, and the horribly inept Walt Coleman said that it was reversed to a touchdown and offered no explanation. The play was different than what we've seen in the past because Tate was never in the air and didn't go to the ground, meaning he didn't have to complete the process of the catch, whatever that means. That was at least the explanation the head of officiating gave, and it was the right 1 based on the rule. But the play? I don't know if Tate ever had possession of the ball, since it was bobbling in his arms the entire time. And given that it was so close, how could Coleman change the ruling on the field? Coleman also had some shaky instances late in the game. There was a mysterious roughing-the-passer call that set up a touchdown to "

   "comment":"Golden Tate and Lance Moore to move inside the 10-yard line. A holding call on Laken Tomlinson and a dropped touchdown by Eric Ebron led to a Detroit field goal. After a Raiders punt, Stafford kept moving the ball using Calvin Johnson and Joique Bell as the Oakland defense was on its heels. Riley Reiff was beaten for a sack by Vincent Mayowa, so the Lions settled for another field goal. Late in the second quarter, Stafford connected with Johnson for a 36-yard reception to give Detroit a 9-0 at halftime. The Lions' defense played a tremendous first half, shutting out the Raiders while holding Carr to only 57 yards and keeping Cooper without a catch. To open the third quarter, Carr connected with Seth Roberts down the deep middle for a 43-yard gain. The officials blew a penalty that canceled out a Quandre Diggs interception, and Carr used his legs to run ball inside the 5-yard line. To finish the drive, Latavius Murray plunged into the end zone. Carr quickly led 2 field goal drives to take a 13-9 lead with 1 of the 3.pointers being a 56-yarder from Sebastian Janikowski. Detroit's offense finally started moving again thanks to a shovel pass to Theo Riddick and a pass to Johnson to the Raiders' 30-yard line. Stafford took off on a run of about 15 to Oakland's 5-yard line. On the next play, he ran into the end zone on a quarterback draw to give the Lions a 16-9 lead. Midway through the 4.h quarter, Ziggy Ansah beat Donald Penn for a sack and then drew a holding from Penn in the end zone to give Detroit a safety. At 18-13, Riddick stepped up with some big receptions to take the ball into Oakland territory so the Lions were able to run out the clock.    Stafford was 22-of-35 for 282 yards. He also ran the ball 6 times for 31 yards and a touchdown.    Calvin Johnson caught 5 passes for 88 yards, and Golden Tate had 8 receptions for 73 yards. "

   "comment":"Golden Tate legally, allowing Justin Bethel to snatch an easy interception. The Lions then botched a punt attempt, where the punter ran the ball to Arizona's 13-yard line, getting hurt in the process. The Cardinals couldn't convert on 2 series, as they were given a second because of a Detroit leaping penalty. Palmer tried to help the Lions after that with a near-interception, but Haloti Ngata dropped the ball. Not to be outdone, Palmer launched a pick because he couldn't step into his throw. The Lions tried to screw themselves from taking advantage of it with a hold, but they managed to score a touchdown. Of course, they messed up the extra point. To conclude the opening half, Palmer was nearly intercepted again, but the ball hit the ground. Phil Dawson made sure Arizona would hurt itself by hitting the left upright on a 32-yard field goal. The Lions had a cleaner second half despite some Kenny Golladay drops. The Cardinals, on the other hand, continued to kill themselves. J.J. Nelson dropped a deep touchdown, then a score to Jermaine Gresham was wiped out by a hold. David Johsnon then lost a fumble and got hurt in the process. And if that wasn't enough, Palmer was pick-sixed to end Arizona's chances.    This was an ugly loss for the Cardinals, but the silver lining is that the X-rays on David Johnson's wrist came back negative. Johnson struggled as a runner, gaining 23 yards on 11 carries, though he did catch 6 passes for 68 receiving yards. His fantasy owners missed out on a touchdown because Kerwynn Williams (5-10) vultured 1 after Johnson left the game. However, they have to be thankful that Johnson might be able to play next week.    As for Palmer, his final numbers were 27-of-48 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He could've been picked on a couple more occasions, so this was an ugly start to his 2017 campaign, especially considering the sort of defense he was playing. The Lions are projected to have 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL, so if Palmer struggled against them, what's going to happen against tougher defenses?    Larry Fitzgerald saw 13 targets, but could reel in only 6 of them for 74 yards. Nelson (5-43) scored a garbage-time touchdown. John Brown trailed only Fitzgerald in targets (9), but could only convert 4 of them for 32 yards.    Adding injury to insult and injury for the Cardinals, they lost tackle D.J. Humphries, who was carted into the locker room in the early going. This was a huge loss, as Arizona struggled to block without him. His replacement, John Wetzel, looked like he didn't belong in the NFL.    While the Cardinals can't feel optimistic about their offense, Haason Reddick at least looked great. He made numerous great plays, and he always seemed to be in the correct place at the right time. Fellow rookie linebacker Jarrad Davis did well overall for Detroit, but was guilty of a couple of dumb penalties.    Stafford deserves a ton of credit for keeping the Lions in the game. He rebounded from the early pick-six and some drops to finish the afternoon on a torrid pace. His final numbers were 29-of-41 for 292 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but in the second half, he was 12-of-16 for 180 yards and 3 scores. It's nice that he was able to pick up where he left off last year prior to injuring his finger.    Reports said before the game that Patrick Peterson would cover Golden Tate, but Tate was still able to catch 10 passes for 107 yards. "

   "comment":"Golden Tate clearly crossed the goal line, but Walt Coleman, the most incompetent official in the NFL, summoned a replay review. The call was close, but the replay showed that Tate was barely short of the goal line when he was touched down. Coleman, who has a long history of not overturning calls when they should be, actually changed the ruling for once. Making matters worse for Detroit, he announced that because the Lions had no timeouts, they would be charged with a 10-second run-off, ending the game. It was the correct call, which in itself is remarkable because Coleman usually gets things wrong. It figures that the Lions, who have never had any great fortune throughout franchise history, would suffer as the result of this. The crowd went from chanting MVP for Stafford to showering the officials with a chorus of boos. The Lions were 3-0 for a minute, but dropped to 2-1 as a result of a horrendous rule. To not give the Lions a chance because the officials stopped the game is just awful. It's unclear if they could've gotten a snap off with 8 seconds remaining, but because everyone was close by, it may have been possible. In fact, the Lions' Twitter feed posted a video of the offense previously getting a snap off in 7 seconds, so it was definitely possible.    As for the victors, it was no Ryan Schraeder, no problem. The Falcons were missing their talented right tackle, but that didn't matter at all against the Lions. Atlanta's offense did whatever it wanted to in this contest, quickly jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the middle of the second quarter. Seemingly getting double-digit yards on every single play, Detroit had no answer for the Falcons without rookie middle linebacker "

Again, a field goal there would've set up a short kick to win the game at the very end. Tate had a strong performance otherwise, catching 7 of his 8 targets for 86 yards. This was impressive, considering he wasn't even supposed to play. Tate trailed "
