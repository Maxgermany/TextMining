   "comment":"Josh Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position. Virgil Green burned Manti Te'o for 22 yards to get inside the 30 yards, but Osweiler threw a ball up for grabs in the end zone that Jason Verrett intercepted for San Diego. Both defenses shut the door, so there was no scoring in the second half.    Philip Rivers completed 18-of-35 passes for 202 yards and an interception. He was under heavy pressure from start to finish.    Melvin Gordon ran for 55 yards on 12 carries, but once again had ball-security issues. Adrian Peterson is the only back who has fumbled the ball more than Gordon than this season.    Antonio Gates led the Chargers' receivers with 6 catches for 50 yards. Both Stevie Johnson and Dontrelle Inman sustained injuries.    Brock Osweiler was 16-of-26 for 166 yards with a touchdown and 1 interception. He did a decent job of managing the game, but missed some opportunities to go vertical on San Diego.    Ronnie Hillman led the Broncos on the ground with 56 yards on 19 carries. C.J. Anderson got hurt, but was kept out for precautionary reasons.    Demaryius Thomas had 61 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions.    Denver's defense was tremendous. Von Miller had 2 sacks and a forced fumble. Shane Ray and Shaq Barrett also added sacks. Chris Harris, Vance Walker and Josh Bush also forced fumbles for Denver. The Chargers' defense played well and received good games from Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position.
