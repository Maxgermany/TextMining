Unfortunately for the 49ers, Foster suffered a leg injury in the first half and had to be carted into the locker room. He didn't return to action. With Ward out, the Panthers had some success moving the chains; this was a scoreless affair prior to the injury. "

   "comment":"Foster returned to the field for the first time since Week 1, but he didn't last long, as a rib injury sent him into the locker room just past the midway point in the game. Some sources from other teams had major durability concerns with Foster and thought me might hit his way out of the NFL before long. Another injury lends more credence to the durability concerns.   "
