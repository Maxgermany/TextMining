   "comment":"Cairo Santos with a 37-yard field goal, and the attempt converted. It's really unbelievable how Newton and the rest of the offense unraveled. Newton was on fire in the opening half, going 11-of-19 for 157 passing yards, 43 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns by intermission. Newton looked like his old self, and he even dabbed after scoring. This appeared to be the 2015 Panthers, but the 2016 version reared its ugly head in the second half. Newton never felt comfortable, as his offensive line failed him. He was actually sacked on consecutive plays on 1 drive, as a possession in the red zone turned into a punt. With Michael Oher and Ryan Kalil out, Newton simply didn't have the protection to be successful all game.    Newton ended up finishing 23-of-38 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. He also scrambled 12 times for 54 yards and a touchdown, with his longest run being a 28-yarder off a great play-action fake to open the game. However, once again, Newton ended poorly, and his second-half numbers were pretty ugly, as he went just 12-of-19 for 104 yards and an interception following the break.    Newton should've had better numbers, but "

   "comment":"Cairo Santos a chance.    Kelce put together 1 of the best games of his career. He caught 11 of his 12 targets for a whopping 160 yards and a touchdown. In addition of sprinting 80 yards into the end zone, he also had so many key conversions on third down. The Chiefs were 9-of-17 on third downs, compared to Denver's 4-of-15 figure. I know the Broncos have had their issues against tight ends this year, but you'd think Wade Phillips would've devised a scheme to restrict Kelce. Denver will have to find an inside linebacker upgrade this offseason. I have the team doing this in my .    Kansas City's 2 receivers were disappointments in regard to their actual catching stats. "
