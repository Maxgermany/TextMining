Things looked ugly when he tossed a pick-six in the first quarter, but he rebounded from that and finished 15-of-22 for 187 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The second pick wasn't his fault - it was bobbled by his own receiver - but the third interception was an ugly, unnecessary heave in the second half as he was falling back into the pocket. Jackson's inconsistency is nothing new; he has always been pretty erratic. Favre still gives Minnesota its best chance to win, so he should start if he's healthy.    "

John Harbaugh and the players even talked about it leading up to this week, yet they still were flat for a 2.win team.    Everyone had a hand in this defeat, save for Ray Rice: - Joe Flacco (29-of-52, 255 yards, TD, INT) missed open receivers and nearly had a second interception when 2 Seattle defenders crashed into each other in the end zone. - What happened to the defense? Twenty-two points is not a lot to give up, but the Ray Lewis and company simply couldn't disrupt Seattle possessions, particularly at the end, when the Seahawks were able to run out the clock despite getting the ball with 5:52 remaining in regulation. - Special teams were a nightmare. Kick returner David Reed lost 2 fumbles, giving Seattle 6 free points. Those 6 points were the difference.    As for Rice, he was able to carry the ball only 5 times because the Seahawks got out to a quick lead. Rice was able to throw a touchdown pass to Ed Dickson on a trick play, however.    Dickson had a monstrous performance at Seattle. He caught 10 balls for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns. Add him to your fantasy team if you need help at tight end.    As for the Seahawks, Tarvaris Jackson was very solid, going 17-of-27 for 217 yards. This was impressive considering that the Seahawks lost both "

The Rams had just 185 total yards of offense.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a score. He and Bradford have only had about 7 practices together, so that chemistry will continue to improve. But that won't matter as long as Bradford is poorly protected in the pocket; he was sacked 5 times in this contest, thanks to the plethora of injuries to the tackle position. Chris Clemons had 3 of those sacks with 2 forced fumbles.    This was a pretty mixed performance for Tarvaris Jackson. He maneuvered pretty well around the pocket and was able to avoid St. Louis' pass rushers effectively at times. At other times, however, he was really reckless and took big losses on sacks. Jackson finished 14-of-24 for 148 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Ironically, top receiver "
