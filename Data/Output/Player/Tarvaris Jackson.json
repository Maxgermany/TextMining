Things looked ugly when he tossed a pick-six in the first quarter, but he rebounded from that and finished 15-of-22 for 187 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The second pick wasn't his fault - it was bobbled by his own receiver - but the third interception was an ugly, unnecessary heave in the second half as he was falling back into the pocket. Jackson's inconsistency is nothing new; he has always been pretty erratic. Favre still gives Minnesota its best chance to win, so he should start if he's healthy.    "

And what was up with telling everyone he was going to start Jackson, then giving Whitehurst the nod, and then replacing him with Jackson? Jackson (21-of-40, 323 yards, INT) was better than Whitehurst (4-of-7, 52 yards), but only by default. The former was knocked out late with a minor injury.    Jackson and Whitehurst didn't have much of a ground attack to work with. The Bengals completely shut down "

   "comment":"Tarvaris Jackson was very solid, going 17-of-27 for 217 yards. This was impressive considering that the Seahawks lost both Jacksonville and now Seattle have all defeated Baltimore. Arizona nearly did as well. John Harbaugh and the players even talked about it leading up to this week, yet they still were flat for a 2.win team.    Everyone had a hand in this defeat, save for Ray Rice: - Joe Flacco (29-of-52, 255 yards, TD, INT) missed open receivers and nearly had a second interception when 2 Seattle defenders crashed into each other in the end zone. - What happened to the defense? Twenty-two points is not a lot to give up, but the Ray Lewis and company simply couldn't disrupt Seattle possessions, particularly at the end, when the Seahawks were able to run out the clock despite getting the ball with 5:52 remaining in regulation. - Special teams were a nightmare. Kick returner David Reed lost 2 fumbles, giving Seattle 6 free points. Those 6 points were the difference.    As for Rice, he was able to carry the ball only 5 times because the Seahawks got out to a quick lead. Rice was able to throw a touchdown pass to Ed Dickson on a trick play, however.    Dickson had a monstrous performance at Seattle. He caught 10 balls for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns. Add him to your fantasy team if you need help at tight end.    As for the Seahawks, Tarvaris Jackson was very solid, going 17-of-27 for 217 yards. This was impressive considering that the Seahawks lost both "

   "comment":"Tarvaris Jackson. He maneuvered pretty well around the pocket and was able to avoid St. Louis' pass rushers effectively at times. At other times, however, he was really reckless and took big losses on sacks. Jackson finished 14-of-24 for 148 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Ironically, top receiver Jackson rushed for only 42 yards on 15 carries against Seattle's top-five rush defense - Bradford just had major difficulty moving the chains the entire afternoon. The Rams had just 185 total yards of offense.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 balls for 67 yards and a score. He and Bradford have only had about 7 practices together, so that chemistry will continue to improve. But that won't matter as long as Bradford is poorly protected in the pocket; he was sacked 5 times in this contest, thanks to the plethora of injuries to the tackle position. Chris Clemons had 3 of those sacks with 2 forced fumbles.    This was a pretty mixed performance for Tarvaris Jackson. He maneuvered pretty well around the pocket and was able to avoid St. Louis' pass rushers effectively at times. At other times, however, he was really reckless and took big losses on sacks.

   "comment":"Tarvaris Jackson hit Ricardo Lockette for a pickup of 44 yards. Jackson would find 3 different receivers on the march, capping it with a score to rookie Doug Baldwin for an early 7-0 lead. Unfortunately, Jackson (15-of-28, 163 yards, TD) would throw for just 89 yards the rest of the afternoon, completing fewer than half his throws. San Francisco answered as it had most of the season, with a steady, methodical drive. Just 2 plays went for more than 4 yards, a 7-yard scramble to open the drive by Alex Smith and a 12-yard pass to Michael Crabtree, but the 49ers worked to field goal range. One of their many MVPs this season, kicker David Akers, couldn't make good from 52 yards out though. Ray McDonald set the Seahawks back with a sack to open the next drive, but Marshawn Lynch (21-107, TD) was in Beast Mode. He ran for 23 yards on the next 2 plays to put Seattle in plus territory and move the chains. Two incompletions by Jackson ended the threat, but Jon Ryan's punt pinned San Francisco at its own 9-yard line. On the drive, Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter took turns picking up first downs rushing to get the ball to midfield. The combination of Gore (23-83 yards, TD) and Hunter (12-73) worked to the tune of rushing for 10 first downs on the afternoon against a stiff run defense. A 13-yard pass to Gore put the 49ers in scoring position and even a sack from Leroy Hill on third down couldn't push them out of it because David Akers hit from 53 yards out to make it 7-3 as the second quarter started. The Seahawks had another steady drive with good gains, but going backward with an offensive pass interference penalty on Ben Obomanu and sack by Navarro Bowman wrecked the drive before the team made it past midfield. Again, Seattle's punter put the opponent in a tough spot, pinning San Francisco at its own 5-yard line. This time, the 49ers' possession resulted in a quick punt, and the Seahawks started in plus territory thanks to C.J. Spillman popping Leon Washington, who had called for a fair catch. Seattle wasn't able to take full advantage of the field position due to the unreal run defense of San Francisco. Set up with second-and-goal from the 3. Lynch went up the middle for 2 yards. The Seahawks had a bit of a busted play on third down and as Jackson rolled to his left, it looked like they would luck into a touchdown. Cornerback Carlos Rogers had other ideas, knocking Jackson into 2012 and forcing a field goal attempt to put Seattle up 10-3. San Francisco tried to answer in the 2-minute drill thanks to a 24-yard run from Hunter putting them close to midfield, but 2 incompletions and a pass short of the sticks forced 4.h down. Harbaugh rolled the dice, but Smith threw another incompletion to turn the ball over on downs. Jackson wasn't able to make him pay in the final 21 seconds of the half though, throwing incomplete 3 times sandwiched around a 12-yard pickup to backup running back Justin Forsett. Speaking of Forsett, did anyone else notice how many players on Seattle's offense have a Bay Area connection? Lynch and Forsett both were running backs for UC-Berkeley where backup tight end Cameron Moorah and reserve lineman Mike Gibson also went. Fullback Michael Robinson played for the 49ers, while starting left tackle Pat McQuistan, left guard Robert Gallery and tight end Zach Miller were drafted by the Raiders. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Doug Baldwin went to Stanford. Kind of ridiculous isn't it? In the third quarter, it looked like San Francisco was going to ice this game. The first possession went 74 yards on 8 plays, highlighted by a 27-yard pass to Michael Crabtree (5-85) on the first play of the half and a 17-yard pickup to Vernon Davis (4-54). Gore cashed in the touchdown from 4 yards out to tie the game at 10. The defense forced a quick punt and Kyle Williams had a big punt return for 36 yards to change field position and set the 49ers up in Seahawks' territory. Gore and Hunter runs did most of the work on the drive while Smith missed on his only pass attempt and scrambled for an 11-yard gain. An illegal block by Braylon Edwards on third-and-goal took away any shot at a touchdown. Harbaugh protected Smith by running the ball and called another field goal for the 13-10 lead. Akers has been like his ATM this season and would set a single-season NFL record with 42 field goals in this game. The next 2 drives were like watching instant replay. San Francisco's defense held, and when the 49ers got the ball back, they pounded the running game to set up a field goal when Smith threw incomplete on third down. Akers connected from 44 yards out to make it 16-10 just a couple minutes into the 4.h quarter. As the saying goes, the Seahawks were hanging around down by just 1 score. First, San Francisco cornerback Tarrell Brown was flagged for a very questionable pass interference penalty to put the ball near midfield. Two plays later, rookie phenomenon Aldon Smith registered a sack to force a 3rd-and-15. Jackson almost bailed Seattle out, hitting Obomanu a yard short of the marker. Carroll resisted the urge to go for it against a stout defense and wisely chose to play field position. It looked like a bad decision when the punt went out of the end zone and Smith hit Davis for 17 yards on the first play of the drive. Just like that, all the Seahawks had gained from the kick was 8 yards of field position. However, the defense stood tall from there, forcing a punt that was blocked by Heath Farwell. Seattle took over at the 49ers' 4-yard line and Lynch delivered the first rushing touchdown of the season against San Francisco to put the Seahawks up 17-16. Suddenly trailing, the 49ers caught a break when Robinson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after hitting defenseless kickoff returner Kyle Williams. Set up at their own 39-yard line, everything was looking good for San Francisco, and then Edwards was flagged for pass interference to start the drive. However, 2 plays later, Smith (14-of-26, 179 yards) connected on a deep ball good for 41 yards to Michael Crabtree. It was a huge play for Smith, who did what he has all season - protect the football and not screw it up. A ready and able Seattle defense held tough on 3 consecutive rushing plays, including a straight run on 3rd-and-6 that didn't exactly ooze confidence in Smith's arm. Yet another field goal from Akers put the 49ers ahead, 19-17. It looked like the Seahawks would respond. Lynch alternated rushing and receiving on the next 4 plays for a total of 33 yards, putting them just past midfield with 1:07 to play. Then Tarvaris Jackson did what bad quarterbacks do in tough spots. On 3rd-and-3, he was trying to scramble for a first down and had the ball knocked out from behind by linebacker Jackson again next year. He's a bum. Seriously, way to fumble the ball away near field-goal range near the end of the game, loser.)    This matchup might be defined by being the What's your deal? Bowl, a reference to the head coaches when they met at midfield following Jim Harbaugh's Stanford team dismantling Pete Carroll's USC team. It is becoming a grudge match. The Seahawks won the division last year, Carroll's first as head coach, and the 49ers have taken it this year, Harbaugh's first. Momentum was on Seattle's side early and its raucous home crowd was in playoff mode on the opening drive. Two plays in, Tarvaris Jackson hit Ricardo Lockette for a pickup of 44 yards."

   "comment":"Tarvaris Jackson failed despite getting good field position after a 47-yard kickoff return by Leon Washington.Jackson failed despite getting good field position after a 47-yard kickoff return by Leon Washington. Jackson (21-of-35, 222 yards, TD, INT) attempted 2 passes, but they were well off the mark, so the Seahawks went 3.and-out. Seattle's not going anywhere with Jackson under center, so it'll have to find another solution at the position this offseason.    "
