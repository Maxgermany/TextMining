   "comment":"Robert Golden to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 44-yard gain to help seal the victory.Golden to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 44-yard gain to help seal the victory.    Roethlisberger and the passing game didn't do much in the second half, instead relying on Bell, who once again showed he is the best back in the NFL, as he totaled 192 yards on 39 touches. He now has an amazing 73 touches in his last 2 games for 383 yards and a touchdown. If you have Bell in fantasy, you really should get James Conner on your team somehow. I don't know how Bell will be able to hold up under this workload.    The Bengals didn't put up any fantasy numbers this week, but it was good to see Joe Mixon get off to a good start. Unfortunately, he ended up with just 7 carries for 48 yards and caught all 3 of his targets for 20 yards. Dalton was sacked 4 times, and then in the second half, the Bengals got behind, so there were few times at which the Bengals could commit to the run.    The Steelers looked the best they have all season, as they rolled up 420 total yards and held their division rival to just 179 total yards on the exact same number of drives. They take their AFC-best 5-2 record to Detroit next week to take on the rested Lions, but the Lions could be without their best wide receiver, Golden Tate.    The Bengals take their 2-4 record back home to face the 2-5 Indianapolis Colts, who were just shut out 27-0 by the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars.   "
