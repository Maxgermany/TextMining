   "comment":"Curtis Brinkley and Mike Tolbert to put the team in plus territory.Brinkley and Mike Tolbert to put the team in plus territory. From there, Rivers hit Antonio Gates for a 38-yard touchdown, tying the game at 7. As the first quarter ended, a rare failed drive followed. Palmer threw short to Kevin Boss and Oakland punted into the end zone. The Chargers quickly got into the Raiders' territory with a 37-yard pass to Gates, and Tolbert finished the drive with a 1-yard plunge, putting the visitors up 14-7. They would never relinquish the lead. Oakland got another big play from Heyward-Bey (9-130, TD) who finished just short of 1,000 yards on the season at 975. After a 19-yard reception from Murphy, the drive looked promising, but stalled. After a long field goal by Sebastian Janikowski (52 yards) made it 14-10, there was reason for optimism as Kansas City led Denver 7-0 a couple hours to the east. However, Richard Goodman returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to provide San Diego with a 21-10 cushion. The Raiders, of course, turned to Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. Palmer found him down the middle for 22 yards, and after some short gains, another Janikowski field goal trimmed the lead to 21-13. The Chargers' offense never let off the pedal (463 total yards) in this 1 though. In 5 plays, they were at the Oakland 33-yard line. The defense held, forcing 3 straight San Diego incompletions, but Nova's long field goal put the Chargers ahead 24-13. Typically, the Raiders would answer in a 2.minute drill, having done so all year. This looked like no exception when Heyward-Bey caught a pass for a gain of 23 followed by a 9-yard pass to Bush, but with 11 seconds left and no timeouts to stop the clock, Palmer inexplicably completed a short pass to Murphy for a gain of 6. Instead of a long, but certainly makeable 55-yard field goal attempt, Oakland entered the locker room for halftime to a chorus of boos from the home fans. The offenses kept piling up stats in the second half, but field goals never beat touchdowns. Palmer dropped a bomb to Denarius Moore who went 78 yards but needed to go a few more. A short Bush run and 2 completions put Janikowski back on the field to slice the San Diego lead to 24-16. The response was a touchdown drive. The Chargers' big receivers used their height advantage all afternoon to school the small defensive backs trying to cover them. After a nice kickoff return set them up at the 34-yard line, Rivers completed all 5 passes he attempted for 51 yards including the 13-yard score to Vincent Jackson (2-29, TD), who played sidekick to Floyd (7-127, TD) and Gates (5-106 yards, TD) most of the game. Midway through the third quarter, it was looking bleak in the Black Hole. The Raiders got another big play, a 28-yard pass to Murphy, but again failed to finish with a touchdown. Janikowski's 4.h field goal closed them to within 31-19 as the third quarter wound down. Again, Oakland's defense couldn't really hold, but caught a break when Norv Turner started running the clock with Brinkley, who was given 4 consecutive carries. Rivers' first pass of the drive came on third-and-two and fell incomplete. Then, "
