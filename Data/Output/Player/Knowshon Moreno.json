   "comment":"Knowshon Moreno runs. They also were guilty of 7 penalties (compared to 4 for the Colts), most of which were really untimely. As an example, the Broncos had a 3rd-and-1 on Indianapolis' 15. A false start made it 3rd-and-6, and on that play, Kyle Orton tossed a pick.    Speaking of picks, Peyton Manning launched 3. 2 of which went to Brian Dawkins off deflections. However, the Broncos turned those all 3 of those interceptions into just 3 points. As I said, blown opportunities. Manning's stat line was otherwise very strange. He was just 20-of-42 for 220 yards, but tossed 4 touchdowns. Manning's troubles against good 3-4 defenses are well-documented, and will likely be prevalent in the postseason.    Dallas Clark caught 3 of Manning's touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 43 yards. Austin Collie (3-39) caught the other. Reggie Wayne and Pierre Garcon had just 43 and 39 yards, respectively.    Joseph Addai had a solid game, rushing for 67 yards on 16 carries, and catching 5 passes for 49 more yards. Addai left the contest with a minor ankle injury, but returned to the lineup later on.    As for the Broncos, Orton finished 29-of-41 for 277 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Amazingly, 21 of his 29 completions went to Marshall.    Knowshon Moreno couldn't do much against Indianapolis' defense. He carried the ball 23 times but for just 63 yards. He also caught 3 balls for 13 more yards. "

   "comment":"Knowshon Moreno have the best rushing performance on the Broncos. Listed as the No. 1 on this Web site, Moreno gained 93 yards and 2 scores on just 13 carries. He should be given more carries going forward, as it's quite apparent that Ball is a typical Big Ten plodder who is inept on third down. Ball mustered only 16 yards on 12 attempts to go along with the aforementioned lost fumble.    Eli lost this contest - giving him an 0-3 record versus Peyton - but if it's any consolation to him, he out-threw his older brother. He generated 362 yards and a touchdown on 28-of-49 passing, but was responsible for 4 interceptions. The first occurred just prior to halftime. He made a poor decision and heaved it toward the end zone despite being in field goal range. One of his other picks was fluky, as it bounced off a player's foot. I was hoping the Broncos would return it for a score so I could call it a kick-six. The other 2 interceptions were heaved deep into double coverage. Eli had a poor showing overall in what could be his final battle against his brother, but if Peyton ever brings this up in the future, Eli can just shove his 2 Super Bowl rings in Peyton's face.    Eli's sole aerial score came late in garbage time to "

Moreno was awesome though. He simply wouldn't go down on some plays. Having him healthy is a huge boost for this offense.    Tannehill, meanwhile, went 18-of-32 for just 178 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. Tannehill was solid overall, but did have some accuracy issues. He also endured some drops, including 1 by "
