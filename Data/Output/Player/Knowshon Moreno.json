Royal caught 10 balls for 90 yards. I don't know if it was Orton's glove-less hand or the new Wild Horses formation, but let's hope he keeps this up.    Brandon Marshall continues to play well; he caught 8 balls for 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. Marshall showed up to his post-game interview in a full Colorado Rockies uniform (with the helmet too).

   "comment":"Moreno runs. They also were guilty of 7 penalties (compared to 4 for the Colts), most of which were really untimely. As an example, the Broncos had a 3rd-and-1 on Indianapolis' 15. A false start made it 3rd-and-6, and on that play, Kyle Orton tossed a pick.    Speaking of picks, Peyton Manning launched 3. 2 of which went to Brian Dawkins off deflections. However, the Broncos turned those all 3 of those interceptions into just 3 points. As I said, blown opportunities. Manning's stat line was otherwise very strange. He was just 20-of-42 for 220 yards, but tossed 4 touchdowns. Manning's troubles against good 3-4 defenses are well-documented, and will likely be prevalent in the postseason.    Dallas Clark caught 3 of Manning's touchdowns. He finished with 5 grabs for 43 yards. Austin Collie (3-39) caught the other. Reggie Wayne and Pierre Garcon had just 43 and 39 yards, respectively.    Joseph Addai had a solid game, rushing for 67 yards on 16 carries, and catching 5 passes for 49 more yards. Addai left the contest with a minor ankle injury, but returned to the lineup later on.    As for the Broncos, Orton finished 29-of-41 for 277 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Amazingly, 21 of his 29 completions went to Marshall.    Knowshon Moreno couldn't do much against Indianapolis' defense. He carried the ball 23 times but for just 63 yards. He also caught 3 balls for 13 more yards. "

   "comment":"Moreno have the best rushing performance on the Broncos. Listed as the No. 1 fantasy football sleeper on this Web site, Moreno gained 93 yards and 2 scores on just 13 carries. He should be given more carries going forward, as it's quite apparent that Ball is a typical Big Ten plodder who is inept on third down. Ball mustered only 16 yards on 12 attempts to go along with the aforementioned lost fumble.    Eli lost this contest - giving him an 0-3 record versus Peyton - but if it's any consolation to him, he out-threw his older brother. He generated 362 yards and a touchdown on 28-of-49 passing, but was responsible for 4 interceptions. The first occurred just prior to halftime. He made a poor decision and heaved it toward the end zone despite being in field goal range. One of his other picks was fluky, as it bounced off a player's foot. I was hoping the Broncos would return it for a score so I could call it a kick-six. The other 2 interceptions were heaved deep into double coverage. Eli had a poor showing overall in what could be his final battle against his brother, but if Peyton ever brings this up in the future, Eli can just shove his 2 Super Bowl rings in Peyton's face.    Eli's sole aerial score came late in garbage time to "

The Chiefs took that 7 right back as Knile Davis returned the kickoff 108-yards to put Kansas City back in front. Manning tried to go back to Decker, but the veteran signal-caller had the underthrown ball fall short to Marcus Cooper for an interception that set up the Chiefs inside Broncos' territory. Smith took advantage with a touchdown pass to Fasano. Manning answered by hitting Decker for a gain of 42 yards to the 3.yard line. That led to a short touchdown toss to Moreno and a 21-14 Kansas City lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Decker burned the Chiefs' secondary again. Manning had a beautiful throw as Decker burned Flowers and Demps for a 37-yard touchdown. Manning kept pushing the ball down the field as "

   "comment":"Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past 3 weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does 10. to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him 4 away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish 1 to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on 8 carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on 3 tries."

Moreno was awesome though. He simply wouldn't go down on some plays. Having him healthy is a huge boost for this offense.    Tannehill, meanwhile, went 18-of-32 for just 178 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. Tannehill was solid overall, but did have some accuracy issues. He also endured some drops, including 1 by "
