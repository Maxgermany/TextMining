Hogan actually led the Browns in rushing and managed to eclipse the century mark, gaining 104 yards and a touchdown on 7 scrambles. Hogan's passing, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Watching him complete his dinks and dunks and misfire on anything longer than that was a clear reminder of why the Chiefs cut him despite using an actual pick on him in the 2016 NFL Draft. Hogan connected on half of his 24 passes for only 100 yards. He also threw 2 interceptions.

   "comment":"Hogan, who was able to find Njoku in the end zone. Hogan then had the Browns deep in Jets territory once again, but Hue Jackson foolishly passed on the opportunity to tie the game at 10. Jackson not only wasted a timeout, but called a predictable play, ramming Crowell into the middle of the line of scrimmage. Crowell was stuffed, and the demoralized Browns surrendered a 97-yard drive to the Jets, showing very little effort because they knew the game was over.    There are 2 pieces of big news concerning the Browns. The first is that Kizer was benched. He was terrible, going 8-of-17 for 87 yards and the aforementioned pick. The move to bench Kizer was the first correct thing Jackson has done all season, though he should've done this much earlier. Kizer has talent for sure, but he's just not seeing things correctly. He's making terrible reads, holding the ball too long, and misfiring on passes NFL quarterbacks should make. Hogan, meanwhile, was much better. He failed to complete just 3 passes, going 16-of-19 for 194 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. I wouldn't even put the pick on him, as it occurred when he was crunched by "
