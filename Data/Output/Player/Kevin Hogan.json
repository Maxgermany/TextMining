   "comment":"Kevin Hogan in these strange read-option plays that were inexplicably effective. Hogan actually led the Browns in rushing and managed to eclipse the century mark, gaining 104 yards and a touchdown on 7 scrambles. Hogan's passing, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Watching him complete his dinks and dunks and misfire on anything longer than that was a clear reminder of why the Chiefs cut him despite using an actual pick on him in the 2016 NFL Draft. Hogan connected on half of his 24 passes for only 100 yards. He also threw 2 interceptions.    The Bengals, battling a fifth-string quarterback, didn't need to do much in the second half, especially after "

  "comment":"Kevin Hogan started, and he was predictably terrible as a passer. He managed to scramble 5 times for 36 rushing yards, but he couldn't do anything aerially. Hogan's passes took forever to reach their targets, as the former Stanford signal-caller has absolutely no arm strength. There was just too much air under all of his passes, and he was lucky to get away with not throwing an early interception. His luck ran out, however, as a ball sailed on him, allowing ",
