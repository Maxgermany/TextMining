   "comment":"Floyd blew up the play. Davis, meanwhile, wasn't much better, gaining just 13 yards on 5 tries.    Alex Smith finished 22-of-37 for 282 yards and a touchdown. He once again dinked and dunked, and most of his yardage came when this was a 2.score game. Smith was 7-of-11 for only 43 yards in the first half. I'd say that the Chiefs need to try Chase Daniel, but no mediocre quarterback stands much of a chance without Charles and Maclin while being stuck behind such a horrible offensive line.    "

   "comment":"Floyd were dominant. The Vikings recorded just 2 sacks, but Wilson had to throw the ball away on numerous occasions. One instance should've been ruled intentional grounding, but Walt Coleman was too incompetent to make the correct call. Wilson went 13-of-26 for 142 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was a tipped pass on a 4.h down. He did not look comfortable whatsoever in the frigid weather. Wilson did, however, make a great play when he mishandled a snap, scooped up the ball 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage, avoided some defenders and found "
