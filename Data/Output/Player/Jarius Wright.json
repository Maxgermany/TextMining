The attempt, which would've been an NFL record, went wide left, securing the victory for the Lions.    It's a shame that Bridgewater made those errors because he was great otherwise. He misfired on just 10 attempts, going 31-of-41 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. He also moved around well, scrambling thrice for 30 rushing yards.
