Johnson's horrid 4.8 YPA speaks for itself, but at least he could move around; he had 41 yards on 7 carries.    The Redskins may have won the game, but Campbell was not any better than Johnson. Campbell was just 12-of-22 for 170 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. He also had a fumble deep in his own territory at the beginning of the game to give the Buccaneers an easy opportunity to score. Apparently, Jim Zorn had Campbell watch some film on "
