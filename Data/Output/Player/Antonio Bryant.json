His numbers will improve as he gets more time with Leftwich if he's healthy. The big concern is that Bryant left the game in the fourth quarter with a knee injury.    Speaking of Mr. Sandwich, he was 25-of-41 for 276 yards and a score. Doesn't sound too bad, but most of that came in junk time late in the game. The amazing thing is that Sandwich didn't get sacked once. Still, the Buccaneers won't win (m)any games with him under center.   "

Campbell was just 12-of-22 for 170 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. He also had a fumble deep in his own territory at the beginning of the game to give the Buccaneers an easy opportunity to score.
