That was once again apparent in this contest, as Chris Johnson rushed for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns on 23 attempts. Johnson has struggled for most of this season, but has picked it up the past 2 weeks against the poor Buffalo and Tampa Bay defenses. He'll once again have an easy matchup next week against the Saints.    Chris Berman called Matt Hasselbeck 1 of the top free-agent acquisitions this offseason during <i>Sunday NFL Countdown</i> this week. Hasselbeck went 16-of-25 for 140 yards, but had trouble sustaining drives, converting just 2-of-11 third-down attempts. In fact, Buffalo actually outgained Tennessee, but 2 fumbles (Ryan Fitzpatrick, Scott Chandler) did them in.    No Titan wideouts of note; Damian Williams and Nate Washington each led the team with 4 receptions, for 62 and 40 yards, respectively."
