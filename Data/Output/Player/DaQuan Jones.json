   "comment":"Jones recovered the fumble for a Titans touchdown. Midway through the first half, Savage converted a 4.h-and-1 on a quarterback sneak. The league's neurological monitors removed Savage from the game after that play, forcing him into the concussion protocol. Savage didn't act injured, but it brought Osweiler into the game for Houston. The Titans had a drive going into Houston territory before "
