   "comment":"Vinatieri was way wide right from 51 yards out. The Colts scored their sole touchdown after that to make it 14-7, but the Patriots posted 10 points right before halftime and after intermission. Before the Colts knew what hit them, it was 31-7 in the middle of the third quarter. Luck had to start forcing the issue, which led to a pair of desperate interceptions.    Luck finished 12-of-33 for 126 yards and 2 picks. He didn't play well, but he wasn't as awful as his putrid numbers indicate. Some drops hurt him, and he didn't get the appropriate protection to help him maintain drives. He was just 5-of-14 for 37 yards and 2 interceptions following intermission when the game was mostly out of hand.    Hilton was Indianapolis' leading receiver even though he had just 1 catch - the aforementioned sideline grab - which went for 36 yards. "

   "comment":"Vinatieri drilled a 54-yard field goal to get on the board first. The Jaguars answered with Blake Bortles hitting Allen Hurns for 26 yards. Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting "

Andrew Luck was the 1 with the shoulder injury, but Hasselbeck spent time in a hospital on Tuesday morning with flu-like symptoms. A report by Stacy Dales prior to kickoff seemed to indicate that Hasselbeck may not make it through the entire game. Despite this, however, Hasselbeck was terrific. He fired sharp, accurate passes to his receivers and lofted some perfect throws to his targets for significant gains.

   "comment":"Vinatieri. Stafford answered with a 32-yard pass to Jones and finished another drive with a strike to Ebron for a short touchdown reception. Ebron made a superb catch while getting hit by 2 defenders. Luck quickly moved the ball with a 32-yard completion to Moncrief, 14 yards to Josh Ferguson, 16 yards to Dwayne Allen, 8 to Hilton, and a short touchdown strike to Moncrief. The Lions took a 21-10 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Luck got rolling with a 51-yard pass to Philip Dorsett (4-94), who beat Darius Slay for the reception. Allen (4-53-1) got open in busted coverage for a 19-yard score. Luck went back to Allen for a 2.point conversion and midway through the third quarter, the Lions' lead was cut to 21-18. Stafford answered ripping the ball down the field and finished it with a short touchdown toss to Abdullah, who was left uncovered in the flat. Luck came back to produce another field-goal drive. The Lions punted the ball away, and Luck went right back to work with a 32-yard pass to Hilton to get into Detroit territory. The Lions' lead evaporated when Luck hit tight end Jack Doyle (3-35-2) for a 16-yard touchdown, and just like that, the game was tied at 28. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Lions were led into the red zone on nice gains by Riddick, Abdullah, Boldin and Ebron. A screen to Riddick hit pay dirt from 13 yards out, as Larry Warford hit the key block to spring Riddick. However, Matt Prater missed the extra point. After a few moderate gains, Luck hit Dorsett for a 33-yard gain after he beat Quandre Diggs downfield. That put the Colts in the red zone with 2 minutes left on the clock. With just under 40 seconds remaining, Luck connected with Doyle for a 6-yard touchdown. Vinatieri made the extra point to give the Colts a 1.point lead. Stafford got the ball at the Lions' 25-yard line with 37 seconds remaining and all 3 timeouts. Riddick rumbled for 20 yards on the first completion. Stafford then hit Ebron for close to 10 yards and then Jones for 22 yards. That set up Prater to redeem himself with a 43-yard field goal attempt that he drilled to give the Lions the victory. A safety was tacked on during the Colts' lateral on the kickoff return as time expired.    Matthew Stafford was superb, going 31-of-39 for 340 yards with 3 touchdowns. Indianapolis' secondary was completely helpless to stop Detroit. The Colts' defense had 1 sack on a play where "
