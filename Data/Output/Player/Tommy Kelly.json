Another personal foul, this 1 a questionable call on linebacker Aaron Curry, who merely hit Rudolph squarely after a short gain, set up the Vikings in plus territory. Harvin had a sweet 35-yard touchdown run negated by a hold on wide receiver Michael Jenkins, but the drive still ended with a score thanks in part to another 15-yard penalty on Oakland's defense, this 1 a face mask on Tyvon Branch. Adrian Peterson's 12-yard run made it 7-0 on a drive that covered 77 yards including 45 on defensive penalties, which you knew if you read this paragraph carefully. The Raiders' offense took over with 5:07 left in the first quarter at their own 45-yard line after a great return by speedy rookie running back Taiwan Jones. Three consecutive drives would start close to midfield starting with this 1, and all of them resulted in scores. This is when the Silver and Black took this game by the throat, and they needed all of the lead they built up. The first march ended in a field goal and was highlighted by a 20-yard run by Marcel matchup nightmare Reece who ran 6 times for 45 yards on the game and caught 2 passes for 16 yards. Leading 7-3, Minnesota was backed up when Desmond Bryant sacked Ponder. Peterson ran up the middle for 12 yards, but left injured. Ponder's long run of 28 yards converted the third down, but this was clearly a turning point as the first quarter ended. Former Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart ran 7 times for just 18 yards in relief of All Day and did not take advantage of a defense giving up a lot of rushing yards this season. On 3rd-and-5 from the Oakland 21, Ponder was intercepted by Matt Giordano on a pass intended for Harvin, who was the only consistent offensive threat for the Vikings. He ran 5 times for 21 yards and caught 6 passes for 73 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. The big return by Giordano led to another short field and the Raiders marched right down it. When they were finally forced to third down, Carson Palmer hit oft-injured wide receiver Chaz Schilens for an 11-yard touchdown to give Oakland a 10-7 lead. They would never trail again. Minnesota took advantage of another short Janikowski kickoff and quickly drove to scoring range, but botched a field goal attempt. Michael Bush (30 carries for 109 yards) started and finished the subsequent drive with short runs, the latter of which went for a touchdown putting the Raiders ahead 17-7. A fumble on the kickoff by Lorenzo Booker was recovered by rookie cornerback DeMarcus Van Dyke and really left the Vikings in trouble with just 1:20 remaining in the half. Oakland worked down to the 1-yard line after burning their remaining timeouts and faced a third down. Hue Jackson went for the throat and called a quarterback sneak. Palmer delivered for a 24-7 halftime lead. After the break, the Raiders' offense was a mess, repeatedly coming up short. Fortunately, the defense was able to stop Minnesota consistently in the third quarter. The biggest play was an interception by Kelly, the defensive tackle's first in his career, to put them on a short field. After 1 first down, however, the drive ended with another Janikowski field goal for a 27-7 lead. Minnesota could have given up here, but struck for a big play covering 42 yards to "

   "comment":"Kelly put the Raiders' defense in a hole with an offsides penalty, Oakland was able to force a third down. Johnson was the man again, this time on a 6-yard reception. One play later, Stafford went deep to Nate Burleson for a 39-yard score to tie the game. I immediately felt that the Lions scored too quickly, leaving a minute for an Oakland defense known for scoring late in halves this season. Palmer threw on 6 consecutive plays, completing 4 throws for 45 yards. Bush picked up 6 more yards on a run right up the middle, and Janikowski's 46-yard field goal put the Raiders up 17-14 at halftime. The third quarter was a mess for both offenses. Oakland struggled to convert third downs (1-of-9) the entire game, and even though Detroit was effective (8-of-17), they did most of their damage on big scoring plays. Kevin Smith (15 rushes for 43 yards) took the rock on 4 of the next 5 plays during 1 drive. He was unable to find room the entire game and was stuffed on 3rd- and 4th-and-1 for a turnover on downs. The Raiders were ready to seize on the change of field position as a 13-yard gain to Kevin Boss putting them in plus territory. Heyward-Bey caught a pass over the middle and looked like he would shake tackles and possibly score until Justin Durant forced a fumble that Alphonso Smith recovered. Once again a scoring opportunity went by the boards. After forcing a punt, the Oakland offense chipped away with a feisty drive featuring a handful of short Bush runs and 2 modest pass plays to get Janikowski close enough for a 51-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter for a 20-14 lead. Backed up and trailing, Detroit was in passing mode. Stafford threw incomplete twice and then lost a fumble when Kelly got to him. "
