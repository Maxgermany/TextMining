   "comment":"Andre Smith hold.    Smith hold.    Giovani Bernard didn't find much running room, but managed to score once. He gained 45 yards on 16 carries otherwise. Unfortunately, he left the game with a hip injury. Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker Emmanuel Lamur. The second was a weird 1. as Torrey Smith appeared to have suffered a concussion and screwed up on the play. Flacco had some other near-picks, including 1 where a Cincinnati defender bobbled 1 of his passes in the first half. Having said that, this loss wasn't all on Flacco. Smith, as mentioned, suffered a concussion. He also lost 2 starting offensive linemen - "
