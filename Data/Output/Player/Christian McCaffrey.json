   "comment":"McCaffrey in the end zone for a short score, but floated the ball over his head. Perhaps the pass rush affected Newton more than his previous injury. Carolina still can't block, and that was apparent when the Bills racked up half-a-dozen sacks. The 6.h appeared to injure Newton, who was down on the ground for a while. He walked gingerly off the field, but was able to return to the field. Newton is not going to last all 16 games if he keeps facing this sort of pressure. The important thing to note is that it could've even been worse for Carolina's offensive line, as Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams were knocked out of the game at various points during the afternoon.    Newton's top receiver was Kelvin Benjamin, who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. Benjamin nearly scored a touchdown on the opening drive, but safety Jordan Poyer hit him hard and dislodged the ball. Devin Funchess (4-68) will have to be a bigger factor if Olsen is out for a while.    Christian McCaffrey will have to step up as well. McCaffrey caught 4 passes for 34 yards, but he also would've scored a touchdown had Newton not missed him in the flat. McCaffrey didn't do much as a runner, however (8-10), as "

Stewart was hit in the backfield almost every single time he touched the ball, and it seemed like a wasted down every time the Panthers tried to involve him. Carolina needs to move away from Stewart, as he's slowing down the offense. Perhaps the coaching staff will figure that out with the extra time off this upcoming week.    Benjamin nearly hit the century mark, catching 9 balls for 99 yards. He would have gotten there had he not dropped a pass in the second half.

He got a team-high 7 receptions and turned them into 36 yards. One of the catches was a beautiful, 1.handed grab on an overthrown ball that he caught with his injured right hand/wrist. He is on the rise and should have a chance to break out with better blocking. "

Speaking of McCaffrey, it seems very likely that the Panthers will continue to get him more involved based on what happened in this game. What happened was Stewart coughing up the ball twice. Stewart fumbled on 2 occasions in Atlanta territory, with both turnovers being forced by "
