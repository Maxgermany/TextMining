Again, Atlanta was being outgained in yards per play the entire afternoon, so its offense wasn't as good as Arizona's, and anyone who paid close attention to this game would probably agree.    Ryan finished 26-of-34 for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He played well overall, but wasn't great. Statistics can often be misleading, and that was certainly the case in this instance. Two of Ryan's longest completions, a 35- and a 25-yarder, were short tosses to Gabriel, who did all the work against a sloppy Arizona defense. Ryan's pick wasn't his fault, as it was a "

In garbage time, the Rams moved the ball versus Atlanta's backups, and on the first play of the 4.h quarter, Todd Gurley plunged into the end zone. Matt Schaub took over at quarterback for Ryan in the 4.h quarter. Goff laid out a 50-yard touchdown pass to Brian Quick, but that was called back by a very questionable pass interference. Still, it was a nice throw from the rookie signal-caller. Goff ended up having a short touchdown run with under 3 minutes remaining.

   "comment":"Gabriel. The Atlanta receiver actually pushed off, and Shead went down instantly. It's unclear why offensive pass interference wasn't called. The Falcons were flagged just twice all game. Hopefully official Gene Steratore makes great use of his new yacht. With Seattle's defense struggling big time, Matt Ryan torched the formerly dominant Legion of Boom with ease. Ryan went 26-of-37 for 338 yards and 3 touchdowns. He validated his possible MVP status, as the Seahawks couldn't do anything to slow him down. They didn't put much pressure on him, and even when they did, he still found open receivers, punishing them for blitzing him. Even when Julio Jones was knocked out, Ryan still torched Seattle's secondary mercilessly. Atlanta punted just once in meaningful action.    Speaking of Jones, he left the game temporarily on the opening drive of the third quarter with a toe injury, as he was hobbling around on the sideline. Jones reentered the game, but left prior to the end of regulation. I imagine he still would've played had the contest not gotten out of hand, but it still has to be disconcerting for the Falcons. They'll obviously need Jones to beat a tougher opponent in the NFC Championship. Jones caught 6 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. He also dropped a pass. His score, the first of the game for the Falcons, was an obvious pass interference call - blocking downfield prior to the ball being released - that Steratore didn't call for some reason. The FOX announcers, including Mike Pereira, were befuddled as to why no flagged was tossed.    If Jones is hobbled next week, the other receivers will obviously have to pick up the slack. Gabriel (4-71) was top wideout producer as far as yardage is concerned, while Mohamed Sanu (4-44) found the end zone."

   "comment":"Gabriel, meanwhile, didn't do much; he caught 2 passes for 24 yards, and he was responsible for a drop of about 15 yards.    The Falcons had a couple of nice runs, but otherwise didn't do very much on the ground. Freeman gained 42 yards on 14 carries, while Coleman managed just 29 yards and a score on 11 attempts.    As for the Packers, Rodgers' stat line looks nice, but he'll be disappointed with this performance. Rodgers finished 27-of-45 for 287 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, but all of his scores came in the second half when Atlanta was already winning in a blowout. Rodgers was uncharacteristically off the mark on some of his throws. He also saw more pressure than he's used to. Rodgers didn't recognize what Atlanta was doing with its blitzes, and it also didn't help that the Packers lost both guards in this contest. "
