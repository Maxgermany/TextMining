Glennon was also guilty of some bad misfires, and he was even worse than Hoyer. Barely completing half of his passes, Glennon went 17-of-33 for 260 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of picks, 1 of which occurred in the end zone that wasn't even close to his intended target. The other was an underthrow in which "

Ryan finished 26-of-34 for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He played well overall, but wasn't great. Statistics can often be misleading, and that was certainly the case in this instance. Two of Ryan's longest completions, a 35- and a 25-yarder, were short tosses to Gabriel, who did all the work against a sloppy Arizona defense. Ryan's pick wasn't his fault, as it was a "
