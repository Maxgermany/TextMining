   "comment":"Heath's. The Redskins would've had first-and-goal inside the Dallas 5-yard line, but the Cowboys came away with the turnover instead. The second was also Crowder's fault, as he fumbled a punt return to give Dallas possession in Washington territory. The third was when Cousins was strip-sacked to set up a Dallas field goal. The fourth was surrendering a punt return for a touchdown, which made the margin 17. The Redskins actually were outgaining the Cowboys at halftime and were averaging nearly 2 more yards per play, yet they were trailing by 10 because of all their blunders. They have no 1 but themselves to blame for this defeat.    Another big factor for the Redskins was the injury to right tackle "
