   "comment":"Fitzpatrick was horrendous, and not because Cincinnati could have dodged an 0-4 start. If Derek Anderson would have defeated Palmer, that would have meant that an Oregon State alumnus would have knocked off a USC product as an underdog. The symmetry would have been awesome - though the Browns weren't a 25-point underdog that lost to crappy Stanford and was blowed out at Penn State.    Anyway, where did this Palmer injury come from? There was nothing during the week. He wasn't limited in practice. If it wasn't for Chris Mortensen, we wouldn't have found out Palmer was a scratch until kickoff.    Speaking of kickoff, I turned on CBS, expecting to see a good game. Unfortunately, the 2 announcers were previewing the Browns-Bengals. Seriously, whose brilliant idea was it to broadcast the Toilet Bowl, a battle between 2 0-3 squads? Someone needs to be fired for this.    I was also shocked that Romeo Crennel didn't bench Anderson after he tossed a pick in the red zone on the opening drive of the third quarter. Crennel didn't even trust Anderson enough to throw the ball on the opening possession of the game, which culminated in a field goal. Seven runs, no passes. If the Browns weren't playing the sorry Bungles, they would be 0-4 right now.    Anderson finished 15-of-24, 138 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He went to Kellen Winslow Jr. 5 times for 54 yards. Braylon Edwards caught 3 balls for 22 yards and a touchdown. Edwards also had a senseless unnecessary roughness penalty after a Browns first down in the third quarter.    With all that offensive ineptness how did the Browns come away with a 20-12 victory? You can thank the Bengals for turning it over 5 times. Ryan Fitzpatrick gave Cincinnati no chance to win, as he threw 3 picks and fumbled once. "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick began the game 3-of-8 for 15 yards. I jotted the following down: How are the Bengals supposed to play hard with garbage like that at quarterback? Seriously, if I knew my quarterback had no chance of leading us to victory, I wouldn't prepare for the game at all. Fitzpatrick finished 21-of-35, 164 yards and a touchdown. However, he fumbled twice and was sacked 7 times. You can't really blame Fitzpatrick for everything; Cincinnati's offensive line sucks and the running game was non-existent ("

If Fitzpatrick, Thigpen and Orlovsky could all light it up on the same day, the world has to be coming to an end, right?

However, he still has major physical limitations, and it's highly doubtful that he would have been able to accomplish this against a defense that wasn't horrible and hadn't quit.

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick and Jason Campbell were 6-of-13 for 32 yards, and the game was scoreless. Oakland got the running game going just enough to move the football with an occasional screen pass to Darren McFadden. It was nothing fancy, but drive after drive, they marched in for touchdowns in the second quarter. This was supposed to be a hangover game for them flying east on a short week following a late Monday Night Football appearance in Denver. Instead, they were up 21-3 at halftime aided by a missed field goal and turnover leading to a short touchdown drive. When the second half started, everything went back to analyst expectations coming in. Buffalo came out firing on offense and playing aggressive on defense. The offense scored touchdowns all 5 times they touched the ball after the break. The defense forced a fumble on Oakland's first possession and a quick punt on their second possession. By the 4.h quarter, this was an old school AFL shootout with the teams exchanging touchdowns and the lead. Remember the passing stats from earlier? Well, in the final 3 quarters Fitzpatrick and Campbell combined to complete 45 out of 66 attempts for 565 yards and 5 touchdowns.    Campbell's numbers were solid. He completed almost 70 percent of his throws for 323 yards and a couple touchdowns. The interception was on a hail mary play the end the game, so ignore that. Campbell was dealing with some different wide receivers with "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick hit David Nelson for the touchdown and 7-0 lead on a march that took up 8:47 off the clock and nearly put the game in the second quarter. New York had an immediate answer. Shonn Greene saw the ball on 3 of the first 4 plays, running twice for 8 yards and collecting an 18-yard reception. Santonio Holmes picked up 23 yards on an end-around for the other big gain to put the offense in business. They scrapped the rest of the way down the field and eventually went to wide open tight end Dustin Keller for the 3-yard touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo moved the ball on its next drive, converting a third down when they were put in a second-and-15 situation after a false start by rookie left tackle Chris Hairston. It was done the hard way with Stevie Johnson beating Darrelle Revis on consecutive plays. The drive stalled when just acquired Tashard Choice was handed the ball out of a shotgun on third-and-four. He was swarmed for a loss of 5 and Rex Ryan laughed at the play call. I might have made the last part up. Brian Moorman pinned the Jets deep with a nice punt. After New York failed to escape the bad field position, their secret weapon Aaron Maybin became a factor. He was a team captain for this 1. which had to motivate him going up against the team that drafted him. The former bust made a dumb play on 3rd-and-8 clocking lineman Kraig Urbik to negate a failed play. An offsetting penalty reset the down and Maybin sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick. Then Moorman pinned the Jets again, keeping the offense and erratic quarterback "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick for stealing millions of dollars from him.)    Buffalo's collapse reached embarrassing proportions as Miami running back Reggie Bush ripped them for over 200 yards on the ground. The day started on a bad note for Bush when he fumbled the ball away. The Bills got on the board first with a 24-yard touchdown run by C.J. Spiller. The Dolphins answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Moore to Anthony Fasano. Miami cornerback Vontae Davis then set up a field goal via an interception to give his offense the ball at the 24-yard line. It should have gone for more but Brandon Marshall dropped his second touchdown of the game. He is 1 of the league leaders in drops, and his 2 early in the game looked like they would be costly. His concentration and focus are terrible. If Marshall could get his head straight, he would be a much better receiver. Moore blew a scoring chance in the third quarter when he fumbled the ball away deep in Buffalo territory. A bit later, Marshall made up for his drops with a 65-yard touchdown on a go route. The pass was thrown in perfectly by Moore to Marshall, who made a nice over-the-shoulder catch while burning cornerback Drayton Florence. The reception put Marshall over 1,000 yards on the season for the fifth straight year. The afternoon got very sloppy in the third quarter. Dolphin safety Reshad Jones caught a deflected pass for an interception. On the Bills' next drive, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw his third interception to Davis (for his second) when he out-fought Stevie Johnson on a ball lofted downfield. The Bills made it 23-13 after a short touchdown pass to Spiller. Fitzpatrick threw an interception on the 2.point attempt. Late in the third quarter, and then early in the 4.h quarter, Bush was running well and moving the ball for the Dolphins. Miami's offensive line was winning the battle up front and doing a good job of opening up lanes and getting to the second level of the defense. Bush sealed the game with a 76-yard touchdown jaunt. He ran through a big hole and broke a tackle from Jarius Byrd to sprint downfield for the score. Bush had a few other highlight-reel runs in the game including an ankle-breaking spin move to juke a defender. He finished with 203 yards on 25 carries with a touchdown. Fitzpatrick attempted a comeback with a short touchdown toss to "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick coughed the ball up, setting up a Miami score. Give credit to the Dolphins though, as they took advantage of Buffalo's mistakes. Bush gained 65 yards on the ground (19 carries) and 42 yards aerially (4 catches) and scored thrice in the process. Miller, meanwhile, mustered 73 yards on 10 attempts. He could be the team's starting running back next year, as Daniel Thomas is just a mediocre plodder.    Ryan Tannehill, who was incredibly sharp in the second half of last week's contest, played well again. He went 13-of-25 for 130 yards and 2 touchdowns thrown to Bush. He also rushed for 44 yards on 6 scrambles.    Tannehill's leading wideout was rookie Rishard Matthews (2-37). Brian Hartline had a pedestrian performance, snagging 2 balls for 12 yards, as he couldn't get open against rookie corner Stephon Gilmore.    Speaking of stud corners, Sean Smith left the game with a knee injury. He'll probably be out next week.    As for the Bills, Fitzpatrick was awful. His final numbers don't look bad - 20-of-35, 240 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception - but he padded those with junk yardage at the very end. He was just 6-of-13 for 75 yards at halftime.

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick, who had an interception to Earl Thomas early on with an overthrow, nearly heaved a second 1 to Walter Thurmond. Thurmond dropped the ball, probably because he saw an open field and a potential defensive touchdown in front of him. - Tennessee punter Brett Kern bobbled a punt, allowing Seattle to take over in Titans' territory. - Seattle kicker Steven Hauschka suffered an injury, forcing the punter/holder to kick. There was a new holder as a consequence, who happened to bobble the ball on a field-goal try. The Titans picked up the ball and ran it into the end zone for their only touchdown of the afternoon. - Sidney Rice (2-35) inexplicably reached the ball out with both hands after a reception even though he was nowhere near the first-down marker. Tennessee picked up the fumble recovery. - Marshawn Lynch, who had a big game with 77 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 21 carries and 4 catches for a team-leading 78 receiving yards, fumbled at the goal line. Linebacker Zach Brown picked the ball up, but he fumbled it as well. Russell Wilson was able to pounce on it.    Wilson had another solid outing. He let only 8 balls hit the ground, as he finished 23-of-31 for 257 yards. He didn't throw a touchdown or an interception, though he did scramble 10 times for 61 rushing yards. His leading receiver, not including Lynch, was Doug Baldwin (4-48).    As for Fitzpatrik, he had another underwhelming performance against a stellar defense. He went 17-of-29 for 171 yards and 2 interceptions - the second underthrown toward Richard Sherman. Fitzpatrick also had that aforementioned dropped pick-six and also took a horrible sack that took his team out of field-goal range in the second quarter.    Fitzpatrick actually tied the team in rushing yards (6-33). "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick fumble in which the quarterback was not down by contact. Even the special teams were dreadful, as the kick returner didn't know whether or not to take the ball out of the end zone, as he was pinned inside the 5-yard line. Mistakes were prevalent throughout the first 2 quarters. Darrius Heyward-Bey and Weslye Saunders dropped passes. The defense, meanwhile, committed 3 penalties on 1 drive, including a head butt by Erik Walden (though if you watch the replay, you'll see the official actually throw the flag right before the head butt and right after Walden ripped the player's helmet off). With Chris Johnson running all over Indianapolis, the Titans led 17-3 just before a last-second Adam Vinatieri field goal prior to intermission. But then everything changed. Suddenly, the Colts were efficient on offense and strong versus the run on defense. They established the lead with the help of a fumbled kickoff return and eventually went up by 10 points, though Fitzpatrick easily torched the Colts on a drive to achieve the dreaded back-door push. If you're reading this, I hope you had Indianapolis -2.5. I had -3. Wah, wah.    It really is amazing how much things changed in the second half. Here are some examples: - "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick and Matt McGloin? But as odd as it sounds, the quarterback position was the least of either team's issues in this contest. The main reason Oakland lost this game was because Sebastian Janikowski whiffed on 2 field goals from 32 and 48 yards. Janikowski is highly paid and should be able to convert these sorts of kicks, but he cost his team a victory with these misses. The Titans, meanwhile, had issues with drops in the early going. They were guilty of 3 in the first half. Delanie Walker (5-46) had 1. while Kenny Britt let 2 balls fall through his hands. I have no idea why Britt's still even on the field. Even 1 of the CBS announcers called Britt a waste of talent. Despite Tennessee's drops, Fitzpatrick let the ball hit the ground only 12 times, finishing 30-of-42 for 320 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He also rushed for 26 yards on 5 scrambles. Fitzpatrick was especially effective in the second half, going 16-of-21 for 185 yards and his 2 scores after intermission.    Fitzpatrick's touchdowns were thrown to "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick tossed his third interception of the afternoon, giving Indianapolis a victory.    Luck had trouble sustaining drives throughout this game, as he was just 3-of-14 on third-down tries. Luck, who went 17-of-32 for 200 yards and an interception (as well as a potential second 1), dealt with an insane amount of pressure from Tennessee's strong front. The Titans sacked Luck 5 times - a number that would've been greater had Luck not scrambled out of trouble on so many occasions (5 rushes, 42 yards). Jurrell Casey, who had 1 of the sacks, had a monstrous afternoon. He had a huge tackle for loss on 1 play that won't be found on the box score. It didn't help Luck that his receivers struggled to get open. No Colt had more than 50 receiving yards, with Coby Fleener leading the way (3-50). T.Y. Hilton had 5 grabs for 46 yards, but was responsible for Luck's sole interception, as the ball tipped off his hands. Darrius Heyward-Bey, meanwhile, took an 11-yard loss and also dropped a pass.    The Colts finally benched Trent Richardson in favor of Donald Brown. This is about 2 months too late, but better late than never. Brown was OK, gaining 54 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, while Richardson wasted 5 attempts for 19 yards. Eleven of those 19 yards came on a third-and-20, so they were meaningless.    Luck didn't play well, but Ryan Fitzpatrick was worse. Fitzpatrick, who performed well against the Colts 2 weeks ago, struggled with turnovers. He was guilty of 3 interceptions and a lost fumble in field-goal range, negating his decent stats: 21-of-37, 201 passing yards, 54 rushing yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). Fitzpatrick's picks were careless. Whenever he sensed any sort of pressure, it looked like he thought, Ah f*** it, I'm just going to bomb it downfield. For a smart, Harvard man, Fitzpatrick can play very stupidly sometimes. Fitzpatrick's lone aerial score was a flip to "

Johnson looked like he wanted to kill the officials as he yelled at them, but it was pointless; the zebras gave the Titans a free first down that the host was able to turn into a trip into the end zone. Following the game-tying score, Fitzpatrick bowed for his teammates, who celebrated the improbable comeback. Unfortunately for Fitzpatrick, he was intercepted in overtime after nearly tossing a pick-six. This helped set up the game-winning field goal for Arizona. The Cardinals managed to prevail in overtime, but allowing Tennessee to send this game into an extra session proved to be costly, as "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick limits how high Houston can hope to go this season. The Texans' defense dominated this game from start to finish as Oakland had no chance. The few times the Raiders were able to move the ball, the Texans would come up with a turnover to end the drive. Oakland got 2 garbage-time touchdowns, but the Raiders really never were truly competitive with Houston. The Texans' offense was led by Arian Foster, as he tore up the Oakland's defense even when it was clear what Oakland was going to do.    The Texans got on the board on their opening drive. Foster had a 40-yard run to the 1.yard line. On second-and-goal, J.J. Watt came in as a tight end and released off the line to get wide open in the back of the end zone for a touchdown catch. The next drive, it was all Foster as he rolled down the field and into the end zone. Oakland got a splash play with a 41-yard run by Derek Carr that caught Houston completely by surprise, but Carr ended the drive by throwing a pick to Kareem Jackson that was returned deep into Oakland territory to set up a field goal. The Raiders had a funny blooper-reel play as James Jones caught a pass downfield and was stripped by Kendrick Lewis. Jones then picked up his own fumble and ran it 20 yards inside the 10-yard line before fumbling again after getting hit by Jonathan Joseph. D.J. Swearinger recovered the ball for Houston. After halftime, the Raiders had a good drive going before Mychal Rivera fumbled the ball away after a hit from Swearinger. Joseph picked up the ball and returned it 50 yards. That set up a 12-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins (3-22). Oakland finally scored with a short touchdown run from Darren McFadden (12-37 rushing, 2-31 receiving) early in the 4.h quarter. Late in the game, Watt blasted Carr and forced a deflection that was caught by Brooks Reed for an interception. In the final minute, Carr threw a touchdown pass to Jones (9-112).    Fitzpatrick did his job as a game manager, as he was 14-of-19 for 139 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Foster ran for 138 yards with a touchdown on 28 carries. "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick managed the game to get points, as head coach Bill O'Brien had a superb performance as a play-caller. The Jaguars had a 13-10 lead at the half, but the final 2 quarters were all Houston.    Jacksonville got on the board first with a short drive aided by some Houston penalties and a 16-yard run by Denard Robinson (10-30). To finish the possession, Bortles rolled out and found Allen Hurns (5-36) in the end zone for a short touchdown pass. The Texans responded with Foster breaking off a 51-yard run to set up a field goal for Houston. Jacksonville quickly got the ball back and took advantage with a nice pass to Andre Johnson (4-17), and another run of about 20 from Foster. Fitzpatrick finished the drive by running into the end zone on a quarterback sweep. The Jaguars responded with a 3.point drive that was spurred by "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick. Poor Texans. They may not even get a look at Tom Savage to help them decide what to do at quarterback this offseason.    The Colts' 13th-straight home victory over the Texans gave Indianapolis the crown of the AFC South and ended the slim playoff hopes for Houston. Indianapolis' offense was held in check by Houston's defense, but the Texans' flaccid offense was unable to produce points as it lost Ryan Fitzpatrick in the first half and was already playing without Andre Johnson (concussion). This wasn't an impressive victory for the Colts, but they got the job done and were the first team in the AFC, along with the Patriots, to clinch a postseason berth.    After trading some punts, the Texans got on the board first when "

It was nice to see some effort from him, as he appeared to slack off throughout the 2014 season.    Speaking of Fitzpatrick, he performed well, outside of the pick. He went 15-of-24 for 179 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. It was odd to see so much life from him, but then again, he was playing the Browns. It helped that he got a bit lucky early on, somehow recovering a fumble from a horrible snap on his own 2-yard line while being flipped over. There were 4 Cleveland defenders around the ball, but Fitzpatrick somehow came up with it.    "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick from behind to get a strip-sack that was recovered by Dont'a Hightower. That set up Brady at the Jets' 19-yard line. A sack from Muhammed Wilkerson though forced the Patriots to settle for a field goal. New York answered with a drive into New England territory led by passes of 24 and 11 yards to Eric Decker. The drive stalled inside the 5. and the Jets settled for a field goal. They went on to open up a 10-3 lead as a 17-yard pass to Decker set up a short touchdown toss to Jeremy Kerley (3-27). The Patriots' offense finally got moving with a drive that started at midfield. A pass to Danny Amendola went for 23 yards did a lot of the distance, and after a few short gains, Brady scrambled to the Jets' 1-yard line with an 11-yard gain. He then dived into the end zone from a yard out on third down to tie the game at 10. New England got in position to take the lead with a 26-yard pass to Gronkowski. That set up a Patriot field goal for a 13-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Patriots got moving when Scott Chandler out-jumped Calvin Pryor for a 26-yard gain. A few more short throws moved the ball to the Jets' 6-yard line before the drive stalled and ended in another field goal. The Jets finally put together a nice drive after falling dormant in the middle of the game. They methodically moved the ball down the field before Chris Ivory made a nifty catch for a 9-yard touchdown pass. New York moved close to the end zone again, but Brandon Marshall dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick. "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick sustained torn ligaments in his thumb, knocking him out of most of the game in favor of Geno Smith. That didn't work out too well, as Smith made numerous mistakes. He fired an interception into double coverage, which was snatched by Charles Woodson. He later took a 5-yard loss on a third down late in the game by running out of bounds instead of throwing the ball away. Smith then took a terrible sack and didn't seem to know how to line the team up. He took a big hit, forcing Fitzpatrick to reenter the contest briefly, but Smith was able to return to make more mistakes. Smith went 27-of-42 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers are inflated because the Raiders let him have short completions in garbage time. Smith may not be any sort of downgrade over Fitzpatrick, but he's inconsistent, which could hurt going forward, since Fitzpatrick is set to miss some time. The Jets have reportedly already begun contacting some free-agent quarterbacks to replace Fitzpatrick.    "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick was efficient and took advantage of Jacksonville's weak cornerbacks to make enough big plays through the air. The Jaguars got a good game out of their young offensive play-makers of Blake Bortles, T.J. Yeldon, Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns, as they produced 436 yards of offense compared to 290 for New York. But 3 4.h-quarter turnovers led to Jacksonville's loss.    After starting with good field position, Bortles converted 1 third down with his feet and another with a screen to Yeldon for 21 yards. That led to a field goal for Jacksonville. New York got an excellent kick return from Antonio Cromartie to midfield. A screen to Zac Stacy converted a third-and-long and a back-shoulder throw to Eric Decker went for about 25 yards. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick found Decker wide open in the end zone to give New York a 7-3 lead. Promptly, Bortles had a deflected pass intercepted by "

Todd Bowles was impressive earlier in the season, but this is definitely a major downgrade for him, as he didn't make the switch to the healthier quarterback.    J.J. Watt dominated the Jets' offensive line, and DeAndre Hopkins destroyed the New York cornerbacks to lead Houston to maintain a tie for first place in the AFC South. The Texans' defense entered this game having not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters, the longest streak of any team in the NFL this season, and they were going against former teammate Ryan Fitzpatrick 9 days after surgery on his hand. They extended the streak to 12 quarters before the Jets scored a touchdown, but Houston's defense still locked down New York to lead the Texans to their third-straight victory and a 5-5 record.

New York started the game with a touchdown drive as a 19-yard run by Ryan Fitzpatrick and a completion to Brandon Marshall for about 15 yards were the key plays that moved the ball inside the 20-yard line."

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick and the offensive line couldn't handle the blitz at all. Fitzpatrick, seeing tons of pressure, was very inaccurate. It didn't help that fierce winds were blowing around his wobbly passes. Fitzpatrick didn't turn the ball over in the first half, but that changed as the game progressed. The Jets were in position to take the lead at the beginning of the 4.h quarter, but Fitzpatrick forced the issue into the end zone to a covered receiver. A field goal would've given New York a 1.point advantage, so the decision-making on Fitzpatrick's part was horrific. Fitzpatrick then threw interceptions on his next 2 possessions. The first occurred as he was getting hit, while the other came on a desperation heave that sealed the victory for the Bills. Fitzpatrick finished 16-of-37 for 181 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks. New York fans that had developed faith in Fitzpatrick had to be shocked by this result, given how well the bearded quarterback had been playing. However, Fitzpatrick was just repeating what he's done in the past; he has always enjoyed some nice stretches but then absolutely killed his team in the clutch. All Jets backers have to do is ask Bills fans about him. One final note on Fitzpatrick: He threw his 30th touchdown of the season in this game, breaking the Jets' single-season record. I'm astonished that New York's previous record, held by Vinny Testaverde, was just 29.    Fitzpatrick's scores went to Marshall (8-126) and "

The Browns, on the other hand, had nothing but pride to play for and their coach knew he was a dead man walking. It was also reported after the game that general manager Ray Farmer had been sacked. Add in the antics of Johnny Manziel, and you have a team with little hope to reach for.    The Steelers' defense is still a mess, but their offense can overcome when they're on, but over the last 2 weeks, they have not been sharp, and in the playoffs, they won't be facing the Browns.

That lead was the greatest by either team as it was a see-saw battle the rest of the game, with the Jets' defense getting to Andy Dalton all day. Sprinkled in between the tough Jets defense were some big splash plays from the Bengals. The biggest, and eventually most lopsided, matchup in this game was A.J. Green versus Darrelle Revis. The first big blow came in the second quarter when Andy Dalton hit Green on a deep post that he had beaten Revis on badly. He covered 54 yards on that touchdown to put the Bengals up 10-7.    The Jets moved the ball with Matt Forte as the primary back, and he was extremely consistent, gaining 96 yards on 22 carries, while adding 59 more yards on 5 catches. On those 27 touches, he put together 8 first downs. It is a large workload for the 30-year-old back, but he out-touched Bilal Powell by 21 and appears to be the true lead back. After Green's big touchdown, Fitzpatrick hit back with a 15-yard strike to Eric Decker to make it 13-10 mid-second quarter."

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick thought he was worth lots of money in the offseason? I member!    There is 1 stat that tells the entire story of this game. The Jets committed a ridiculous EIGHT turnovers, while the Chiefs only were guilty of 1. The Chiefs absolutely dominated the Jets, and it clearly showed that the Jets still have not solved their problems at quarterback. Ryan Fitzpatrick was absolutely dreadful for the Jets on Sunday. He played the worst game of his time with the Jets. The veteran quarterback was a turnover machine, and he just could not do anything right. He ended up throwing a career-high 6 interceptions and going 20-for-44 with only 188 passing yards. Of the 6 picks, there were 3 that were particularly harmful to the Jets. Two came off of tip drills in the end zone. On the first, Fitzpatrick never saw linebacker "

The Ravens, as it turned out, had way too many injuries to be competitive. And this includes the shoulder problem that apparently is really bothering Joe Flacco. Flacco didn't look right whatsoever.

He threw 2 interceptions; 1 pass was telegraphed, while the other was made because he heaved the ball off his back foot, prompting a high pass. Flacco actually seldom stepped into his passes in this contest. His mechanics were horrible, which might be a sign that he wasn't feeling well. Flacco finished 25-of-44 for 248 yards and those 2 picks. It wasn't all on him, as he didn't get much help from both his offensive line and receiving corps, missing stud guard Marshal Yanda and Steve Smith, respectively.    Only 3 Ravens accumulated more than 11 receiving yards: Mike Wallace (10-120), Kamar Aiken (3-55) and Dennis Pitta (4-40). Wallace caught a 53-yard bomb in the first half to set up a field goal.    The Jets have a strong run defense, so it's not surprise that Terrance West was limited to just 10 yards on 8 carries. West got banged up on the opening drive, so perhaps that had something to do with his limited production as well. Another factor is that he had a gain of about 50 wiped out by an Alex Lewis hold; Lewis was in the lineup because of Yanda's injury.    New York managed to run the ball much better than Baltimore. Matt Forte hadn't done anything since Week 2, but he hit the century mark in this contest, though he had 30 opportunities to do so. He also scored a touchdown.

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick fired a touchdown to take the lead. As mentioned, however, a penalty allowed Miami to score on a decisive kickoff return. It wasn't the first time that the Jets were guilty of a costly penalty, as it was actually a problem all afternoon. For example, Buster Skrine and Calvin Pryor were flagged for consecutive personal fouls on a first-half drive, which ultimately led to Ajayi's touchdown. Sheldon Richardson was called for unnecessary roughness on Miami's next drive. Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, was responsible for his own blunders. He missed "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick's fumble at the end to cover the spread. And yet, my heart nearly exploded when LeGarrette Blount ran down to the 1-yard line.    It seemed like the Jets had the advantage for most of this game. They were restricting the Patriots and were doing a great job of limiting mistakes on offense. Unfortunately for the Jets, they were unable to do enough to beat their opponents because of the efforts on the Patriots' penultimate offensive drive. On that possession, Tom Brady was nearly spotless. The team had to make lot of plays to get down the field, but Brady was able to pick apart the defense. The Jets had several coverage busts, and Brady delivered balls on the money that allowed the Patriots to move down the field. They scored a touchdown on a throw to Malcolm Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much. The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2.point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the 4.h quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. That can be chalked up to Brady's knee injury though. He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, Julian Edelman (8-83) led the way. Brady targeted him 11 times, and he was a beast over the middle of the field. He beat Darrelle Revis a couple of times and should get a boost if Gronkowski misses time. Martellus Bennett (3-22) left for some time with an injury as well, but he returned. He had a minimal impact on the outcome.    Elsewhere, Chris Hogan (4-70) looked solid and Malcolm Mitchell (5-42, 2 TD) looked like a star in the making. The rookie had been getting more involved in New England's attack in the previous weeks, but it now looks like he is becoming 1 of Brady's favorite targets. If Mitchell is available in your league, add him as soon as possible.    LeGarrette Blount put up some good numbers. However, going into the final drive, he had only 8 carries for 36 yards. He had a 23-yard burst on the last run of the game to pad his stats at 11 carries for 67 yards. Meanwhile, Dion Lewis got 10 touches and totaled 58 scrimmage yards. He looks healthier and as gets back into shape, he will steal some playing time from Blount.    For the Jets, this was certainly a disappointing loss. The team put together a very strong effort, but they could not do enough to take down the Patriots. It is hard to blame Ryan Fitzpatrick for the results of today's game. The veteran got the start, despite some cries for Bryce Petty, and actually played relatively well. Fitzpatrick went 22-of-32 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. He displayed excellent accuracy and touch on his passes, and was able to limit his mistakes. The most impressive throw of Fitzpatrick's day came on a touchdown pass to "

It's a bit puzzling why Hackenberg hasn't been given any regular-season snaps yet. The front office needs to find out what they have in him prior to the offseason. If Petty is hurt, starting Fitzpatrick would be a huge mistake.    New York's top player in this game was Bilal Powell, who had a huge performance. Powell didn't find the end zone, but he handled most of the workload despite "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick was picked off, thanks to Eric Rowe's perfect coverage on Brandon Marshall. The Patriots quickly scored after that, and it was suddenly 20-0. Just like that, the game was over.    The Patriots didn't need to be great offensively, and they weren't, but they still did enough to put the Jets away. Tom Brady finished 17-of-24 for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns. He did this in 3 quarters of action before taking the final 15 minutes off. Brady obviously didn't have the best game, but he did have plenty of time in the pocket, as the Jets had absolutely no pass rush.    Because New England didn't have to throw the ball very much, only 1 player accumulated more than 32 receiving yards. That was Edelman, who snatched 5 balls for 89 yards. As mentioned earlier, he should've drawn pass interference in the end zone. Malcolm Mitchell (3-29) disappointed his fantasy owners, failing to come up with an end-zone grab in the early going, while James White (3-32) and Martellus Bennett (2-19) caught Brady's touchdowns. White dropped a long gain.    LeGarrette Blount and Dion Lewis nearly split the workload evenly. Blount ended up with more carries than Lewis, 20-16, but only because the Patriots fed Blount while running out the clock. Lewis had more attempts in the opening half, 9-7. Lewis also outgained Blount, 52-50, but Blount scored twice.    As for the pathetic Jets, Petty was knocked out without completing a pass; he was 0-of-3 with a pick. As mentioned, the interception wasn't his fault, but it was still disappointing that the Jets couldn't use Christian Hackenberg once Petty left the game. Hackenberg was inactive for some strange reason, though perhaps it had to do with Todd Bowles' hospitalization. Bowles clearly didn't have all of his mental faculties intact when he made the decision to deactivate Hackenberg. Fitzpatrick played the rest of the way and was his usual, pedestrian self. Fitzpatrick's numbers were awful - 8-of-21 for 136 yards, 2 interceptions - but he should've thrown a touchdown, as Seferian-Jenkins had the aforementioned drop. If Petty can't play in Week 17, Hackenberg needs to start. There's absolutely no reason to keep trotting out a woeful, bearded quarterback with no future within the organization.    The Jets wanted to establish "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick's last game with the Jets, he put together a solid performance that many will look at when scouting backup quarterbacks this offseason. Fitzpatrick went 20-of-30 for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns. For the most part, he looked sharp and threw accurate passes. This is the type of performance that should be expected of him. If Fitzpatrick can limit his turnovers, he is a serviceable starter. It will be interesting to see where he lands in the offseason. Fitzpatrick spent a majority of the day targeting "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick. Winston, at 1 point in the second half, began warming up as if he were going to re-enter the game, but that never happened. I suppose that's a promising sign for next week, at the very least. As for Fitzpatrick, he did the best he could. He misfired just 10 times, going 22-of-32 for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The first was a poor throw, as he lobbed up a dumb floater into double coverage. The second occurred from the back of his own end zone, setting up Arizona with a touchdown the team didn't know it needed at the time.    "

   "comment":"Fitzpatrick didn't do much in this game prior to the final drive. He basically feasted on the short fields that Cutler and Parker provided for him. However, he did a great job of moving Tampa into field-goal range to win at the very end. Fitzpatrick went 22-of-37 for 275 yards and 2 touchdowns.    "
