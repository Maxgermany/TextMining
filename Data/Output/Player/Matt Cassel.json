   "comment":"Matt Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason. Cassel went 13-of-18 for 152 yards and a score. Before Patriots fans are relieved that they have a capable backup, 2 things should be noted: 1) The Chiefs didn't gameplan for Cassel and didn't know what to expect. Not that Herm Edwards is capable of gameplanning for anything... 2) Cassel was playing the Chiefs, arguably the worst team in the NFL that happens to maintain a young, but awful defense.    While Tom Brady and Matt Cassel shared stats, the same could be said for Laurence Maroney and Sammy Morris to the chagrin of Maroney's fantasy owners.Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason.

However, Cassel's 4 interceptions, all of which took place in the second half, absolutely killed the Chiefs. And speaking of Kansas City's self-destruction, Cassel somehow took a 7-yard sack on 4th-and-goal on Buffalo's 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter. I watched that play live and on replay, and I still don't know how something like that happened. Cassel finished 26-of-43 for 224 yards. His 5.2 YPA is something to be proud of; considering that he barely has the arm strength to complete 5-yard passes, any YPA greater than 5.0 is outstanding for him.

   "comment":"Matt Cassel threw short of the first-down marker on 3rd-and-3.    The Raiders had nothing going in the first half. Cassel threw short of the first-down marker on 3rd-and-3.    The Raiders had nothing going in the first half. Jason Campbell was 4-of-10 for 18 yards and an interception, while the team was getting killed in the yardage (169-49) and first-down (11-2) categories. But Campbell got his act together after intermission, finishing 19-of-33 for 229 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick.    The lightning-quick Jacoby Ford came out of nowhere to haul in 6 grabs for 148 yards. Darrius Heyward-Bey had no receptions.    Darren McFadden rushed for 89 yards on 17 carries, and also had 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. He just missed getting into the end zone; he had a run down to the 1-yard line.    Cassel, meanwhile, went 20-of-35 for 216 yards, 2 scores and a pick. He had some nice throws, but his limitations were really apparent late in the game when his poor arm strength prevented him from keeping drives alive. He will be the eventual downfall of the Chiefs... That is, if Todd Haley isn't. "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel. Cassel (9-of-18, 70 yards, 3 INTs) is not a legitimate starting quarterback in the NFL. He thrived this season because of all the horrific opponents he played, but as Simms said, Baltimore finally exposed Kansas City's flaw. Adding insult to injury, things won't be any better for Cassel next year with Charlie Weis headed to Florida.    You really have to wonder what happened to Charles (9-82, TD). He ran the ball just twice in the second half. One of those carries was the turning point of the game - down 10-7 early in the third quarter, Todd Haley opted to go for it on 4th-and-inches on Baltimore's 33. Charles was stuffed for a 4-yard loss, and didn't receive a single carry after that. Following that botched 4.h-down attempt, the Chiefs' offense had minus-23 yards of offense with 3 turnovers.

Well, they've already seen enough of Brady Quinn to cheer for Cassel's return. Quinn, who completed 2 of his 4 passes for a whopping 1 yard (and an interception, to boot), was knocked out with a possible concussion. This is the worst thing that could have happened to the Chiefs, as they had no chance of winning any games with Quinn at the helm. Cassel is more functional and has a better chance of ruining draft position. Cassel entered the game to an ovation and went on to go 20-of-30 for 218 yards, a touchdown (in garbage time) and an interception. He also showed some scrambling ability, picking up 35 yards on the ground on 7 carries. Cassel was infinitely better than Quinn could have been, but it didn't matter either way; the Chiefs continued to kill themselves with mistakes and poor play-calling. The errors were all costly. "

Cassel went 16-of-25 for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns. Those numbers look good, but again, Pittsburgh's slow defense was mostly responsible for that. Outside of those 2 long gains, Cassel had just 2 completions longer than 13 yards, and just 1 that went beyond 16. Having said that, I don't want to take away everything from Cassel because he did good job of avoiding turnovers.    I'm sure the Minnesota faithful was pleased to see "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel tossed a 4.h-quarter interception in the red zone, as the ball popped out of his hands and into Khaseem Greene's. Ellison then committed a face mask on Blair Walsh's successful field goal in overtime, though this was a dubious call. Walsh was pushed back 15 yards and consequently missed a long field goal. Unfortunately for the Vikings, they ultimately secured a meaningless, Pyrrhic victory. Robbie Gould, called the greatest kicker in NFL history by the FOX play-by-play announcer, whiffed on a 47-yard field goal. The Vikings took over and drove down the field, thanks to numerous Adrian Peterson tough runs. Walsh converted on his next attempt, clinching a win for his team.    Peterson was a beast. He exposed Chicago's horrid rush defense, gaining 211 yards on 35 carries. He also drew a crucial horse-collar tackle on a big gain in overtime. Peterson became the 28th running back in NFL history to eclipse 10,000 career rushing yards.    The Vikings might be starting another quarterback next week. Christian Ponder was a shaky 3-of-8 for 40 yards before leaving the game in the second quarter with a concussion. Matt Cassel stepped in and played pretty well, albeit against 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL. He went 20-of-33 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception that was Ellison's fault. Cassel's pocket presence was so much better than Ponder's; the latter took 3 sacks on his first 3 drives. Cassel, on the other hand, went down just twice through nearly 4 quarters of action.    You can bet that Cassel tossed a 4.h-quarter interception in the red zone, as the ball popped out of his hands and into Khaseem Greene's.

I'm not sure what that was about, but I guess it doesn't matter. In terms of fantasy, Taylor may have gone undrafted in your league. If so, pick him up. His rushing ability makes him a viable fantasy option - at the very least as a backup with upside.    Taylor was the big story in this game, but the primary reason the Bills prevailed was because of their dominant defense. Limiting Cassel or E.J.

   "comment":"Matt Cassel was getting his first start as a Cowboy, but the results weren't better than when Brandon Weeden was the starter. The difference in this game was Dallas committing 4 turnovers and the Giants playing mistake free football. New York's offense struggled to produce points, but the defense and special teams came through with the clutch plays to get them a much-needed win.    The Cowboys got the scoring started with a drive where they ran the ball down New York's throat, but the drive stalled and Dan Bailey hit a chip-shot field goal. In the second quarter, the Giants' offense got moving as Eli Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain. Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York.    Rueben Randle had 2 receptions for 68 yards. Odell Beckham Jr. had just 4 catches for 35 yards.    Matt Cassel was 17-of-27 for 227 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could have been worse as Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie dropped an interception early in the game that would have been a pick-six. "

He threw a horrible interception in his own territory that allowed the Cowboys to score. He was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions and was guilty of several other ugly throws, including a horrible pass behind Eric Decker on a crucial third down. He made some gutsy plays - he even opened a giant cut above his nose, which was bleeding for most of the evening, but he's just not a good quarterback. Fitzpatrick finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception, which was a terrible read. To be fair, he endured some drops, including what would've been a 30-yard gain by Brandon Marshall, and he managed to set up Randy Bullock for a game-winning field goal at the very end on a long pass to Kenbrell Thompkins, who beat rookie Byron Jones.    Fitzpatrick's sole aerial score went to Decker (6-55), while Brandon Marshall (4-74) led the team in receiving yardage. Both players missed some action and had to go to the locker room, but they weren't out for very long. Marshall, as mentioned, had a deep drop. Phil Simms claimed that the ball was uncatchable, yet it hit Marshall right in the hands. This, of course, was a conflict of interest, as Simms and Marshall are co-hosts on <i>Inside the NFL</i>. This was yet another example of Simms being absolutely incompetent. Another occasion was when Simms said that the Cowboys were in great hands with Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel behind Tony Romo.

With Marcus Mariota out for the Titans, this game resembled a preseason contest. However, the Texans needed to get some reps for inexperienced starter Tom Savage. That plan didn't work out, as Savage suffered a concussion on a quarterback sneak in the second quarter and forced Brock Osweiler into the game. With the injury to Savage, the Texans now have to figure out who they are going to start in the opening round of the playoffs next Saturday.

Midway through the first half, Savage converted a 4.h-and-1 on a quarterback sneak. The league's neurological monitors removed Savage from the game after that play, forcing him into the concussion protocol. Savage didn't act injured, but it brought Osweiler into the game for Houston. The Titans had a drive going into Houston territory before A.J.

On the first third down of the game, Mariota was pressured and overthrew Cassel leading a comeback for the Titans as the blowout was on. Houston's defense created 5 turnovers with a sack-fumble and 4 interceptions, returning 1 of the picks for a touchdown.    On the first third down of the game, Mariota was pressured and overthrew Delanie Walker with Texans safety Andre Hal making an acrobatic catch for an interception near the Tennessee 40. Watson then threaded a rope to Bruce Ellington (3-44) for 35 yards to the Titans' 5-yard line. From there, Lamar Miller finished the drive with a short touchdown run. On the next drive, Watson found Miller wide open in the flat, and Miller took off down the field for a gain of 27 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson threw a frozen rope to Hopkins a couple plays later for a short touchdown run and a 14-0 lead. Houston quickly got the ball back with Watson making clutch first-down completions. On the first play of the second quarter, he threw a bullet to Fuller for a 15-yard touchdown. The Titans' offense finally got moving with completions to Rishard Matthews and Delanie Walker, and some runs by DeMarco Murray. Mariota took off on a read-option run for a 34-yard touchdown run. Watson responded with a drive that produced a 50-yard field goal from Ka'imi Fairbairn. Mariota answered with a touchdown drive that was keyed by hitting Matthews for a 28-yard pass to set up a first-and-goal, and Mariota finished it with a short touchdown run. Chris Thompson returned the kickoff to midfield to set up Houston. Fuller had Adoree' Jackson burned for a touchdown, but a pass interference caused an incompletion. It did, however, set up a first-and-goal, leaving Watson to run in a read-option for a touchdown. Mariota then stared down a receiver, letting Hal make his second interception of the half. However, Watson had his 1 mistake of the of the game, throwing an interception to Kevin Byard to lose a scoring opportunity, but Houston was up 30-14 at the half. After the intermission, Watson continued to move the ball, using Hopkins for a few completions, including a 4.h-and-1 and a pass interference. The drive ended with Watson lofting in a 10-yard touchdown to Fuller to complete a drive that drained the game clock of 8 minutes. Shortly later, Watson threw his 4.h touchdown pass, via a short toss to Miller. Marcus Gilchrist then picked off Cassel to get into Tennessee territory for another field goal from Fairbairn. Afterward. Cassel promptly threw a pick-six to linebacker "
