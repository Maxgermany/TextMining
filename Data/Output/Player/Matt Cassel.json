   "comment":"Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason. Cassel went 13-of-18 for 152 yards and a score. Before Patriots fans are relieved that they have a capable backup, 2 things should be noted: 1) The Chiefs didn't gameplan for Cassel and didn't know what to expect. Not that Herm Edwards is capable of gameplanning for anything... 2) Cassel was playing the Chiefs, arguably the worst team in the NFL that happens to maintain a young, but awful defense.    While Tom Brady and Matt Cassel shared stats, the same could be said for "

   "comment":"Cassel, Kevin O'Connell nor Doug Flutie can help the Patriots score in the 30s every week - because that's what it's going to take to overcome the slow defense's ineptness. The Patriots may be 2-1, but they don't have much hope of making the playoffs.    Speaking of that poor stop unit, Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams combined for 211 yards and 4 rushing touchdowns. Brown, who worked out of the archaic single wing formation, also tossed a score to Anthony Fasano. Meanwhile, Chad Pennington misfired on only 3 passes. Fasano caught 3 balls for 66 yards and that score. Ted Ginn, meanwhile, had 5 receptions for 49 yards.    I wouldn't blame Matt Cassel for the loss too much. He did what he could; he moved the chains efficiently at times, but took too many sacks, namely from "

Cassel began the game 11-of-20 for 75 yards (a YPA of less than 4). He opened things up in the second half, but that's when he tossed both interceptions.    I will give Todd Haley credit for being aggressive. In the first quarter, he went for it on 4.h down and attempted an onside kick a few minutes later. Unfortunately, it's tough to be too aggressive with a quarterback with no arm strength.    "

   "comment":"Cassel took 4 sacks and tossed 4 picks. The Bills struggled to get into the end zone and this game was Kansas City's for the taking. However, Cassel's 4 interceptions, all of which took place in the second half, absolutely killed the Chiefs. And speaking of Kansas City's self-destruction, Cassel somehow took a 7-yard sack on 4th-and-goal on Buffalo's 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter. I watched that play live and on replay, and I still don't know how something like that happened. Cassel finished 26-of-43 for 224 yards. His 5.2 YPA is something to be proud of; considering that he barely has the arm strength to complete 5-yard passes, any YPA greater than 5.0 is outstanding for him.    The 1 bright spot for Kansas City's offense once again was "

But Campbell got his act together after intermission, finishing 19-of-33 for 229 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick.    The lightning-quick Jacoby Ford came out of nowhere to haul in 6 grabs for 148 yards. Darrius Heyward-Bey had no receptions.    Darren McFadden rushed for 89 yards on 17 carries, and also had 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. He just missed getting into the end zone; he had a run down to the 1-yard line.    Cassel, meanwhile, went 20-of-35 for 216 yards, 2 scores and a pick. He had some nice throws, but his limitations were really apparent late in the game when his poor arm strength prevented him from keeping drives alive. He will be the eventual downfall of the Chiefs... That is, if Todd Haley isn't. "

Cassel's pass protection has been sound for most of the year, but the offensive line surrendered 4 sacks, including 3 to Mario Haggan."

He thrived this season because of all the horrific opponents he played, but as Simms said, Baltimore finally exposed Kansas City's flaw. Adding insult to injury, things won't be any better for Cassel next year with Charlie Weis headed to Florida.    You really have to wonder what happened to Charles (9-82, TD). He ran the ball just twice in the second half. One of those carries was the turning point of the game - down 10-7 early in the third quarter, Todd Haley opted to go for it on 4th-and-inches on Baltimore's 33. Charles was stuffed for a 4-yard loss, and didn't receive a single carry after that. Following that botched 4.h-down attempt, the Chiefs' offense had minus-23 yards of offense with 3 turnovers. There was nearly a 4.h, but Cassel was saved by the tuck rule.    One more thing on the Chiefs: "

   "comment":"Cassel looked completely lost in those 2 contests, and the same could be said of him in this game. He went just 22-of-36 for 119 yards, 1 score and a pick. This means that in his previous 3 outings, Cassel is just 42-of-87, 304 yards, 1 touchdown and a whopping 6 interceptions. That's a 3.5 YPA. Time for Andrew Luck?

   "comment":"Cassel had yet another poor outing without Charlie Weis. He went 15-of-22 for 133 yards and 3 picks. That means he's 57-of-109, 437 yards, 1 touchdown and a whopping 9 interceptions in his last 4 games. Fortunately for Dwayne Bowe owners, he was able to salvage a solid day (5-101).    While the Chiefs struggled to get first downs, the Lions pretty much moved the ball at will. Matthew Stafford went 23-of-39 for 294 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. The disparity between the 2 quarterbacks was extremely evident, as Stafford completed a very similar pass that was a Cassel interception. The announcers ran with this, talking about windows for a good 10 minutes. I guess they can't be blamed because it was a blowout and they had nothing else to say.    Two of Stafford's scores went to "

   "comment":"Cassel was pretty erratic completing half his passes (15- for-30) for 161 yards and a pair of interceptions without a touchdown. Nine of those completions resulted in first downs, and overall, the visitors cashed in 7-of-15 third down attempts. After Oakland's defense held, the Raiders' offense quickly got to 3rd-and-1. Head coach Hue Jackson probably got too cute too early calling for rookie quarterback Terrelle Pryor's NFL debut on a trick play. He ran in motion, then quickly jumped under center, took the snap and ran for a first down. One problem though, Pryor needed to pause before accepting the ball. Ergo, they were backed up needed to throw. Reserve quarterback Kyle Boller, forced to start because newly acquired Carson Palmer was deemed not ready to go, threw a pass towards rookie Denarius Moore who was double covered. Kendrick Lewis intercepted the ball and returned it for a touchdown making it 7-0 Chiefs. Even after a 3.and-out drive, it was not time to panic yet for the Silver and Black. However, when Darren McFadden left with an injury (sprained right foot), it was looking like 1 of those days. Still, the defense forced a punt. Unfortunately, the offense eventually had to throw another pass. Boller found Brandon Flowers on the interception to set up Kansas City. He was looking for Moore again, this time on a deep ball and had linebacker Derrick Johnson in his face. The Chiefs got 2 key receptions each from Dwayne Bowe and Steve Breaston totaling 54 yards. Le'Ron McClain plunged in from a yard out and as the opening quarter came to a close, Kansas City led 14-0. The Raiders were apparently motivated to respond, and their offense got moving. Rookie running back Taiwan Jones kicked off the drive with a 14-yard run. The revitalized Darius Heyward-Bey caught a pass for another 14 yards, and Michael Bush rumbled down the middle for 35 more. Setting up camp at the Kansas City 5-yard line for first-and-goal, a touchdown seemed inevitable. Four Bush runs later, it was not to be. The final effort was from the Wildcat formation with Bush taking the snap in a shotgun formation. Punts dominated the rest of the second quarter. As time ran down, Boller got the offense going again on a drive that began on the 2-yard line. He connected on a 21- yard toss to Heyward-Bey, following it up with a scramble for 20 yards to the Kansas City 36. However, a deep ball to Heyward-Bey was intercepted by Brandon Carr, giving Boller the hat trick. Down 14-0 at the half, it appeared to be only a matter of time before Palmer was given his opportunity to lead the offense. However, Jackson stuck with Boller, who threw 3 incompletions to open the third quarter. The pressure was catching up to the Oakland defense, and 2 personal foul penalties catapulted Kansas City's offense down the field. Savvy runs from Jackie Battle (16 carries for 76 yards) surrounded those key mistakes, and Javier Arenas capped the march with a 7-yard touchdown run. At 21-0, there was no reason for Jackson not to turn to Palmer. Boller finished 7-for-14 passing with 61 yards and the 3 interceptions. On his first play, Palmer hit Heyward-Bey (5 receptions for 89 yards) for a gain of 18 and picked up another 15 thanks to a personal foul from Tamba Hali, who hit him low after the pass. One more first down was all they could muster however, and the absence of kicker Sebastian Janikowski was felt. He might have gotten them on the board with a long field goal. Instead the Raiders were forced to punt. After an exchange of punts, the Kansas City offense got going a bit, moving into Oakland territory until rookie DeMarcus Van Dyke intercepted Cassel. The Raiders countered by moving into Kansas City territory as the 4.h quarter began. Then Flowers put a stamp on any thoughts of a comeback by housing an interception of Palmer. "

The team confirmed that he couldn't attempt a pass because of this malady, and Cassel was seen leaving the stadium with his arm in a sling. His status for next week's Monday night tilt at New England is in doubt.    With Cassel struggling, his receivers obviously disappointed their fantasy owners. "

The second bounced off Bowe's chest and into Cary Williams' arms. - Bowe also committed an offensive pass interference penalty that wiped out a 25-yard gain in the 4.h quarter. Bowe, who only collects his yardage in garbage time, will be appearing in my next overrated players list. He had 6 catches for 60 yards in this game. - Bowe found the end zone on 1 instance, but that was negated by another offensive pass interference. - Flacco fumbled the ball late in the 4.h quarter, and the Chiefs recovered it and scored a touchdown. Except it never happened because the officials blew the play dead. Yeah, this isn't a Kansas City mistake, but it was amusing watching an ultra-nice Romeo Crennel refrain from lashing out at the refs in his post-game press conference.    Cassel suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. The crowd cheered when Cassel was on the ground, which drew the ire of right tackle "

Quinn, who completed 2 of his 4 passes for a whopping 1 yard (and an interception, to boot), was knocked out with a possible concussion. This is the worst thing that could have happened to the Chiefs, as they had no chance of winning any games with Quinn at the helm. Cassel is more functional and has a better chance of ruining draft position. Cassel entered the game to an ovation and went on to go 20-of-30 for 218 yards, a touchdown (in garbage time) and an interception. He also showed some scrambling ability, picking up 35 yards on the ground on 7 carries. Cassel was infinitely better than Quinn could have been, but it didn't matter either way; the Chiefs continued to kill themselves with mistakes and poor play-calling. The errors were all costly. "

   "comment":"Cassel tossed a 4.h-quarter interception in the red zone, as the ball popped out of his hands and into Khaseem Greene's. Ellison then committed a face mask on Blair Walsh's successful field goal in overtime, though this was a dubious call. Walsh was pushed back 15 yards and consequently missed a long field goal. Unfortunately for the Vikings, they ultimately secured a meaningless, Pyrrhic victory. Robbie Gould, called the greatest kicker in NFL history by the FOX play-by-play announcer, whiffed on a 47-yard field goal. The Vikings took over and drove down the field, thanks to numerous Adrian Peterson tough runs. Walsh converted on his next attempt, clinching a win for his team.    Peterson was a beast. He exposed Chicago's horrid rush defense, gaining 211 yards on 35 carries. He also drew a crucial horse-collar tackle on a big gain in overtime. Peterson became the 28th running back in NFL history to eclipse 10,000 career rushing yards.    The Vikings might be starting another quarterback next week. Christian Ponder was a shaky 3-of-8 for 40 yards before leaving the game in the second quarter with a concussion. Matt Cassel stepped in and played pretty well, albeit against 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL. He went 20-of-33 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception that was Ellison's fault. Cassel's pocket presence was so much better than Ponder's; the latter took 3 sacks on his first 3 drives. Cassel, on the other hand, went down just twice through nearly 4 quarters of action.    You can bet that "

   "comment":"Cassel or E.J. Manuel would have been, though it's maybe worth noting that Cassel actually started. He was under center on the opening play, while Taylor was split out wide. I'm not sure what that was about, but I guess it doesn't matter. In terms of fantasy, Taylor may have gone undrafted in your league. If so, pick him up. His rushing ability makes him a viable fantasy option - at the very least as a backup with upside.    Taylor was the big story in this game, but the primary reason the Bills prevailed was because of their dominant defense. Limiting "

   "comment":"Cassel was getting his first start as a Cowboy, but the results weren't better than when Brandon Weeden was the starter. The difference in this game was Dallas committing 4 turnovers and the Giants playing mistake free football. New York's offense struggled to produce points, but the defense and special teams came through with the clutch plays to get them a much-needed win.    The Cowboys got the scoring started with a drive where they ran the ball down New York's throat, but the drive stalled and Dan Bailey hit a chip-shot field goal. In the second quarter, the Giants' offense got moving as Eli Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain. Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to "

   "comment":"Cassel starting once again. Cassel struggled in his second start. He at least didn't commit a turnover this time - though he was close for what would've been a horrific front-door cover at the end - but aside from some timely scrambles, he simply didn't threaten Seattle's defense with his dinks and dunks. His stat line says it all. He went 13-of-25 for only 97 yards. That's a YPA of 3.88, which is just embarrassing. Somewhere out there, Brodie Croyle is laughing at such a horrible number. It's worth noting that Cassel picked up for 43 rushing yards on 4 running attempts. He showed a ton of emotion after 1 scamper in which he picked up a first down. Mobility and leadership are 2 traits Cassel possesses that Brandon Weeden doesn't, so he should continue to start. However, Dallas is going to continue to struggle until Romo returns. That will be in 3 weeks.    "

He was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions and was guilty of several other ugly throws, including a horrible pass behind Eric Decker on a crucial third down. He made some gutsy plays - he even opened a giant cut above his nose, which was bleeding for most of the evening, but he's just not a good quarterback. Fitzpatrick finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception, which was a terrible read. To be fair, he endured some drops, including what would've been a 30-yard gain by Brandon Marshall, and he managed to set up Randy Bullock for a game-winning field goal at the very end on a long pass to Kenbrell Thompkins, who beat rookie Byron Jones.    Fitzpatrick's sole aerial score went to Decker (6-55), while Brandon Marshall (4-74) led the team in receiving yardage. Both players missed some action and had to go to the locker room, but they weren't out for very long. Marshall, as mentioned, had a deep drop. Phil Simms claimed that the ball was uncatchable, yet it hit Marshall right in the hands. This, of course, was a conflict of interest, as Simms and Marshall are co-hosts on <i>Inside the NFL</i>. This was yet another example of Simms being absolutely incompetent. Another occasion was when Simms said that the Cowboys were in great hands with Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel behind Tony Romo. Simms needs to be dismissed from the CBS broadcast because he's absolutely horrible, bland and biased.    "

   "comment":"Cassel, it automatically forfeits a playoff spot, even if it sits some of its starters. Who outside Houston wouldn't agree with this?    This was a meaningless game for both teams. The Texans had key players like Jadeveon Clowney, Johnathan Joseph and Lamar Miller inactive, plus pulled their other defensive starters before long. With Marcus Mariota out for the Titans, this game resembled a preseason contest. However, the Texans needed to get some reps for inexperienced starter Tom Savage. That plan didn't work out, as Savage suffered a concussion on a quarterback sneak in the second quarter and forced Brock Osweiler into the game. With the injury to Savage, the Texans now have to figure out who they are going to start in the opening round of the playoffs next Saturday.    On Houston's first possession of the game, Savage was drilled by Sean Spence for a strip-sack. The ball rolled into the end zone before DaQuan Jones recovered the fumble for a Titans touchdown. Midway through the first half, Savage converted a 4.h-and-1 on a quarterback sneak. The league's neurological monitors removed Savage from the game after that play, forcing him into the concussion protocol. Savage didn't act injured, but it brought Osweiler into the game for Houston. The Titans had a drive going into Houston territory before A.J. Bouye deflected a pass in the air and Quintin Demps picked it off before returning it to the Texans' 40-yard line. Osweiler moved the chains a few times before Nick Novak missed a 45-yard field goal. The Titans got moving late in the half with a 25-yard pass to Rishard Matthews after Corey Moore fell down in coverage. A pass interference set up a first-and-goal, and Matt Cassel found Matthews open for a short touchdown. Savage came back into the game to take a knee to kill the clock before the half. The Titans took a 14-0 lead into the locker room. Curiously at halftime, Savage was ruled out with a concussion after being re-evaluated. Osweiler was able to engineer a drive in the third quarter with a 27-yard pass to "

   "comment":"Cassel leading a comeback for the Titans as the blowout was on. Houston's defense created 5 turnovers with a sack-fumble and 4 interceptions, returning 1 of the picks for a touchdown.    On the first third down of the game, Mariota was pressured and overthrew Delanie Walker with Texans safety Andre Hal making an acrobatic catch for an interception near the Tennessee 40. Watson then threaded a rope to Bruce Ellington (3-44) for 35 yards to the Titans' 5-yard line. From there, Lamar Miller finished the drive with a short touchdown run. On the next drive, Watson found Miller wide open in the flat, and Miller took off down the field for a gain of 27 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson threw a frozen rope to Hopkins a couple plays later for a short touchdown run and a 14-0 lead. Houston quickly got the ball back with Watson making clutch first-down completions. On the first play of the second quarter, he threw a bullet to Fuller for a 15-yard touchdown. The Titans' offense finally got moving with completions to Rishard Matthews and Delanie Walker, and some runs by DeMarco Murray. Mariota took off on a read-option run for a 34-yard touchdown run. Watson responded with a drive that produced a 50-yard field goal from Ka'imi Fairbairn. Mariota answered with a touchdown drive that was keyed by hitting Matthews for a 28-yard pass to set up a first-and-goal, and Mariota finished it with a short touchdown run. Chris Thompson returned the kickoff to midfield to set up Houston. Fuller had Adoree' Jackson burned for a touchdown, but a pass interference caused an incompletion. It did, however, set up a first-and-goal, leaving Watson to run in a read-option for a touchdown. Mariota then stared down a receiver, letting Hal make his second interception of the half. However, Watson had his 1 mistake of the of the game, throwing an interception to Kevin Byard to lose a scoring opportunity, but Houston was up 30-14 at the half. After the intermission, Watson continued to move the ball, using Hopkins for a few completions, including a 4.h-and-1 and a pass interference. The drive ended with Watson lofting in a 10-yard touchdown to Fuller to complete a drive that drained the game clock of 8 minutes. Shortly later, Watson threw his 4.h touchdown pass, via a short toss to Miller. Marcus Gilchrist then picked off Cassel to get into Tennessee territory for another field goal from Fairbairn. Afterward. Cassel promptly threw a pick-six to linebacker "
