   "comment":"Matt Cassel played relatively well compared to how abysmal he looked in the preseason. Cassel went 13-of-18 for 152 yards and a score. Before Patriots fans are relieved that they have a capable backup, 2 things should be noted: 1) The Chiefs didn't gameplan for Cassel and didn't know what to expect. Not that Herm Edwards is capable of gameplanning for anything... 2) Cassel was playing the Chiefs, arguably the worst team in the NFL that happens to maintain a young, but awful defense.    While Tom Brady and Matt Cassel shared stats, the same could be said for Laurence Maroney and Sammy Morris to the chagrin of Maroney's fantasy owners."

   "comment":"Matt Cassel, Kevin O'Connell nor Doug Flutie can help the Patriots score in the 30s every week - because that's what it's going to take to overcome the slow defense's ineptness. The Patriots may be 2-1, but they don't have much hope of making the playoffs.    Speaking of that poor stop unit, Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams combined for 211 yards and 4 rushing touchdowns. Brown, who worked out of the archaic single wing formation, also tossed a score to Anthony Fasano. Meanwhile, Chad Pennington misfired on only 3 passes. Fasano caught 3 balls for 66 yards and that score. Ted Ginn, meanwhile, had 5 receptions for 49 yards.    I wouldn't blame Matt Cassel for the loss too much. He did what he could; he moved the chains efficiently at times, but took too many sacks, namely from "

Still, he did a great job moving the chains against San Francisco's pathetic defense. Moss caught 5 balls for 111 yards and that score, while "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel took 4 sacks and tossed 4 picks. The Bills struggled to get into the end zone and this game was Kansas City's for the taking. However, Cassel's 4 interceptions, all of which took place in the second half, absolutely killed the Chiefs. And speaking of Kansas City's self-destruction, Cassel somehow took a 7-yard sack on 4th-and-goal on Buffalo's 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter. I watched that play live and on replay, and I still don't know how something like that happened. Cassel finished 26-of-43 for 224 yards. His 5.2 YPA is something to be proud of; considering that he barely has the arm strength to complete 5-yard passes, any YPA greater than 5.0 is outstanding for him.

   "comment":"Matt Cassel was pretty erratic completing half his passes (15- for-30) for 161 yards and a pair of interceptions without a touchdown. Nine of those completions resulted in first downs, and overall, the visitors cashed in 7-of-15 third down attempts. After Oakland's defense held, the Raiders' offense quickly got to 3rd-and-1. Head coach Hue Jackson probably got too cute too early calling for rookie quarterback "

He simply didn't have a chance because the Panthers were leading by double digits for most of this contest. Peterson did help his PPR owners out a bit with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards.    Matt Cassel was awful in this contest. The completion percentage and yardage look nice (32-of-44, 241 yards, TD), but most of his completions were checkdowns, and he looked completely fazed when having to deal with pressure. He also heaved 2 ugly interceptions. This is the Cassel we've come to know and love; not the impostor who played well in London. On the bright side, Josh Freeman will be ready in a couple of weeks. Oh wait, Freeman sucks, I forgot.    Cassel's lone score went to "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel tossed a 4.h-quarter interception in the red zone, as the ball popped out of his hands and into Khaseem Greene's. Ellison then committed a face mask on Blair Walsh's successful field goal in overtime, though this was a dubious call. Walsh was pushed back 15 yards and consequently missed a long field goal. Unfortunately for the Vikings, they ultimately secured a meaningless, Pyrrhic victory. Robbie Gould, called the greatest kicker in NFL history by the FOX play-by-play announcer, whiffed on a 47-yard field goal. The Vikings took over and drove down the field, thanks to numerous Adrian Peterson tough runs. Walsh converted on his next attempt, clinching a win for his team.    Peterson was a beast. He exposed Chicago's horrid rush defense, gaining 211 yards on 35 carries. He also drew a crucial horse-collar tackle on a big gain in overtime. Peterson became the 28th running back in NFL history to eclipse 10,000 career rushing yards.    The Vikings might be starting another quarterback next week. Christian Ponder was a shaky 3-of-8 for 40 yards before leaving the game in the second quarter with a concussion. Matt Cassel stepped in and played pretty well, albeit against 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL. He went 20-of-33 for 243 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception that was Ellison's fault. Cassel's pocket presence was so much better than Ponder's; the latter took 3 sacks on his first 3 drives. Cassel, on the other hand, went down just twice through nearly 4 quarters of action.    You can bet that "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel was getting his first start as a Cowboy, but the results weren't better than when Brandon Weeden was the starter. The difference in this game was Dallas committing 4 turnovers and the Giants playing mistake free football. New York's offense struggled to produce points, but the defense and special teams came through with the clutch plays to get them a much-needed win.    The Cowboys got the scoring started with a drive where they ran the ball down New York's throat, but the drive stalled and Dan Bailey hit a chip-shot field goal. In the second quarter, the Giants' offense got moving as Eli Manning hit Rueben Randle on the run for a 24-yard gain. Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York.    Rueben Randle had 2 receptions for 68 yards. Odell Beckham Jr. had just 4 catches for 35 yards.    Matt Cassel was 17-of-27 for 227 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could have been worse as Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie dropped an interception early in the game that would have been a pick-six. "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel starting once again. Cassel struggled in his second start. He at least didn't commit a turnover this time - though he was close for what would've been a horrific front-door cover at the end - but aside from some timely scrambles, he simply didn't threaten Seattle's defense with his dinks and dunks. His stat line says it all. He went 13-of-25 for only 97 yards. That's a YPA of 3.88, which is just embarrassing. Somewhere out there, Brodie Croyle is laughing at such a horrible number. It's worth noting that Cassel picked up for 43 rushing yards on 4 running attempts. He showed a ton of emotion after 1 scamper in which he picked up a first down. Mobility and leadership are 2 traits Cassel possesses that Brandon Weeden doesn't, so he should continue to start. However, Dallas is going to continue to struggle until Romo returns. That will be in 3 weeks.    "

   "comment":"Matt Cassel, it automatically forfeits a playoff spot, even if it sits some of its starters. Who outside Houston wouldn't agree with this?    This was a meaningless game for both teams. The Texans had key players like Jadeveon Clowney, Johnathan Joseph and Lamar Miller inactive, plus pulled their other defensive starters before long. With Marcus Mariota out for the Titans, this game resembled a preseason contest. However, the Texans needed to get some reps for inexperienced starter Tom Savage. That plan didn't work out, as Savage suffered a concussion on a quarterback sneak in the second quarter and forced Brock Osweiler into the game. With the injury to Savage, the Texans now have to figure out who they are going to start in the opening round of the playoffs next Saturday.    On Houston's first possession of the game, Savage was drilled by Sean Spence for a strip-sack. The ball rolled into the end zone before DaQuan Jones recovered the fumble for a Titans touchdown. Midway through the first half, Savage converted a 4.h-and-1 on a quarterback sneak. The league's neurological monitors removed Savage from the game after that play, forcing him into the concussion protocol. Savage didn't act injured, but it brought Osweiler into the game for Houston. The Titans had a drive going into Houston territory before A.J. Bouye deflected a pass in the air and Quintin Demps picked it off before returning it to the Texans' 40-yard line. Osweiler moved the chains a few times before Nick Novak missed a 45-yard field goal. The Titans got moving late in the half with a 25-yard pass to Rishard Matthews after Corey Moore fell down in coverage. A pass interference set up a first-and-goal, and Matt Cassel found Matthews open for a short touchdown. Savage came back into the game to take a knee to kill the clock before the half. The Titans took a 14-0 lead into the locker room. Curiously at halftime, Savage was ruled out with a concussion after being re-evaluated. Osweiler was able to engineer a drive in the third quarter with a 27-yard pass to "
