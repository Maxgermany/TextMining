   "comment":"Carpenter, whom many regarded as a third-round prospect. Oops! This was not a great <i>complete</i> game for Dalton (18-29, 168 yards, 2 TDs, 2 INTs), but it looked to be at first. He was 13-of-18 for 125 yards and 2 touchdowns by halftime, which means he was only 5-of-11 for 43 yards and a pair of picks after the break. Pete Carroll screwed up in so many things in this contest (including a called run deep in Cincinnati territory with only a few seconds remaining in the first half, which allowed the clock to expire), so I'll at least give him credit for making some nice second-half adjustments.    What you have to bash the Seattle coaching staff for is the handling of its quarterbacks, both during the offseason and the week leading up to this game. How Carroll thought he could win with "
