This was a tough loss for the Bucs as it ensured the team its third losing season in the last 4 years. Tampa Bay could also finish in last place in the NFC South for the third time in 4 years. At the end of his 4.h season, Freeman should not be this much of a work in progress. The Bucs need to bring in some legitimate starting quarterback competition during the offseason.

That would help explain why there was so much confusion in the Carolina secondary on the final drive, especially when Manuel targeted Johnson in the end zone for the final score.
