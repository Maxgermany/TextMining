He rushed for just 36 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts versus Detroit's porous defense.    As mentioned, Stafford tossed 5 picks. Otherwise, he was 22-of-42 for 203 yards and 2 touchdowns. Stafford made some impressive throws and led the Lions to 3 scoring drives to start the game, but he also made a dumb errors later on. Remember though that he's merely a rookie with no offensive line and was playing in a hostile Seattle environment. There's no need to panic.    An encouraging development for the Lions was the emergence of "

John Harbaugh considered challenging, but opted against it. Forsett was a bigger factor in the passing game - 4 catches, 16 receiving yards - but it was disappointing to see Pierce utilized much more. It should be noted that Pierce (1 catch, 7 rec. yards) also dropped a pass.    As for the Steelers, Roethlisberger went 22-of-37 for 217 yards and a garbage-time interception off a tip by "

   "comment":"Justin Forsett racked up nearly half of Baltimore's net yardage. Forsett gashed the Steelers for 150 yards on 27 carries. It wasn't very odd, despite Pittsburgh being usually pretty stout versus the rush. The team was missing Ryan Shazier, its top linebacker. He would've made a big difference in this contest, though the Ravens were missing a key role player of their own in left tackle Eugene Monroe. His absence was a huge reason why Flacco took 5 sacks - all from different players.    Of course, the big name who was out of this game was Ben Roethlisberger. It was encouraging to see him without crutches on the sidelines, but his backup will start the next several games. Pittsburgh's No. 2 quarterback was underwhelming, despite receiving an absurd amount of praise from the NFL Network analysts prior to kickoff. His stats were misleading. He finished 19-of-26 for 124 yards and a touchdown to go along with 9 scrambles on 33 rushing yards. That doesn't look too bad, but keep in mind that his YPA of 4.8 is on a Brodie Croyle-type level. He made a couple of nice throws and was able to pick up some first downs with his legs, but a few of his passes were way off the mark. He was nearly picked in overtime and was inaccurate on passes that could've moved the chains late in the game. He also took some awful sacks, including 1 to move his team out of field-goal range in the first half, though Josh Scobee probably would've just missed anyway. Pittsburgh's backup is not worth owning in any league. Despite Deion Sanders' incoherent ravings, he's not nearly the same athlete we once saw in Philadelphia or Atlanta. Already 1 of the most overrated players in NFL history, he's a shell of his former self, and if the Steelers opened things up for him, he would've made many more mistakes.    Given that the Steelers were using a reserve signal-caller, it's curious that Todd Haley shied away from "

   "comment":"Justin Forsett to an injury, but Fisher sucks.    If you didn't watch this game, well, I am very happy for you, because if you were rooting for the Rams, they lost, and looked pitiful for most of the game, and if you were backing the Ravens, well, they lost their 2 best offensive players, Joe Flacco and Justin Forsett, for the season.    The Rams' woes on offense continued, as Case Keenum, who got the nod ahead of Nick Foles due to the latter's complete ineptitude, was equally horrid. Keenum completed just 12-of-26 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 fumbles, 2 of which were lost. We, of course, knew he wasn't a starting-caliber quarterback, but this performance was downright awful at all times, and even more so against a Baltimore defense giving up an average of 288 yards passing and 2 passing touchdowns per game.    To add insult to horribleness, Keenum suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter, but the team either didn't notice or they also all had concussions they were dealing with. I actually think Jeff Fisher may just have a perpetual concussion. There's a decent chance we see 1 Mr. Nick Foles at the helm next week in Cincinnati.    The Ravens were slightly better on offense, but had similar results. Really, if you can say anything good about this win for the Ravens, well, you are the most optimistic person of all time.    Midway through the first quarter, Justin Forsett was slammed to the ground by defensive tackle "

   "comment":"Justin Forsett as their 2 primary running backs. Zenner (14-58) outgained Forsett (5-5) by a wide margin, and he also caught more passes (2) than Forsett (1) did. Forsett may not be on the roster very long.    Speaking of running backs, Todd Gurley didn't have the sort of performance that his owners were expecting prior to this matchup. Gurley gained just 58 yards on 14 carries, though he did catch 4 balls for 39 yards. Gurley was blown up in the backfield on a 4.h-and-1 try in the second quarter. Gurley's low workload may have been a byproduct of him walking off the field gingerly at 1 point in the opening half. He missed some action, but managed to return to the field. It's unclear if he was 100 percent.    I mentioned that Keenum missed on just 5 throws earlier. Take a look at his stat line: 27-of-32, 321 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, which was a horrible throw at the end to ruin the Rams' chances. But how does an overall stat line like that even happen? Detroit's banged-up defense got Ziggy Ansah back this week, and he managed to draw a false start at 1 point, but the back 7 continued to be brutal. DeAndre Levy needs to return for the Lions to play well defensively.    "
