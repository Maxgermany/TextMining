   "comment":"Wallace.    Pittsburgh looked great, but Cleveland really helped them clinch the AFC North by playing stupid football throughout the afternoon. On defense, they constantly left Steelers receivers wide open. On 1 play, the middle of the field was abandoned, allowing Roethlisberger to move the chains on a third down. Later, 2 players committed encroachment on a third-and-long, which led to a Pittsburgh touchdown. On offense, the Browns allowed the Steelers to beat McCoy into the ground. I'm not exaggerating when I say that McCoy (20-of-41, 209 yards, 1 TD, 3 INTs) was hit on almost every play. Meanwhile, Mohamed Massaquoi may have set the record for most unfinished routes in a single game.    Obviously hobbling, Peyton Hillis had just 6 carries for 13 yards. McCoy sadly led the team with 19 rushing yards.    As indicated, Roethlisberger had a great afternoon, going 15-of-22 for 280 yards and 2 scores. Rashard Mendenhall (14-36) also found the end zone twice.    Speaking of finding the end zone, Wallace (3-105), Heath Miller (4-55) and Hines Ward (5-45) all scored touchdowns."

A fake punt where punter Daniel Sepulveda threw a pass to defensive back Ryan Mundy went for 33 yards. That set the Steelers up at the 17-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to wide receiver Hines Ward. After a Titans punt, the Steelers had the ball at their own 9.yard line. Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. "

   "comment":"Wallace and Antonio Brown committed illegal procedure penalties. The defense, perhaps feeling the frustration of being shorthanded, were flagged for dual personal foul penalties during 1 of Philadelphia's 2 touchdown drives. One of the penalties would have almost certainly forced a punt because the Eagles would have been stuck with a third-and-long. Philadelphia's other scoring drive was amusing. The Eagles had a 4th-and-1 deep in their own territory at the beginning of the final quarter. Andy Reid inexplicably sent his players out to go for it. He then decided to challenge the prior play. As always when coaches attempt to review a spot, Reid was denied, costing him a precious timeout. Reid still decided to go for it, despite the pleas of Troy Aikman, and barely converted. Later on the drive, Reid asked for yet another useless timeout and went for it again on a 4th-and-1. Philadelphia somehow scored a touchdown out of this, but in typical Reid fashion, the team didn't have any stoppages at the end of the game to prevent the Steelers from running the clock out and kicking the decisive field goal.    Ben Roethlisberger won this matchup on his own. He went 21-of-37 for 207 yards, but was masterful on third downs. Big Ben should have had a touchdown added to his stats, but Antonio Brown dropped a ball in the end zone. Brown did catch 7 passes for 86 yards.    No other Steeler wideout did very much. Heath Miller (4-41) and Mike Wallace (2-17) both disappointed.    The Eagle receivers also struggled. "

   "comment":"Wallace lost a fumble in Baltimore territory. The Steelers did a good job of limiting the Ravens to a field goal on the ensuing possession. However, they would commit small infractions like a false start here or a hold to negate a nice gain there, but then they surrendered a punt return touchdown to Jacoby Jones. That was the ultimate back-breaker because Baltimore didn't score an offensive touchdown in this contest. After that, Pittsburgh continued with the blunders, missing tackles and getting whistled for a block in the back on a nice catch. On Baltimore's final drive, Larry Foote was called for tripping, and then 2 Steelers were whistled for an offsides infraction. They still forced a punt on the next play, but 40 precious seconds were able to tick off the clock. Pittsburgh still had a chance to win even with all of these errors, thanks to a heroic effort from its defense. Unfortunately, despite an impressive opening drive that featured a 42-yard pass interference penalty and an inexplicable 31-yard Byron Leftwich touchdown run, the Steelers were stagnant offensively all evening. Leftwich was particularly abysmal, going 18-of-39 for 201 yards, the rushing score and a horrible interception. The problem was some sort of injury that Leftwich incurred when he ran into the end zone. He was wincing after nearly every throw while grabbing his rib or shoulder. He consequently couldn't make all of the passes he's usually capable of; he had an alarming lack of arm strength, especially in the 4.h quarter. I have no idea what Mike Tomlin was thinking by not making the switch to Charlie Batch; Leftwich was clearly hurting his team, and it's not like there's any sort of dropoff between the 2 reserve signal-callers. Pittsburgh may have had a chance with Batch on the field, but that was hardly the case with a hobbled Leftwich.    With Leftwich unable to hit anything downfield, only 1 Steeler had more than 26 receiving yards. That would be Emmanuel Sanders, who recorded 3 catches for 82 yards. Wallace notched 4 grabs for 26 yards, but was guilty of that aforementioned fumble.    "

The Steelers took the lead early in the 4.h quarter with a touchdown pass to Antonio Brown (8-76). After a fumbled punt by Pittsburgh, the third tie of the game came on a short touchdown run by Murray (14-81). Both defenses came up with clutch stops late to force overtime. Dallas really had a good pass rush all day. Anthony Spencer had a tremendous game for the Cowboys with 1.5 sacks and a lot of pressure on Roethlisberger. In overtime, Brandon Carr maybe made the play of the year for the Cowboys when he undercut a pass to Wallace to make a diving interception. Carr jumped up and returned the interception 36 yards to the 1-yard line. That set up the game-winning field goal that was basically an extra point. Roethlisberger threw the pass too late and telegraphed the throw.    Romo completed 30-of-42 passes for 341 yards with 2 touchdowns. He made good decisions all game to take care of the football. "

Dolphins' safety Reshad Jones tracked it down like a punt and raced 25 yards into the end zone to tie the game.

Down by 3 with 2 minutes remaining, Miami had 1 more shot. On a 4.h-and-10 deep in his own territory, Tannehill dodged a sack and rolled out to loft in a beautiful 46-yard pass to Brandon Gibson (4-74). Tyson Clabo was beaten by Elvis Dumervil for a critical sack that made the final field goal attempt about 5 yards longer and Caleb Sturgis missed the 57-yarder.    Flacco finished 19-of-32 for 269 yards with zero touchdowns and a pick-six. Bernard Pierce (11-46) and Tandon Doss (3-58) contributed.    Tannehill was 21-of-40 for 307 yards with a score. Wallace, Clay and Hartline all had costly dropped passes. However, the offensive line was the biggest liability for the Dolphins as the team had only 22 yards rushing on the ground. "

Tyson Clabo was beaten by Elvis Dumervil for a critical sack that made the final field goal attempt about 5 yards longer and Caleb Sturgis missed the 57-yarder.    Flacco finished 19-of-32 for 269 yards with zero touchdowns and a pick-six. Bernard Pierce (11-46) and Tandon Doss (3-58) contributed.    Tannehill was 21-of-40 for 307 yards with a score. Wallace, Clay and Hartline all had costly dropped passes. However, the offensive line was the biggest liability for the Dolphins as the team had only 22 yards rushing on the ground. "

Marquice Cole was Johnny-on-the-spot to catch the ball and get his feet in bounds for the interception. A huge blown call by the officials really hurt the Dolphins. Jimmy Wilson had a strip-sack on Brady, but the officials ruled that Olivier Vernon slapped the ball forward. It was a terrible call as Vernon was trying to gain control of the ball. That took a big play away from Miami and gave New England 10 yards and a first down. Steven Ridley (14-79) ran the ball into the end zone a few plays later.

As was the case Monday night, the officials picked up the flag even though there was a blatant penalty on Luke Kuechly. Scott Green was the referee who screwed up this time. It's really amazing how things changed in the second half. Newton put together a brilliant final drive, going 5-of-7 for 34 yards and a touchdown along with an 8-yard scramble, highlighted by a Newton-to-Steve Smith conversion on 4.h-and-10. Newton finished 19-of-38 for 174 yards, 2 scores (1 passing, 1 rushing) and 51 yards on the ground on 8 carries. Meanwhile, Ryan Tannehill started to struggle following the break. He completed 16-of-23 attempts in the second half, but mustered only 107 yards in the process. He missed Wallace on 2 deep shots, but he can't get all of the blame; he heaved what should've been a long touchdown right into Wallace's hands, but the speedy receiver flat-out dropped the pass. Wallace finished with 5 grabs for 127 yards and a score, but that final drop cost his team a victory. The problem for the Dolphins is that they couldn't run the ball, so they weren't able to bleed the clock. Tannehill actually led the team in rushing yardage by a wide margin; he had 36 yards on 4 scrambles, while "

   "comment":"Wallace, who fumbled because of a massive hit by stud linebacker Jamie Collins. The second was an inaccurate downfield delivery from Ryan Tannehill, who was a bit off the mark in the opening half. The third was a Lamar Miller fumble. Miller screwed up later, stopping his route and causing an incompletion on third down. I wondered why Miller was being used instead of Knowshon Moreno at that moment. Joe Philbin and his staff apparently had the same thought. Moreno was used much more after that, as his 24 carries for 134 yards and a touchdown dwarfed Miller's 11 totes for 59 yards, though Miller did score on a receiving touchdown (4 catches, 19 yards) and had another score wiped out by a holding penalty. Moreno was awesome though. He simply wouldn't go down on some plays. Having him healthy is a huge boost for this offense.    Tannehill, meanwhile, went 18-of-32 for just 178 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. Tannehill was solid overall, but did have some accuracy issues. He also endured some drops, including 1 by Dion Sims in the end zone. Tannehill's 2 scores went to Miller and Mike Wallace, who finished with 7 grabs for 81 yards. If you're surprised that Wallace wasn't shut down by Revis Island, don't be; Bill Belichick used "

   "comment":"Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because Louis Delmas screwed up - but he broke up several passes intended for the league's best receiver.    Johnson wasn't the only Detroit receiver to eclipse the 100-yard barrier. Golden Tate was highly efficient, reeling in 11 of the 13 targets thrown in his direction for 109 yards. Tate made some key catches to move the chains.    The Lions didn't try to run the ball very much. Joique Bell mustered 44 yards on 10 carries, while Reggie Bush (4-20) hurt his ankle in the first half.    In addition to Bush, a couple of Detroit players got hurt. Stud guard Larry Warford was knocked out with a knee injury, and his absence didn't help an offensive line that couldn't block Cameron Wake. Safety James Ihedigbo also left the game, but was able to return.    Despite their slow start, the Dolphins held 2 separate leads in the second half. They held an advantage until there were 30 seconds remaining, and they easily could have prevailed. A horrible spot gave the Lions a first down, even after a review. Earlier, Charles Clay dropped a touchdown, and that conversion would've at least given Miami a chance to pull through in overtime. And even before that, Tannehill heaved a careless interception in the red zone. Being down by 1 would've made a difference; the Dolphins drove to their 40-yard line with 10 seconds left, so 1 long completion would have put them in position to try the game-winning kick. Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). "

   "comment":"Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. "

   "comment":"Wallace, but if it wasn't slightly underthrown, it would've gone for a score. Tom Brady had the same issue slightly later, failing to convert to Rob Gronkowski for a long touchdown. While Brady eventually got things under control, Tannehill continued to struggle. He was guilty of 2 interceptions into New England's talented secondary, and both turnovers led to New England touchdowns. The Dolphins actually had this at 14-13 at halftime, and they were outgaining the Patriots by about 170 yards. However, the Patriots broke free in the third quarter, outscoring Miami 24-0 in that frame. Before long, this was a complete blowout, as the Patriots preserved the No. 1 seed in the AFC.    Brady finished 21-of-35 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which came early when Jason Trusnik tipped and picked off a pass. Brady was on fire in the second half, going 13-of-20 for 205 yards and a pair of scores following intermission. Brady had some awesome throws, fitting in a tight ball to Gronkowski for a touchdown. He also sprinted for a 17-yard scamper on a third-and-11, which featured a pump fake that caused a Miami player to bite.    Brady endured some drops, 1 of which came from Julian Edelman. However, the speedy slot receiver more than made up for it with 7 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown. He trailed only Gronkowski in receiving, as the monstrous tight end generated 96 yards on just 3 receptions.    Elsewhere for the Patriots, Brandon LaFell registered 6 catches for 66 yards. I'm giving him his own entry to highlight a blunder by Dolphins' head coach Joe Philbin. The ball hit the ground on LaFell's 19-yard reception, but Philbin didn't even bother challenging. The 2 CBS announcers were clamoring for Philbin to throw the red flag, but he didn't even seem like he was aware that it was a close play that should be looked at. This was significant because the Patriots ultimately scored on that drive.    The Patriots ran well against the Dolphins, who were missing 2 starting linebackers. Jonas Gray saw the most work, though that came following intermission. He gained 62 yards on 11 carries. LeGarrette Blount (8-17) didn't find as much room, but he scored a touchdown. Shane Vereen did as well, though he mustered just 5 yards on 6 attempts.    Meanwhile, Tannehill was all over the place. He opened with the aforementioned 50-yard bomb to Wallace that was underthrown. He had a high pass that was picked off. He was almost intercepted again later, but "

   "comment":"Wallace, who caught the ball off a deflection and dived into the end zone for a 16-yard grab. Overall though, Tannehill was unstoppable. The Vikings just had no answer for him, so this has to be very encouraging for Miami going forward.    Tannehill was great at the end of the game, but Lamar Miller was the 1 who sparked the offense with some great runs. He gained 92 yards and a touchdown on just 19 carries, and he also contributed in the passing attack, snatching 5 balls for 58 receiving yards. Miller had been struggling lately because of a nagging injury, but he looked completely healthy in this contest.    I mentioned that Wallace had an awesome touchdown catch. He actually found the end zone twice, as he and Tannehill actually had some great chemistry with each other. He hauled in all 5 of his targets for 58 yards in addition to the scores. Charles Clay (6-114) led the team in receiving, while "

The errant pass to Wallace was the only 1 the speedy wideout saw, as he wasn't targeted for the rest of the afternoon. The reason was because he was benched for quitting on the team, telling Philbin that he no longer wanted to be on the field. "

I received an e-mail from someone who suggested that this was 1 of the most fixed games of the year. I could get behind that, as Walt Coleman was either very incompetent or corrupt. It seemed like the Vikings were flagged for offensive holding on almost every drive. There were also bogus defensive holding calls, and on 1 instance, Datone Jones somehow wasn't flagged for spiking the ball right after sacking Bridgewater. All of the major penalties went against the Vikings, who never had a chance with such biased officiating. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Wallace. Meanwhile, the other receivers aren't helping Rodgers. Cobb (6-74) continues to underwhelm, while Jones, who couldn't reel in any of his 6 targets, looks like he's running in slow motion. I didn't think Green Bay would miss Jordy Nelson when he went down in the preseason, given that Rodgers has gotten the most out of pedestrian talents before, but I think most Packer fans would kill to have him back in the lineup right now.    Getting to the numbers, Rodgers went 22-of-43 for only 202 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick to go along with 33 rushing yards on 4 scrambles. I counted at least half-a-dozen drops, 2 of which could've been scores, so Rodgers should've had a much bigger game. Then again, Rodgers nearly threw an interception, but the defender dropped the ball in the end zone in the second quarter. There was also a scary moment where Rodgers appeared to hurt his hand while recovering a botched snap. However, he didn't miss any time. Cris Collinsworth speculated that Rodgers simply banged his funny bone.    The Packers ran very well on the Bears. Lacy gained 105 yards on 17 carries, but was benched for a few drives because of his early fumble. Lacy, however, was given 7 carries following intermission. "

The Redskins got on the scoreboard as Jamison Crowder ripped off an 85-yard punt return for a score, but Washington missed the extra point. Baltimore soon added a field-goal drive, with the big playing being a 26-yard pass interference on linebacker Will Compton. The Ravens were set up for more points when Zach Orr caused and recovered a fumble from Matt Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the 4.h quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over "

   "comment":"Wallace for the team's lone touchdown. Flacco was again ineffective, and now on the season, he has completed 73-of-118 passes for 601 yards, 4 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. The hope is that Flacco started slow due to his back problems in training camp, but 4 games in, he has yet to show that he's up to the task.    Roethlisberger hasn't been as bad as Flacco, but he hasn't been great by any stretch of the imagination. Roethlisberger's road woes have continued this season, and if Bell hadn't been on Sunday, Roethlisberger's numbers would not have you assuming the Steelers won this game. He finished by completing 18-of-30 passes for 216 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. The pick wasn't on Roethlisberger, and he did make a nice touchdown pass to rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster, but overall, it was a game manager type of showing, which will do, as the Steelers took an important game from their division rival inside that rival's home stadium.    The Ravens did get a spark from running back Alex Collins, who rushed for 82 yards on 9 carries, but also fumbled, which led to Steeler points. Collins started ahead of Terrance West and Buck Allen, but Allen did handle the majority of the passing-game work. We'll see if Collins can retain the slight edge as the starter after being benched for a while after his fumble. Thankfully for him, he made a nice 50-yard run after the fumble, which could keep him from a true demotion, especially since Terrance West lost yardage on his 4 carries.    Antonio Brown had his worst statistical game, as he caught just 4-of-9 targets for 34 yards. The Ravens weren't going to let Brown beat them, so it all turned to Bell as the offense took the easier road. Brown has had trouble in Baltimore just like the whole team, so this isn't a shocking result. He'll continue to pace the league in yards and receptions.    Baltimore's top receiver was Mike Wallace, who led the team in targets, receptions and yards to go along with his touchdown. He also dropped what would have been a long touchdown pass. Not much went right for Baltimore this week.    Next week, the Ravens will head to Oakland, where they should have a bit more luck offensively, but we can't count on that with the way Flacco has played of late. The Steelers will take on another tough defense as they host the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they will be home, where they usually play much better. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Wallace to lead to a road victory. The Ravens' offensive line played much better than it had in recent weeks, and the Raiders' offense was unable to keep up because Derek Carr was sidelined by his back injury. Later this season, this could be a very significant win for the Ravens to get a tiebreaker over Oakland because this is a conference victory. Conversely, the Raiders have to hope they can get Carr back soon, as it will be very hard for them to win without him. Oakland's defense is just not good enough to carry the team to wins.    On the first drive of the game, Flacco aired out a bomb to Wallace for a 52-yard completion. The Ravens got into the end zone a few plays later on a jet sweep run by wideout "

   "comment":"Wallace left the game on a dirty hit by safety Andrew Sendejo in the opening quarter. The Ravens were granted a first down on the penalty, which helped set up a field goal, but the injury was much more consequential, as Flacco didn't have a legitimate wide receiver to throw to in Wallace's absence. Some poor pass protection didn't help matters either. The Vikings accumulated 5 sacks, with "

This put Baltimore up 13-0, which put the game out of reach for the struggling Packers.    Flacco misfired on just 6 passes, going 22-of-28 for 183 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned interception. Flacco didn't take too many chances, but it's not like he needed to. With a lead throughout the afternoon, Flacco never had to press, which was a good thing considering that he was missing left tackle Ronnie Stanley.    Wallace led the Ravens with 56 receiving yards on 4 catches with a touchdown. "
