The Jets then waved the white flag on the next possession, punting on 4.h-and-short despite being down 2 possessions with about 4 minutes remaining. It was 1 of several curious decisions Todd Bowles made this afternoon.    Tyrod Taylor finished 16-of-28 for 224 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which, as discussed, wasn't his fault. Taylor also did some work on the ground, dashing for 38 yards on 8 scrambles. Taylor was awful in the preseason, but he had a nice performance in his 2017 debut. Before anyone gets too excited, however, Taylor threw against the worst team I've ever covered, so I wouldn't expect him to maintain this level of production.    LeSean McCoy had a scare in this game when he hurt his hand on a run down to the 1-yard line. He left the game, allowing Mike Tolbert to vulture a touchdown. McCoy returned on the next drive, so everything is OK. McCoy looked great, gaining 110 yards on 22 carries and also catching 5 balls for 49 receiving yards. McCoy was as outstanding as those numbers indicate, and he even juked Jamal Adams out of his cleats in the early going on a 21-yard catch-and-run play.    Despite his blunders, Clay had a nice stat line, registering 4 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. He trailed only Jordan Matthews (2-61), who did most of his work on 1 47-yard reception. The big catch (47 yards) was a nice play by Taylor, as he escaped some pressure and kept his eyes downfield. Meanwhile, Zay Jones converted only 1 of his 4 targets for 21 yards. He was a big disappointment.    Moving on to the Jets, Josh McCown finished with a nice completion percentage (26-of-39), but only because he dinked and dunked on almost every throw. He didn't have much of a choice because of poor protection, but I'd still describe him as Sam Bradford on crack. His 39 attempts went for 187 yards, which gave him a YPA of 4.79. To put that in perspective, McCoy averaged more yards per carry than McCown did per throw! McCown tossed 2 interceptions, but neither was really his fault. The first, which I discussed already, was a great play by Poyer. The second was a desperation heave in the final minutes.    I mentioned some questionable decisions made by Bowles. I'd say not involving "
