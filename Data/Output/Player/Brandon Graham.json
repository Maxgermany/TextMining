   "comment":"Graham was able to abuse Morgan Moses during the contest, and Cousins was constantly under pressure. The Redskins have to fix their problems in pass protection if they want to succeed this season.    Pryor was the most notable Washington receiver during the day. Pryor (6-66) made some nice catches, but he also had a couple of bad drops. One aforementioned 1 came on a play that was called back, but Pryor also dropped a wide-open catch for a first down. Pryor needs to continue to improve his catching ability. If he does, he will be a real weapon for the Redskins. The other top receivers for the Redskins, Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder, disappointed. Doctson barely saw the field, and it looks like Ryan Grant (4-61) will take his spot as a starter. Meanwhile, Crowder only caught 3 passes for 14 yards and wasn't able to get open much. He also fumbled a punt that led to Eagles points, so it was a forgettable day for him. If you can buy low on Crowder, now would be the time to do it.    The running game was not a strength for the Redskins. Rob Kelley totaled 30 yards on 10 carries. He looked a bit sluggish and not quite the bruiser that he was last year. Cousins totaled the same number of rushing yards on just 4 scrambles. Chris Thompson was the best of the group, but he did most of his damage in the receiving department (4-52, 1 TD).    Defensively, new Redskins start Zach Brown had a great performance. He recorded 12 tackles and nearly had a sack. He looks like a great fit in Greg Manusky's defense. Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith also combined for 1.5 sacks, and they look to be a strong starting duo for the team.    For the Eagles, this was an encouraging performance. There has been a lot of hype around the team this offseason, and it looks like it was warranted. Carson Wentz and the offense were able to get going early on. On the second pass of the game, Wentz had a Fran Tarkenton-like scramble around the pocket to avoid multiple Redskins defenders before finding an open Nelson Agholor for a 58-yard touchdown. That 1 play was a microcosm of Wentz's performance on Sunday. Wentz's mobility allowed him to move around the pocket easily and find open receivers. Wentz was very accurate on most of his throws, and he was able to make clutch completions in third-and-long scenarios. His downfield accuracy was very good, and that should bode well for the Eagles moving forward. Wentz's 1 issue was that he overthrew Agholor on a few different occasions. On 3 passes, Agholor had to reach up to try to knock a ball down to himself, and each time, he was mostly wide open. One of Wentz's biggest mistakes came on a backward pass to Agholor that was too high. Agholor dropped it, and the Redskins recovered the fumble. Overall, Wentz went 26-for-39, totaling 307 yards, 2 touchdowns, and throwing an interception. This is an impressive stat line, and he is definitely improving with each game. Wentz will soon be a top-10 quarterback in the NFL.    Wentz's favorite receiver was unsurprisingly tight end Zach Ertz. Last season, the 2 developed a strong rapport, and it carried over to this opener. Ertz caught all 8 of his targets for 93 yards and had many key first-down catches. Ertz is a smooth route runner, and he is definitely a TE1 in fantasy this season. Wentz's other top receivers were Nelson Agholor (6-86, 1 TD) and Alshon Jeffery (3-38). Agholor was very impressive and tied for the team lead with 8 targets. He would have done better had Wentz not overthrown him on a couple of occasions. Agholor looks fast, athletic and explosive. He is worth adding in all fantasy formats, as it appears that he and Wentz have developed a good relationship. Meanwhile, Jeffery had a mildly disappointing performance, but he was facing Josh Norman for a good chunk of game. Jeffery will bounce back, and will be a high-end WR2 in fantasy this season.    The running game for the Eagles was dominated by LeGarrette Blount. He received 14 carries for 46 yards, plus caught a touchdown. Blount is merely a power back who can run over weaker opponents. He is not an explosive play-maker. He, Darren Sproles and Wendell Smallwood will continue to fight for carries, and I would expect Smallwood to get a chance to be the top back at some point this season.    Defensively, Brandon Graham was a force on Philadelphia's defensive line, and he looked terrific. Graham totaled 2 sacks, and he will continue to be a major weapon. Elsewhere, the team's top cornerback "
