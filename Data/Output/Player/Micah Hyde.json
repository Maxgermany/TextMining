Bridgewater had a drive going in the third quarter, but missed a few opportunities for big plays on some inaccurate and dropped passes. Minnesota still turned the possession into points with a 51-yard field goal from Blair Walsh. The Packers answered with a 48-yard field goal from Mason Crosby. In the 4.h quarter, Rodgers came up with a critical drive featuring a clutch run of 18 yards on a third down. A nice run by Lacy set up a 10-yard touchdown pass to the power back. Bridgewater had an impressive response to lead a long drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Greg Jennings (4-38) and a 2.point conversion to Charles Johnson. The Packers got the ball with 3.and-a-half minutes on the clock, but the Vikings' defense couldn't stop Lacy as he rolled up a few first downs to run out the clock for Green Bay.    Rodgers finished completing 19-of-29 passes for 209 yards with 2 scores. Lacy was the leader for the Green Bay offense, as he ran for 125 yards on 25 carries with 2 receptions for 13 yards. Jordy Nelson chipped in 68 yards on 8 catches.    Bridgewater was 21-of-37 for 210 yards with 2 scores and an interception. He also ran for 32 yards on 5 carries. Kyle Rudolph came back from injury and contributed 3 receptions for 50 yards.    Bridgewater got zero help from his offensive line, as Minnesota's front was atrocious.

   "comment":"Micah Hyde picked off the deflection. On the first play of the third quarter, Hyde picked off the deflection. On the first play of the third quarter, Julius Peppers burned Charles Leno Jr. for a blind-side strip-sack of Barkley. Peppers recovered the ball to set up the Packers inside the Bears' 20-yard line. Davante Adams had his second dropped touchdown of the game though, and Rodgers was tackled at the 1-yard line on third-and-goal to force a field goal. Green Bay's defense continued to get the job done, with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix picking off Barkley to set up the Packers near midfield. A chunk completion to Adams and then a 26-yard run by Montgomery moved the ball to the 1-yard line before Montgomery plunged into the end zone. Clinton-Dix quickly picked off Barkley again, as wideout Daniel Braverman screwed up by quitting on the route. A few plays later, Christine Michael (4-45-1) broke down the field for a 42-yard touchdown run. Down 27-10, the Bears got back into the game, as Barkley started connecting with Alshon Jeffery (6-89-1) with 3 completions for 58 yards, including an 8-yard strike for 6. Barkley and Jeffery connected some more to set up a 9-yard touchdown run by Jordan Howard. Late in the 4.h quarter, Barkley made another drive deep into Green Bay territory, but on third-and-goal, Hyde made a tremendous diving breakup to force a game-tying field goal. With under a minute remaining on a third-and-long, Rodgers hit a 60-yard bomb to Jordy Nelson, who somehow got behind the Bears' coverage. On the final play of the game, "

   "comment":"Micah Hyde snatched. His second pick bounced off the hands of someone named Nick Williams, who wouldn't have been on the field had Jones and Sanu been available.    With Jones (3-30) and Sanu (1-3) barely seeing any playing time, Tevin Coleman led the Falcons in receiving with 4 grabs for 65 receiving yards, followed by Austin Hooper (5-50). Hooper paced the Falcons with 7 targets.    Coleman also led the Falcons in rushing with 79 yards on just 9 carries. Devonta Freeman had double the attempts, but mustered only 58 yards. He did find the end zone, however.    As for the Bills, I don't want to take credit away from them just because the Falcons lost after Jones and Sanu left the game. They should be praised for the victory, as they had a terrific game plan prepared for an Atlanta defense that had absolutely no answer for Charles Clay. The Bills made sure to get the ball to Clay early and often, as he had a huge mismatch versus the mediocre Atlanta linebackers. Clay had a monstrous stat line, catching 5 balls for 112 yards. His numbers would've been even better had he not dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Clay accounted for more than half of Tyrod Taylor's passing yardage. Taylor went 12-of-20 for 182 yards and a touchdown to Jordan Matthews (2-10). Taylor didn't get much going on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 12 rushing yards.    LeSean McCoy eclipsed 100 total yards from scrimmage in this contest. He struggled to find running room - 20 carries, 76 rushing yards - but he also caught 3 balls for 32 yards. McCoy and Clay were the only Buffalo players to generate more than 18 receiving yards, and this includes Zay Jones, who had 1 grab for that exact amount.    Bills edge rusher Eddie Yarbrough needs to be highlighted. Shaq Lawson missed this game, but it didn't matter because Yarbrough was so dominant. He didn't log a sack, but he had tons of pressures. Micah Hyde secured 2 interceptions.   Hyde snatched. His second pick bounced off the hands of someone named Nick Williams, who wouldn't have been on the field had Jones and Sanu been available.
