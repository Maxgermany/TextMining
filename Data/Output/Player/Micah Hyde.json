   "comment":"Micah Hyde snatched. His second pick bounced off the hands of someone named Nick Williams, who wouldn't have been on the field had Jones and Sanu been available.    With Jones (3-30) and Sanu (1-3) barely seeing any playing time, Tevin Coleman led the Falcons in receiving with 4 grabs for 65 receiving yards, followed by Austin Hooper (5-50). Hooper paced the Falcons with 7 targets.    Coleman also led the Falcons in rushing with 79 yards on just 9 carries. Devonta Freeman had double the attempts, but mustered only 58 yards. He did find the end zone, however.    As for the Bills, I don't want to take credit away from them just because the Falcons lost after Jones and Sanu left the game. They should be praised for the victory, as they had a terrific game plan prepared for an Atlanta defense that had absolutely no answer for Charles Clay. The Bills made sure to get the ball to Clay early and often, as he had a huge mismatch versus the mediocre Atlanta linebackers. Clay had a monstrous stat line, catching 5 balls for 112 yards. His numbers would've been even better had he not dropped a pass in the first quarter.    Clay accounted for more than half of Tyrod Taylor's passing yardage. Taylor went 12-of-20 for 182 yards and a touchdown to Jordan Matthews (2-10). Taylor didn't get much going on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 12 rushing yards.    LeSean McCoy eclipsed 100 total yards from scrimmage in this contest. He struggled to find running room - 20 carries, 76 rushing yards - but he also caught 3 balls for 32 yards. McCoy and Clay were the only Buffalo players to generate more than 18 receiving yards, and this includes Zay Jones, who had 1 grab for that exact amount.    Bills edge rusher Eddie Yarbrough needs to be highlighted. Shaq Lawson missed this game, but it didn't matter because Yarbrough was so dominant. He didn't log a sack, but he had tons of pressures. Micah Hyde secured 2 interceptions.   "
