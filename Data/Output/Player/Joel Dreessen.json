   "comment":"Joel Dreessen the play prior to Kubiak's blunderous call. Schaub had Dreessen open in the back of the end zone, but overthrew him. Dreessen caught the ball, but could only get 1 foot inbounds.    Andre Johnson caught 8 balls for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns. Owen Daniels also had 8 grabs for 94 yards. Kevin Walter notched 4 receptions for 37 yards.    As many predicted, Steve Slaton didn't have much running room to work with. He had 39 yards on 13 carries. Slaton saved his fantasy owners with 6 receptions for 59 more yards.    As for the Cardinals, "
