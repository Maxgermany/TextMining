   "comment":"Joel Dreessen wide open for a 56-yard touchdown, taking advantage of linebacker Rolando McClain missing coverage.Dreessen wide open for a 56-yard touchdown, taking advantage of linebacker Rolando McClain missing coverage. It appeared McClain was running gingerly and suffering from some sort of injury. At 14-6, with a huge advantage in total yards, and the crowd behind them and things were going very smoothly early in the second quarter for the home team. Two punts on each side later, Oakland's offense woke up starting on their own 25 at the 2.minute warning. Campbell hit Darrius Heyward-Bey for 18 yards twice and then for 34 yards and a touchdown on an eye-popping drive. Heyward-Bey, 1 of the picks Al Davis was criticized heavily for making because Texas Tech's more-heralded Michael Crabtree was on the board, finished with 7 receptions for 99 yards and that score. A missed 2.point conversion left Houston ahead 14-12, which remained the score at halftime.    At the break, the Raiders had an opportunity to take advantage of Mario Williams, who left the game in the first quarter, being out of the lineup. Rookie Brooks Reed did not do a bad job stepping in, but the front 7 was not nearly as effective the rest of the way. On the other hand, Oakland's front made Schaub uneasy. He was only sacked 3 times, but looked out of it at times, and was an erratic 24-for-51, with the aforementioned tipped passes a huge problem.    After a punt from each side to start the second half, Houston found a way to involve Foster. He took a screen 60 yards and would finish with a game-high 116 yards receiving on 5 catches. Needless to say, Andre Johnson was missed, but 4 Texans had at least 81 yards receiving. The drive immediately stalled, and it was wasted when Neil Rackers missed from 41 yards out. Oakland answered with a scrappy drive for another long field goal and suddenly took the lead 15-14. Houston responded by hitting Kevin Walter for 41 yards on the first play of their drive. A few Foster runs mashed up with incompletions, set up a long field goal, and Rackers converted from 54 yards out to put the Texans back ahead 17-15. Speed was something Al Davis loved, and Jacoby Ford displayed some of it, returning the subsequent kickoff to the 39. Darren McFadden finally made his presence felt running for 8, 14 and 20 yards on consecutive plays to put them in the red zone. Forced to third down, Campbell was ready to run for it when he spotted oft-injured wide receiver Chaz Schilens wide open for the touchdown and the 22-17 lead as the 4.h quarter began. After a Houston punt, Oakland was pushed to 4.h down again. Hue Jackson channeled Les Miles by calling for a fake, and Rock Cartwright ran 35 yards down the sideline. The drive stalled, but Janikowski hit another field goal, this 1 a gimme 42-yard effort, and a 25-17 advantage. An exchange of punts set up the Texans with 8:22 left at their own 7-yard line. Screens to Foster were key on this drive, along with a pass interference penalty, to help them into field goal range. The biggest play was the Raiders finally being in position to stop the screen, with Michael Huff sniffing it out and 3 defenders crunching Schaub on third down. Kubiak had no choice on 4.h-and-18 but to call for a field goal, and Rackers made it 25-20 from 40 yards out. Even with only 1 timeout remaining, Houston got the ball back with 1:50 left thanks to Campbell checking out of a run on first down and going for the sealing first down on a deep ball to Denarius Moore. The Texans were not going down easy. After a complex review showing 12 defenders were on the field (Quentin Groves was lazy running off) during a Tommy Kelly sack, a face mask on Kelly took precedence over that flag and seemingly buried them. Schaub then found Walter for 26 yards. They put a foot in the coffin again when an errant snap cost them 13 yards. Two plays later, Schaub bought time and found Dreessen down to the 5-yard line. The clock was ticking, but a spike stopped it with 7 ticks remaining. Huff sealed the victory with an interception on a play where Schaub was indecisive. He was clearly trying to figure out if he was fast enough to run for the score. The replay showed Schaub wouldn't have made it, since "
