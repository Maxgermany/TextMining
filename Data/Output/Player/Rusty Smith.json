   "comment":"Smith. After the loss, Young stormed out of the locker room after telling Jeff Fisher, I'm not running out on teammates; I'm running out on you. A frustrated Fisher then took the podium and announced that even if healthy, Young will not be the starter for the Titans going forward. Young will likely never play for Tennessee ever again, considering he's owed $12.75 million in 2011. With Kerry Collins out for several weeks, it'll be Rusty Smith, who looked really awful in relief. Smith went 3-of-9 for 62 yards and an interception that looked more like a punt. He also had another pick dropped by "
