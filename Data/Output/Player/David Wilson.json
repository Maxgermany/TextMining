The result of this poor blocking was disastrous outside of that blown scoring opportunity. The Giants mustered just 2 first downs and 18 total net yards by halftime. The team's fans on the forum all agreed that this was the worst offensive performance they've ever seen.    As you may guess, Eli Manning struggled immensely because he had no time to throw. By the time the Panthers went up 31-0, Manning was just 6-of-11 for 37 yards and an ugly interception that he fired into double coverage. Manning finished 12-of-23 for 119 yards and the pick. His 3 wideouts - Victor Cruz (3-25), Hakeem Nicks (0 catches), Rueben Randle (2-4) - didn't do very much.    David Wilson received the bulk of the workload for a change, but given that the Giants were being blown out the entire contest, he was given just 11 carries for 39 yards.
