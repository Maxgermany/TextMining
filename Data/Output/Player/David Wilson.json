   "comment":"David Wilson's kickoff returns. Wilson averaged 36 yards per attempt, as there were gaping holes nearly every time the ball was kicked to him. The crowd eventually booed after each Giants' kickoff. - Speaking of an angry crowd, I thought it was hilarious that the fans jeered AndWy Reid when he challenged a DeSean Jackson reception. It's amazing how little confidence Philadelphians have in their head coach. - Giants' safety "

Wilson (6-16) was off to a good start with a touchdown, and his absence completely destroyed whatever New York wanted to do on offense. In fact, ",
