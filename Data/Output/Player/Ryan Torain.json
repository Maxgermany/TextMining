   "comment":"Torain (12 carries, 68 yards, 1 touchdown), who is out for the year with a knee. So, what happened? The Browns played like the Browns. A foolish Winslow pass-interference penalty eliminated a beautiful Quinn-to-Braylon Edwards first-down conversion on third-and-12. This forced a Cleveland punt. On Denver's next possession, Jay Cutler hit Eddie Royal on a 93-yard bomb to Eddie Royal, thanks to completely inept coverage by completely inept corner Brandon McDonald. On Cleveland's next drive, Winslow once again did his best to ruin his team's chances of winning, fumbling on Denver's 38-yard line. Denver took over and scored another touchdown 8 plays later to take the lead, despite the fact that the Browns dropped about 4 would-be interceptions in the final quarter. After the teams exchanged touchdowns, Winslow let a ball sail right through his hands in Denver territory on 4.h-and-six. Game over. I really should stop handicapping Cleveland contests and just ask Edwards and Winslow whom they're betting on. Those 2 clowns have blown so many games this year, it's really disgusting. I'm convinced Winslow had the Browns -2 in the first half and the Broncos +3 for the game. There is no other explanation for his Jekyll-and-Hyde performance. Winslow, McDonald and the other drop-happy defensive backs weren't the only 1. trying to blow it for the Browns. Romeo Crennel did some ridiculously stupid things himself, including accepting a 10-yard penalty on the Broncos that brought up third down instead of 4.h down.    At any rate, tons of credit has to be given to Denver. Despite its multiple injuries, the Broncos won to improve to 5-4. Cutler was 24-of-42 for 447 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick, though the Browns dropped about half-a-dozen sure-fire interceptions in this contest. Because he didn't have a running game by his side - Torain and Selvin Young both had to leave the game early - Cutler was forced to throw on almost every down."
