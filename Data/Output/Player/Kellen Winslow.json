   "comment":"Kellen Winslow: 8 Arrelious Benn: 7 Preston Parker: 5 Dezmon Briscoe: 1 Kregg Lumpkin: 1 Luke Stocker: 1    Buccaneers running back LeGarrette Blount couldn't get going in the first half with 13 yards on 4 carries. All of Tampa Bay's running backs struggled to find running room against the Lions front 7. The Bucs' inability to control the ball prevented them from getting Blount more carries in the first half. In the final 2 quarters, Tampa Bay was forced to throw the ball and play their 2.minute offense package that has Earnest Graham in the game instead of Blount. The second-year Blount finished with 15 yards on 5 carries. In order for Blount to be featured more, the Bucs have to be competitive throughout the game.    Tampa Bay struggled to get their top receivers involved. Tight end Kellen Winslow had 6 catches for 66 yards while Mike Williams finished with 4 receptions for 50 yards and a score. Many of the passes thrown to Winslow and Williams were off the mark, and the 1. that were catchable rarely hit them when they had room to run.   "
