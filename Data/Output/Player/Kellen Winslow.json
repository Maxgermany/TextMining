All of Tampa Bay's running backs struggled to find running room against the Lions front 7. The Bucs' inability to control the ball prevented them from getting Blount more carries in the first half. In the final 2 quarters, Tampa Bay was forced to throw the ball and play their 2-minute offense package that has Earnest Graham in the game instead of Blount. The second-year Blount finished with 15 yards on 5 carries. In order for Blount to be featured more, the Bucs have to be competitive throughout the game.    Tampa Bay struggled to get their top receivers involved. Tight end Kellen Winslow had 6 catches for 66 yards while Mike Williams finished with 4 receptions for 50 yards and a score. Many of the passes thrown to Winslow and Williams were off the mark, and the ones that were catchable rarely hit them when they had room to run.   "

To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers.

On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.    Early in the third quarter, Smith and Gore kept moving the ball against the Buccaneers. Smith threw a nice pass to Vernon Davis, who powered his way into the end zone for a 23-yard touchdown catch. The connection of Smith to Davis torched Tampa Bay for a 14-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Smith threw a perfect fade pass and Davis beat Ronde Barber off the snap to break open.    Raheem Morris hurt his team's efforts on a possession when he was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Tampa Bay was marred by critical penalties and untimely turnovers, such as when wide receiver Mike Williams fumbled the ball away in the second half.    The 49ers dominated the Buccaneers, completely kicking their butt. The Tampa Bay run defense was a disaster, constantly getting blown out of their gaps. Gore ran for 125 yards on 20 carries and Smith finished the game 11-of-19 for 170 yards with 3 touchdowns.    Third-year quarterback Freeman played a terrible game. He failed to move the ball consistently and made a lot of bad decisions, ending up 17-of-33 for 187 yards and 2 interceptions. Blount had no carries in the second half. With 5 catches for 54 yards, Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving. The 49ers' defense saw great performances out of rookie outside linebacker "

   "comment":"Winslow. The pass was picked off by Carlos Rogers, who returned the ball 31-yards for a touchdown. On the next possession, Freeman threw an interception to Chris Culliver, who returned it to almost midfield. The 49ers moved the ball down the field, and Gore plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out for a 21-3 lead. Freeman was out of sync throughout the first 2 quarters, throwing 2 interceptions and nearly allowing 2 more, both of which fell incomplete.    Early in the third quarter, Smith and Gore kept moving the ball against the Buccaneers. Smith threw a nice pass to Vernon Davis, who powered his way into the end zone for a 23-yard touchdown catch. The connection of Smith to Davis torched Tampa Bay for a 14-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Smith threw a perfect fade pass and Davis beat Ronde Barber off the snap to break open.    Raheem Morris hurt his team's efforts on a possession when he was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Tampa Bay was marred by critical penalties and untimely turnovers, such as when wide receiver Mike Williams fumbled the ball away in the second half.    The 49ers dominated the Buccaneers, completely kicking their butt. The Tampa Bay run defense was a disaster, constantly getting blown out of their gaps. Gore ran for 125 yards on 20 carries and Smith finished the game 11-of-19 for 170 yards with 3 touchdowns.    Third-year quarterback Freeman played a terrible game. He failed to move the ball consistently and made a lot of bad decisions, ending up 17-of-33 for 187 yards and 2 interceptions. Blount had no carries in the second half. With 5 catches for 54 yards, Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving. The 49ers' defense saw great performances out of rookie outside linebacker "

   "comment":"Winslow drop an easy pass for a failed conversion. The Packers' offense woke up and started to attack the Buccaneers' vulnerable run defense. Green Bay was aided by some penalties by Tampa Bay, and fullback John Kuhn dove into the end zone from 2 yards out. After a Rodgers' interception, the Buccaneers got a big play downfield with a long pass from Freeman to Arrelious Benn. That set up a short touchdown pass to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe. Tampa Bay trailed 28-26 with 4 and half minutes left. The Buccaneers made a terrible decision to do an onside kick rather than to kick it deep. The Packers recovered the attempt and were set up at midfield in prime position to get a game-clinching score. Rodgers made the Tampa Bay pay with a perfect pass he dropped into Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown. . After a terrible game last week, the Buccaneers dug deep and played the Packers really tough. Rodgers' accuracy was off frequently in the game and he didn't look like his normal self against Tampa Bay. Green Bay's defense is showing some weakness with the amount of yards they are giving up. That could come back to bite them in the postseason. Freeman was 28-of-38 for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Winslow caught 9 passes for 132 yards, while Blount ran for 107 yards on 18 carries. Rodgers was 23-of-34 for 299 yards with 3 scores and an interception. Nelson led Green Bay with 6 receptions for 123 yards and 2 touchdowns.   "

   "comment":"Winslow, but when the veteran tight end tried to hurdle a defender, it all went wrong. He got hit in mid-air and fumbled the ball away to the Panthers. That started another Carolina scoring drive that culminated with a short touchdown pass from Newton to Jonathan Stewart. The Panthers then piled it on with a 49-yard touchdown run from Newton straight up the middle of the Buccaneers' defense. On the play, linebacker Quincy Black got caught overpursuing, while safety Tanard Jackson looked tentative trying to tackle Newton. Tampa Bay then fumbled the ball to Carolina on the kickoff, and Newton tossed a short touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey.    Tampa Bay just doesn't have the talent on its roster to match up and compete in the NFL. Every week, the opposition exploits mismatches throughout the Buccaneers' stop unit. Their run defense is awful due to pitiful gap integrity and bad linebackers. Their secondary is targeted and overwhelmed every week.    In their 2 games this season, the Panthers illustrated that there is a huge talent discrepancy between them and the Buccaneers. Carolina has outscored Tampa in 2 meetings, 86-35.    Freeman was 28-of-38 for 274 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving with 6 receptions for 63 yards.    Newton went 12-of-17 for 171 yards and 3 scores. He also ran for 65 yards and a score on 6 carries. Stewart (88 yards) and Williams (66 yards) had only 7 carries each. LaFell led Carloina in receiving with 3 receptions for 103 yards and a score.

On Atlanta's next possession, Turner capped the Falcons' collection of 42 unanswered points, with an 81-yard touchdown run. The Buccaneers finally got on the board with a short touchdown from Freeman to Briscoe on the next drive. At halftime Falcons were up 42-7, and Ryan had already been replaced by backup Chris Redmond.    Ryan was 6-of-9 for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns. Turner ran for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. Jones (4-76) and "

   "comment":"Winslow including an 8-yard touchdown toss. For his first game, Smith made some nice plays on third down and came up with some clutch completions and runs in the fourth quarter. He finished 24-of-38 for 256 yards with a score and a pick, plus ran for 47 yards on 6 carries. Smith didn't get much help from the ground game as Bilal Powell (12-29) and Chris Ivory (10-15) were contained. Winslow sat out last season, but had an impressive comeback game against his former team. He led the Jets with 79 yards on 7 receptions. If your fantasy team is weak at tight end, you should consider picking up Winslow. New Tampa Bay cornerback "
