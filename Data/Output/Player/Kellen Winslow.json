Freeman got into more of a groove late in the second quarter to lead a 14-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. He connected on a few passes to rookie tight end Luke Stocker and Williams. Freeman dived into the end zone from a yard out to give Tampa Bay 10-3 lead. A turnover set Tampa Bay up for 3 more points just before halftime and a lead of 16-3. To start the third quarter, Freeman led a drive that ate up over half the period and produced another field goal for the Buccaneers. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, Freeman had a pass deflected off the hands of wide receiver Arrelious Benn and into the hands of safety William Moore, who returned the interception to midfield. Freeman finished the game 22-of-32 for 180 yards and 2 interceptions. Williams had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Winslow had 2 catches for 20 yards. Blount finished with 81 yards on 24 carries.

Green Bay was aided by some penalties by Tampa Bay, and fullback John Kuhn dove into the end zone from 2 yards out. After a Rodgers' interception, the Buccaneers got a big play downfield with a long pass from Freeman to Arrelious Benn. That set up a short touchdown pass to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe. Tampa Bay trailed 28-26 with 4 and half minutes left. The Buccaneers made a terrible decision to do an onside kick rather than to kick it deep. The Packers recovered the attempt and were set up at midfield in prime position to get a game-clinching score. Rodgers made the Tampa Bay pay with a perfect pass he dropped into Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown. . After a terrible game last week, the Buccaneers dug deep and played the Packers really tough. Rodgers' accuracy was off frequently in the game and he didn't look like his normal self against Tampa Bay. Green Bay's defense is showing some weakness with the amount of yards they are giving up. That could come back to bite them in the postseason. Freeman was 28-of-38 for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Winslow caught 9 passes for 132 yards, while Blount ran for 107 yards on 18 carries. Rodgers was 23-of-34 for 299 yards with 3 scores and an interception. Nelson led Green Bay with 6 receptions for 123 yards and 2 touchdowns.   "

That started another Carolina scoring drive that culminated with a short touchdown pass from Newton to Winslow, but when the veteran tight end tried to hurdle a defender, it all went wrong. He got hit in mid-air and fumbled the ball away to the Panthers. That started another Carolina scoring drive that culminated with a short touchdown pass from Newton to Jonathan Stewart. The Panthers then piled it on with a 49-yard touchdown run from Newton straight up the middle of the Buccaneers' defense. On the play, linebacker Quincy Black got caught overpursuing, while safety Tanard Jackson looked 10.ative trying to tackle Newton. Tampa Bay then fumbled the ball to Carolina on the kickoff, and Newton tossed a short touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey.    Tampa Bay just doesn't have the talent on its roster to match up and compete in the NFL. Every week, the opposition exploits mismatches throughout the Buccaneers' stop unit. Their run defense is awful due to pitiful gap integrity and bad linebackers. Their secondary is targeted and overwhelmed every week.    In their 2 games this season, the Panthers illustrated that there is a huge talent discrepancy between them and the Buccaneers. Carolina has outscored Tampa in 2 meetings, 86-35.    Freeman was 28-of-38 for 274 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Winslow led Tampa Bay in receiving with 6 receptions for 63 yards.    Newton went 12-of-17 for 171 yards and 3 scores. He also ran for 65 yards and a score on 6 carries. Stewart (88 yards) and Williams (66 yards) had only 7 carries each. LaFell led Carloina in receiving with 3 receptions for 103 yards and a score.
