   "comment":"Jaron Brown (8-105) for a 32-yard gain to set up a first-and-goal. Palmer finished the drive by hitting Andre Ellington for a short touchdown pass, but the officials screwed up the call saying it was incomplete, so Arizona settled for a field goal. Even Mike Pereira disagreed with what the officials decided. The 49ers got moving with Hoyer hitting Aldrick Robinson (3-52) for 24 yards and Carlos Hyde getting a few gains to set up a field goal. Late in the first half, Hoyer threw a pass up for grabs like a punt, and Antoine Bethea picked it off to set up the Cardinals at the 49ers' 30-yard line. Arizona tied it at 6-6 entering halftime. Early in the third quarter, the 49ers put up another field goal drive. Arizona drove into San Francisco territory before DeForest Buckner had a clutch sack to force the Cardinals into settling for a field goal. The 49ers answered again with a Robbie Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the 4.h quarter. Palmer used Ellington and Chris Johnson as receivers before the 49ers' pass rush stepped up to keep the Cardinals to 3 points. Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining. However, Ray Ray Armstrong notched a sack and Elvis Dumervil recorded the 100th sack of his career to get the ball for the 49ers' offense. Hoyer couldn't do anything with it, forcing the 49ers to punt again. Dumervil added another sack, and that basically forced overtime. A pass interference on Patrick Peterson in overtime helped get San Francisco on the move. The 49ers advanced the ball with an 11-yard pass to Pierre Garcon (4-36), a third-down conversion with an 8.yard run by Kyle Juszcyk, and a pass to Hyde for 9 yards to get inside the 10-yard line. The drive stalled, and Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. Because it was the opening possession of overtime, Arizona got a chance to score. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for receptions of 17 and 25 yards. A holding on "

   "comment":"Jaron Brown (8-105) for a 32-yard gain to set up a first-and-goal. Palmer finished the drive by hitting Andre Ellington for a short touchdown pass, but the officials screwed up the call saying it was incomplete, so Arizona settled for a field goal. Even Mike Pereira disagreed with what the officials decided. The 49ers got moving with Hoyer hitting Aldrick Robinson (3-52) for 24 yards and Carlos Hyde getting a few gains to set up a field goal. Late in the first half, Hoyer threw a pass up for grabs like a punt, and Antoine Bethea picked it off to set up the Cardinals at the 49ers' 30-yard line. Arizona tied it at 6-6 entering halftime. Early in the third quarter, the 49ers put up another field goal drive. Arizona drove into San Francisco territory before DeForest Buckner had a clutch sack to force the Cardinals into settling for a field goal. The 49ers answered again with a Robbie Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the 4.h quarter. Palmer used Ellington and Chris Johnson as receivers before the 49ers' pass rush stepped up to keep the Cardinals to 3 points. Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining.
