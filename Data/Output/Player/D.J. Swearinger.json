   "comment":"Swearinger. No. 1 overall-pick Jadeveon Clowney was disruptive in the first half and played well before a sprained MCL knocked him out at halftime. Even with a new coaching staff, it was a similar story for the Redskins, as crushing mistakes and turnovers gave the game away. Robert Griffin III had no time to throw the ball, and turnovers inside the Texans 10-yard line took away critical points from Washington.    In the first quarter, both teams struggled to move the chains. After a good 26-yard punt return from Andre Roberts, the Redskins got some good Alfred Morris runs that took Washington from midfield to the goal line, and that set up a short touchdown run for fullback Darrel Young. Houston came back right back as DeAndre Hopkins (4-89) got wide open in busted coverage for a 76-yard touchdown. A few plays later, Texans rookie running back Alfred Blue blocked a punt and scooped it up to return it a few yards for a touchdown. Houston was up 14-6 at the half.    The Redskins self-destructed during the third quarter. Morris (14-91) fumbled a handoff inside the Texans 10-yard line and Watt recovered the ball. Shortly later, Washington had a pass play of 47 yards to Niles Paul inside Houston's 10-yard line, but Swearinger stripped the ball out for a Texans' recovery. Houston returned the favor as 1 of its few good offensive drive ended when "

Goff is going to be a huge project for Los Angeles' new coaching staff, but with how bad he looked as a rookie, it wouldn't be at all surprising if he ends up being a bust.    Gurley ran for 40 yards on 14 carries plus made 4 receptions for 37 yards. Playing in what he previous described as a middle-school offense, Gurley was the Rams' leading receiver against Arizona. "
