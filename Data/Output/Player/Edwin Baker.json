The big news for the Browns was the report that Rob Chudzinski would be fired. I've posted a coach firing grade for Chudzinski, who had a YOLO approach to this game, constantly going for it on fourth down. I'm all for aggressiveness, but had Chudzinkski settled for some field goals, the Browns could've been in position to tie on a final drive.   "
