  "comment":"Edwin Baker actually looked pretty decent on an early 20-yard scamper, showing some nice speed. Baker, who gained 69 yards on 18 carries, can be a capable No. 2 back next year.    The big news for the Browns was the report that Rob Chudzinski would be fired. I've posted a for Chudzinski, who had a YOLO approach to this game, constantly going for it on 4.h down. I'm all for aggressiveness, but had Chudzinkski settled for some field goals, the Browns could've been in position to tie on a final drive.   "
