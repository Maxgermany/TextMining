As you can tell, the Cardinal signal-callers were extremely pathetic, especially John Skelton. He went 11-of-24 for only 74 yards, all 4 picks and a lost fumble. One of the picks wasn't his fault, as it was caught and bobbled by Larry Fitzgerald, but regardless, Skelton may have lost a spot in a league based on this performance.    Because Skelton sucked so much, Fitzgerald had just 1 catch for 2 yards. That's it. Sherman took him away, and that was that. Chris Wells didn't do anything either, rushing for 18 yards on 6 carries.    "

Kaepernick just seemed unbelievably befuddled early by Seattle's raucous crowd amid the constant downpour; he had to burn timeouts and was whistled for delay-of-game infractions.    Kaepernick actually led the 49ers in rushing, scrambling for 31 yards on 7 attempts. Frank Gore had just 28 yards on 6 carries. He appeared to lose a fumble, but Joe Staley somehow pounced on it when it seemed like Seattle was sure to secure a turnover.    Three San Francisco players caught more than 2 passes: Michael Crabtree (4-65), Delanie Walker (4-54, TD) and Randy Moss (3-44). Sherman baited Kaepernick to throw to Moss into the end zone for the aforementioned interception. "

   "comment":"Sherman was able to tip the pass right into linebacker Malcolm Smith's arms to seal the victory. Kaepernick went 14-of-24 for 153 passing yards, 1 touchdown, 2 picks and the lost fumble to go along with 130 rushing yards on 11 scrambles. Wilson, meanwhile, wasn't very good to begin the game. He was stripped immediately by Aldon Smith while trying to scramble. The 49ers recovered deep in Seattle territory, but the defense stepped up and held them to a field goal. Wilson then missed Jermaine Kearse downfield for what would've been a big gain. Luckily for the Seahawks, Wilson got stronger as the game went on despite seeing heavy pressure from the San Francisco front. He was able to keep a play alive by avoiding multiple sacks and finding Doug Baldin downfield for a 51-yard gain. Wilson was then able to take advantage of a 49er offside penalty on a 4.h-and-7 to find Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown. His only blemish down the stretch was not giving Marshawn Lynch a sure handoff on a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, allowing San Francisco to pounce on the fumble. Wilson finished 16-of-25 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He didn't do anything on the ground, rushing for zero yards on his 5 scrambles.    Wilson was credited with the lost fumble to Lynch, but it was the running back who was distraught on the sideline right after the play. Perhaps Lynch was to blame, and if that was the case, it was his only mistake of the afternoon. Lynch struggled to find running lanes in the opening quarter, but each of his carries seemed to wear San Francisco down more and more. Suddenly, his 2-yard gains turned into 8-yard rushes. He then broke free for a 40-yard scamper, which was Seattle's first touchdown of the afternoon. He ultimately rushed for 109 yards and the score on 22 carries.    While Lynch was strong in the second half - 66 of his yards came after intermission - Frank Gore couldn't get anything going throughout. Gore mustered just 14 yards on 11 carries. He had a 9-yard scamper, so take that away and he had a pathetic line of 10-5.    As mentioned, Wilson's lone touchdown went to Kearse (2-44). Baldwin led all Seahawks in receiving yardage, catching 6 balls for 106 yards. Golden Tate (4-31) and Zach Miller (3-25) were the only other Seattle players with more than 2 receptions.    Kaepernick's aerial score, once again, was thrown to Boldin (5-53), who had 2 drops in this contest. Vernon Davis managed just 2 catches for 16 yards, while Crabtree (4-52) never had a chance for the game-winning touchdown because Sherman tipped the pass away. Sherman was then flagged for taunting Crabtree, giving the throat-slash gesture. And if that wasn't completely over the top, he shrieked at Erin Andrews in the post-game interview, exclaiming that he was the best cornerback in the NFL and that Crabtree was just a mediocre at best receiver. This prompted the following ridiculous feedback on Twitter :   "

   "comment":"Sherman wasn't thrown to at all, causing Jarrett Boykin to come away with zero receptions. Earl Thomas needs to stop playing special teams. A muffed punt of his led to a Green Bay touchdown. Michael Bennett, meanwhile, had a strip-sack of Aaron Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with 1 touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took 3 sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to Randall Cobb (6-58), but Jordy Nelson was the primary target. Seeing Byron Maxwell for most of the night, Nelson snagged 9 balls for 83 yards. Jarrett Boykin, meanwhile, was completely blanked because he was matched up against Sherman all evening.    "

   "comment":"Sherman picked off a back-shoulder throw intended for Andre Holmes (2-28). That spotted Seattle a field goal. Just before the half, the Seahawks drove down the field again. They were aided by a taunting penalty on Hayden, and Lynch scored from 5 yards out. The Seahawks had a 24-3 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Hayden dropped an interception that should have been a pick-six as he jumped a route. On the very next play though, Denico Autry blocked a punt and the ball rolled about 25 yards into the end zone before Brice Butler recovered it for a touchdown. The Raiders got going with a punt return by T.J. Carrie to the Seahawks' 30-yard line. A 23-yard pass to McFadden moved the ball inside the 10. On 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, Mychal Rivera (8-38) made a tremendous leaping catch for a touchdown. And just like that, Oakland was surprisingly down by just 7. The Seahawks responded with a 39-yard pass play to Lynch, who rumbled down the field, but the drive stalled, and Seattle had to settle for a field goal. Doug Baldwin then returned a punt 38 yards. Wilson scampered for 19 to convert a third down to set up another field goal. The Raiders got a drive going thanks to a face mask on Michael Bennett and a pass to Maurice Jones-Drew inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal just after the 2-minute warning, Carr connected with Rivera (8-38) for another touchdown off a play-action bootleg. It was close, but Seattle recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.    Wilson finished completing 17-of-35 passes for 179 yards. Marshawn Lynch had a huge day as Seattle's leading rusher with 21 carries for 67 yards and was the leading receiver with 5 receptions for 76 yards. The Seahawks' receivers gave them very little, as Doug Baldwin (5-38), Paul Richardson (3-12) and Jermaine Kearse (1-4) were all held in check.    Carr completed 24-of-41 passes for 194 yards with 2 scores and 2 picks.    Defensively, Seattle got big games from K.J. Wright (13 tackles, 1 pass batted), Cliff Avril (1 strip sack), and Richard Sherman (1 interception, 1 forced fumble, 3 tackles). For the Raiders, rookie defensive tackle "

Sherman, who intercepted Kaepernick a second time in the final quarter on a late, forced throw, nearly picked Kaepernick off on a third occasion during the second quarter. In between, Kaepernick missed open receivers, didn't see his targets who were available for big gains, and even botched the clock management right before halftime. The 49ers might as well just pack it in if Kaepernick keeps performing like this. His regression has been inexplicable, and it's a huge mystery why the 49ers didn't design any runs for him. Kaepernick caused major problems for the Seahawks in the NFC Championship with his rushing ability, yet he scrambled only 3 times for 17 yards. Instead, Kaepernick, instead, spent the entire night targeting Sherman, who is now responsible for 5 of Kaepernick's 24 career interceptions, including the tip to "

   "comment":"Sherman then dropped what looked like a pick-six, which was sandwiched in between 2 Carolina fumbles that Seattle failed to recover. Earl Thomas then let the ball hit the ground on an interception, which set up the Panthers with a field goal. That kick was actually blocked by Kam Chancellor, who had a great game. However, the officials incorrectly ruled that Chancellor ran into the kicker; Graham Gano flopped, which shouldn't have even mattered because Chancellor changed the trajectory of the attempt. The Panthers went into the break down 14-10, though they were extremely fortunate it wasn't 24-7. The Seahawks appeared to be in jeopardy of potentially blowing a victory despite being a 12-point favorite, but they got their act together in the second half, finishing on a very strong note. They hit some big plays and finally took advantage of a turnover, as Chancellor brought a pick-six 90 yards to the house to seal the win.    Russell Wilson had an outstanding performance. He went 15-of-22 for 268 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 22 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. Wilson endured some drops, including 2 by Cooper Helfet, but he didn't allow that to deter him. He fired some well-placed bombs to his receivers, including a 63-yard score to Jermaine Kearse.    Speaking of Kearse, he led the Seahawks with 129 receiving yards on 3 catches. Only 3 other Seattle players caught more than 1 pass: Luke Willson (4-68, TD), Doug Baldwin (3-38, TD) and Marshawn Lynch. Wilson targeted Paul Richardson for a touchdown, but the pass fell incomplete, and the rookie receiver sprained his knee.    Max Unger also got hurt. This occurred on 1 of the final plays of the contest, as the center, who had been out of the lineup since Week 11, rolled his ankle again. It's unclear how serious this tweak was, but the Seahawks will definitely need their star center back in the lineup against an actual playoff-caliber opponent next week.    Unger's presence was expected to open things up for Marshawn Lynch, but Beast Mode couldn't get on track for the most part. Lynch was limited to 59 yards on 14 carries, and most of that came on a 25-yard burst in the second half, which could've been a longer gain had Lynch not barely stepped out of bounds.    The Panthers, meanwhile, didn't look like they were going to be very competitive in the first quarter. Jerricho Cotchery opened by dropping a pass that was nearly picked off. Cam Newton was nearly intercepted on 2 other occasions after actually being picked by Richard Sherman, and the team fumbled twice and was lucky to recover both times. Carolina had several 3.and-outs to open the contest, but everything changed when starting cornerback "

   "comment":"Sherman picked off a pass heading toward Davante Adams. After that, Green Bay had the following unforced blunders: - Following an overturned John Kuhn touchdown, Mike McCarthy opted to kick a field goal from the 1-inch line. Rodgers could've easily converted on a sneak. - McCarthy did the same exact thing on the ensuing drive that saw Rodgers miss Jordy Nelson by inches. McCarthy opted to send out Mason Crosby on the 1-yard line. His conservative play-calling left a whopping 8 points off the board in the first quarter. - Brandon Bostick dropped the ball on an attempted onside kick at the very end of the game. Bostick just had the ball slip out of his hands. Had he hung on to it, the Seahawks wouldn't have gotten the 1 possession they needed to take the lead. - Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had a chance to intercept a pass on a 2.point conversion following a Seattle touchdown that gave the Seahawks their first lead of the afternoon. Instead, the ball went right over his head and into the hands of Luke Willson. Had Clinton-Dix made the pick, Mason Crosby's 48-yard field goal at the end of regulaton would've clinched a trip to the Super Bowl for the Packers. - On Green Bay's game-tying drive, McCarthy opted not to call any timeouts. Time trickled off the clock, and Green Bay never really had an opportunity to score the go-ahead touchdown.    It would be a mistake to concentrate on the Packers exclusively, given how awesome Wilson was at the very end. Wilson, at 1 point, was 2-of-9 for only 13 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. Green Bay smothered him, as Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews put immense pressure on him. Wilson couldn't even scramble; he generated just 2 rushing yards in the opening half. Following intermission, Wilson was 12-of-20 for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception that wasn't his fault, as the ball deflected off Kearse's hands. Wilson also finished with 25 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The transformation was amazing; Wilson looked like Jake Delhomme in the first half, but was his usual clutch self when the game was on the line. A tearful Wilson was overcome with emotion during his post-game interview with Erin Andrews, who had to be relieved that she wasn't getting yelled at like she was at this time last year. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    Kearse was 1 of the heroes because he caught the touchdown, but he was having a miserable afternoon prior to that reception, which was his first of the contest. Kearse, who was responsible for a pick, dropped several other passes. Doug Baldwin (6-106), who lost a fumble on a kickoff, led the team in receiving, but it's clearer than ever that the Seahawks have to address their receiving corps this offseason. That's exactly what I have them doing in my .    Marshawn Lynch was awesome in what is likely to be his final game in front of the Seattle faithful. He rushed for 157 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He nearly scored on a 35-yard reception, but his foot was ruled to be out of bounds. Lynch couldn't get much early, being limited to 37 yards in the first half, but as usual, he had numerous tough runs following the break.    As for the Packers, Rodgers began the game hot, but threw for only 63 yards in the second half. He showed some mobility early on, moving out of the pocket to find his receivers, but he rolled his ankle at 1 point and then began hobbling around. Rodgers' poor health was most apparent on the Packers' final drive of regulation when he limped out of bounds on a scramble and then eschewed running downfield despite having tons of room in front of him. Instead, he flipped the ball toward Eddie Lacy, who wasn't even looking for the pass. That missed opportunity ruined the final possession, as it put the Packers in a long-yardage situation, which they couldn't recover from. Rodgers finished 19-of-34 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The first pick was a great play by Sherman, who injured his arm in the second half. The other was a miscommunication with Cobb.    Speaking of Cobb, he hauled in Rodgers' sole score and managed to lead the team with 7 receptions for 62 yards. Jordy Nelson (5-71) and "

   "comment":"Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was Jermaine Kearse last week, yet he failed to reel in a single reception. Doug Baldwin led the way instead, catching 7 balls for 92 yards and a touchdown. No Seattle wideout should be on any roster in 12-team leagues.    Jimmy Graham caught a touchdown in the opener, but managed to secure just 1 catch in this game. He was targeted just twice. Graham will continue to struggle because he's not a good fit in Seattle's offense. I would attempt to unload him.    As for the Packers, they trailed 17-13 in the third quarter, but Aaron Rodgers went nuts and closed the game out on a 14-0 run. Rodgers was perfect in the final quarter. Literally. He was 9-of-9 for 91 yards and a touchdown in the final frame despite dealing with a key injury in his backfield. Rodgers went 25-of-33 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 23 rushing yards. He did a great job of repeatedly drawing the Seahawks offsides and torching Richard Sherman, who was flagged twice.    Rodgers' performance was particularly impressive considering that he was missing "

   "comment":"Sherman shadowed Antonio Brown, and Heath Miller left the game with a rib injury. Wheaton, before this game, had never caught more than 5 passes or accumulated more than 97 yards in his 38 games. On Sunday, he caught 9-of-13 targets for 201 yards and a touchdown, the 4.h of his career. Over the first 10 games of 2015, Wheaton had caught 16-of-32 targets for 273 yards and a touchdown.    On the other side, all 5 of Wilson's touchdown passes went to 2 of his wide receivers, Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse. Baldwin's 6 receptions on 8 targets for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns was his career game in both yardage and touchdowns. He's now had 2 huge games in his last 3. Wilson and Baldwin can look like this 1 game and then do very little the next game, but we know they have it in them. It will be interesting to see if they open up this passing game more as the season closes.    One problem with going more pass heavy is the season-ending injury Jimmy Graham suffered. He tore his right patellar 10.on after putting together a nice game, with 4 receptions for 75 yards. This injury is a tough 1 to recover from, and it has taken some players completely out of the NFL. Graham had not put up the numbers he had in New Orleans, but still had been an integral part of the Seattle offense, averaging 4.4 receptions for 55 yards per game. Luke Willson of The Royal Tenenbaums' fame, will take over as the starter.    As this game went back and forth, with little defense to speak of, Tomlin made a curious decision after Roethlisberger drove the ball down to the 3.yard line, down by 5 points with 3:02 left on the clock. Instead of going for the touchdown on 4.h down, Tomlin opted for a field goal to make the score 32-30 Seattle. Tomlin is known for not playing conservatively, and with his defense giving up yards in fat chunks, the odds of the Steelers getting the ball back, still down just 2.points, was slim. Some have pontificated that he went for the field goal because Roethlisberger was feeling concussion-like symptoms, but if Pittsburgh knew Landry Jones was going to be the quarterback, then why not go for it at the 3. rather than hoping the Steelers' defense could stop Wilson and then hoping some more that Jones could then move them into Chris Boswell's range for the game-winner?    Of course, we can second guess until the cows come home, but if the barn's burning, the cows have no safe place! When you put the early fake field goal interception and this conservative decision together, it does not look good for coach Tomlin's decision-making prowess this week.    The Seahawks played the much cleaner game, and even though their defense was exposed yet again, they made the plays when they needed to, and Sherman proved once again that he's as good or better than any defensive back out there.    The Steelers, on the other hand, showed us that if they aren't getting to the quarterback, they aren't stopping anybody and must overwhelm the opposition with points. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Sherman and Bobby Wagner. On the ensuing possession. Steven Hauschka whiffed on a 28-yard attempt, though I bet he wishes he hit the post because his kick wasn't even close. The game ended in a senseless tie, something that the NFL should've abolished long ago. Ultimately, this tie hurts the Cardinals more; they were at home, and they needed to rebound off their 3-3 start, while the Seahawks were 4-1 and had a greater margin for error.    Going into this game, I spent some time writing about how I was confused about why the top entrants in the Supercontest and the sharps all were wagering on the Cardinals. During this contest, I spent the majority of the evening wondering how they possibly knew that Russell Wilson wasn't nearly 100 percent in terms of his passing ability. Wilson, of course, has been dealing with some knee problems, he had been able to throw the ball well in his past 3 games. That was not the case in this contest, as he struggled throughout most of the evening. This almost went down as 1 of Wilson's worst games ever. Sure, the offensive line didn't do him any favors; they surrendered constant pass rushes to Chandler Jones and Markus Golden. The latter proved to be a huge problem for the Seahawks. The Seattle blockers also were constantly flagged for holding penalties. By the time the second half commenced, I was shocked when there was an offensive play in which 1 of the linemen wasn't guilty of a hold. However, Wilson was way off the mark on most of his passes, even on the rare occasions in which he had time to throw. He definitely did not look right, and I was wondering if he's dealing with some new, undisclosed injury. I noted that Wilson was horrible for most of the evening. Things somehow changed in overtime. Wilson made a great touch pass to Jermaine Kearse for 31 yards, and then he hit Doug Baldwin for a 27-yard toss in which Baldwin got away from Tyrann Mathieu. This set up Hauschka's 28-yard try, but he ruined Wilson's sole positive drive with a miss. Wilson finished 24-of-37 for 225 yards. Those aren't horrible numbers, but keep in mind that he had a big chunk of his yardage in overtime. Wilson definitely did get better as the evening progressed, as he was 5-of-14 for 34 yards in the opening half. Maybe he doesn't have a new, undisclosed injury, but the offensive line is definitely a big problem. I was thinking Seattle's coaching staff would be able to remedy this issue during the bye as it has been able to in previous years, but apparently, that was not the case.    Wilson's targets didn't have quality numbers as a result of his struggles. Baldwin caught 6 balls for 69 yards, with 27 of those yards coming in overtime. His only blemish was a drop with 4 minutes remaining in regulation. Jimmy Graham (5-53) also dropped a pass. Tyler Lockett, meanwhile, was a disappointment with just 2 receptions for 13 yards.    Christine Michael was also affected by Seattle's poor offensive line. Michael had a nice run in overtime, but he was limited to 52 yards overall on 16 carries.    The main advantage Arizona had in this contest, aside from its ability to refrain from committing stupid penalties throughout the evening, was the rushing attack. The Seahawks were able to clog rushing lanes pretty well, and yet, David Johnson still picked up decent gains. Most of his attempts ended with Johnson twisting or pushing forward to pick up extra yardage, and all of those high-effort plays added up, as they put Carson Palmer in some favorable down-and-distance situations. Johnson gained 113 yards on 33 carries to go along with 8 catches for 58 receiving yards. He also had a gain of about 30 negated by a hold. Johnson appeared to win the game in overtime, but he was tackled twice short of the goal line, prompting Arizona to try a 24-yard kick with Catanzaro, and the rest was history.    Palmer finished 29-of-49 for 342 yards. I've been trashing Palmer all year because he hasn't looked the same, but he was better in this contest. He still missed on some throws he ordinarily would've made, but he was battling a tremendous secondary, albeit 1 without Kam Chancellor. Palmer did have an interception negated by a Sherman hold, and he nearly threw a pick-six that was dropped by Earl Thomas, but Palmer should have registered more completions, but was betrayed by numerous drops."

Only 2 other Carolina players logged more than 18 receiving yards: Devin Funchess (2-44) and Greg Olsen (3-30). Kelvin Benjamin saw 9 targets, but hauled in just 2 passes for 18 yards.

   "comment":"Sherman and missed numerous throws. He had Brian Quick wide open in the end zone on 1 occasion, but wasn't even close on his throw. Goff took numerous sacks because he held on to the ball too long, showing no pocket awareness. He also had a deer-in-the-headlights look far too often. Goff was ultimately knocked out of the game with a concussion when he was blasted by Richard Sherman on an attempted run into the end zone that wouldn't even count because of a penalty. Goff probably deserves a C- for this performance, so I guess he could've been much worse. Goff just doesn't look anywhere close to being ready to be called a franchise quarterback. This was the consensus of Goff heading into the 2016 NFL Draft, so it's still mind-boggling that the Rams used so many resources to acquire him. Goff probably should've been a second-round pick.

   "comment":"Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the 4.h quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback "
