   "comment":"Richard Sherman snatched out of the air; the pass was way behind the intended target. Sherman, who intercepted Kaepernick a second time in the final quarter on a late, forced throw, nearly picked Kaepernick off on a third occasion during the second quarter. In between, Kaepernick missed open receivers, didn't see his targets who were available for big gains, and even botched the clock management right before halftime. The 49ers might as well just pack it in if Kaepernick keeps performing like this. His regression has been inexplicable, and it's a huge mystery why the 49ers didn't design any runs for him. Kaepernick caused major problems for the Seahawks in the NFC Championship with his rushing ability, yet he scrambled only 3 times for 17 yards. Instead, Kaepernick, instead, spent the entire night targeting Sherman, who is now responsible for 5 of Kaepernick's 24 career interceptions, including the tip to "

   "comment":"Richard Sherman then dropped what looked like a pick-six, which was sandwiched in between 2 Carolina fumbles that Seattle failed to recover. Earl Thomas then let the ball hit the ground on an interception, which set up the Panthers with a field goal. That kick was actually blocked by Kam Chancellor, who had a great game. However, the officials incorrectly ruled that Chancellor ran into the kicker; Graham Gano flopped, which shouldn't have even mattered because Chancellor changed the trajectory of the attempt. The Panthers went into the break down 14-10, though they were extremely fortunate it wasn't 24-7. The Seahawks appeared to be in jeopardy of potentially blowing a victory despite being a 12-point favorite, but they got their act together in the second half, finishing on a very strong note. They hit some big plays and finally took advantage of a turnover, as Chancellor brought a pick-six 90 yards to the house to seal the win.    Russell Wilson had an outstanding performance. He went 15-of-22 for 268 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 22 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. Wilson endured some drops, including 2 by Cooper Helfet, but he didn't allow that to deter him. He fired some well-placed bombs to his receivers, including a 63-yard score to Jermaine Kearse.    Speaking of Kearse, he led the Seahawks with 129 receiving yards on 3 catches. Only 3 other Seattle players caught more than 1 pass: Luke Willson (4-68, TD), Doug Baldwin (3-38, TD) and Marshawn Lynch. Wilson targeted Paul Richardson for a touchdown, but the pass fell incomplete, and the rookie receiver sprained his knee.    Max Unger also got hurt. This occurred on 1 of the final plays of the contest, as the center, who had been out of the lineup since Week 11, rolled his ankle again. It's unclear how serious this tweak was, but the Seahawks will definitely need their star center back in the lineup against an actual playoff-caliber opponent next week.    Unger's presence was expected to open things up for Marshawn Lynch, but Beast Mode couldn't get on track for the most part. Lynch was limited to 59 yards on 14 carries, and most of that came on a 25-yard burst in the second half, which could've been a longer gain had Lynch not barely stepped out of bounds.    The Panthers, meanwhile, didn't look like they were going to be very competitive in the first quarter. Jerricho Cotchery opened by dropping a pass that was nearly picked off. Cam Newton was nearly intercepted on 2 other occasions after actually being picked by Richard Sherman, and the team fumbled twice and was lucky to recover both times. Carolina had several 3.and-outs to open the contest, but everything changed when starting cornerback Byron Maxwell left the game with a shortness of breath. Newton then recognized the mismatch, targeting backup corner Tharold Simon on most of his throws. Newton had a ton of success moving the chains this way, but he had to dink and dunk doing so because of the Seattle edge in the trenches. As with any dink-and-dunk offense, Carolina's scoring unit was disrupted by mistakes, such as penalties, drops and sacks. It's clear that the team needs to upgrade the offensive line as well as the receiving corps this offseason. Newton finished 23-of-36 for 246 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He played well considering the competition, but the picks were a killer, and as mentioned, things could've been much worse for him. It should be noted that he was effective on the ground, gaining 37 yards on 11 scrambles.    Both of Newton's touchdowns went to Kelvin Benjamin, who had 7 catches for 75 yards. He was 1 of only 2 Panthers to accumulate more than 35 receiving yards, and the other was "

   "comment":"Richard Sherman, who struggled once again, quite possibly because he's filming too many commercials, was flagged twice. Wilson telegraphed an interception. K.J. Wright was ejected because he tried to rip a Packer player's helmet off. Fred Jackson fumbled at the very end when Wilson repeatedly kept dinking and dunking with almost no time available. They had no timeouts late because they squandered a pair earlier in the half. I'm sure there are other things as well that I'm missing. Regardless, the Seahawks need to get their act together before they fall too far behind the Cardinals in the divisional race.    Wilson finished 19-of-30 for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The good news is that he scrambled 10 times for 78 rushing yards. The bad news is Wilson didn't look as good as the passing stats indicate. Wilson, who was constantly under siege behind a poor offensive line, threw several inaccurate passes. Even his completions were way off the mark, as Luke Willson reeled in a 1.handed ball thrown way behind him. Wilson will continue to be a QB1 because of his running ability, but his protection needs to improve for Seattle to win some real games.    Marshawn Lynch's inability to run against the Packers was a big surprise, considering the outing Matt Forte enjoyed the week before. The Packers dominated the line of scrimmage, often tackling Lynch behind the line of scrimmage. Lynch did have a few nice gains, but he finished with just 41 yards on 15 carries. He tried to help his PPR owners with 3 catches for 21 receiving yards. He lost a fumble on a botched handoff, but an offsides penalty bailed him out.    Another week, another Seattle receiver leading the team in yardage. It was Jermaine Kearse last week, yet he failed to reel in a single reception. Doug Baldwin led the way instead, catching 7 balls for 92 yards and a touchdown. No Seattle wideout should be on any roster in 12-team leagues.    Jimmy Graham caught a touchdown in the opener, but managed to secure just 1 catch in this game. He was targeted just twice. Graham will continue to struggle because he's not a good fit in Seattle's offense. I would attempt to unload him.    As for the Packers, they trailed 17-13 in the third quarter, but Aaron Rodgers went nuts and closed the game out on a 14-0 run. Rodgers was perfect in the final quarter. Literally. He was 9-of-9 for 91 yards and a touchdown in the final frame despite dealing with a key injury in his backfield. Rodgers went 25-of-33 for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also scrambled 6 times for 23 rushing yards. He did a great job of repeatedly drawing the Seahawks offsides and torching Richard Sherman, who was flagged twice.    Rodgers' performance was particularly impressive considering that he was missing "

Ginn led the Panthers with 80 receiving yards and a touchdown on 5 catches, thanks to his aforementioned 55-yard grab against the discombobulated Seahawks, who were reeling from Thomas' injury. Only 2 other Carolina players logged more than 18 receiving yards: "

   "comment":"Richard Sherman and missed numerous throws. He had Brian Quick wide open in the end zone on 1 occasion, but wasn't even close on his throw. Goff took numerous sacks because he held on to the ball too long, showing no pocket awareness. He also had a deer-in-the-headlights look far too often. Goff was ultimately knocked out of the game with a concussion when he was blasted by Richard Sherman on an attempted run into the end zone that wouldn't even count because of a penalty. Goff probably deserves a C- for this performance, so I guess he could've been much worse. Goff just doesn't look anywhere close to being ready to be called a franchise quarterback. This was the consensus of Goff heading into the 2016 NFL Draft, so it's still mind-boggling that the Rams used so many resources to acquire him. Goff probably should've been a second-round pick.    The Rams' miserable offensive line affected "

   "comment":"Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the 4.h quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback "

   "comment":"Richard Sherman for a 27-yard reception to get inside the 30, but Watson made an ill-advised pass that was jumped by Thomas for an interception. He raced 78 yards for a pick-six to tie the game at 7. Watson shook off the bad play and got moving with a 15-yard completion to Hopkins and then a 22-yard pass interference on Jeremy Lane, who had to grab Fuller to prevent a long touchdown. Lamar Miller ran for 12 to set up a first-and-goal and then darted into end zone from a few yards out. Seattle got moving with a Tyler Lockett snatching a 27-yard completion. Jadeveon Clowney had a third-down strip-sack on Wilson, but the ball flew forward and Seahawks tight end Luke Willson scooped up the ball at the 20 to give Seattle a lucky first down. Russell Wilson dodged Clowney and then found Paul Richardson for a 20-yard touchdown. That tied it at 14 to end the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, the Texans took the lead. Watson ran for 18 yards, and Houston made a 4.h-down conversion with Miller. The Texans then picked on Sherman, with Hopkins getting him for 24 yards, and then Fuller getting open in the front of end zone for a 20-yard touchdown with Sherman getting turned around by the speedy receiver. The Seahawks came right back with Wilson hitting Tanner McEvoy for 53 yards to the Texans' 7.yard line. The next play saw Wilson roll out and hit Richardson for a short touchdown to tie the game at 21 at halftime. In the third quarter, Houston produced a field-goal drive. The Seahawks then got a 66-yard gain after Houston had busted coverage to let fullback Tre Madden get wide open. A 9.yard gain to Jimmy Graham moved the ball inside the 5.yard line, but Thomas Rawls dropped a touchdown, so Seattle settled for a tying field goal. Watson then had a critical mistake as he was pressured and threw off the mark, leaving Richard Sherman to pick him off deep in Houston territory. Seattle took the lead with a field goal to go up 27-24. The Texans came back with Watson hitting Hopkins for 34 yards and then Fuller for 36 yards to set up a first-and-goal. Watson made a phenomenal play to break a sack and throw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Miller. That put Houston up 31-27 with 9 minutes remaining in the 4.h quarter. Wilson came right back, hitting Lockett for 55 yards to the Houston 20. The drive ended with Jimmy Graham getting wide open for a 1-yard touchdown. That put Seattle up 34-31 with 5 and half minutes remaining. The Texans caught Seattle in a great play call with a screen to Hopkins, and he exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. That gave the Texans a 38-34 with 4:49 remaining. Wilson quickly moved the ball across the midfield with a few completions and a 21-yard scramble to put Seattle inside the 30. Houston's defense finally came up with a big play, as cornerback "

If there was any proof needed that Thursday night games should be abolished, this game was it. The Seahawks-Cardinals clash was a sloppy struggle with way too many injuries, and had Sherman been playing on proper rest, he almost certainly wouldn't have gotten hurt.    Wilson, as mentioned, missed only 1 snap, and he proved that he was healthy with 1 of the most spectacular plays of the season. Wilson was under duress by 2 defenders in the pocket.
