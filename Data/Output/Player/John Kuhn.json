Mike McCarthy, meanwhile, really screwed up when he let the clock drain out at the end of the opening half.

He managed only 27 yards on 13 tries. I wouldn't panic yet if you own him in fantasy. He's still averaging 4.1 YPC on the year.    Given the Packers' offensive struggles, if the Rams had any sort of decent quarterbacking and kicking, they may have won this game. It's a shame for "
