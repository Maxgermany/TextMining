He was also a big factor catching out of the backfield, as he caught 4 balls for 60 receiving yards. - McCarron finished 23-of-41 for 212 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick and fumble. He was much better in the second half, going 16-of-27 for 153 yards and a touchdown compared to 7-of-14 for just 59 yards and an interception beforehand. - Green led the Bengals with 71 receiving yards on 5 grabs. Hill, who is partly off the hook in the wake of Cincinnati's dual personal fouls, gained 50 yards and a score on 12 attempts. He struggled for the most part, however, as most of his yardage came on a 38-yard burst that featured an impressive cut.
