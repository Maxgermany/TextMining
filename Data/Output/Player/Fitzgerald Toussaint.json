   "comment":"Toussaint ran well, gaining 58 yards on 17 carries. He was also a big factor catching out of the backfield, as he caught 4 balls for 60 receiving yards. - McCarron finished 23-of-41 for 212 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick and fumble. He was much better in the second half, going 16-of-27 for 153 yards and a touchdown compared to 7-of-14 for just 59 yards and an interception beforehand. - Green led the Bengals with 71 receiving yards on 5 grabs. Hill, who is partly off the hook in the wake of Cincinnati's dual personal fouls, gained 50 yards and a score on 12 attempts. He struggled for the most part, however, as most of his yardage came on a 38-yard burst that featured an impressive cut.    The Bengals have several key free agents this offseason, including Nelson, Pacman Jones and "

   "comment":"Toussaint was given the ball, but was hit hard by Bradley Roby. He lost the fumble, and Denver recovered on its own 35. Peyton Manning had a chance to take the lead, but threw a pass right to Steelers' corner William Gay - not that there's anything wrong with that - but Gay dropped the ball, though Emmanuel Sanders helped by grazing it. An interception there in Denver territory would've all but sealed the victory for Pittsburgh, but the Broncos were given second life. They took advantage of it and drove down the field. They scored a touchdown, converted the 2-point conversion, and then stopped the Steelers, who called a couple of dumb plays that went no where. A front-door covering field goal and a back-door pushing kick later, and the Broncos walked away with a 7-point victory. I say the Broncos were fortunate to prevail because Manning and his receivers struggled immensely. Manning had a couple of nice passes, but most of his attempts were wobblers that either sailed out of bounds or bounced in front of his targets. Meanwhile, his supporting cast was guilty of a whopping 5 drops. Also, Manning's longest pass, a 34-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders, should've never happened. Manning, who was about to be sacked, gave himself up to avoid a hit, like he usually does. However, he realized he wasn't touched, so he got up and fired a shot to an open Sanders despite the fact that some Steelers stopped playing. An irate Mike Tomlin tried to challenge the call, but it was ruled unreviewable for some reason. Manning's final numbers weren't terrible, but they resembled his other playoff choke-job performances. He went 21-of-37 for 222 yards and no touchdowns. Again, Manning was extremely lucky to get away with a victory and no turnovers, and a big chunk of his yardage was a complete fluke. If the Steelers hadn't fumbled deep in Denver territory, he would've been 1-and-done once again.    Of the 5 drops, Demaryius Thomas was guilty of the first 1. Thomas struggled for the most part, catching just 4 passes for 40 yards. He left temporarily with an injury in the third quarter, but managed to return a bit later and eventually caught a 2-point conversion following Denver's sole touchdown.    Sanders had the second drop, but he led the team with 5 catches for 85 yards. With Manning struggling, Sanders and Thomas were the only players who logged more than 2 receptions.    C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman both committed drops as well. They had an equal workload, but Anderson was once again the better back. Anderson gained 72 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries, while Ronnie Hillman's 16 attempts went for just 38 yards. Most of Anderson's yardage came on a 34-yard burst, and he also had another big gain (28 yards), but that was called back because of a holding penalty by Michael Schofield, who couldn't break free from the opposing pass-rusher.    As for the Steelers, there was some question as to Ben Roethlisberger's health heading into this contest. Roethlisberger proved his arm strength wasn't an issue on his first throw, as he launched a bomb to Markus Wheaton, which was overthrown. Roethlisberger played well for the most part, considering that A) he didn't have Antonio Brown, and B) he was battling 1 of the top defenses in the NFL. Roethlisberger went 24-of-37 for 339 yards. His numbers would've been even better had Markus Wheaton not dropped a touchdown on a fourth-down attempt in the first quarter. Like the Broncos, Pittsburgh was guilty of numerous drops as well.    Martavis Bryant, who was guilty of a drop, was an absolute monster. The Broncos had no hope of covering him, as Bryant snatched 9 passes for 154 yards. He also ran for 40 yards on a reverse, which set up Pittsburgh's first touchdown.    With Brown out, some other Steelers had to pick up the slack. Third-round rookie Sammie Coates appeared to be that guy when he caught a deep pass early, but he finished with just 2 receptions for 61 yards. Wheaton (5-30), as mentioned, should've caught a touchdown.    Bryant was actually the Steelers' leading rusher. Toussaint had no room to do anything, though he did score a touchdown. He finished with 39 yards on 12 carries, but was guilty of that horrible fumble that gave Denver the victory.    The Steelers need to upgrade their punter, who struggled mightily. The secondary is a more pressing issue, so I have them addressing that area in my 2016 NFL Mock Draft. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "
