   "comment":"Harris for 31 yards.The first play of the second quarter saw Anquan Boldin out-fight Janoris Jenkins to catch a pass and coast into the end zone with a 33-yard score after Jenkins fell down. San Francisco added a field goal and the Rams answered with 1 of their own. The 49ers tried to set up a screen, but Aaron Donald tipped the pass. Eugene Sims picked it off and ran it 42 yards to San Francisco's 4-yard line. Tre Mason then ran the ball into the end zone for the score. The Rams quickly got the ball back, and Benny Cunningham ripped off a 40-yard run. That set up 1 more field goal, and St. Louis took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bruce Ellington got open running deep and Blaine Gabbert hit him for 44 yards. The 49ers settled for another Phil Dawson field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, "

   "comment":"Harris, who ran untouched down the sideline for a 47-yard touchdown. Just seconds later though, Ingram took off on a 75-yard touchdown run to put the Saints up 28-10. The 49ers' next drive saw a 31-yard pass to Garrett Celek set up another Dawson field goal. Just before the half, Kaerpernick hit Vance McDonald on a short crossing route, and McDonald turned down the field to run 65 yards for a touchdown. The Saints had completely busted coverage as they forgot to account for McDonald. In the final minute before the half, Brees ripped the ball down the field to get a field goal and a 31-20 lead at intermission. The 49ers opened the third quarter by moving the ball quickly down the field, but Nate Stupar forced a fumble from Mike Davis at the 1.yard line and New Orleans recovered the loose ball. The 49ers got the ball back after forcing a 4.and-out, however, and produced a field goal drive. Late in the third quarter, the Saints missed a long field goal, but Brees threw some beautiful passes, including a 32-yard touchdown to Thomas. It was a tremendous juggling catch by Thomas along the sideline. New Orleans added a field goal and then stopped the 49ers on a 4.h down in the red zone as Kaepernick fumbled the snap away. In garbage time, Kenny Vaccaro forced another fumble that was recovered by the Saints.    Brees completed 28-of-39 passes for 323 yards with 3 touchdowns. Thomas led the Saints with 5 receptions for 73 yards and 2 scores. Brandin Cooks (5-66) chipped in as well for New Orleans.    Tim Hightower (23-87-1) and Mark Ingram (15-158-1 rushing, 2-13-1 receiving) ran wild on the 49ers. It was good for Ingram to get back on track after being demoted for fumbling issues.    Kapernick was 24-of-39 for 398 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. His touchdowns were lucky plays and the result of terrible defense by the Saints.    DuJuan Harris (10-59 rushing, 5-83-1 receiving) was San Francisco's best offensive weapon with Carlos Hyde out.   "
