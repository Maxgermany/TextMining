San Francisco added a field goal and the Rams answered with 1 of their own. The 49ers tried to set up a screen, but Aaron Donald tipped the pass. Eugene Sims picked it off and ran it 42 yards to San Francisco's 4-yard line. Tre Mason then ran the ball into the end zone for the score. The Rams quickly got the ball back, and Benny Cunningham ripped off a 40-yard run. That set up 1 more field goal, and St. Louis took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bruce Ellington got open running deep and Blaine Gabbert hit him for 44 yards. The 49ers settled for another Phil Dawson field goal. In the 4.h quarter, Gabbert connected with Torrey Smith for 31 yards and then Harris for 21 yards. That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal.
