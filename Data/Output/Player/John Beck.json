   "comment":"John Beck. Philadelphia caught many breaks. Here are some examples: - There was a bogus roughing-the-passer penalty called on QB Dog Killer on what could have been a safety in the first quarter. The official said the hit was helmet-to-helmet, but QBDK was trying to scramble around and that actually forced the ugly-looking hit. It definitely didn't deserve any sort of yellow flag, though I'm sure Tom Jackson would vehemently disagree. Fortunately for the Eagles, they were awarded a free first down and subsequently scored a touchdown. - QBDK threw a pass behind "

   "comment":"John Beck John Blegh.)    I anticipated a defensive struggle and was not disappointed. Late in the first half, neither team had reached 100 total yards. The Redskins did start with a bang. Rookie Roy Helu Jr., who got the start at running back, ran around the edge for 16 yards on the first play from scrimmage. Unfortunately, Helu (10 rushes for 41 yards) would average just 2.5 yards per carry the rest of the game. Even with Ray McDonald out on the defensive front, the 49ers were not budging. Starting in his place was Ricky Jean Francois, no doubt pumped over his alma mater LSU's huge win the previous night. Two short runs and a failed pass to Terrence Austin later, the opening possession ended in a punt. San Francisco's offense was just a little more functional in this 1 even though they only drove more than 40 yards once. Their first drive was stopped by a funky shift that resulted in a penalty on 3rd-and-1 from the Washington 49. Head coach Jim Harbaugh clearly felt it should not have been a penalty for inducing the defense to jump and therefore an illegal motion penalty. Nevertheless, needing to throw, Alex Smith was crunched by rookie Ryan Kerrigan for a sack. After a quick exchange of punts, Washington mounted a bit of offense, digging its way out from their own 3-yard line to reach the 37 thanks in part to a pair of 5-yard penalties. However, John Beck (30-for-47 254 yards 1 TD, 1 INT) was picked off by Dashon Goldson."
