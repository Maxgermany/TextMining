   "comment":"Tyler Boyd was down. I don't know if they would've won, but covering is far more important than winning. What, you don't agree?    The much-anticipated slobber-knocker between the Steelers and Bengals wasn't quite as chippy as their recent matchups with just 5 penalties for each team, and in turn, we had a game that wasn't bogged down with delays all day. The Bengals outgained the Steelers, 412 yards to 374, and won the first-down contest with 21 to the Steelers 19, but the Steelers' red-zone defense and strong rushing game were the deciding factors as the Steelers never trailed on their way to a 24-16 win. Rain was a constant factor in this matchup, slowing down the offenses and causing some mistakes, and slowing down the Bengals' passing game. Andy Dalton threw the ball 54 times, the most he's ever thrown the ball in a game, so his 366 yards passing and 1 touchdown don't look quite as good in that light.    The Steelers put safety help on A.J. Green, and that along with the wet conditions helped them hold him down to just 2 receptions for 38 yards on 8 targets. Cincinnati's leading receiver this week was Giovani Bernard, who caught 9-of-11 targets for 100 yards and a touchdown. His ability after the catch was a big factor, and kept the Bengals at least within striking distance.    The Bengals had no luck on the ground against Pittsburgh's front 4. and Jeremy Hill ran for just 22 yards on 11 carries. For the day, the Steelers allowed just 2.6 yards per carry and 46 total rushing yards. That, plus the Steelers' lead throughout, kept the Bengals throwing the ball, and Dalton wasn't up to the task in the rain, as he dinked and dunked and had trouble sustaining drives.    Ben Roethlisberger was also not sharp and seemed to have trouble throwing the ball accurately in the rain. He made some great throws in between the sloppy 1., but the base of the offense in this game was DeAngelo Williams, who continued to show patience and burst on his way to 132 total yards and a receiving touchdown on a whopping 36 touches. The Steelers must feel they have the luxury of running Williams into the ground with Le'Veon Bell returning in Week 4, because he's now touched the ball 68 times this year. On the season, Williams has 313 total yards and 3 touchdowns.    The Bengals continued to do a great job slowing Antonio Brown down. He had 11 targets, but caught just 4 for 39 yards. Brown had 1 drop, and he and Roethlisberger weren't on the same page as Adam Jones also did a good job of tracking Brown most of the day.    Dalton was at his worst in the red zone. After getting a pass-interference call down 17-6 in the third quarter to take the Bengals down to Pittsburgh's 1-yard line, Dalton and company couldn't do anything on 3 tries at the goal line. Cincinnati ended up settling for a field goal to leave the team down 17-9, and that was the crux of the game.    The Bengals did make a late run down 8 points, but rookie Tyler Boyd fumbled after making a 6.yard reception, ending a good drive. The call was close, but Boyd's knee did appear to be down before the ball came out.    The good news for the Steelers, besides getting a divisional win, is that they won without a strong game from Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown. The Steelers' defense is of course their weakness in most games, but it came up big in big situations this week.   "
