  "comment":"DeAndre Washington had the ball pop out of his hands. Linebacker Matt Milano secured it, and he ran back the distance to give the Bills the lead. Milano would recover another fumble in the third quarter when Jalen Richard coughed up a punt return. That set up a field goal. The Bills drilled another 3.pointer a bit later when Derek Carr lofted an underthrown pass that was picked off. And just like that, the Bills were up 20-7 and never looked back.    Despite what I said about the Bills turning the Raiders over numerous times, I don't want to take anything away from Tyrod Taylor and the rest of the offense, which was extremely efficient in this contest. The Raiders, like the Bills, were missing multiple starters in the secondary, and Taylor took advantage of it. Taylor misfired just 7 times, going 20-of-27 for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). The passing yardage number isn't an impressive figure, but because the Bills had the lead for most of the afternoon, Taylor didn't have to force anything downfield. What's important is that any time that Buffalo needed a big play to keep a drive alive, Taylor would deliver.    Of course, Buffalo's best player happened to be LeSean McCoy, who gashed NaVorro Bowman and the Raiders for 151 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He also caught 6 passes for 22 yards. Oakland simply had no answer for McCoy despite Bowman now being in the center of the defense.    Buffalo's leading receiver was Andre Holmes, who got revenge against his former team, catching 3 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown. Jordan Matthews (3-21) had a big gain nullified by penalty. Even Zay Jones got into the mix, snatching 3 receptions for 32 yards. It was a miracle that he didn't have any huge drops.    Meanwhile, Carr posted some misleading stats. He finished 31-of-49 for 313 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. A bulk of Carr's yardage came on a meaningless drive in the 4.h quarter. He didn't look like himself, and it didn't appear as though the Raiders were willing to trust him in the early going, as they called for a run on a third-and-2 play. Carr spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, so it's fair to wonder when he'll be 100 percent.    While Carr regressed, the same could be said for Amari Cooper, who was a shell of the dominant player we saw on a recent Thursday night. Cooper caught 5 of his 10 targets for 48 yards. Michael Crabtree was way more productive, hauling in 5 balls for 83 yards.    Despite the fumble, DeAndre Washington had a strong fantasy outing as a receiver, catching 8 passes for 62 yards and a touchdown. He also led the team in rushing (6-26), outgaining Richard (5-21), so despite the error, the Raiders should consider utilizing Washington over the ineffective Marshawn Lynch.   ",
