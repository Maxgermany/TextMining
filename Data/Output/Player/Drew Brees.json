   "comment":"Drew Brees was 18-of-32 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he leaned on his running game more than anything. Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush combined for 182 yards on 26 carries. Thomas had a rushing touchdown, while Bush also had 3 catches, 26 receiving yards and an aerial score.    Marques Colston and Lance Moore disappointed their fantasy owners, catching just 3 passes each. Moore and Colston had 35 and 26 yards, respectively. Neither wideout found the end zone.    Jeremy Shockey led the Saints in receptions with 5 (64 yards).    If the Falcons would have pulled this game off - and they led in the 4.h quarter, so that was a very realistic possibility - I would have led with Matt Ryan converting a third-and-21 with a 28-yard hook-up to Roddy White being 1 of the key moments of his young career. Unfortunately, that drive culminated in a chip-shot field goal from New Orleans' 5-yard line.    Despite the loss, Ryan continued to impress despite being a mere rookie. Ryan finished 24-of-33 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    Ryan found Roddy White 10 times for 164 yards. His touchdown, however, went to Brian Finneran (yes, he's still in the league.)    Michael Turner rushed for just 61 yards, but only received 18 carries, as this game turned into a shootout very early. Fantasy owners were happy to see that he found the end zone once, at least.    <b> Dan Marino Record Watch: </b> Drew Brees now has exactly 4,100 passing yards on the season. He's on pace for 5,046 yards. Dan Marino had 5,084 yards in 1984.   "

   "comment":"Drew Brees tossed an interception. The Saints then went 3.and-out on their second possession.    Despite Payton's debacled game plan and a 21-7 deficit at halftime, the Saints were able to stay in this contest because of Chicago's anemic offense. Save for Devin Hester and Greg Olsen, the Bears receivers couldn't catch anything. In fact, Rashied Davis dropped a pass that deflected into the arms of a Saints defensive back. Orton was also horrific, going 24-of-40 for 172 yards, including a telegraphed pass to New Orleans linebacker Scott Fujita. Worst of all, the Bears couldn't get the running game going. It didn't even look like they wanted to. I know Matt Forte left the game in the first quarter with a toe injury, which must have scared all of his fantasy owners half to death, but he came back in the beginning of the second quarter. At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

On the bright side, Brees became the second quarterback in NFL history to eclipse the 5,000-yard barrier. Brees was 30-of-49 for 386 yards, 4 touchdowns and a pick.    "

Brees helped the Saints convert 9-of-13 third downs, and had to call in the punt unit only twice.    The biggest story to me, on the other hand, is the play of New Orleans' defense. You may look at the score and say, The same old Saints gave up 27 points. Doing so would be ignorant; Detroit's first touchdown was set up on a great punt return. A later touchdown was a fumble return. New Orleans really gave up 13 points and allowed only 14 first downs to the Lions.    The biggest story to the fantasy world is the emergence of "

   "comment":"Drew Brees a short, 15-yard field. - A drive and a New Orleans touchdown later, Freeman had another interception at midfield that led to yet another Saints end-zone trip. By then, it was 31-7 New Orleans, and 3 Freeman turnovers were responsible for 17 of those points. Freeman finished just 17-of-33 for 126 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. He made some nice throws at times and had 2 separate scrambles of 15 yards. However, he really needs to cut down on the turnovers. They really killed the Buccaneers on Sunday.    With Freeman struggling, no Tampa skill player did much. It is worth noting, however, that Antonio Bryant caught 3 balls for 40 yards. He'll be more of a factor soon once he's fully healthy.    Other Buccaneers of significance: Cadillac Williams (11 carries, 32 yards), Kellen Winslow Jr. (5 catches, 29 yards).    Constantly being handed short fields, Drew Brees didn't get a chance to pad his yardage numbers - he finished with 187 yards - but he had 3 touchdowns in this contest.    "

   "comment":"Drew Brees line up under center. This was clearly a ruse to get Cincinnati to jump offsides, and the Bengals fell for it. A play later, Brees found Marques Colston for the 3-yard decisive touchdown.    It's a shame Cincinnati ruined a potential victory because they played really well. They had the defending Super Bowl champions down late, as Carson Palmer played his best game in a very long time. Palmer went 23-of-33 for 249 yards and a touchdown. Both Chad Ochocinco (5-96) and Terrell Owens (6-47, TD) were heavily involved on offense.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, put together yet another magnificent game-winning drive. It's just amazing how he can keep doing this every single week. Brees finished 24-of-29 for 313 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The Saints probably could have ran away with a victory - they led 20-6 at 1 point - but they killed themselves with a with a whopping 11 penalties.    The Saints may not care when Pierre Thomas comes back. "

   "comment":"Drew Brees scored another touchdown to put his team up 14-0. At that point, Bradford had no chance. It's very difficult for any young quarterback to play in the raucous Superdome, let alone 1 who has a 14-0 deficit. Bradford really struggled from that point on, finishing 18-of-32 for 231 yards and 2 interceptions. He also missed a wide-open receiver for a potential touchdown in the third quarter.    One play that you won't see on <i> SportsCenter</i> was Bradford's effort on another Jackson fumble. Jackson coughed up the ball in the 4.h quarter, and Bradford impressively ran down safety Roman Harper. The play was inconsequential - the call was overturned, so it wasn't even a real fumble - but this was a great effort play by the rookie quarterback, who will undoubtedly earn even more respect from his teammates.    The Rams kicked field goals early, which is never a good strategy against the Saints. Drew Brees was highly efficient, going 25-of-40 for 221 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions (1 of which was a late deep ball). He converted 11-of-16 third downs and did a great job keeping the ball away from St. Louis. Two of Brees' touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Drew Brees and even picked him off twice. It really looked like Houston was about to take the next step. - But as usual, the Texans withered down the stretch, choking for what seems like the billionth time in franchise history. Suddenly, Brees was the quarterback who couldn't be stopped (31-44, 370, 3 TDs, 2 INTs). Schaub also tossed a horrible 4.h-quarter pick with the lead. There's no excuse for that. In my 2011 Houston Texans season preview, I expressed concern with Schaub being able to perform in the clutch, listing his awful 4.h-quarter and overtime numbers when the game is close. Well, it appears as though nothing has changed. Well, scratch that. The Colts are a non-factor, so maybe the Texans can sneak into the playoffs by winning an awful AFC South. Maybe...    Other numbers of note: - "

   "comment":"Drew Brees and a finesse offensive line. The signal-caller was sacked repeatedly and was constantly under pressure. Kaepernick, meanwhile, played well overall, completing 16-of-25 passes for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception while running for 27 yards and a score on 6 carries. San Francisco is a different team and more dangerous on offense with Kaepernick at quarterback instead of Alex Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by "

   "comment":"Drew Brees was unbelievable, going 37-of-53 for 446 yards and 3 touchdowns - numbers that could have been even better if his targets hadn't dropped about half-a-dozen passes. The Cowboys just couldn't get New Orleans' offense off the field; Brees was an unreal 11-of-19 on third down, as it helped that Dallas simply didn't seem to realize that Brees was capable of throwing short passes to his backs. And on 1 instance on a goal-to-go in the 4.h quarter, Dallas actually had just 9 defenders on the field, but the Saints called timeout because the clock was running down.    Four New Orleans players hauled in at least 7 receptions: "

Drew Brees was amazing in this victory. He let the ball hit the ground on just 8 occasions, going 26-of-34 for 332 yards and a whopping 5 touchdowns.

   "comment":"Drew Brees roughing-the-passer penalty? He wasn't hit in the head or neck area; it was at the top of his chest. That cost the 49ers a victory. Then again, the officials tried to screw the Saints as well at other moments. I guess it's fitting that this game concluded with a push.    With Carolina on the rise, the Saints needed a win to remain in control of the NFC South, and they got it thanks to a collective team effort of big plays on offense, defense and special teams. In back-to-back weeks, the 49ers have lost close games to the top 2 teams in the NFC South. While San Francisco still controls its playoff destiny, these losses have the potential to bite the franchise when it comes to tie-breakers.    After starting at New Orleans' 3.yard line early in the game, the Saints' Mark Ingram (6-25) had a good run, and Drew Brees got the ball into the 49ers' territory with a deep cross to Robert Meachem that the wideout turned down the field for a 44-yard gain."

He should be able to eclipse that mark as well; the Raiders will offer very little resistance next week, and Manning will have to play because the Patriots beat the Ravens, meaning Denver will have to triumph in Week 17 to secure homefield advantage, barring a New England loss to Buffalo.    However, all of this should be irrelevant. Manning has posted records and earned regular-season MVPs before, yet he's often come up short in the playoffs. His 2013 campaign will ultimately be measured by how successful he is beyond Week 17, meaning what happened in the first quarter of this contest is far more significant than Manning's flurry of touchdowns late in the game. On Houston's second possession, "

   "comment":"Drew Brees nearly connected on a couple of long throws, but members of the Atlanta secondary made great plays to negate those completions. Meanwhile, the Falcons bungled their own chances, as their only trip to the end zone came because official Bill Leavy threw a very late, bogus flag for pass interference, perhaps because he thought the Atlanta crowd was going to lynch him. Meanwhile, Julio Jones bungled his team's chances by fumbling in the red zone. This did not look like it was going to be Atlanta's day. And then Matt Ryan's second half happened. Ryan was 20-of-27 after intermission for a whopping 263 yards and 2 touchdowns. His overall numbers were also excellent (31-of-43, 448 yards, 3 TDs), as his yardage was the most in Atlanta history for a single game (and 6.h-most by anyone on opening weekend). He did a phenomenal job leading his team to a pair of field goal drives at the end of regulation and in overtime, though he was helped greatly by a Marques Colston fumble in the extra session. What's really impressive about Ryan's performance is that he did it against what was supposed to be a stellar defense (though they had about a billion missed tackles), all while being without first-round rookie left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the contest. Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. Devin Hester also had a big game. Meanwhile, Roddy White (5-72), Antone Smith and Levine Toilolo came up with Ryan's other scores.    The Falcons' 4 running backs all made contributions in this victory. Steven Jackson paced the group with 52 yards on 12 carries. Jacquizz Rodgers (6-34) and Smith scored. Fourth-round rookie Devonta Freeman did the least (2 carries, 15 yards; 2 catches, 18 rec. yards), but he made a crucial first down by refusing to be tackled.    Speaking of breaking tackles, Mark Ingram did plenty of that in this game. Ingram, who had a stellar preseason, rushed for 60 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored twice. Khiry Robinson (6-28) also found the end zone.    The 3 rushing touchdowns screwed over Drew Brees fantasy owners, who watched their quarterback do most of the work in between the 20s. Brees went 29-of-42 for 333 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The Falcons did a good job of pressuring him in the second half, doing just enough to slow him down a little bit, giving themselves a chance to pull out the victory. Brees was hot in the first half.

He then had a pick-six that popped into the air, and then his worst interception was a dying ball that was severely underthrown. Brees looked like his arm strength was sapped on that final pass, and that has to be a major concern for anyone affiliated with the Saints. Brees finished 35-of-57 for 371 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.

The Lions were limited to just 101 net yards in the opening half and just 5.1 yards per play overall, which is a mediocre figure.

   "comment":"Drew Brees were unstoppable in between the 20s, and every single possession in the first half led to some sort of scoring output. Everything changed, however, when the Packers were driving in the third quarter. They reached the red zone and had a nice scramble from Rodgers, but the Packer quarterback pulled up. He grabbed his left hamstring and shouted expletives. Cris Collinsworth picked up on it immediately, saying this was a huge deal for Green Bay. He was right, as the Packers were outscored from that point on, 28-7. Rodgers was on fire early, and it helped that he had all day to throw for the most part. That changed a bit after T.J. Lang went down with an ankle injury, but he was still able to drive down the field with ease, going 13-of-18 for 278 yards and a touchdown in the opening half. The hamstring ruined his evening, however, as he threw an interception a couple of plays following the scramble, which was a deflection off a throw into the end zone to Andrew Quarless. Rodgers then had another pick that was an inaccurate heave toward Davante Adams. He completely lost his mobility and couldn't escape pressure. Rodgers finished 28-of-39 for 418 yards, a pair of touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 interceptions. The good news for the Packers is that they have a bye coming up, so Rodgers will get to rest his hamstring before a divisional matchup against the Bears at home.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, was pretty much flawless, as he usually is in the Superdome. He misfired on just 5 attempts, going 27-of-32 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't let the ball hit the ground a single time in the second half, completing all 11 of his attempts for 124 yards. Some of his first-half misfires weren't even his fault. For example, "

The Saints, who showed absolutely no signs of desperation throughout the afternoon, couldn't even get more than 7 garbage-time points; that's how dismal this performance was on their part. Brees ultimately went 33-of-41 for 255 yards and a late, meaningless touchdown. The numbers don't look terrible, but all Brees did throughout the afternoon was dink and dunk. He and Sean Payton screwed up in the red zone yet again, as they squandered a scoring opportunity in the second quarter, coming away with zero points. So, what really happened? There's no logical reason why the Saints' top-ranked offense should sputter against an injury-ridden Cincinnati defense. The answer is "

Brees' numbers weren't terrible - he went 24-of-38 for 255 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception - but he compiled some of his numbers in meaningless action when the Buccaneers were up 23-7 entering the 4.h quarter. Brees' pick was an underthrown wobbler, and he was also strip-sacked, but the Saints managed to retain possession. Despite all of this, I don't want to say Brees is done. To be fair, he's not getting any help from his supporting cast. He was sacked 4 times, a high number for a quarterback who releases the ball so quickly. Brees was sacked thrice by some guy named "

He misfired on just 8 passes, going 33-of-41 for 359 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he doesn't have the same type of arm strength in the wake of his shoulder injury. Brees was fortunate to be battling a Dallas skeleton-crew defense that actually dropped a couple of potential interceptions. The Saints also had to rely on several illegal pick plays that weren't whistled by an incompetent officiating crew that blew calls for both teams in this contest.    Spiller ended up as New Orleans' top receiver, but prior to the game-winning score - the 400th touchdown in Brees' career, by the way - he had just 4 catches for 19 yards. He was barely a factor, so keep this in mind if you have wild ideas about plugging him into your lineup. Keep sticking with "

   "comment":"Drew Brees era in New Orleans. Payton is coaching like he has 1 foot out the door, and Brees looks done. They had a great run, but it's over.    The Texans' defense has been phenomenal over the past month, and they continued their dominant play by Drew Brees' streak of games with a touchdown pass at 45. Houston held New Orleans to a pair of field goals and shut out the Saints in the second half. Rob Ryan is gone, but the results are the same as New Orleans' defense struggled to contain "

   "comment":"Drew Brees. Winston's accuracy was an issue in this contest, though he was still better than Ryan this particular week.    Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver "

The Saints need to sign Brees to a contract extension and spread out his cap hit.    The New Orleans defense played relatively well against the Falcons. But this defense struggled throughout most of the season. It's clear that the Saints need to improve on defense. They have to look for help in the 2016 NFL Draft. A pass-rusher to go with Cam Heyward is desperately needed, and that's the direction the Saints should look in the draft. Penn State defensive end Carl Nassib could be a perfect fit.    The Saints also need to use the 2016 NFL Draft to upgrade their wide receiver corps. Veteran Marques Colston is near the end of his career. "

Brees was sacked just once, and he wasn't brought down until very late. It didn't matter though, as the Saints ultimately picked up the first down and won the game on that drive.

   "comment":"Drew Brees, basically allowing nothing to him until very late in the game when they were up multiple scores. It didn't help the Saints that Terron Armstead sustained an injury on the second drive, but New Orleans couldn't block the Chiefs' defensive front. The sack count might not seem low - Drew Brees was brought down only once - but the Saints' blockers were responsible for numerous holding penalties, which disrupted drives in the opening half. As a result, Brees was constantly stuck in third-and-long situations, and he threw a pick-six on the second drive, which was deflected. Stats can be deceiving, and that's the case here, as Brees went 37-of-48 for 367 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick-six. Brees definitely did not play poorly at all, but he wasn't as great as those stats indicate. He was very jittery in the pocket, as it was apparent that the Chiefs' pressure rattled him. The crowd noise was bothersome as well, as Brees took a delay-of-game penalty and had to waste a precious second-half timeout. He also missed some receivers, including "

   "comment":"Drew Brees, he had a shaky start to this game. He lost a fumble on a third down of the opening drives because he held on to the ball too long. The Panthers turned the short field into 3 points, though it was nearly worse for the Saints because the Panthers were stuffed at the 1-yard line on an impressive goal-line stand by New Orleans. After that, Brees launched an inaccurate interception, which led to a Carolina touchdown. Those 2 give-aways, plus a blocked field goal at the end of the first half that was immediately followed by Ginn's touchdown, is pretty much why Carolina had such a big lead. New Orleans' 3 turnovers turned into 17 points for Carolina, and the Saints just didn't have enough time to come back from that. Brees shook off the early turnovers and finished strong, going 35-of-44 for 285 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. Two passes of his were dropped, 1 of which was in the end zone.    "

   "comment":"Drew Brees wasn't on the field very often, and it seemed like he felt that he needed to force the issue. That was evident in the second half, which was when Brees launched all 3 of his interceptions. Two came in desperation time, while the other occurred when he was baited into a bad throw. Brees disappointed his fantasy owners, going 31-of-44 for 326 yards and the 3 picks. The afternoon didn't begin very well when a bad snap forced an intentional-grounding penalty on a third down, and it didn't get much better after that. Brees put together some nice drives, but really didn't have much of a chance because he wasn't on the field very much.    "

   "comment":"Drew Brees' 71.2 from 2011. Bradford, who went 25-of-33 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, finished with a 71.6-percent completion rate this year. I'm calling the record fraudulent because that's exactly what it is. Brees' 2011 campaign was 1 of the best quarterbacking seasons in NFL history. Brees tallied 5,476 yards and maintained a sterling 8.3 YPA. Bradford, on the other hand, achieved the high completion percentage because all he did was dink and dunk throughout the entire year. By comparison, Bradford failed to reach 4,000 yards and possessed a YPA of around 7. It's a shame for Brees because he actually deserved the record. Bradford does not. Bradford did play well in this game, though it needs to be noted that the Bears were missing several edge rushers. Bradford was seldom pressured, and he was able to shred Chicago's secondary as a result. His 1 blemish was the pick, which he forced into tight coverage.    With Bradford performing well, the Bears didn't have a chance, especially with "

   "comment":"Drew Brees at 38 years old. Then again, both future Hall of Famers are still playing so well that it is possible they will battle each other again in 4 years. The Patriots got themselves righted as Brady dominated the Saints' vulnerable defense. Brees moved the ball well at times, but New England's defense bounced back after the Week 1 disappointment, limiting the Saints enough. It was the 4.h straight season that New Orleans has started 0-2, and the Saints' defense once again looks incapable of supporting the offense with just average play.    The Patriots took the opening kickoff and marched down the field. Brady had a clutch third-and-long conversion to Rob Gronkowski before lofting in a pretty 19-yard touchdown to Rex Burkhead (3-41-1 receiving), who got past rookie linebacker Alex Anzalone. The Saints responded with a field goal drive led by some passing from Brees. Brady got New England on the move with a screen to Burkhead for 15 yards and then found Gronkowski, who got eventual separation from Anzalone. After hauling the pass in, Gronkowski broke a tackle and raced down the field for a 53-yard touchdown. Brady kept ripping the ball down the field using Gronkowski and Phillip Dorsett before lofting in an easy touchdown pass to Chris Hogan (5-78-1). New Orleans got moving with Alvin Kamara (3-51) making a leaping reception for 38 yards. Adrian Peterson then ran hard on 2 carries for a another first down before Brees found Brandon Coleman (4-82-1) open for a short touchdown pass. The Saints got the ball back, and a 42-yard pass to Coleman set up a field goal to cut New England's lead to 20-13. Brady responded with a drive using Gronkowski, Hogan and Brandin Cooks (2-37) to set up a short touchdown run for Mike Gillislee. New England tacked on a field goal drive to make it 30-13 at the half with Brady totaling 302 yards passing through 2 quarters.    Brady dominated New Orleans' defense, completing 30-of-39 passes for 447 yards and 3 touchdowns. Gronkowski had 6 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown. In the third quarter, however, he left the game with trainers as it looked like he injured his back, but it was said to be a groin injury. His durability has been problematic, so this was a bad omen for the Patriots and his fantasy owners.    Mike Gillislee ran for 69 yards with 1 touchdown on 18 carries.    Drew Brees completed 27-of-45 passes for 356 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions.    Adrian Peterson (8-26) and "

The Saints responded with a field goal drive led by some passing from Brees. Brady got New England on the move with a screen to Burkhead for 15 yards and then found Gronkowski, who got eventual separation from Anzalone. After hauling the pass in, Gronkowski broke a tackle and raced down the field for a 53-yard touchdown. Brady kept ripping the ball down the field using Gronkowski and Phillip Dorsett before lofting in an easy touchdown pass to Chris Hogan (5-78-1). New Orleans got moving with Alvin Kamara (3-51) making a leaping reception for 38 yards. Adrian Peterson then ran hard on 2 carries for a another first down before Brees found Brandon Coleman (4-82-1) open for a short touchdown pass. The Saints got the ball back, and a 42-yard pass to Coleman set up a field goal to cut New England's lead to 20-13. Brady responded with a drive using Gronkowski, Hogan and Brandin Cooks (2-37) to set up a short touchdown run for Mike Gillislee. New England tacked on a field goal drive to make it 30-13 at the half with Brady totaling 302 yards passing through 2 quarters.    Brady dominated New Orleans' defense, completing 30-of-39 passes for 447 yards and 3 touchdowns. Gronkowski had 6 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown. In the third quarter, however, he left the game with trainers as it looked like he injured his back, but it was said to be a groin injury. His durability has been problematic, so this was a bad omen for the Patriots and his fantasy owners.    Mike Gillislee ran for 69 yards with 1 touchdown on 18 carries.    Drew Brees completed 27-of-45 passes for 356 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions.    Adrian Peterson (8-26) and "

   "comment":"Drew Brees and his running backs, as they were guilty of some miserable tackling. They also generated zero pass rush. By the time the Saints were up 45-10, they were averaging 7.6 yards per play. That's almost a first down on every single snap! There was some late-game nonsense to trim the margin to a couple of touchdowns, but make no mistake about it; this game was never close desptite the final score.    Brees finished with some misleading stats. The final numbers say he was 21-of-31 for 186 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. However, he was 12-of-14 for 148 yards and a touchdown in the opening half. The Saints fell asleep following intermission, and when Brees had to begin throwing the ball again, he was out of rhythm with his receivers. Neither of his picks were his fault either; the first occurred when "

Hundley turned into an inaccurate pumpkin late in the game, while the defense suddenly couldn't keep the Saints out of the end zone. New Orleans outscored Green Bay in the second half, 19-3, picking up a 9.point victory.    Brees proved to be way too lethal for Green Bay's defense to handle in the second half. Just take a look at his stats following intermission: 14-of-18 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Packers simply couldn't get off the field against him.

   "comment":"Drew Brees and his high-powered offense off the board in the Superdome. Chicago's defense did a good job, limiting the Saints to 20, but Mitchell Trubisky just didn't have the experience or the supporting cast to pull the big upset. While the Saints technically scored 20, it was really just 16, as an early field goal turned into a touchdown because the Bears were offside on the kick. Alvin Kamara scored a touchdown on the very next play, which was huge because it allowed New Orleans to maintain the lead throughout the afternoon. Drew Brees, as a result, didn't have to force poor throws against Chicago's fierce defense. Brees actually misfired on just 5 occasions, going 23-of-28 for 299 yards. He failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all season, but he didn't need to.    "
