   "comment":"Drew Brees was 18-of-32 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he leaned on his running game more than anything. Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush combined for 182 yards on 26 carries. Thomas had a rushing touchdown, while Bush also had 3 catches, 26 receiving yards and an aerial score.    Marques Colston and Lance Moore disappointed their fantasy owners, catching just 3 passes each. Moore and Colston had 35 and 26 yards, respectively. Neither wideout found the end zone.    Jeremy Shockey led the Saints in receptions with 5 (64 yards).    If the Falcons would have pulled this game off - and they led in the 4.h quarter, so that was a very realistic possibility - I would have led with Matt Ryan converting a third-and-21 with a 28-yard hook-up to Roddy White being 1 of the key moments of his young career. Unfortunately, that drive culminated in a chip-shot field goal from New Orleans' 5-yard line.    Despite the loss, Ryan continued to impress despite being a mere rookie. Ryan finished 24-of-33 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    Ryan found Roddy White 10 times for 164 yards. His touchdown, however, went to Brian Finneran (yes, he's still in the league.)    Michael Turner rushed for just 61 yards, but only received 18 carries, as this game turned into a shootout very early. Fantasy owners were happy to see that he found the end zone once, at least.    <b> Dan Marino Record Watch: </b> Drew Brees now has exactly 4,100 passing yards on the season. He's on pace for 5,046 yards. Dan Marino had 5,084 yards in 1984.   "

It didn't even look like they wanted to.

At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued.

   "comment":"Drew Brees. Brees absolutely lit up Detroit's hapless defense, going 26-of-34 for 358 yards, 6 touchdowns and a pick. Brees helped the Saints convert 9-of-13 third downs, and had to call in the punt unit only twice.    The biggest story to me, on the other hand, is the play of New Orleans' defense. You may look at the score and say, The same old Saints gave up 27 points. Doing so would be ignorant; Detroit's first touchdown was set up on a great punt return. A later touchdown was a fumble return. New Orleans really gave up 13 points and allowed only 14 first downs to the Lions.    The biggest story to the fantasy world is the emergence of Brees.

The good news is that the Saints have a bye week to get Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush healthy. New Orleans hosts Seattle in Week 11, so we should know by then if they've gotten their act together.

Backup running back Earnest Graham then had a 34-yard run and a 19-yard screen pass to set up a field goal for the Buccaneers.

Late in the second quarter, he caught a deflected pass to set up Tampa Bay in excellent field position. A few plays later, Freeman threw a dart to a wide receiver for a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Buccaneers' defense came to play, as they intercepted Brees twice in the first half along with their forced fumble. Tampa Bay led 20-10 at halftime.

Kaepernick, meanwhile, played well overall, completing 16-of-25 passes for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception while running for 27 yards and a score on 6 carries. San Francisco is a different team and more dangerous on offense with Kaepernick at quarterback instead of Alex Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by Brees and a finesse offensive line.

   "comment":"Drew Brees nearly connected on a couple of long throws, but members of the Atlanta secondary made great plays to negate those completions. Meanwhile, the Falcons bungled their own chances, as their only trip to the end zone came because official Bill Leavy threw a very late, bogus flag for pass interference, perhaps because he thought the Atlanta crowd was going to lynch him. Meanwhile, Julio Jones bungled his team's chances by fumbling in the red zone. This did not look like it was going to be Atlanta's day. And then Matt Ryan's second half happened. Ryan was 20-of-27 after intermission for a whopping 263 yards and 2 touchdowns. His overall numbers were also excellent (31-of-43, 448 yards, 3 TDs), as his yardage was the most in Atlanta history for a single game (and 6.h-most by anyone on opening weekend). He did a phenomenal job leading his team to a pair of field goal drives at the end of regulation and in overtime, though he was helped greatly by a Marques Colston fumble in the extra session. What's really impressive about Ryan's performance is that he did it against what was supposed to be a stellar defense (though they had about a billion missed tackles), all while being without first-round rookie left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the contest. Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. Devin Hester also had a big game. Meanwhile, Roddy White (5-72), Antone Smith and Levine Toilolo came up with Ryan's other scores.    The Falcons' 4 running backs all made contributions in this victory. Steven Jackson paced the group with 52 yards on 12 carries. Jacquizz Rodgers (6-34) and Smith scored. Fourth-round rookie Devonta Freeman did the least (2 carries, 15 yards; 2 catches, 18 rec. yards), but he made a crucial first down by refusing to be tackled.    Speaking of breaking tackles, Mark Ingram did plenty of that in this game. Ingram, who had a stellar preseason, rushed for 60 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored twice. Khiry Robinson (6-28) also found the end zone.    The 3 rushing touchdowns screwed over Drew Brees fantasy owners, who watched their quarterback do most of the work in between the 20s. Brees went 29-of-42 for 333 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The Falcons did a good job of pressuring him in the second half, doing just enough to slow him down a little bit, giving themselves a chance to pull out the victory. Brees was hot in the first half.

He had a third pick, which occurred prior to halftime. He carelessly heaved a ball in the 2-minute drill, leading to a Tampa Bay touchdown, which inexplicably came right after a New Orleans timeout. He then had a pick-six that popped into the air, and then his worst interception was a dying ball that was severely underthrown. Brees looked like his arm strength was sapped on that final pass, and that has to be a major concern for anyone affiliated with the Saints. Brees finished 35-of-57 for 371 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.

   "comment":"Drew Brees were unstoppable in between the 20s, and every single possession in the first half led to some sort of scoring output. Everything changed, however, when the Packers were driving in the third quarter. They reached the red zone and had a nice scramble from Rodgers, but the Packer quarterback pulled up. He grabbed his left hamstring and shouted expletives. Cris Collinsworth picked up on it immediately, saying this was a huge deal for Green Bay. He was right, as the Packers were outscored from that point on, 28-7. Rodgers was on fire early, and it helped that he had all day to throw for the most part. That changed a bit after T.J. Lang went down with an ankle injury, but he was still able to drive down the field with ease, going 13-of-18 for 278 yards and a touchdown in the opening half. The hamstring ruined his evening, however, as he threw an interception a couple of plays following the scramble, which was a deflection off a throw into the end zone to Andrew Quarless. Rodgers then had another pick that was an inaccurate heave toward Davante Adams. He completely lost his mobility and couldn't escape pressure. Rodgers finished 28-of-39 for 418 yards, a pair of touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 interceptions. The good news for the Packers is that they have a bye coming up, so Rodgers will get to rest his hamstring before a divisional matchup against the Bears at home.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, was pretty much flawless, as he usually is in the Superdome. He misfired on just 5 attempts, going 27-of-32 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't let the ball hit the ground a single time in the second half, completing all 11 of his attempts for 124 yards. Some of his first-half misfires weren't even his fault.

   "comment":"Drew Brees (who torched them), an injured Cam Newton, Ryan Tannehill, Christian Ponder, Jay Cutler.Brees (who torched them), an injured Cam Newton, Ryan Tannehill, Christian Ponder, Jay Cutler. Not exactly the group that will be playing in the Pro Bowl. Brady (on a neutral field), Russell Wilson, Peyton Manning (assuming he's healthy), Andrew Luck, Ben Roethlisberger, and even Philip Rivers and Joe Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.    Of course, the Packers will be favored against all of those teams because of Aaron Rodgers, who was mostly spectacular in this contest. With no pressure in his face for nearly the entire game, he was able to go 24-of-36 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 5 scrambles for 28 rushing yards. There was some complacency in the second half, however. Rodgers wasn't nearly as sharp as he was prior to intermission, completing just 6-of-11 attempts. He missed an open Jordy Nelson for a touchdown (he connected with him, but Nelson had to dive for an inaccurate ball). His teammates seemed to be out of sync as well, as Eddie Lacy dropped a pass, while the special teams didn't have enough players on the field for a punt. As a result, the Packers nearly squandered their 31-7 lead. The Falcons scored 4 touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, ultimately covering the spread.    Lacy gashed the Falcons in the early going. He ripped through Atlanta's poor defense and had 56 yards and a touchdown by halftime. However, he finished with 73 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown, as Atlanta clamped down on the run in the second half - save for a big James Starks gain at the very end. Starks actually outgained Lacy as a result, finishing with 75 yards and a score on 10 attempts, though Lacy had the better fantasy day because he caught 5 balls for 33 receiving yards and a second touchdown.    Rodgers' other scores went to Jordy Nelson, who reeled in 8 of 10 targets for a whopping 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. No other Packer had more than 58 receiving yards, however, with Randall Cobb holding that distinction on 4 catches.    As for the Falcons, I already mentioned Jones' dominance. I have to emphasize how incredible he was. He caught 11 balls for a ridiculous 259 yards and a touchdown. The Packers looked completely clueless trying to stop him, and he would've had a bigger night, but 3 things happened: First, Jones nearly had a second score, but could only get 1 foot inbounds. Second, he was tackled at the 3-yard line on a 79-yard gain. And third, he was knocked out of the game with an injury. He wasn't present on the field for Atlanta's final offensive drive, though the Falcons found the end zone anyway for the dreaded backdoor cover.    Matt Ryan was terrific in the second half. He finished 24-of-39 for 375 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but he was 18-of-25 for 263 yards and a quartet of scores following intermission. His pick was a poor decision, as he threw the ball toward Devin Hester without looking while under pressure. However, he rebounded and nearly led an unbelievable comeback. Though the Falcons lost, their outlook in terms of winning the division is positive because Ryan is performing on a much higher level than Brees.    Excluding Jones, the players who reeled in Ryan's touchdowns were Roddy White (3-42), who barely did anything prior to Jones getting hurt, Harry Douglas (2-11) and Eric Weems.    Steven Jackson, meanwhile, looked functional for the second week in a row. He gained 50 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Most of his yardage came in the first half, but the Falcons had to abandon the run for the most part because they were so far behind. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

He misfired on just 8 passes, going 33-of-41 for 359 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he doesn't have the same type of arm strength in the wake of his shoulder injury. Brees was fortunate to be battling a Dallas skeleton-crew defense that actually dropped a couple of potential interceptions. The Saints also had to rely on several illegal pick plays that weren't whistled by an incompetent officiating crew that blew calls for both teams in this contest.    Spiller ended up as New Orleans' top receiver, but prior to the game-winning score - the 400th touchdown in Brees' career, by the way - he had just 4 catches for 19 yards. He was barely a factor, so keep this in mind if you have wild ideas about plugging him into your lineup. Keep sticking with "

If not, it's a bit fitting that the team and city's resurgence began with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown in the home opener in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the last hurrah for the same regime occurred with yet another blocked punt for a touchdown versus Atlanta. Up 7-0, Brees and Sean Payton will be in New Orleans next season. If not, it's a bit fitting that the team and city's resurgence began with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown in the home opener in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the last hurrah for the same regime occurred with yet another blocked punt for a touchdown versus Atlanta. Up 7-0, Michael Mauti echoed the memories of Steve Gleason, blocking the ball and falling on it in the end zone. The crowd, which already cheered Gleason, who was in the building to be honored, was ignited even more. Though the Falcons snugged up the margin to 1 touchdown, the Saints eventually exploded out to a 3.score lead to keep their season alive. They now stand at 2-4, so they're not dead - at least not yet. The Falcons, meanwhile, sustained their first loss. It was a mistake-filled night for them, as they constantly killed themselves with turnovers. The blocked punt wasn't even the initial error, as Matt Ryan fumbled a snap on a 4.h down of the opening drive. After that, Tevin Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a 4.h turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers are misleading because of the 2 lost fumbles and the red-zone miscues, but Ryan didn't have a bad outing. He was betrayed by his supporting cast; he suffered through several drops and was sacked on 5 occasions, thrice by Cameron Jordan.    The big story prior to the game was whether or not Julio Jones would play. Jones took the field and didn't appear to be limited. He caught 6 passes for 93 yards. Ryan didn't have enough time in the pocket to find Jones as much as he wanted to. Because of this, Ryan frequently tossed checkdowns to Devonta Freeman, who once again had a great game. He caught 8 passes for 56 receiving yards and a touchdown to go along with some fantastic rushing numbers (13 carries, 100 rushing yards, TD). Freeman had a drop late, but it was his only blemish during the evening. Freeman was also helped by Coleman's aforementioned lost fumble. Not that Freeman was going to lose his job to Coleman, or anything, but Coleman (4-40) didn't have a single touch following intermission.    Jones' fantasy owners had to be upset when they saw that Roddy White scored a touchdown. White, who caught 3 balls for 23 yards and the score, is still not worth owning; he saw just 4 targets despite Ryan's 44 attempts. Leonard Hankerson (4-37) was thrown to more, seeing 6 balls. Hankerson was guilty of a bad drop.    As for the Saints, Brees had a terrific evening, going 30-of-39 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He had just 1 bad throw when he missed "

   "comment":"Drew Brees that much time to lead his offense and expect to win, and naturally, New Orleans was able to pull the upset.    Wilson finished 22-of-34 for 253 yards and an interception. The pick was a rare 1. as it was Wilson's first in 203 attempts. It occurred because Wilson didn't see linebacker Brees that much time to lead his offense and expect to win, and naturally, New Orleans was able to pull the upset.    Wilson finished 22-of-34 for 253 yards and an interception. The pick was a rare 1. as it was Wilson's first in 203 attempts. It occurred because Wilson didn't see linebacker Nathan Stupar dropping into coverage. Wilson threw better than he did at Arizona, but missed Jermaine Kearse in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown on the final play of the contest. Wilson clearly isn't 100 percent, as he hesitated to run. He scrambled 3 times for 11 rushing yards. He picked up a first down with his feet on 1 occasion, but he didn't do much else with his legs. He'll need to be completely healthy to give the Seahawks a chance to make a deep playoff run so that he can overcome his horrible blocking.    Despite the poor pass blocking, the Seahawks oddly did not try to run the ball very often. Christine Michael was given just 3 carries in the opening half, which simply doesn't make any sense. Michael finally got some work following intermission, and he and C.J. Prosise showed well in their limited opportunities. Michael gained 40 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, while Prosise registered 23 yards on 4 tries. Seattle had a successful drive in which Michael and Prosise were given carries, so it's weird that they shied away from that the rest of the afternoon.    Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving yardage, as he had 4 catches go for 80 yards. He looked great, and it's easy to see why the Seahawks cut C.J. Spiller this week in order to get Prosise more touches. Wilson otherwise spread the ball around. Jermaine Kearse (4-57), Doug Baldwin (4-51), Jimmy Graham (3-34) and Tyler Lockett (4-32) all posted underwhelming numbers.    Moving on to the Saints, Brees was sharp the entire afternoon. He misfired on just 8 occasions, going 27-of-35 for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). He was precise on third downs, converting 9 of 15 attempts.

Brees had a pretty rough outing, going 25-for-41 with 257 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. He struggled with accuracy throughout the whole day. He missed numerous big plays, but none were more important than a couple of deep passes for Brandin Cooks. In the second quarter, Cooks had his man beaten for what would have been a touchdown. Brees saw Cooks streaking over the middle of the field and lofted a pass toward the end zone. Brees put it a step in front of Cooks, however, and the speedy receiver could not get to it in time. It was a throw that Brees definitely should have made, and it was indicative of the larger problems he had during the day. Moving forward, Brees has to improve his accuracy. He simply has not looked good this season, and maybe he is just on the decline. The turnovers and missed opportunities really played a major part in the loss.    Despite Brees' accuracy issues, New Orleans' receiving corps was able to have some success. Three receivers saw 8 or more targets. They were Cooks (5-61), "

Early in the first quarter, Arizona took the lead as Kerwynn Williams took a carry for 49 yards for a touchdown, and that set the tone for the first half. The Saints answered with a field goal drive, and then Larry Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away to New Orleans at the Cardinals' 30-yard line.

   "comment":"Drew Brees' 71.2 from 2011. Bradford, who went 25-of-33 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, finished with a 71.6-percent completion rate this year. I'm calling the record fraudulent because that's exactly what it is. Brees' 2011 campaign was 1 of the best quarterbacking seasons in NFL history. Brees tallied 5,476 yards and maintained a sterling 8.3 YPA. Bradford, on the other hand, achieved the high completion percentage because all he did was dink and dunk throughout the entire year. By comparison, Bradford failed to reach 4,000 yards and possessed a YPA of around 7. It's a shame for Brees because he actually deserved the record. Bradford does not. Bradford did play well in this game, though it needs to be noted that the Bears were missing several edge rushers. Bradford was seldom pressured, and he was able to shred Chicago's secondary as a result. His 1 blemish was the pick, which he forced into tight coverage.    With Bradford performing well, the Bears didn't have a chance, especially with Brees' 71.2 from 2011.

The Patriots got themselves righted as Brady dominated the Saints' vulnerable defense. Brees moved the ball well at times, but New England's defense bounced back after the Week 1 disappointment, limiting the Saints enough. It was the 4.h straight season that New Orleans has started 0-2, and the Saints' defense once again looks incapable of supporting the offense with just average play.    The Patriots took the opening kickoff and marched down the field. Brady had a clutch third-and-long conversion to Rob Gronkowski before lofting in a pretty 19-yard touchdown to Rex Burkhead (3-41-1 receiving), who got past rookie linebacker Alex Anzalone. The Saints responded with a field goal drive led by some passing from Brees. Brady got New England on the move with a screen to Burkhead for 15 yards and then found Gronkowski, who got eventual separation from Anzalone. After hauling the pass in, Gronkowski broke a tackle and raced down the field for a 53-yard touchdown. Brady kept ripping the ball down the field using Gronkowski and Phillip Dorsett before lofting in an easy touchdown pass to Chris Hogan (5-78-1). New Orleans got moving with Alvin Kamara (3-51) making a leaping reception for 38 yards. Adrian Peterson then ran hard on 2 carries for a another first down before Brees found Brandon Coleman (4-82-1) open for a short touchdown pass. The Saints got the ball back, and a 42-yard pass to Coleman set up a field goal to cut New England's lead to 20-13. Brady responded with a drive using Gronkowski, Hogan and Brandin Cooks (2-37) to set up a short touchdown run for Mike Gillislee. New England tacked on a field goal drive to make it 30-13 at the half with Brady totaling 302 yards passing through 2 quarters.    Brady dominated New Orleans' defense, completing 30-of-39 passes for 447 yards and 3 touchdowns. Gronkowski had 6 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown. In the third quarter, however, he left the game with trainers as it looked like he injured his back, but it was said to be a groin injury. His durability has been problematic, so this was a bad omen for the Patriots and his fantasy owners.    Mike Gillislee ran for 69 yards with 1 touchdown on 18 carries.

He finished 22-of-29 for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns, scorching a Carolina secondary that hasn't been the same ever since losing Josh Norman. Brees only made 1 mistake, as he overthrew Ginn for a potential touchdown, but this was Brees in vintage form. His performance was very impressive, considering the blocking woes the Saints have endured, and he'll only get better once Terron Armstead and Zach Strief return.    Ginn may have missed out on the aforementioned potential touchdown, but he managed to score again later. Ginn (2-44), "

   "comment":"Drew Brees. The veteran quarterback was the catalyst for the Saints down the stretch. He sparked the comeback with his terrific passes and his ability to quickly command the offense. Throughout the 4.h quarter, Brees threw accurate passes to his receivers and was constantly able to find wide-open receivers. The Redskins blew a lot of coverages late in the contest, and Brees was able to expose every single mistake made. He was perfect in the 4.h quarter and led 2 very quick scoring drives to make up the 15-point deficit. By the end of the day, Brees' state line looked like this: He went 29-of-41 for 385 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick, which came on the team's first drive. Brees was nearly flawless and clearly is still 1 of the top quarterbacks in the NFL.    Brees' top targets on Sunday were predictably Brees.
