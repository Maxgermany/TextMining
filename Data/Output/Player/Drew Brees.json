   "comment":"Brees was 18-of-32 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he leaned on his running game more than anything. Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush combined for 182 yards on 26 carries. Thomas had a rushing touchdown, while Bush also had 3 catches, 26 receiving yards and an aerial score.    Marques Colston and Lance Moore disappointed their fantasy owners, catching just 3 passes each. Moore and Colston had 35 and 26 yards, respectively. Neither wideout found the end zone.    Jeremy Shockey led the Saints in receptions with 5 (64 yards).    If the Falcons would have pulled this game off - and they led in the 4.h quarter, so that was a very realistic possibility - I would have led with Matt Ryan converting a third-and-21 with a 28-yard hook-up to Roddy White being 1 of the key moments of his young career. Unfortunately, that drive culminated in a chip-shot field goal from New Orleans' 5-yard line.    Despite the loss, Ryan continued to impress despite being a mere rookie. Ryan finished 24-of-33 for 315 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick.    Ryan found Roddy White 10 times for 164 yards. His touchdown, however, went to Brian Finneran (yes, he's still in the league.)    Michael Turner rushed for just 61 yards, but only received 18 carries, as this game turned into a shootout very early. Fantasy owners were happy to see that he found the end zone once, at least.    <b> Dan Marino Record Watch: </b> Drew Brees now has exactly 4,100 passing yards on the season. He's on pace for 5,046 yards. Dan Marino had 5,084 yards in 1984.   "

   "comment":"Brees tossed an interception. The Saints then went 3.and-out on their second possession.    Despite Payton's debacled game plan and a 21-7 deficit at halftime, the Saints were able to stay in this contest because of Chicago's anemic offense. Save for Devin Hester and Greg Olsen, the Bears receivers couldn't catch anything. In fact, Rashied Davis dropped a pass that deflected into the arms of a Saints defensive back. Orton was also horrific, going 24-of-40 for 172 yards, including a telegraphed pass to New Orleans linebacker Scott Fujita. Worst of all, the Bears couldn't get the running game going. It didn't even look like they wanted to. I know Matt Forte left the game in the first quarter with a toe injury, which must have scared all of his fantasy owners half to death, but he came back in the beginning of the second quarter. At the end of regulation, Forte (34 rushing yards, TD) and Peterson (15 yards) combined for only 13 carries, while Orton threw 39 times! It's almost as if offensive coordinator Ron Turner forgot the running portion of the playbook at home.    I mentioned Hester and Olsen; they had 4 catches for 46 yards and 8 grabs for 45 yards, respectively. Hester also drew 77 yards in penalty yardage. It should be noted that Forte had 5 receptions for 29 receiving yards in addition to his rushing yardage.    As for the Saints offense, Drew Brees' road woes continued. He was 24-of-43 for 232 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. As a visitor this season, Brees has 12 interceptions to just 9 scores. That's a stark contrast compared to his home figures (19 TDs, 4 INTs).    To move the chains against Chicago, New Orleans utilized "

   "comment":"Brees a short, 15-yard field. - A drive and a New Orleans touchdown later, Freeman had another interception at midfield that led to yet another Saints end-zone trip. By then, it was 31-7 New Orleans, and 3 Freeman turnovers were responsible for 17 of those points. Freeman finished just 17-of-33 for 126 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions and a lost fumble. He made some nice throws at times and had 2 separate scrambles of 15 yards. However, he really needs to cut down on the turnovers. They really killed the Buccaneers on Sunday.    With Freeman struggling, no Tampa skill player did much. It is worth noting, however, that Antonio Bryant caught 3 balls for 40 yards. He'll be more of a factor soon once he's fully healthy.    Other Buccaneers of significance: Cadillac Williams (11 carries, 32 yards), Kellen Winslow Jr. (5 catches, 29 yards).    Constantly being handed short fields, Drew Brees didn't get a chance to pad his yardage numbers - he finished with 187 yards - but he had 3 touchdowns in this contest.    "

   "comment":"Brees that was clearly a chest tackle. There were also mysterious holding and intentional grounding penalties all afternoon. Toward the end, the Seahawks recovered an onsides kick, but Carey whistled Lawyer Milloy for illegal touching, when it appeared as though he established himself inbounds before he recovered the football. Pete Carroll was infuriated, but was denied the opportunity to challenge the call for some strange reason. Midway through the second quarter, it was apparent that Carey was going to do everything in his power to have New Orleans win by 12 points or more. Mission accomplished, Mike.    I don't want to take anything away from the Saints though. They were magnificent. They punted only once, and more importantly, were nearly flawless in the red zone, which was a big problem for them in the first 9 weeks of the season.

   "comment":"Brees scored another touchdown to put his team up 14-0. At that point, Bradford had no chance. It's very difficult for any young quarterback to play in the raucous Superdome, let alone 1 who has a 14-0 deficit. Bradford really struggled from that point on, finishing 18-of-32 for 231 yards and 2 interceptions. He also missed a wide-open receiver for a potential touchdown in the third quarter.    One play that you won't see on <i> SportsCenter</i> was Bradford's effort on another Jackson fumble. Jackson coughed up the ball in the 4.h quarter, and Bradford impressively ran down safety Roman Harper. The play was inconsequential - the call was overturned, so it wasn't even a real fumble - but this was a great effort play by the rookie quarterback, who will undoubtedly earn even more respect from his teammates.    The Rams kicked field goals early, which is never a good strategy against the Saints. Drew Brees was highly efficient, going 25-of-40 for 221 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions (1 of which was a late deep ball). He converted 11-of-16 third downs and did a great job keeping the ball away from St. Louis. Two of Brees' touchdowns went to "

Marques Colston just had his knee scoped, so even if he can play next week, he won't be very effective. Second, Chris Ivory suffered an ankle injury in this contest. With Pierre Thomas also nursing an ankle injury, it doesn't look like the Saints will be able to run the ball well this January. The next running back up? Julius Jones. Jones fumbled almost immediately, forcing Sean Payton to ride Reggie Bush. Bush looked good at times, but that's not surprising given how banged up Tampa's defense is. He had 70 yards on just 9 carries.    Brees went 22-of-38 for 196 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick that wasn't his fault (Lance Moore fell down)."

   "comment":"Brees and company in the final 10 minutes despite it being a 1.score game. However, New Orleans fans should be really concerned. For 1. Marques Colston just had his knee scoped, so even if he can play next week, he won't be very effective. Second, Chris Ivory suffered an ankle injury in this contest. With Pierre Thomas also nursing an ankle injury, it doesn't look like the Saints will be able to run the ball well this January. The next running back up? Julius Jones. Jones fumbled almost immediately, forcing Sean Payton to ride Reggie Bush. Bush looked good at times, but that's not surprising given how banged up Tampa's defense is. He had 70 yards on just 9 carries.    Brees went 22-of-38 for 196 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick that wasn't his fault (Lance Moore fell down)."

   "comment":"Brees and even picked him off twice. It really looked like Houston was about to take the next step. - But as usual, the Texans withered down the stretch, choking for what seems like the billionth time in franchise history. Suddenly, Brees was the quarterback who couldn't be stopped (31-44, 370, 3 TDs, 2 INTs). Schaub also tossed a horrible 4.h-quarter pick with the lead. There's no excuse for that. In my 2011 Houston Texans season preview, I expressed concern with Schaub being able to perform in the clutch, listing his awful 4.h-quarter and overtime numbers when the game is close. Well, it appears as though nothing has changed. Well, scratch that. The Colts are a non-factor, so maybe the Texans can sneak into the playoffs by winning an awful AFC South. Maybe...    Other numbers of note: - "

Tampa Bay took the lead back with a 65-yard touchdown pass from Josh Freeman to wide receiver Arrelious Benn. The second-year wide out ran wide open in busted coverage, and Freeman lofted a ball that led him down the field. Backup running back Earnest Graham then had a 34-yard run and a 19-yard screen pass to set up a field goal for the Buccaneers. Safety Tanard Jackson made his first start since Week 2 of 2010 after a 19-game suspension by the NFL for failed drug tests. Late in the second quarter, he caught a deflected pass to set up Tampa Bay in excellent field position. A few plays later, Freeman threw a dart to a wide receiver for a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Buccaneers' defense came to play, as they intercepted Brees twice in the first half along with their forced fumble. Tampa Bay led 20-10 at halftime. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter. Early in the 4.h quarter, Brees made a crucial third-down conversion on a perfect pass to "

   "comment":"Brees throwing a fade pass to Lance Moore for a short touchdown. The next drive saw the Saints move the ball downfield quickly. They pounded the Buccaneers' run defense on the ground and set up a 21-yard screen pass to Sproles for a touchdown and a 14-0 lead. Just before halftime, Tampa Bay's offense got going. Freeman lofted a deep ball to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe for a 46-yard gain. That set up a field goal to cut New Orleans' lead to 14-3. Brees led a quick-strike drive to get the 3 points back. In the third quarter, Brees was intercepted by veteran "

   "comment":"Brees found Marques Colston for gains of 15 and 19 then capped the drive with a deep ball to Meachem for a touchdown. The final play of the third quarter turned out to be crucial. Matt Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards."

They kept this NFC South battle close for a while, but Brees was simply unstoppable. The NFL's new single-season passing-record holder went 28-of-35 for 389 yards, 5 touchdowns and an interception. He put on an absolute clinic. Brees' pick, by the way, wasn't his fault. "

   "comment":"Brees in this matchup, after all. Apparently not. Different game, same result. We can now confirm the Saints are 17 points better than the Lions.    This game could have actually been much uglier. Like Detroit last time, New Orleans killed itself with mistakes early on. Marques Colston fumbled in the red zone in the first quarter. Drew Brees lost a fumble in the following period. And right before halftime, Colston dropped a touchdown. The Saints, however, got their act together in the second half. Brees was unstoppable, going 33-of-43 for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns. The team didn't even punt. In fact, New Orleans set a playoff record for most net yards in a single game with 626. Of course, it didn't help the Lions' cause that they continuously blew coverages and whiffed on tackles. It's amazing how many times Brees' targets were open downfield. And I know Detroit struggled versus the run all year, but making "

Kaepernick, meanwhile, played well overall, completing 16-of-25 passes for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception while running for 27 yards and a score on 6 carries. San Francisco is a different team and more dangerous on offense with Kaepernick at quarterback instead of Alex Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Brees was whistled for a pair of false starts in the red zone. Those penalties were so bizarre; all Brees was trying to do was audible, yet the officials flagged him on consecutive plays. It was so suspicious that I assumed the game was fixed (Hartley's 2 misses factored into my conspiracy theory), but the Saints ultimately got their act together, establishing a double-digit lead and never looking back.    Drew Brees was amazing in this victory. He let the ball hit the ground on just 8 occasions, going 26-of-34 for 332 yards and a whopping 5 touchdowns. This type of outing was remarkable, considering he was under heavy pressure throughout the afternoon. He took 4 sacks - 1.5 from "

   "comment":"Brees was absolutely unstoppable. He went 34-of-41 for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns, putting together a stretch in which he completed 19 consecutive passes. It helped that the Cowboys lost a couple of defensive starters to injury in this contest, including Sean Lee (hamstring), but Brees was hot even before several Dallas players were sidelined. Lee's absence had no bearing on the result of this game, but it did play a huge factor in allowing the Saints to set that single-game record for first downs.    With the Saints so far ahead, the Cowboys couldn't expose New Orleans' greatest weakness, which happens to be the run defense. "

   "comment":"Brees roughing-the-passer penalty? He wasn't hit in the head or neck area; it was at the top of his chest. That cost the 49ers a victory. Then again, the officials tried to screw the Saints as well at other moments. I guess it's fitting that this game concluded with a push.    With Carolina on the rise, the Saints needed a win to remain in control of the NFC South, and they got it thanks to a collective team effort of big plays on offense, defense and special teams. In back-to-back weeks, the 49ers have lost close games to the top 2 teams in the NFC South. While San Francisco still controls its playoff destiny, these losses have the potential to bite the franchise when it comes to tie-breakers.    After starting at New Orleans' 3.yard line early in the game, the Saints' Mark Ingram (6-25) had a good run, and Drew Brees got the ball into the 49ers' territory with a deep cross to Robert Meachem that the wideout turned down the field for a 44-yard gain."

   "comment":"Brees would be the reason the Saints would pull the upset, given that he had a great matchup against Philadelphia's putrid secondary. However, he started off very slowly. He missed an open target downfield for big gain on the opening drive. He then forced an interception on a deep shot to a receiver who wasn't open. He heaved a second pick in Philadelphia territory right to DeMeco Ryans. Brees simply didn't see the linebacker. Brees led the Saints to just 6 points in the opening half, going 10-of-18 for just 98 yards and the 2 picks prior to the break. He caught fire after intermission, however, misfiring on just 2 of 12 attempted passes. He finished 20-of-30 for 250 yards, 1 touchdown and the pair of interceptions. Brees made a number of key conversions on third-and-long.    While Brees thrived after intermission, the running game was a constant for the Saints throughout. They bulldozed what was billed to be a strong Philadelphia run defense for 185 rushing yards, as their offensive line pushed around the Eagles' defensive front. "

   "comment":"Brees nearly connected on a couple of long throws, but members of the Atlanta secondary made great plays to negate those completions. Meanwhile, the Falcons bungled their own chances, as their only trip to the end zone came because official Bill Leavy threw a very late, bogus flag for pass interference, perhaps because he thought the Atlanta crowd was going to lynch him. Meanwhile, Julio Jones bungled his team's chances by fumbling in the red zone. This did not look like it was going to be Atlanta's day. And then Matt Ryan's second half happened. Ryan was 20-of-27 after intermission for a whopping 263 yards and 2 touchdowns. His overall numbers were also excellent (31-of-43, 448 yards, 3 TDs), as his yardage was the most in Atlanta history for a single game (and 6.h-most by anyone on opening weekend). He did a phenomenal job leading his team to a pair of field goal drives at the end of regulation and in overtime, though he was helped greatly by a Marques Colston fumble in the extra session. What's really impressive about Ryan's performance is that he did it against what was supposed to be a stellar defense (though they had about a billion missed tackles), all while being without first-round rookie left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the contest. Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. Devin Hester also had a big game. Meanwhile, Roddy White (5-72), Antone Smith and Levine Toilolo came up with Ryan's other scores.    The Falcons' 4 running backs all made contributions in this victory. Steven Jackson paced the group with 52 yards on 12 carries. Jacquizz Rodgers (6-34) and Smith scored. Fourth-round rookie Devonta Freeman did the least (2 carries, 15 yards; 2 catches, 18 rec. yards), but he made a crucial first down by refusing to be tackled.    Speaking of breaking tackles, Mark Ingram did plenty of that in this game. Ingram, who had a stellar preseason, rushed for 60 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored twice. Khiry Robinson (6-28) also found the end zone.    The 3 rushing touchdowns screwed over Drew Brees fantasy owners, who watched their quarterback do most of the work in between the 20s. Brees went 29-of-42 for 333 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The Falcons did a good job of pressuring him in the second half, doing just enough to slow him down a little bit, giving themselves a chance to pull out the victory. Brees was hot in the first half. He and "

   "comment":"Brees did not look good, especially after losing Graham and Goodwin. He was just 19-of-32 for just 158 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions following intermission. He had a third pick, which occurred prior to halftime. He carelessly heaved a ball in the 2-minute drill, leading to a Tampa Bay touchdown, which inexplicably came right after a New Orleans timeout. He then had a pick-six that popped into the air, and then his worst interception was a dying ball that was severely underthrown. Brees looked like his arm strength was sapped on that final pass, and that has to be a major concern for anyone affiliated with the Saints. Brees finished 35-of-57 for 371 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He'll get credit for leading the team down the field in overtime, but he was struggling until the Buccaneers were whistled for illegal hands to the face.

   "comment":"Brees were unstoppable in between the 20s, and every single possession in the first half led to some sort of scoring output. Everything changed, however, when the Packers were driving in the third quarter. They reached the red zone and had a nice scramble from Rodgers, but the Packer quarterback pulled up. He grabbed his left hamstring and shouted expletives. Cris Collinsworth picked up on it immediately, saying this was a huge deal for Green Bay. He was right, as the Packers were outscored from that point on, 28-7. Rodgers was on fire early, and it helped that he had all day to throw for the most part. That changed a bit after T.J. Lang went down with an ankle injury, but he was still able to drive down the field with ease, going 13-of-18 for 278 yards and a touchdown in the opening half. The hamstring ruined his evening, however, as he threw an interception a couple of plays following the scramble, which was a deflection off a throw into the end zone to Andrew Quarless. Rodgers then had another pick that was an inaccurate heave toward Davante Adams. He completely lost his mobility and couldn't escape pressure. Rodgers finished 28-of-39 for 418 yards, a pair of touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) and the 2 interceptions. The good news for the Packers is that they have a bye coming up, so Rodgers will get to rest his hamstring before a divisional matchup against the Bears at home.    Drew Brees, meanwhile, was pretty much flawless, as he usually is in the Superdome. He misfired on just 5 attempts, going 27-of-32 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't let the ball hit the ground a single time in the second half, completing all 11 of his attempts for 124 yards. Some of his first-half misfires weren't even his fault. For example, "

Brees ultimately went 33-of-41 for 255 yards and a late, meaningless touchdown. The numbers don't look terrible, but all Brees did throughout the afternoon was dink and dunk. He and Sean Payton screwed up in the red zone yet again, as they squandered a scoring opportunity in the second quarter, coming away with zero points. So, what really happened? There's no logical reason why the Saints' top-ranked offense should sputter against an injury-ridden Cincinnati defense. The answer is "

   "comment":"Brees (who torched them), an injured Cam Newton, Ryan Tannehill, Christian Ponder, Jay Cutler. Not exactly the group that will be playing in the Pro Bowl. Brady (on a neutral field), Russell Wilson, Peyton Manning (assuming he's healthy), Andrew Luck, Ben Roethlisberger, and even Philip Rivers and Joe Flacco would throw all over this secondary unless it makes major improvements in the near future.    Of course, the Packers will be favored against all of those teams because of Aaron Rodgers, who was mostly spectacular in this contest. With no pressure in his face for nearly the entire game, he was able to go 24-of-36 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 5 scrambles for 28 rushing yards. There was some complacency in the second half, however. Rodgers wasn't nearly as sharp as he was prior to intermission, completing just 6-of-11 attempts. He missed an open Jordy Nelson for a touchdown (he connected with him, but Nelson had to dive for an inaccurate ball). His teammates seemed to be out of sync as well, as Eddie Lacy dropped a pass, while the special teams didn't have enough players on the field for a punt. As a result, the Packers nearly squandered their 31-7 lead. The Falcons scored 4 touchdowns and a field goal in the second half, ultimately covering the spread.    Lacy gashed the Falcons in the early going. He ripped through Atlanta's poor defense and had 56 yards and a touchdown by halftime. However, he finished with 73 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown, as Atlanta clamped down on the run in the second half - save for a big James Starks gain at the very end. Starks actually outgained Lacy as a result, finishing with 75 yards and a score on 10 attempts, though Lacy had the better fantasy day because he caught 5 balls for 33 receiving yards and a second touchdown.    Rodgers' other scores went to Jordy Nelson, who reeled in 8 of 10 targets for a whopping 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. No other Packer had more than 58 receiving yards, however, with Randall Cobb holding that distinction on 4 catches.    As for the Falcons, I already mentioned Jones' dominance. I have to emphasize how incredible he was. He caught 11 balls for a ridiculous 259 yards and a touchdown. The Packers looked completely clueless trying to stop him, and he would've had a bigger night, but 3 things happened: First, Jones nearly had a second score, but could only get 1 foot inbounds. Second, he was tackled at the 3-yard line on a 79-yard gain. And third, he was knocked out of the game with an injury. He wasn't present on the field for Atlanta's final offensive drive, though the Falcons found the end zone anyway for the dreaded backdoor cover.    Matt Ryan was terrific in the second half. He finished 24-of-39 for 375 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception, but he was 18-of-25 for 263 yards and a quartet of scores following intermission. His pick was a poor decision, as he threw the ball toward Devin Hester without looking while under pressure. However, he rebounded and nearly led an unbelievable comeback. Though the Falcons lost, their outlook in terms of winning the division is positive because Ryan is performing on a much higher level than Brees.    Excluding Jones, the players who reeled in Ryan's touchdowns were Roddy White (3-42), who barely did anything prior to Jones getting hurt, Harry Douglas (2-11) and Eric Weems.    Steven Jackson, meanwhile, looked functional for the second week in a row. He gained 50 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Most of his yardage came in the first half, but the Falcons had to abandon the run for the most part because they were so far behind. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"Brees nearly gave this game away with some poor quarterbacking. He threw 3 interceptions, 2 of which were thrown into the end zone. Both were forced and happened to be poor decisions. The third pick was tipped. Brees went 24-of-38 for 281 yards, 1 touchdown otherwise. Most of his production came after intermission; he was 14-of-22 for 184 yards, 2 scores and a pair of interceptions in the second half.    Brees' touchdown was thrown to "

   "comment":"Brees is the quarterback, but this was a major problem for them last year. With Jimmy Graham gone, it doesn't appear as though this issue will be fixed anytime soon. Brees finished 30-of-48 for 355 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, an inaccurate pass on a third down. Brees had a chance to take the lead with the score being 24-19 with 1:50 remaining, but the Saints strangely opted to punt the ball away. Granted, they were deep in their own territory, but I would rather trust Brees on a 4.h down than the defense on any down. The FOX announcers were overly critical of this, and I couldn't believe it happened. I actually went to the bathroom - there was a stoppage prior to that 4.h down - and when I came back to my desk, I actually exclaimed, They punted!? That was just a terrible coaching decision.    The Saints' top play-maker on offense was "

The Saints also had to rely on several illegal pick plays that weren't whistled by an incompetent officiating crew that blew calls for both teams in this contest.    Spiller ended up as New Orleans' top receiver, but prior to the game-winning score - the 400th touchdown in Brees' career, by the way - he had just 4 catches for 19 yards.

   "comment":"Brees and Sean Payton will be in New Orleans next season. If not, it's a bit fitting that the team and city's resurgence began with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown in the home opener in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the last hurrah for the same regime occurred with yet another blocked punt for a touchdown versus Atlanta. Up 7-0, Michael Mauti echoed the memories of Steve Gleason, blocking the ball and falling on it in the end zone. The crowd, which already cheered Gleason, who was in the building to be honored, was ignited even more. Though the Falcons snugged up the margin to 1 touchdown, the Saints eventually exploded out to a 3.score lead to keep their season alive. They now stand at 2-4, so they're not dead - at least not yet. The Falcons, meanwhile, sustained their first loss. It was a mistake-filled night for them, as they constantly killed themselves with turnovers. The blocked punt wasn't even the initial error, as Matt Ryan fumbled a snap on a 4.h down of the opening drive. After that, Tevin Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a 4.h turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers are misleading because of the 2 lost fumbles and the red-zone miscues, but Ryan didn't have a bad outing. He was betrayed by his supporting cast; he suffered through several drops and was sacked on 5 occasions, thrice by Cameron Jordan.    The big story prior to the game was whether or not Julio Jones would play. Jones took the field and didn't appear to be limited. He caught 6 passes for 93 yards. Ryan didn't have enough time in the pocket to find Jones as much as he wanted to. Because of this, Ryan frequently tossed checkdowns to Devonta Freeman, who once again had a great game. He caught 8 passes for 56 receiving yards and a touchdown to go along with some fantastic rushing numbers (13 carries, 100 rushing yards, TD). Freeman had a drop late, but it was his only blemish during the evening. Freeman was also helped by Coleman's aforementioned lost fumble. Not that Freeman was going to lose his job to Coleman, or anything, but Coleman (4-40) didn't have a single touch following intermission.    Jones' fantasy owners had to be upset when they saw that Roddy White scored a touchdown. White, who caught 3 balls for 23 yards and the score, is still not worth owning; he saw just 4 targets despite Ryan's 44 attempts. Leonard Hankerson (4-37) was thrown to more, seeing 6 balls. Hankerson was guilty of a bad drop.    As for the Saints, Brees had a terrific evening, going 30-of-39 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He had just 1 bad throw when he missed "

Just when it looked like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a shot at the playoffs, they fell flat on their face. The Bucs dropped to 6-7 on a day when they did nothing well. Their offense was able to do very little against a New Orleans defense that's been horrible all year. Tampa Bay's defense, minus suspended middle linebacker Kwon Alexander, was very mediocre. Are the Bucs out of the race for a wild-card berth? No, not out of it, coach Lovie Smith said. Three games left to go and we're 2 out of it. The reality is the Bucs likely would need to win all 3 of their remaining games to have a shot at the playoffs. If they play like they did against New Orleans, they won't have a chance. For the Saints, 5-8, the victory was meaningless. All it did was hurt their draft position. But the much-maligned defense had 1 of its best games of the season, holding the Bucs to 291 yards of total offense.    Drew Brees had a solid game from a fantasy perspective. He completed 31-of-41 passes for 312 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Brees benefited from good field position thanks to his defense.    The Saints got a blast from the past as veteran wide receiver "

   "comment":"Brees. He has a $30 million salary-cap figure for next season and will be 37 years old. But Brees still has something left in the tank. The Saints need to sign Brees to a contract extension and spread out his cap hit.    The New Orleans defense played relatively well against the Falcons. But this defense struggled throughout most of the season. It's clear that the Saints need to improve on defense. They have to look for help in the 2016 NFL Draft. A pass-rusher to go with Cam Heyward is desperately needed, and that's the direction the Saints should look in the draft. Penn State defensive end Carl Nassib could be a perfect fit.    The Saints also need to use the 2016 NFL Draft to upgrade their wide receiver corps. Veteran Marques Colston is near the end of his career. "

Brees tore up Sean Smith and the rest of Oakland's secondary as a result, going 28-of-42 for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns. He looked like vintage Brees, as he nearly put the Saints in position for the game-winning field goal. Unfortunately for the Saints, Brees ran out of time, and New Orleans had to attempt a 61-yard field goal, which drifted wide left.    It was no surprise who Brees' 2 primary receivers were. "

   "comment":"Brees, basically allowing nothing to him until very late in the game when they were up multiple scores. It didn't help the Saints that Terron Armstead sustained an injury on the second drive, but New Orleans couldn't block the Chiefs' defensive front. The sack count might not seem low - Drew Brees was brought down only once - but the Saints' blockers were responsible for numerous holding penalties, which disrupted drives in the opening half. As a result, Brees was constantly stuck in third-and-long situations, and he threw a pick-six on the second drive, which was deflected. Stats can be deceiving, and that's the case here, as Brees went 37-of-48 for 367 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick-six. Brees definitely did not play poorly at all, but he wasn't as great as those stats indicate. He was very jittery in the pocket, as it was apparent that the Chiefs' pressure rattled him. The crowd noise was bothersome as well, as Brees took a delay-of-game penalty and had to waste a precious second-half timeout. He also missed some receivers, including "

   "comment":"Brees that much time to lead his offense and expect to win, and naturally, New Orleans was able to pull the upset.    Wilson finished 22-of-34 for 253 yards and an interception. The pick was a rare 1. as it was Wilson's first in 203 attempts. It occurred because Wilson didn't see linebacker Nathan Stupar dropping into coverage. Wilson threw better than he did at Arizona, but missed Jermaine Kearse in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown on the final play of the contest. Wilson clearly isn't 100 percent, as he hesitated to run. He scrambled 3 times for 11 rushing yards. He picked up a first down with his feet on 1 occasion, but he didn't do much else with his legs. He'll need to be completely healthy to give the Seahawks a chance to make a deep playoff run so that he can overcome his horrible blocking.    Despite the poor pass blocking, the Seahawks oddly did not try to run the ball very often. Christine Michael was given just 3 carries in the opening half, which simply doesn't make any sense. Michael finally got some work following intermission, and he and C.J. Prosise showed well in their limited opportunities. Michael gained 40 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, while Prosise registered 23 yards on 4 tries. Seattle had a successful drive in which Michael and Prosise were given carries, so it's weird that they shied away from that the rest of the afternoon.    Prosise actually led the Seahawks in receiving yardage, as he had 4 catches go for 80 yards. He looked great, and it's easy to see why the Seahawks cut C.J. Spiller this week in order to get Prosise more touches. Wilson otherwise spread the ball around. Jermaine Kearse (4-57), Doug Baldwin (4-51), Jimmy Graham (3-34) and Tyler Lockett (4-32) all posted underwhelming numbers.    Moving on to the Saints, Brees was sharp the entire afternoon. He misfired on just 8 occasions, going 27-of-35 for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing). He was precise on third downs, converting 9 of 15 attempts.

The Panthers turned the short field into 3 points, though it was nearly worse for the Saints because the Panthers were stuffed at the 1-yard line on an impressive goal-line stand by New Orleans. After that, Brees launched an inaccurate interception, which led to a Carolina touchdown. Those 2 give-aways, plus a blocked field goal at the end of the first half that was immediately followed by Ginn's touchdown, is pretty much why Carolina had such a big lead. New Orleans' 3 turnovers turned into 17 points for Carolina, and the Saints just didn't have enough time to come back from that. Brees shook off the early turnovers and finished strong, going 35-of-44 for 285 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. Two passes of his were dropped, 1 of which was in the end zone.    "

Brees disappointed his fantasy owners, going 31-of-44 for 326 yards and the 3 picks. The afternoon didn't begin very well when a bad snap forced an intentional-grounding penalty on a third down, and it didn't get much better after that.

   "comment":"Brees was the second-year quarterback and Jameis Winston was the long-term pro. Brees had a pretty rough outing, going 25-for-41 with 257 yards and a whopping 3 interceptions. He struggled with accuracy throughout the whole day. He missed numerous big plays, but none were more important than a couple of deep passes for Brandin Cooks. In the second quarter, Cooks had his man beaten for what would have been a touchdown. Brees saw Cooks streaking over the middle of the field and lofted a pass toward the end zone. Brees put it a step in front of Cooks, however, and the speedy receiver could not get to it in time. It was a throw that Brees definitely should have made, and it was indicative of the larger problems he had during the day. Moving forward, Brees has to improve his accuracy. He simply has not looked good this season, and maybe he is just on the decline. The turnovers and missed opportunities really played a major part in the loss.    Despite Brees' accuracy issues, New Orleans' receiving corps was able to have some success. Three receivers saw 8 or more targets. They were Cooks (5-61), "

This has been a lost season for the Cardinals, in part due to a plethora of dropped balls.    Early in the first quarter, Arizona took the lead as Kerwynn Williams took a carry for 49 yards for a touchdown, and that set the tone for the first half. The Saints answered with a field goal drive, and then Larry Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away to New Orleans at the Cardinals' 30-yard line. New Orleans took advantage with Brees hitting Travaris Cadet (5-30-1) for a short touchdown pass."

   "comment":"Brees' 71.2 from 2011. Bradford, who went 25-of-33 for 250 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception, finished with a 71.6-percent completion rate this year. I'm calling the record fraudulent because that's exactly what it is. Brees' 2011 campaign was 1 of the best quarterbacking seasons in NFL history. Brees tallied 5,476 yards and maintained a sterling 8.3 YPA. Bradford, on the other hand, achieved the high completion percentage because all he did was dink and dunk throughout the entire year. By comparison, Bradford failed to reach 4,000 yards and possessed a YPA of around 7. It's a shame for Brees because he actually deserved the record. Bradford does not. Bradford did play well in this game, though it needs to be noted that the Bears were missing several edge rushers. Bradford was seldom pressured, and he was able to shred Chicago's secondary as a result. His 1 blemish was the pick, which he forced into tight coverage.    With Bradford performing well, the Bears didn't have a chance, especially with "

   "comment":"Brees and his running backs, as they were guilty of some miserable tackling. They also generated zero pass rush. By the time the Saints were up 45-10, they were averaging 7.6 yards per play. That's almost a first down on every single snap! There was some late-game nonsense to trim the margin to a couple of touchdowns, but make no mistake about it; this game was never close desptite the final score.    Brees finished with some misleading stats. The final numbers say he was 21-of-31 for 186 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. However, he was 12-of-14 for 148 yards and a touchdown in the opening half. The Saints fell asleep following intermission, and when Brees had to begin throwing the ball again, he was out of rhythm with his receivers. Neither of his picks were his fault either; the first occurred when "

   "comment":"Brees twice deep in Green Bay territory. The Packers went into halftime, up 14-7, and they even led in the 4.h quarter, 17-16. However, the clock struck 12 and the magic vanished. Hundley turned into an inaccurate pumpkin late in the game, while the defense suddenly couldn't keep the Saints out of the end zone. New Orleans outscored Green Bay in the second half, 19-3, picking up a 9.point victory.    Brees proved to be way too lethal for Green Bay's defense to handle in the second half. Just take a look at his stats following intermission: 14-of-18 for 176 yards and a touchdown. The Packers simply couldn't get off the field against him. Brees' final numbers were 27-of-38 for 331 yards, 1 score and the aforementioned 2 picks.    "

Chicago's defense did a good job, limiting the Saints to 20, but Mitchell Trubisky just didn't have the experience or the supporting cast to pull the big upset. While the Saints technically scored 20, it was really just 16, as an early field goal turned into a touchdown because the Bears were offside on the kick. Alvin Kamara scored a touchdown on the very next play, which was huge because it allowed New Orleans to maintain the lead throughout the afternoon. Drew Brees, as a result, didn't have to force poor throws against Chicago's fierce defense. Brees actually misfired on just 5 occasions, going 23-of-28 for 299 yards. He failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all season, but he didn't need to.    "
