   "comment":"Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York.    Rueben Randle had 2 receptions for 68 yards. Odell Beckham Jr. had just 4 catches for 35 yards.    Matt Cassel was 17-of-27 for 227 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could have been worse as Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie dropped an interception early in the game that would have been a pick-6. Robert Ayers dropped another pick.    Darren McFadden ran like he was back at Arkansas with 152 yards on 29 carries and a touchdown. Christine Michael, who was told that he'd get a larger workload, had just 6 touches for 20 total yards.    Jason Witten had 6 receptions for 74 yards. Terrance Williams (4-70) and Devin Street (1-25-1) chipped in, but clearly the Cowboys were missing Dez Bryant just as much with Cassel at quarterback.   "

   "comment":"Street then came up with a big catch for a first down in the red zone, but was flagged for spinning the ball. It's ridiculous calls like these that are driving fans away, by the way. Roger Goodell needs to crack down on this, and he should consider getting rid of Jerome Boger, whose officiating crew bungled yet another NFL game. Luck ultimately found Doyle for what would be the decisive touchdown. The Titans still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Mariota was strip-sacked, and "
