   "comment":"Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much. The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2-point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the fourth quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter."
