   "comment":"Malcolm Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much. The Patriots scored the touchdown, but failed on the 2.point conversion. They took the 22-17 lead that they would not relinquish. Brady's performance on Sunday was up and down. The veteran quarterback had been dealing with a knee injury during the week, and he looked a little bit banged up in the first quarter. He had trouble getting in a rhythm, and the Patriots' offense sputtered as a result. However, as the game went along, Brady got better, and by the 4.h quarter, he was making all the throws he would normally make. Brady went 30-of-50 for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was not his best performance of the season, as he did make some errors. He overthrew Mitchell for a potential touchdown at 1 point and overthrew Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. That can be chalked up to Brady's knee injury though. He still was able to make some nice throws, and as he gets healthier, he will continue to be the best quarterback of all time.    One of the biggest storylines of this contest was an injury to Rob Gronkowski. Early in the game, Gronkowski went down the field and dived to try to catch a pass. He came up looking a little bit gimpy, and he went back to the locker room. He would not return. There have been reports that Gronkowski's injury is not too severe, but it is definitely worth monitoring. In terms of fantasy, definitely add a backup, given how fragile he has proven to be in the past. With Gronkowski out, Julian Edelman (8-83) led the way. Brady targeted him 11 times, and he was a beast over the middle of the field. He beat Darrelle Revis a couple of times and should get a boost if Gronkowski misses time. Martellus Bennett (3-22) left for some time with an injury as well, but he returned. He had a minimal impact on the outcome.    Elsewhere, Chris Hogan (4-70) looked solid and Malcolm Mitchell (5-42, 2 TD) looked like a star in the making. The rookie had been getting more involved in New England's attack in the previous weeks, but it now looks like he is becoming 1 of Brady's favorite targets. If Mitchell is available in your league, add him as soon as possible.    LeGarrette Blount put up some good numbers. However, going into the final drive, he had only 8 carries for 36 yards. He had a 23-yard burst on the last run of the game to pad his stats at 11 carries for 67 yards. Meanwhile, Mitchell, but there was 1 crucial play on the drive. On a key 4th-and-4, Brady threw a quick out route to James White to get an imperative first down. It was a good move by Bill Belichick, as Stephen Gostkowski had missed a field goal attempt earlier in the game. The 54-yard kick alternative would likely have been asking a bit too much.
