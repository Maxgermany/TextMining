Romo had time to throw, and they were getting some good runs out of Felix Jones and Tashard Choice. The Cowboys were stopped on the goal line and decided to go for it on 4.h-and-goal. Jones was stuffed at the line by Lions linebacker Ashlee Palmer, and Detroit took over. Passing up on 3 points would come back to hurt the Cowboys. Romo attacked Houston again with a 44-yard pass to Laurent Robinson that got the Cowboys all the way to the Lions' 6-yard line."

On the next possession, the Broncos finally responded to the Lions' 45 unanswered points. Tebow threw a 14-yard screen pass to Decker for the home team's only touchdown.

The penalties set the Raiders up at the Detroit 12, and Louis Murphy ran it in for a touchdown on a reverse for the game's first score. The Lions answered with a touchdown drive that started off with small gains and ended with a bomb to Calvin Johnson (9-214, 2 TDs) for the 51-yard tying score. Megatron regularly made big plays against a defense that seemed confused about his status as an elite force of nature. After an exchange of punts, Oakland started to open up the passing game, which was open against a defense weakened by the loss of free safety Chris Harris. Darrius Heyward-Bey had a 35-yard gain to bail the Raiders out of poor field position, and then he caught a 43-yard touchdown to put Oakland back on top 14-7. Heyward-Bey (8-155 yards, TD) broke loose from Chris Houston's attempt to knock him over and sprinted to the end zone. Another exchange of punts, Detroit got its offense in gear again.

The Lions answered by moving the ball down the field and Smith running into the end zone from 6 yards out. Detroit was up 31-10 entering the 4.h quarter. San Diego followed up with another promising drive, moving the ball down the field. However, Houston had another good pass breakup in the end zone. The Lions' stand forced a 4.h-and-goal from the 3 that fell incomplete. Houston would kill another drive by intercepting a jump ball at the goal line. He returned it 43 yards and the pick sealed the win for Detroit.    Stafford finished the afternoon 29-of-36 for 373 yards and 3 touchdowns. Pettigrew (9-80), Johnson (4-102) and Nate Burleson (6-83) all had good games. For San Diego, Rivers completed 28-of-53 passes for 299 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Floyd (6-95) led the Chargers in receiving with Gates (4-40) contributing. He became the franchise's all-time receptions leader in this loss, passing Charlie Joiner.    It was a huge win for the Lions as they clinched their first playoff appearance since 1999. Congratulations to the long-suffering Lions fans who finally get to see their team play in the postseason after a long drought.   "
