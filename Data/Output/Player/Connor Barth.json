Trubisky finished 18-of-30 for 179 yards and a touchdown. It was an above-average performance, as he slowed down following a hot start. However, he was able to put his team in position to tie, and he also threatened Detroit's defense with his legs, scrambling 6 times for 53 rushing yards. He inexplicably picked up a 4.h-and-13 on the final possession with a run past the first-down marker.    Trubisky's sole score went to rookie tight end "
