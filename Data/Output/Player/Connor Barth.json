Bryant then missed a 48-yarder to give Tampa Bay 1 more shot at stealing the win with a Hail Mary attempt (Editor's Note: and a push).    Both offenses moved the ball all afternoon. The Bucs' first drive was pure domination as Doug Martin (21-50) scored a short touchdown to give Tampa Bay a 7-3 lead. Atlanta answered with a drive through the air as Ryan connected to Tony Gonzalez (6-62) for some key conversions. The drive ended with a short score from Jacquizz Rodgers. The Buccaneers pulled out a gadget play with Mike Williams (3-28) throwing a 28-yard pass to Vincent Jackson (5-96) to set up a Tampa Bay field goal. The Bucs had some blown opportunities of their own. Freeman missed a wide open Jackson and Williams in the end zone in the third quarter. Tampa Bay took a 13-10 lead, but it lasted only a few seconds as Ryan dropped in a beautiful 80-yard touchdown pass to Jones (6-147). The Bucs took the lead on the first play of the 4.h quarter with Martin plunging into the end zone. Tampa Bay's defense came up with a big play as E.J. Biggers had a sack-fumble on Ryan that was recovered by the Bucs. The play was completely Ryan's fault as he didn't diagnosis the free blitzer and held onto the ball too long. That led to another Barth field goal and a 23-17 Tampa Bay lead. Atlanta won the game on a short touchdown run by the decrepit "

Trubisky finished 18-of-30 for 179 yards and a touchdown. It was an above-average performance, as he slowed down following a hot start. However, he was able to put his team in position to tie, and he also threatened Detroit's defense with his legs, scrambling 6 times for 53 rushing yards. He inexplicably picked up a 4.h-and-13 on the final possession with a run past the first-down marker.    Trubisky's sole score went to rookie tight end "
