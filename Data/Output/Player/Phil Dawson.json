   "comment":"Phil Dawson was excellent for the 49ers as he was clutch all game, hitting long field goals and putting 16 points on the board.    Kansas City's offense started the game strongly, but the Chiefs couldn't put together any point-producing drives in the 4.h quarter in part because of a lack of receiving weapons. Kansas City got on the board first as the Chiefs moved the ball down the field. Jamaal Charles ran the ball well, while Junior Hemingway (5-40) led the Chiefs through the air. Alex Smith tossed a short touchdown to Travis Kelce (2-15). The 49ers tacked on 2 field-goal drives, including a 55-yarder from Dawson, and the Chiefs had 1 of their own. Just before halftime, Colin Kaepernick got the 49ers in the end zone. He led a 93-yard drive and finished it with a short touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson (1-9). Brandon Lloyd (3-76), Anquan Boldin (4-72), and Frank Gore (18-107) all chipped in to move the ball for San Francisco. In the third quarter, Kansas City got moving with a 26-yard run by Charles and a 15-yard pass to Dwayne Bowe (3-42). Smith then threw a swing pass to De'Anthony Thomas, who bolted into the end zone from 17 yards out to give the Chiefs a 17-13 lead. Kaepernick responded with 27-yard bullet to Boldin, but the drive stalled as Kansas City got sacks from Justin Houston and Alvin Bailey with pressures from Dontari Poe. Phil Dawson nailed a 52-yard field goal. San Francisco went to a fake punt early in the 4.h quarter close to midfield. Lloyd and Kaepernick took advantage of the opportunity, as Lloyd made a great catch for a gain of 29 yards. That led to another Dawson field goal to take the lead 19-17. The 49ers drained the clock with another drive to set up Dawson again. The Chiefs' comeback attempt ended quickly, as Smith sailed a pass down the middle of the field that was intercepted by "

   "comment":"Phil Dawson to tie the score at 10 entering the half. The 49ers put together a drive in the third quarter, but couldn't get a touchdown on a goal-to-go and had to settle for a field goal. Carr answered as he got red hot and carved up the San Francisco defense. He hit Andre Holmes (2-38) for 16 and Rivera for 27 yards. On third-and-1, Carr drilled Marcel Reese (7-64) for a 9-yard touchdown. After getting the ball back, Carr continued to be red hot as he ripped the ball through the 49ers' secondary, mainly using Reese and Rivera. Carr made another clutch throw on third and goal with a laser to Rivera, who caught the ball over a defensive back to put Oakland up 24-13. Kaepernick moved the ball into field goal range before Antonio Smith sacked him on a third down to end the drive before Phil Dawson missed the 47-yard attempt. After getting the ball back, "

   "comment":"Phil Dawson was good on his attempts, including a 53-yarder. The Ravens started to move the ball thanks to a nice kick return. The big play that led to a field goal was Flacco hitting tight end Crockett Gilmore for 19 yards. Kaepernick responded immediately as Torrey Smith burned new Raven Shareece Wright for a 76-yard touchdown. While he's struggled on some deep throws, Kaepernick threw that bomb perfectly. With the 49ers up 13-3, Flacco was picked off by forcing a pass to a covered receiver. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite cut in front of the ball, and that gave the 49ers another field goal. The Ravens answered with a field goal drive of their own. The 49ers took a 16-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Flacco threw an awful pass. It was late down the middle of the field, off his back foot, and up for grabs like a punt, and dropped in to San Francisco cornerback Kenneth Acker. A pop pass to Anquan Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal. Acker found that Flacco giveth and taketh away, as "

That set up another San Francisco field goal to tie the game at 16 with about 4 minutes remaining. The 49ers got the ball back and has 2 passes to Boldin that totaled 37 yards, but the drive stalled, and San Francisco decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal. After the Rams went nowhere, the game went to overtime. In the extra session, Case Keenum moved the ball across midfield with a completion to Britt for 18 yards. However, Dontae Johnson blocked a 48-yard field goal to keep the 49ers alive. San Francisco took advantage with a 15-yard pass to Torrey Smith, a roughing the passer penalty, and a 33-yard screen to Quinton Patton.

Torrey Smith (5-61) and Boldin (5-71-1) led San Francisco's receivers.    Case Keenum was 22-of-37 for 231 yards. Kenny Britt led the St. Louis receivers with 3 catches for 81 yards.
