This forced a long, game-winning attempt for Dan Bailey, which sailed wide left. Game over. I'm sure I forgot to list some other pretty bad errors, but despite them, the Cowboys were still in position to come away with a win because they moved the ball at will against Baltimore's defense. They completely gashed the Ravens, as both DeMarco Murray (14-93) and Felix Jones (18-92, TD) ran right at Ray Lewis, who was terrible yet again when he was in the game (more on this later)."

Dallas cut the lead to 23-17 in the third quarter after Romo moved the ball down the field with Bryant (5-110) and Austin (9-133). Romo ran in a bootleg on 4.h-and-goal for a 1.yard touchdown. The Cowboys then took the lead with Romo throwing a short touchdown pass to tight end John Phillips (3-14).    Manning finally got going in the 4.h quarter and moved the ball through the air to retake the lead with a field goal. Dallas was driving down the field, but Felix Jones (3-19) fumbled the ball away after running into his own linemen.
