   "comment":"Jones' helmet off. This was just minutes after Jason Campbell wasn't whistled for a blatant intentional grounding penalty. I really don't know what to say anymore about the officiating this year. I'd say it's been the worst I've ever seen, but I don't want to be fined by Roger Goodell.    That said, Campbell needs to be complimented for improving every week and learning Jim Zorn's West Coast offense very quickly. Campbell, who was 20-of-31 for 231 yards and 2 touchdowns, was a huge thorn in Dallas' side, as he kept moving the chains on third downs, and did a great job evading Dallas' pass rushers. The Cowboys had him dead to rights a couple of times, but he maneuvered his way out of sacks and located his receivers downfield.    And by receivers, I mean Santana Moss in large part. Moss led all targets with 8 receptions and 145 yards.    As for the Cowboys, 3 of Tony Romo's receivers - Jason Witten, Patrick Crayton and Terrell Owens - managed 7 catches. Witten and Owens found the end zone. Romo himself was 28-of-47, 300 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. That said, Washington's secondary did an outstanding job blanketing Owens and Witten. Those guys are going to put up numbers regardless, but they weren't exactly dominant.    One player who was far from dominant was Marion Barber. Don't blame him though. Barber carried the ball only 8 times (26 yards). This game was never out of reach for the Cowboys. I don't get why he didn't get the ball more often.    I also don't understand what happened to Felix Jones. No carries. No catches. Did the Cowboys forget about him, or did they just not want to waste their 2 running backs because they knew the referees would make sure Washington won this game no matter what? Ah crap, I think I'm going to have to write a $15,000 check to Goodell.   "

   "comment":"Jones, meanwhile, has really cooled off; he had only 4 grabs for 20 yards.    This contest was a 1-score game for 3-plus quarters, so you have to wonder why the Cowboys ran the ball only 11 times. Marion Barber led the squad with 5 carries for 26 yards. Tashard Choice and Felix Jones each had 3 rushes for 13 and 6 yards, respectively. I don't know what offensive coordinator Jason Garrett was doing all week, but if I had to guess, he was busy studying Andy Reid game tape instead of preparing for the Packers.    As mentioned, "

Jon Kitna capitalized off his team's great ground game by going 18-of-26 for 167 yards and a touchdown, as he made clutch throws all afternoon. Unfortunately, 1 of Kitna's targets, Dez Bryant (1-14) fractured his ankle. His season is over.    The Cowboys are now 3-1 with Garrett as their head coach, with the sole loss coming on that fluke fumble on Thanksgiving. It makes you wonder what could have happened if Jerry Jones fired Wade Phillips earlier.   "

   "comment":"Jones hurt his shoulder early. He had just 9 carries for 25 yards, and caught a pass for 5 yards. DeMarco Murray (6-21) and Tashard Choice (5-5) were not effective in relief.    While on the subject of injuries, Tony Romo was hit by Carlos Rogers toward the end of the second quarter and did not come out ready to play in the second half. It was Jon Kitna time and you know what that means - touchdowns, yards and interceptions. Kitna completed his first 3 passes before Donte Whitner intercepted him when Jason Witten did not go where he expected him to on a deep route. Witten saw a hefty 15 targets, catching 7 passes for 102 yards. Both quarterbacks looked at him, so if Romo's ribs keep him out, fantasy owners should not be worried about putting the tight end in the lineup. That interception was offset by a pick from Alan Ball who was starting at cornerback as part of a makeshift Dallas secondary. Five plays later, Kitna found Austin to tie the game at 14.    Where was Ted Ginn? Glad I am pretending you asked. Ginn was another heavily targeted player, leading the 49ers with 7, but he caught just 4 passes for 38 yards. He also was not a factor in the return game after housing a punt and kickoff to ice last week's win over Seattle. However, rookie Kendall Hunter did have a big kickoff return for 43 yards following the tying score. Unfortunately it was wasted when DeMarcus Ware started that drive with 1 of his 2 sacks. Kitna's next interception was a pass thrown behind Kevin Ogletree. Alex Smith immediately hit Delanie Walker who was matched up with Anthony Spencer and predictably ran right past him for a 29-yard score to make it 21-14. After the 2 interceptions apparently Romo's painkillers kicked in. He was hit a ton in this game even though he was sacked just once. One of the legal hits was from rookie Aldon Smith. Romo looked battered. San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh made a gutsy call going to the field goal from 55 yards out leading by 7 early in the fourth quarter, and veteran kicker David Akers came through for him. After that, in the fourth quarter the more talented Cowboys were done making mistakes and drove the ball on 3 straight scoring drives while the defense did not allow another first down. Dallas drove 80 yards for a touchdown to cut the lead to 24-21, then probably got too conservative with time running out by marching 44 yards to tie it with a field goal. I guess I can't really call the third 1 a drive since Romo hit reality TV show winner (seriously) Jesse Holley for a 77-yard pass on the first play of overtime. A quick field goal ended the game.    The takeaway is the injury status of Austin, Jones and Romo. We pretty much found out the Cowboys can't run much without Jones and will turn it over more without Romo. The 49ers played about as well as they could in this 1, but should have lost by double digits at least.   "

   "comment":"Jones' club would be 5-5 right now. It's almost inexplicable that the Redskins were able to move the chains so easily because Rex Grossman looked like he was going to give the game away early with his patented stupid interceptions and fumbles. He was guilty of 1 of each, but had a strip-6 overturned by a replay challenge. However, Grossman got into a groove in the second half and was able to finish 25-of-38 for 289 yards, 3 touchdowns ((2 passing, 1 rushing) and an interception.    What's even weirder is that Grossman was able to do this against Dallas' defense by throwing exclusively to Jabar Gaffney (7-115) and Donte' Stallworth (4-51), of all people. Fred Davis also had a decent outing (6-49).    So, whom would Mike Shanahan turn to this week at running back? Would it be Roy Helu? Roy Torain? Tashard Choice? How about all of the above? Helu (8-35), Choice (6-7) and Torain (5-4) all split time in the backfield. Helu is clearly the best of the 3, but Shanahan either is completely stupid or just hates fantasy football.    As for Dallas' backfield situation, there was no doubt that DeMarco Murray would be the feature back. He had the first 3 touches of the contest, and finished with 5 times as many carries as Felix Jones. Murray couldn't find much running room, however, tallying 73 yards on 25 attempts. Jones' 5 tries went for 18 yards.    "

   "comment":"Jones or a regular Dallas fan, is that the team lacked energy and showed no urgency in the first half. There were multiple fumble recovery opportunities, but the players were just really slow in jumping on the loose balls. It's almost like most of the Cowboys thought that this was the third preseason game instead of a win-or-die divisional battle for the final playoff spot.    I don't want to take anything away from the Giants though, who played really well in the first, second and fourth quarters. Eli Manning went 24-of-33 for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns, thanks to the dynamic play of Victor Cruz, who torched Newman for a 74-yard score. Cruz caught 6 balls for 178 yards and the touchdown in total. Hakeem Nicks (5-76, TD) also posted solid numbers.    Ahmad Bradshaw scored Manning's third touchdown. He also found the end zone on the ground, rushing for 57 yards on 16 attempts.    Romo, meanwhile, tossed both of his scores to Laurent Robinson (4-61). Dez Bryant (6-70) and Jason Witten (7-69) also performed well. Miles Austin-Jones didn't do much (2-20).    "

Romo later found Jason Witten open downfield, but the former Pro Bowl tight end dropped the ball. This was a major problem for Witten the entire afternoon. He dropped numerous passes, including a potential touchdown, hurting Dallas' ability to move the chains. Romo, as a result, went just 23-of-40 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. He was nearly intercepted a second time at the end of the third quarter, but linebacker K.J. Wright dropped a ball that was thrown right to him.

   "comment":"Jones both had easy drops on third down that would have moved the chains and kept drives alive in Atlanta territory. This would have given the Cowboys a pair of field-goal opportunities at the very least, which is key because they lost by 2 field goals. Also, Dallas had 7 plays in the red zone in the opening quarter and gained just 19 yards. On special teams, Dallas had a nice punt to pin the Falcons at their own 6-yard line at the end of the third quarter. The Cowboys committed a penalty, however, which gave Atlanta possession at the 20. The Falcons would go on to score a touchdown on the drive, breaking the 6-6 tie. On defense, the Cowboys had several opportunities to stop Atlanta and force a punt in the final minutes. However, Orlando Scandrick missed a tackle on Jacquizz Rodgers and then was whistled for a hold on Roddy White, allowing the Falcons to move the chains, eat up more time on the clock and kick the covering 32-yard field goal, prompting Al Michaels to give us his obligatory gambling reference.    Of course, the Falcons weren't flawless either. Matt Bryant whiffed on 2 attempts from 37 and 43 yards. Asante Samuel, meanwhile, dropped a gift Tony Romo interception in the end zone during the first half. Romo was decent overall, going 25-of-35 for 321 yards and a touchdown to Kevin Ogletree (3-96).    Dez Bryant was questionable entering this contest. He played, but did nothing (1-15), hurting his fantasy owners. Three Cowboys caught at least 5 passes: Austin-Jones (7-76), Felix Jones (5-70) and Jason Witten (7-51)."

Felix Jones, who boasted about being healthy for the first time in a while, rushed for just 43 yards on 14 carries, though he salvaged his fantasy day with a touchdown.    Dallas' furious, 13-point, second-half comeback was completely legitimate, as it outgained the Browns, 243-143 after intermission. It ruined a potential third victory of the season for Cleveland. Not that the Browns didn't have the opportunities to fend them off. "

   "comment":"Jones, meanwhile, didn't get a single touch because he blew a blitz pick-up. It makes you wonder why the Steelers cut Jonathan Dwyer, who was their most talented running back.    As mentioned, Jake Locker didn't have to do anything. He completed just 11-of-20 attempts for 125 yards. I wanted to see if he could put together a strong performance in hostile conditions, but we'll have to wait for that.    Only 3 Titans caught passes, with Nate Washington predictably leading the way with 4 grabs for 46 yards. Delanie Walker (3-40) and Kendall Wright (2-11) also had multiple catches, while Kenny Britt (1-15) barely did anything.    Chris Johnson had a tough matchup, which would explain his low YPC. He gained just 70 yards on 25 carries. Rookie rush linebacker Jarvis Jones blew him up on 1 play.    Speaking of Tennessee running backs, goal-line specialist "
