   "comment":"Everett managed to get in front of the receiver and picked it off. It was not a bad throw from Wentz, but he has to show better decision-making as he continues to develop.    Wentz was able to do a lot despite having only 1 proven receiver. Ertz led the way in targets (13), catches (10) and yards (112) during the game. He could end up being a big fantasy performer down the stretch, though the Redskins have been notoriously bad against tight ends this year.    Jordan Matthews (8-79) put together a strong performance, and he is the No. 1 receiver on the Eagles right now. He can be used as a WR3 unless he has a tough matchup. Nelson Agholor (2-22) looked better today as he used his speed to beat Washington's corners. He just did not see a lot of targets. Tight end Trey Burton (7-65) looked like another good intermediate weapon, while Darren Sproles caught the only touchdown for Wentz.    The Eagles were happy to welcome back Ryan Mathews to their back-by-committee system today. Mathews saw 15 carries for 60 yards, but was mostly bottled up in the second half. Mathews is only a mediocre runner, and he is not a recommended start in most fantasy formats. If you are desperate, use him as a FLEX. Normally, I would prefer Darren Sproles, who saw 5 carries for 27 yards and caught a touchdown, but he got knocked out in the second half by a pretty dirty Deshazor Everett hit. Sproles was getting ready to return a punt when Everett put a massive blow on him. He got there a split second before the ball and gave Sproles a knock to the head.    There was actually some long snapper drama in this game for the Eagles. Their long snapper, "
