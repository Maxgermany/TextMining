   "comment":"DeShone Kizer is off to a nice start in his career, at least as someone who is going to screw bettors with back-door touchdowns at the very end of games. Former Browns quarterback Seneca Wallace was the original back-door bandit, so perhaps Cleveland's coaching staff can develop Kizer into becoming Back-Door Bandit 2.0. That would be pretty cool for the Browns, who would finally have something to cheer for. On a more serious note, we'll see if Stephon Tuitt's injury is a major 1. Losing him would be huge.    The Steelers came into Cleveland favored by 8.5 points (closed at 10), but we know when the AFC North matches up, anything can happen. And once again, it almost did. The Steelers got out to a quick lead off a blocked punt recovered for a touchdown, but the Browns' young defense didn't let the game get away from them, as rookie DeShone Kizer ran in a touchdown from 1 yard out to tie up the game 7-7 going into the second quarter. He and the defense kept the game close throughout, but the young quarterback often held the ball too long, helping a swarming Pittsburgh defense to 7 sacks and an interception. "

  "comment":"DeShone Kizer was strip-sacked, giving Jacksonville the undeserved cover. If you had the Browns, you can't even call this a bad beat because they've done stuff like this almost every single week. The Jaguars, meanwhile, have improved to 7-3. They might be the worst team with 7 victories heading into Thanksgiving weekend in recent memory. Their defense is great, but ",
