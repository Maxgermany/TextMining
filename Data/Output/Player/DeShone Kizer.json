   "comment":"DeShone Kizer is off to a nice start in his career, at least as someone who is going to screw bettors with back-door touchdowns at the very end of games. Former Browns quarterback Seneca Wallace was the original back-door bandit, so perhaps Cleveland's coaching staff can develop Kizer into becoming Back-Door Bandit 2.0. That would be pretty cool for the Browns, who would finally have something to cheer for. On a more serious note, we'll see if Stephon Tuitt's injury is a major 1. Losing him would be huge.    The Steelers came into Cleveland favored by 8.5 points (closed at 10), but we know when the AFC North matches up, anything can happen. And once again, it almost did. The Steelers got out to a quick lead off a blocked punt recovered for a touchdown, but the Browns' young defense didn't let the game get away from them, as rookie DeShone Kizer ran in a touchdown from 1 yard out to tie up the game 7-7 going into the second quarter. He and the defense kept the game close throughout, but the young quarterback often held the ball too long, helping a swarming Pittsburgh defense to 7 sacks and an interception. "

   "comment":"DeShone Kizer had an epically horrid day. Kizer failed to complete half of his passes and was responsible for 4 turnovers. He also missed about 2 quarters with a migraine. Curiously, Kizer was inserted back into the game, and he was awful afterward. He was flagged for a delay-of-game penalty right away, then telegraphed an interception in the end zone. Kizer forced another pass that was picked off a bit later. Kizer ended up 15-of-31 for 182 yards, 3 picks and a lost fumble because he held the ball way too long in the pocket. There's going to be some question as to why Kizer was able to reenter the game. Kizer had a migraine, so weren't there concussion-related issues? It's not like this was a crucial game for the Browns, anyway. Why endanger Kizer? Besides, it's not like "
