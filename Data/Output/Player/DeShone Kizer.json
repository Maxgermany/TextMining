   "comment":"Kizer is off to a nice start in his career, at least as someone who is going to screw bettors with back-door touchdowns at the very end of games. Former Browns quarterback Seneca Wallace was the original back-door bandit, so perhaps Cleveland's coaching staff can develop Kizer into becoming Back-Door Bandit 2.0. That would be pretty cool for the Browns, who would finally have something to cheer for. On a more serious note, we'll see if "

   "comment":"Kizer had an epically horrid day. Kizer failed to complete half of his passes and was responsible for 4 turnovers. He also missed about 2 quarters with a migraine. Curiously, Kizer was inserted back into the game, and he was awful afterward. He was flagged for a delay-of-game penalty right away, then telegraphed an interception in the end zone. Kizer forced another pass that was picked off a bit later. Kizer ended up 15-of-31 for 182 yards, 3 picks and a lost fumble because he held the ball way too long in the pocket. There's going to be some question as to why Kizer was able to reenter the game. Kizer had a migraine, so weren't there concussion-related issues? It's not like this was a crucial game for the Browns, anyway. Why endanger Kizer? Besides, it's not like "

   "comment":"Kizer took a 15-yard sack when the ball was snapped over his head, and he didn't think quickly enough to throw it out of bounds after collecting it. Pacman Jones then had a 40-yard punt return to set up a touchdown. The Browns proceeded to move the chains after that, but a pair of drops ended the drive. Britt's drop turned into an interception because the ball popped into the air, and that set up another Cincinnati score. Giovani Bernard followed that up with a long touchdown on a busted coverage, and just like that, the game was over with the Bengals going up by 3 touchdowns. Dalton was extremely sharp, going 25-of-30 for 286 yards and 4 touchdowns. It helped that he was battling a defense missing its 2 best linemen, Myles Garrett and Danny Shelton, so his putrid blocking unit wasn't tested at all. Dalton was able to torch Cleveland's abysmal secondary with ease.    Cincinnati's poor blocking was apparent in the ground game. Many fantasy prognosticators expected a big game from Joe Mixon, but he let them down despite getting 17 carries. He turned those attempts into 29 yards, tying Dalton for the team's rushing lead. He also caught 4 balls for 19 receiving yards. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hill mustered only 16 yards on 6 tries, fumbling once in the process.    Two of Dalton's touchdowns were thrown to Tyler Kroft, who exposed Cleveland's Jamie Collins-less linebacking corps. Kroft caught 6 balls for 68 yards and the 2 scores, with his longest gain, a 21-yarder, coming on a busted coverage. Bernard (3-67) and A.J. Green (5-63) also found the end zone.    As for the Browns, Kizer was eventually benched in the second half, and for good reason. He finished 16-of-34 for only 118 yards and the interception, which wasn't his fault. That said, Kizer played terribly. So many of his passes were off the mark, and it took him forever to process information. He also wasn't a factor as a runner - 5 scrambles, 10 rushing yards - so he didn't have any positive moments outside of a 26-yard completion on a third-and-13. The Browns really need to consider sitting Kizer for a while until things slow down for him. "

   "comment":"Kizer didn't commit any turnovers. Kizer, however, had some accuracy issues, as indicated by his stat line; he was 18-of-34 for only 179 yards to go along with 18 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground. Kizer threw some passes into the dirt and sailed a ball over Njoku's head for a big gain. However, he also had several passes that were dropped, as his receivers screwed him out of a potentially decent game.    Crowell, who had the aforementioned crucial fumble, actually had a strongfantasy performance for once. He rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, and he also caught 4 passes for 54 receiving yards. Crowell was a greater part of the passing game because "

   "comment":"Kizer was strip-sacked, giving Jacksonville the undeserved cover. If you had the Browns, you can't even call this a bad beat because they've done stuff like this almost every single week. The Jaguars, meanwhile, have improved to 7-3. They might be the worst team with 7 victories heading into Thanksgiving weekend in recent memory. Their defense is great, but Blake Bortles and the offensive line nearly blew this game against a dreadful 0-9 opponent. Cleveland dominated the trenches on the defensive side of the ball, and that's why the Jaguars were limited to just 284 net yards, with only 78 coming in the second half. Bortles finished 17-of-30 for only 154 yards and a touchdown. He also had 2 fumbles, losing 1 on a Myles Garrett strip-sack when Jacksonville was in field-goal range. Bortles settled mostly for checkdowns, which is why he was able to avoid interceptions in this windy, snowy game.    Leonard Fournette entered the game questionable, but he had a solid showing against a quality run defense, gaining 111 yards on 28 carries.    Marqise Lee once again paced the Jaguars with 5 catches for 45 receiving yards. Rookie Dede Westbrook, making his pro debut, hauled in 3 balls for 35 yards, but he made some mistakes. He dropped a pass in the second quarter and then fumbled on the very next play. Fortunately for Westbrook, his team retained possession because the Browns couldn't recover the ball before it trickled out of bounds.    As for the Browns, Kizer took a big step backward from last week. He had a decent performance versus the Lions, but he managed to complete only half of his passes in this affair, going 16-of-32 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He was actually picked on his very first pass attempt, and he had the aforementioned lost fumble on the strip-sack at the end. Kizer had a couple of nice throws - he ripped a ball to "
