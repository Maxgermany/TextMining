   "comment":"Ryan Shazier had a great afternoon - but it's a very dubious sign that most of the Pittsburgh defenders were so exhausted by the end of the game. It's not a good sign going forward, especially with a game coming up on Thursday.    You might be wondering whom Hoyer threw to, considering that his receiving corps is so depleted. Shazier had a great afternoon - but it's a very dubious sign that most of the Pittsburgh defenders were so exhausted by the end of the game. It's not a good sign going forward, especially with a game coming up on Thursday.    You might be wondering whom Hoyer threw to, considering that his receiving corps is so depleted. Jordan Cameron, the only prominent name, caught only 2 balls for 47 yards, though he would've scored a touchdown in the first half if he didn't stumble over his own 2 feet. Cameron left the game in the third quarter because he aggravated his AC joint. Andrew Hawkins actually dominated the targets and receptions. He saw 10 balls thrown his way, and he snagged 8 of them for 87 yards. No other Brown recorded more than 2 catches.    While Hawkins is worth an add, the No. 1 player who should be picked up in Week 1 is rookie running back Terrance West. Ben Tate was running well early - 6 carries, 41 yards - but he hurt his knee and left the game. Shocker. West took over and was dominant, tallying 100 yards on just 16 carries. He has lots of talent, so he needs to be added in all formats.    Ben Roethlisberger had a great stat line - 23-of-34, 365 yards, touchdown and an interception - but those numbers are slightly misleading because some of Roethlisberger's big, first-half gains came on screens. For instance, an Antonio Brown 41-yarder on the opening drive came on a slip screen. Roethlisberger also struggled in the second half, going just 7-of-12 for 87 yards following intermission. Having said that, Roethlisberger made several great plays to lead his team to victory, which was capped off by a game-winning drive at the very end when Cleveland had all of the momentum. What stood out most was when he escaped out of 2 potential sacks and found Brown in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. It should be noted that part of the reason Roethlisberger struggled after the break was because the offensive line couldn't block Cleveland at all.    Brown paced the Steelers in receiving yardage with 116 on 5 catches. Le'Veon Bell (6 catches, 88 yards) and Markus Wheaton (6-97) tied for the team lead in catches. Rookie cornerback Justin Gilbert struggled to cover Wheaton.    I mentioned Shazier earlier. The No. 15 overall pick had a terrific regular-season debut. He made a huge hit on Terrance West, stuffed another running back for a loss and made a pass break-up in the first half, nearly coming away with an interception. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
