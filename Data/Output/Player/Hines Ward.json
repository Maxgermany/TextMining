Backup running back Jonathan Dwyer took his first carry of the season for 76 yards. The Pittsburgh offensive line made some great blocks and Dwyer broke free into the secondary. He was caught from behind by Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. The drive was capped with another short touchdown toss from Big Ben. Roethlisberger was moving the ball for another score just before halftime. The Steelers tried a fake spike, but his pass was intercepted by cornerback Cortland Finnegan. In the first half, Roethlisberger completed 15-of-22 passes for 114 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Wallace had 3 receptions for 24 yards. Miller had 2 catches for 26 yards and a score. Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward.
