   "comment":"Hines Ward touchdown, but ruled the catch incomplete even though the ball never hit the ground. When that happened, I had a pretty good feeling that the Steelers weren't going to cover the spread.    Two big stories for the Steelers. On the defensive side, Troy Polamalu played just his second game of the season. Polamalu made his presence known with an interception. Polamalu limped off the field on the same left knee he hurt in the opener after making the pick, but he returned to the game later on.    On offense, Ben Roethlisberger was 23-of-35 for a whopping 417 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Roethlisberger was sacked 3 times, but often had a ton of time to throw on most plays. On his first score, Roethlisberger seriously had 10 seconds in the pocket.    Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes both had huge games."
