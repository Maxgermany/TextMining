   "comment":"Alec Ogletree stripped the ball away from Rainey on the next drive. Following the sudden change, St. Louis dialed up an awesome double-reverse to Stedman Bailey (3-44), who bolted down the field for a 27-yard touchdown run. The Rams should have scored more often, but had ball-security issues. On a third-and-goal, Kellen Clemens fumbled the ball away on a quarterback draw. St. Louis got the ball in Tampa Bay territory again, but Stacy fumbled the ball away after a hit from Dekoda Watson. The Rams had a 14-10 lead at the half. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Glennon fumbled the ball away on a sack from James Laurinaitis and Alec Ogletree. That set up another St. Louis field goal.
