   "comment":"Byron Bell, who had a rough night. In addition blocking poorly, Bell also nullified a first down with a face mask infraction. Carolina didn't help matters with dumb penalties and turnovers. Playing like the 49ers, the Panthers continuously shot themselves in the foot with terrible errors. I already mentioned the Bell infraction and that Newton was strip-sacked by Jones. In the third quarter, an encroachment infraction on a field goal attempt put the defense back on the field. The Steelers scored a touchdown 1 play later. And then there was Philly Brown's muffed punt which he picked up and tried to advance, only to have it knocked out of his hands and secured in the end zone for a Pittsburgh touchdown. That was the nail in the coffin, as the Panthers were down 10 with 11 minutes remaining and receiving possession. That blunder put this game out of reach.    Newton had a night to forget. His numbers don't look bad - 24-of-35, 250 yards, touchdown - but he looked hobbled and resorted to short attempts for the most part. The Steelers hit him hard - which included a violent Bell and LeGarrette Blount combined for 265 rushing yards. Some of that came in garbage time - Blount burst for a 50-yarder when this game was out of reach - but the Panthers looked helpless when trying to bring down Bell. The second-year runner gained 147 yards on 21 carries. He showed off some brilliant cuts throughout the evening and exploded for 81-yard gain on a first-and-20 in the second half. Roethlisberger, meanwhile, went 22-of-30 for 196 yards and 2 touchdowns. He should've had 2 other scores. On 1 occasion, "
