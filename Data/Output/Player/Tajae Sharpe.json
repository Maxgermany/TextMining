The Jaguars played with a tremendous amount of effort, while the Titans, fresh off emotional, difficult victories versus the Broncos and Chiefs, appeared to be sleepwalking, taking this game for granted. As a result, Jacksonville had its best performance of the season, finally displaying the potential the Jaguar truthers have been clamoring about all of these years.    "
