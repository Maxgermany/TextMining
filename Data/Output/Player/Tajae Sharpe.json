   "comment":"Tajae Sharpe (2-10). Sharpe dropped a pass.    The Chiefs, meanwhile, appeared as though they were lucking their way into another win, but they definitely had their part in blowing this victory. They got out to an early lead, but in typical Andy Reid fashion, they went into a conservative shell and hoped to just hold on to the lead. That didn't happen, though it may have been possible if the Chiefs didn't blow opportunities. It started in the second quarter when the Chiefs failed to convert 2 chances at the 1-yard line. "

   "comment":"Tajae Sharpe (3-48) led the way, while Matthews (3-31) and Walker (3-23) caught touchdowns.    Moving on to the victors, teams typically rally around a new coach, and that's exactly what the Jaguars did with Doug Marrone replacing the utterly incompetent Gus Bradley. The Jaguars played with a tremendous amount of effort, while the Titans, fresh off emotional, difficult victories versus the Broncos and Chiefs, appeared to be sleepwalking, taking this game for granted. As a result, Jacksonville had its best performance of the season, finally displaying the potential the Jaguar truthers have been clamoring about all of these years.    "
