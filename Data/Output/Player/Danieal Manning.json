   "comment":"Manning took the opening kickoff to the New England 12-yard line. However, they settled for 3 instead of 7. which has been a theme for them of late. Matt Schaub threw a perfect pass to James Casey in the end zone, but the tight end dropped it. Schaub then missed Andre Johnson (8-95) on third down, so Houston had to kick a field goal. Schaub finished 34-of-51 for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, but don't be fooled by those stats because they were padded in 4.h-quarter garbage time. Schaub wasn't terrible, but he could have been much better. He missed some open targets and fumbled the ball when he was moving out of the pocket and carrying it around loosely. His interception was a killer; his team was in field-goal range down 11 in the third quarter. He carelessly lofted a pass over the middle of the field, but didn't see Rob Ninkovich dropping into coverage.    Schaub's touchdowns went to DeVier Posey (3-47), who suffered an injury in the 4.h quarter, and Arian Foster, whose 7 catches for 47 yards complemented his 90 rushing yards and score on the ground on 22 carries. However, Foster struggled to run early on, and he was guilty of a dropped ball on what surely looked like it would be a long gain.    New England will host the Ravens next Sunday in what will be a rematch of last year's AFC Championship. The Patriots are so sound offensively and defensively, but they have to be concerned about kick coverage. Manning had 2 big kickoff returns, so Jacoby Jones, who has 3 special-teams touchdowns this season, has to be licking his chops."
