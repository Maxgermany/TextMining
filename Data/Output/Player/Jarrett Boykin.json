   "comment":"Jarrett Boykin to come away with zero receptions. Earl Thomas needs to stop playing special teams. A muffed punt of his led to a Green Bay touchdown. Michael Bennett, meanwhile, had a strip-sack of Aaron Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with 1 touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took 3 sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to Randall Cobb (6-58), but Jordy Nelson was the primary target. Seeing Byron Maxwell for most of the night, Nelson snagged 9 balls for 83 yards. Jarrett Boykin, meanwhile, was completely blanked because he was matched up against Sherman all evening.    "
