It appeared as though Green Bay's season would be over because the Bears were battling a Philadelphia team that had nothing to play for. The Bears lost, however, granting the Packers new life. They'll play in Chicago next week for the NFC North title. It'll obviously be huge for the Packers if Aaron Rodgers is cleared to play. He has a good chance, and he'll need to suit up because Flynn once again wasn't very good. In addition to the 2 aforementioned mistakes, he took some bad sacks and missed several receivers on overthrows. He also fired a pick-six on 1 of the most awkward passes I've ever seen. It was so odd that I jotted down pick-six WTF? in my notes. Flynn finished 21-of-39 for 232 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception. His offense's struggles to move the ball through the air wasn't all his fault; the Packers had 3 drops in the opening half. Also, Eddie Lacy, who gained 84 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries, suffered an ankle injury in the third quarter and never returned, and the offense sputtered afterward as a consequence. This is why it's absolutely crucial for Rodgers to return. If the Packers don't have him or Lacy, they'll have major problems moving the chains next week despite how awful Chicago's defense looked Sunday night.    Lacy wasn't the only major Packer to suffer an injury. Clay Matthews aggravated his thumb injury in the first half and never reentered the game. There's a chance he broke it again, which would be disastrous.    A trio of Packers caught 3 or more passes: Boykin (5-54, TD), Nelson (3-46) and James Jones (9-84)."

   "comment":"Jarrett Boykin to come away with zero receptions. Earl Thomas needs to stop playing special teams. A muffed punt of his led to a Green Bay touchdown. Michael Bennett, meanwhile, had a strip-sack of Aaron Rodgers when he beat right tackle Derek Sherrod. The play resulted in a safety, and it's what completely put the Seahawks in command. It was a 20-10 contest at that point. The safety and the ensuing drive, which saw Seattle begin with good field position, allowed the Seahawks to go up 29-10. They never looked back after that, as the Packers had no chance to mount a comeback because of Circadian rhythms.    The Packers nearly lost more than this game. Left tackle Bryan Bulaga aggravated the same knee he had surgery on to repair an ACL tear last year. Fortunately, it was just a sprain. He might be ready for Week 2 because he'll have 10 days to heal. Aaron Rodgers will want Bulaga against the Jets' defensive line. Rodgers went 23-of-33 for only 189 yards with 1 touchdown, an interception and the lost fumble that resulted in a safety. Rodgers made some nice downfield throws - he drew a 44-yard pass interference - but struggled with pressure overall. He took 3 sacks and easily could've had more. Rodgers' touchdown went to Randall Cobb (6-58), but Jordy Nelson was the primary target. Seeing Byron Maxwell for most of the night, Nelson snagged 9 balls for 83 yards. Jarrett Boykin, meanwhile, was completely blanked because he was matched up against Sherman all evening.    Boykin to come away with zero receptions. Earl Thomas needs to stop playing special teams.
