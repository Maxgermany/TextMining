   "comment":"Michael Bush cashed in to put Oakland back in front 10-7. Welker receptions and a few Bush cashed in to put Oakland back in front 10-7. Welker receptions and a few BenJarvus Green-Ellis runs, including a 1-yard plunge for a touchdown, changed that in a hurry to make it 14-10 New England. The Black Hole was not in panic mode though. Darrius Heyward-Bey picked up 28 yards on a reception, and the return of Jacoby Ford was felt with a trick play run good for 30 yards. The drive ended on an interception I can't even describe. Announcer Solomon Wilcots assumed Campbell was trying to throw the ball away with no Raiders in the vicinity at the New England 6-yard line on second down and goal. I surmised he just delivered it directly to Patrick Chung, who caught it easily even with a hand in a cast. The Patriots drove for a field goal to make it 17-10 at the halftime gun. Wasted yardage, 75 on that drive, was a theme for the Raiders, who piled up 504 while never realistically having a shot to win down the stretch. If it feels like I am jumping ahead ,it is because the Patriots moved the ball at will in this game when they needed to. Welker's receiving and the hard running of rookie Stevan Ridley were unstoppable. Ridley capped the first drive of the second half with a touchdown run from 33 yards out. Oakland did answer with a drive for a field goal, but it took 7:34 to get it done. An offense built to wear teams down running the ball is not going to beat an offense run by Tom Brady with long marches for 3 points. Already up double digits, New England just kept going to Welker for 9, 19, 6 and 28 yards along the way before hitting Deion Branch for the touchdown to make it 31-13. With the game now in the 4.h quarter, it was up to Campbell to make big plays down the field. He really wasn't up to it although he led a drive down to the New England 30 before throwing an interception to Vince Wilfork. Someone on Twitter joked about Wilfork Island since the big boy now has a couple picks in the past 3 games, but it is more like a continent. There was just some scrapping after that. The Patriots tried to smash in another in your face touchdown and failed. The Raiders found Heyward-Bey for 58 yards and Bush for 35 on consecutive passing plays in the closing moments to set up rookie phenom Denarius Moore, a total non-factor most of the day, for a garbage touchdown."

The Bears needed to lean on the running game with a backup quarterback, but Matt Forte lost 3 yards to start their next drive, which went 3.and-out.

Chicago forced a punt, but as would be another theme, they were backed up by Shane Lechler. Hanie picked up a first down on a 17-yard scramble, but the yardage was offset by a personal foul on fullback Tyler Clutts. Perhaps playing in front of the home crowd was too much for Clutts, who went to Fresno State and is from Clovis, Calif. After a false start, Hanie nervously tossed a pick to Stanford Routt while under pressure from Aaron Curry. Oakland's offense barely did enough to score, coming up with just 2 yards on the drive but since Janikowski is their kicker, it was no problem. He was good from 47 yards out for the 6-0 lead.

   "comment":"Michael Bush (18-77) and it fell incomplete. The Raiders' defense held, but with Bush (18-77) and it fell incomplete. The Raiders' defense held, but with Sebastian Janikowski at their disposal, this failure cost them 3 points they would desperately need later. Oakland's next drive began with a run from Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece. He rumbled down the sidelines for 56 yards, but stepped out of bounds after 26. Jim Schwartz smartly threw the challenge flag and got back the yardage. When Cliff Avril sacked Palmer, it looked like the Lions would stop the drive, but he was flagged for a horse collar. Chris Houston drew a flag on the very next play for illegal contact, and 1 play later, Stephen Tulloch was nailed for yet another horse collar. The penalties set the Raiders up at the Detroit 12, and Louis Murphy ran it in for a touchdown on a reverse for the game's first score. The Lions answered with a touchdown drive that started off with small gains and ended with a bomb to Calvin Johnson (9-214, 2 TDs) for the 51-yard tying score. Megatron regularly made big plays against a defense that seemed confused about his status as an elite force of nature. After an exchange of punts, Oakland started to open up the passing game, which was open against a defense weakened by the loss of free safety Chris Harris. Darrius Heyward-Bey had a 35-yard gain to bail the Raiders out of poor field position, and then he caught a 43-yard touchdown to put Oakland back on top 14-7. Heyward-Bey (8-155 yards, TD) broke loose from Chris Houston's attempt to knock him over and sprinted to the end zone. Another exchange of punts, Detroit got its offense in gear again. Johnson was covered by Rolando McClain and responded with a 17-yard reception. Even after Tommy Kelly put the Raiders' defense in a hole with an offsides penalty, Oakland was able to force a third down. Johnson was the man again, this time on a 6-yard reception. One play later, Stafford went deep to Nate Burleson for a 39-yard score to tie the game. I immediately felt that the Lions scored too quickly, leaving a minute for an Oakland defense known for scoring late in halves this season. Palmer threw on 6 consecutive plays, completing 4 throws for 45 yards. Bush picked up 6 more yards on a run right up the middle, and Janikowski's 46-yard field goal put the Raiders up 17-14 at halftime. The third quarter was a mess for both offenses. Oakland struggled to convert third downs (1-of-9) the entire game, and even though Detroit was effective (8-of-17), they did most of their damage on big scoring plays. "

   "comment":"Michael Bush picked up 4 yards on first down, he was stuffed on second down to force a passing situation. Bush (23-70) was contained all day and had a long run of just 11 yards. The Raiders' running game is totally different without Darren McFadden's speed on the outside to loosen up opposing defenses, and even quick rookie Taiwan Jones (out with a hamstring) might have helped. Instead, Palmer threw incomplete, and Sebastian Janikowski came in to put Oakland up 3-0 very early. On Kansas City's first possession, Thomas Jones went right up the middle for 22 yards on the second play from scrimmage. It was by far the longest run of the game by either team though, and after that, Jones (11-51) and Jackie Battle (14-56) combined for just 85 yards on 24 carries for a 3.54 yard average. In other words, both run defenses stepped up in what felt like a playoff game, albeit a wild card, atmosphere. Jones was stopped on the next play, and 2 incompletions later, the Chiefs were punting. At least Dustin Colquitt trapped the Raiders at their own 3-yard line. Oakland battled its way out of poor field position, but the always-entertaining Carson Palmer threw while being hit, and his pass went right at Derrick Johnson for the easy interception. Earlier in the drive, Johnson had fallen down to allow a 17-yard pickup by Bush on a screen, so it was a bit of redemption for him. Kansas City small-balled its way on the next drive toward the end zone after starting at the Raiders' 36. All 8 plays were for gains, but none covered more than 7 yards. The march stalled inside the 10, a familiar failure for this offense all season, and Ryan Succop tied the game at 3. After an exchange of punts took the game into the second quarter, Oakland had a very Oakland sequence. Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Bush picked up 4 yards on first down, he was stuffed on second down to force a passing situation. Bush (23-70) was contained all day and had a long run of just 11 yards. The Raiders' running game is totally different without Darren McFadden's speed on the outside to loosen up opposing defenses, and even quick rookie Taiwan Jones (out with a hamstring) might have helped.
