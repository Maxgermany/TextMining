There wasn't anything the Chiefs could do after the break, facing a huge deficit. They at least logged a bit of yardage to avoid the poor field position that plagued them in the second quarter, but the Jets went 90 yards for a touchdown to really ice the game. The big plays in that march were all Kansas City penalties. The Chiefs were flagged 5 times for an astounding 81 yards and Sanchez capped the drive with a 3-yard run, and at 35-3, the rout was on.

   "comment":"Kerley threw a pass off an end around to Dustin Keller for a gain of 41 yards. The drive ended with Sanchez tossing a 1.yard touchdown pass to Keller. New York's lack of discipline was a crippler in the first half. The team had repeated false start penalties that turned a promising drive into a field goal. Conversely, the Jets' defense had an excellent first half. They were aided by Brian Hartline dropping a perfectly thrown deep pass from Moore. Brodney Pool intercepted Moore, but Sanchez gave it right back with a terrible pick. Under pressure, Sanchez tried to dump a pass off but instead he was picked by defensive lineman Randy Starks. That set up a 58-yard field goal from Dan Carpenter on the final play of the first half. The third quarter started out as more of the same and there was zero scoring, but the Dolphins started a long drive at their own 6-yard line with just under 8 minutes in the period. The possession consumed the rest of the quarter. Miami finished the drive with a short touchdown pass from Moore to Charles Clay. It was a 21-play, 94-yard drive that took over 12 minutes off the clock. Moore was extremely efficient as he moved down the field by spreading the ball around, and the Jets couldn't get a pass rush. On the next drive, Dolphins-great Jason Taylor toasted D'Brickashaw Ferguson and started to wrestle Sanchez to the ground. The third-year quarterback made an idiotic move and tossed the ball toward the line of scrimmage, bouncing it off the back of the head of center Nick Mangold, allowing Starks to make his second pick of the game. Starks ran downfield and the Jets were lucky the big lineman didn't return it for a touchdown. The Miami started the drive at the New York 25-yard line, but only yielded a field goal. After the punt, the Jets finally started to move the ball, aided by a roughing-the-passer penalty on Yeremiah Bell. The Dolphins sealed the game with another pick of Sanchez. It was a terrible pass thrown behind his target. Miami outside linebacker Marvin Mitchell returned the pick 55 yards to set up another field goal. On New York's final possession, Sanchez moved the ball effectively, tossing a short touchdown pass to Patrick Turner, but it was too little too late since the onside kick attempt didn't work out. It wasn't clear if it was injury-related or because of a coaching decision, but Jets wide receiver Santonio Holmes was benched and did not record a catch in the game. Moore was 22-of-32 for 135 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Miami was led on the ground by Steve Slaton (11-55) and in the air by wide receiver Brandon Marshall (6-50). New York running backs LaDanian Tomlinson (11-56) and Shonn Greene (14-55) had some good runs, but never controlled the game on the ground. Kerley (4-71) and Keller (7-45) had quality games for the Jets. New York will have an interesting offseason, and the organization will surely make some changes on its coaching staff. Miami showed some heart this season and actually has a base of talent to work with. What the Dolphins really need is to find a franchise quarterback.   "

In 1 humorous instance, Sanchez heaved a pass toward Tebow, who didn't look for the pass and consequently had the ball bounce off his helmet. But then when the Jets need to use Tebow, he's nowhere to be found. For example, the Jets had a first-and-goal at the Miami 1-yard line in the third quarter, but they didn't use Tebow a single time. As a result, they couldn't find the end zone, when Tebow probably could have scored easily.    Sanchez's 1 touchdown went to Kerley (2-73). "

   "comment":"Kerley on a 3rd-and-4. The crowd booed Sanchez as he ran off the field. New York, however, quickly realized that it had a huge advantage in the running game, which is how it tallied 185 total yards of offense for the rest of the first half. It was ugly for the Colts. They looked completely helpless trying to stop a very mediocre Shonn Greene. Greene rushed for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns on 32 carries, but don't think he did anything spectacular; on the contrary, he ran straight forward, as he usually does, showing absolutely no elusiveness, save for some stiff-arms and 1 play in which he spun away from safety Antoine Bethea. He was simply able to accumulate yardage because New York's offensive line blasted open massive holes for him.    Thanks to Greene (as well as Joe McKnight, who had a 61-yard burst), Sanchez didn't have to do much. He went 11-of-18 for 82 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he constantly had defenders in his face - Jerry Hughes had a good game - whenever he dropped back to throw. He's pretty fortunate that his team was able to run the ball as well as it did; otherwise, he would have struggled to move the chains and may have been replaced by Tim Tebow, who completed a 23-yard pass on a fake punt. Tebow also had 4 scrambles for 7 rushing yards.    Sanchez's scores went to Stephen Hill (3-23) and Jason Hill (1-5). Jeremy Kerley (3-24) was the team's leading receiver.    As for the Colts, "

Rex Ryan, who is the only person who could've called a timeout from the Jets' sideline, was completely befuddled that the score was wiped out. He didn't even find out until during the post-game press conference that Mornhinweg was the 1 who requested the stoppage. Ryan isn't faultless though. He made some blunders of his own, as he had to waste timeouts in the second half for having too many men on the field. Those errors go along with Muhammad Wilkerson's ejection for throwing 2 punches. Meanwhile, Smith got away with a couple of turnovers after intermission. Smith nearly threw an interception, and he also appeared to heave a backward pass that was inexplicably ruled an incompletion. The reversal even had CBS ref Mike Carey perplexed.    Smith missed Decker, who snagged a team-high 4 balls for 63 yards and Smith's lone aerial touchdown. When Decker left the game, Smith had to focus on Kerley and his mediocre tight ends. It's no surprise that New York's offense was stymied against a porous defense in the second half.    "

I don't know if that says more about Gabbert's incompetence or the lack of talent in San Francisco's receiving corps, but it's a sad state of affairs. As for Kerley and Hyde, the former caught 8 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. Given how much Gabbert loves throwing to him, Kerley should be owned in all formats. Hyde, meanwhile, gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He also caught all 6 of his targets for 36 receiving yards.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how horrible Phil Simms was tonight. He called Jeremy Kerley Jeremy Colored - kind of racist, eh? - and then said, This game's going to come down to who can make the less mistakes. The less mistakes? You mean fewer mistakes? What kind of English is that? Simms' logic was poor, too. They should run more option! he exclaimed of the 49ers. So, they ran the option, prompting Simms to say, All these teams have seen it so much, they know how to defend it. Contradictory, much? I wasn't the only 1 to notice Simms' woeful announcing.

   "comment":"Kerley (2-15) and Torrey Smith (1-17) were all relatively disappointing. They may have performed better with a different quarterback, but they were still underwhelming.    In terms of the running game, the 49ers used a rather ineffective rotation of DuJuan Harris and Mike Davis. Carlos Hyde was out for the game, so Davis was expected to carry the load; however, Harris got 11 carries, for 39 yards, while Davis just received 7. for 21 yards. Harris looked like a decent change-of-pace back, but Davis is just a plodder at the best. Shaun Draughn did not see a carry, but he did have 5 catches for 37 yards and a touchdown. Perhaps he will get more carries moving forward if Hyde misses any more time.    Defensively, the 49ers suffered a lot of injuries. At any point, it seemed like they were missing multiple players. Rashard Robinson, Arik Armstead and Nick Bellore were among the many players to go down. It will be interesting to see how San Francisco's injury report shakes out following this contest.    As for the Buccaneers, this was a very encouraging performance. Most importantly, they got a great effort out of their second-year quarterback, Jameis Winston. Winston was incredibly sharp during this game. He went 21-of-30 for 269 yards and 3 total touchdowns. Winston did throw a pick, but that was probably his only blemish. On all 3 of his touchdowns, Winston made excellent throws. The first 1 went to Mike Evans (8-96) after Winston moved around the pocket and stepped up into open space. It was a nice display of his mobility. The second touchdown went to Russell Shepard (5-77). Winston lofted a perfect pass into a small window that allowed Shepard to go up and catch the pass. It was definitely Winston's best throw of the game. The final score went to Evans as well. Winston put the pass up where only his tall receiver could get it. It was a smart play that really helped to solidify the lead for the Buccaneers. If Winston can continue to play like this against major competition, that would be great for Tampa. They definitely need him to play well if they want to have any chance of competing in the future.    In terms of the receivers, Evans and Shepard really led the way for the team. They combined to catch 13 of Winston's 21 completions. It looks like they will be the top guys moving forward. Aside from those 2. tight end Cameron Brate (3-29) and wide receiver Adam Humphries (2-17) will continue to see targets. Brate is worth consideration as a TE2 with upside, while Humphries is too inconsistent to be relied on in fantasy.    The other player who really helped the Bucs win today was running back Jacquizz Rodgers. The veteran looks to be a terrific fit in the Tampa Bay offense. Rodgers got 26 carries during the game and totaled a whopping 154 yards. He was able to gash the 49ers' poor run defense and should be the top running option moving forward. He will be a FLEX with upside most weeks. Aside from him, Peyton Barber totaled 12 carries for 84 yards, most of which came on a late 44-yard touchdown burst. He will probably be the top backup until Doug Martin gets healthy.    On defense, the Buccaneers got a terrific performance from their defensive linemen. Gerald McCoy was able to put a lot of pressure on Kaepernick. Though McCoy only had 1 sack, he broke through the 49ers' offensive line repeatedly and set up his teammates for the other sacks. Tampa Bay collected 4 in total, and this was a really strong performance for the unit.    Final Note: Both of these teams ended up having special-teams issues in the contest. For the 49ers, they had a terrible play occur that helped the Buccaneers stay in the game. On a punt, rookie wideout Aaron Burbridge crashed into the return man Jeremy Kerley, and that resulted in a critical fumble. Tampa recovered the fumble, eventually turning that into 3 points. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers had some problems of their own. Their rookie kicker, "
