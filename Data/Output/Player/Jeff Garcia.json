I thought it was a mistake for Gruden to start the error-prone Griese over Luke McCown.    Despite Griese being under center, Antonio Bryant was still as dominant as ever, catching 8 passes for 108 yards and a score.

Cadillac Williams actually led the team in carries with 14 for 59 yards. Warrick Dunn had just 40 yards on 12 attempts, but also caught 7 passes for 50 more yards.    A doubting Buccaneer fan may snicker at the Falcons for barely winning this contest despite Garcia being hurt. I think that's a bit naive, seeing as how Tampa Bay lost to the "

   "comment":"Garcia and Jon Gruden all they want for their late-season collapse, but I'd like to point the finger at Monte Kiffin. Kiffin has been a Hall of Fame-caliber defensive coordinator for years, but ever since he announced that he'll be joining his son at the University of Tennessee, essentially mentally resigning from the team, Tampa Bay's defense has been abysmal. Case in point: Michael Bush bulldozed the Buccaneers for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns on 27 rushes. JaMarcus Russell, meanwhile, actually played really well for a change, going 14-of-21 for 148 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Russell played like the great player Al Davis billed him as a few months ago. Eventually, Monte Kiffin, like Lane, will have to get over it.    Russell went to Johnnie Lee Higgins 6 times for 52 yards and a score. As for Justin Fargas and Darren McFadden, the 2 runners left the game with injuries.    I brought up Garcia earlier; the skittish signal caller was 17-of-33 for 257 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Those numbers aren't that bad, but they don't show that Garcia missed a number of wide-open targets downfield. One of those targets, "
