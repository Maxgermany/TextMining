   "comment":"Kellen Moore has to be discouraging. Ryan Fitzpatrick, as mentioned earlier, will be New York's downfall. Fitzpatrick had some shaky moments in this game. He threw a horrible interception in his own territory that allowed the Cowboys to score. He was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions and was guilty of several other ugly throws, including a horrible pass behind Eric Decker on a crucial third down. He made some gutsy plays - he even opened a giant cut above his nose, which was bleeding for most of the evening, but he's just not a good quarterback. Fitzpatrick finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception, which was a terrible read. To be fair, he endured some drops, including what would've been a 30-yard gain by Brandon Marshall, and he managed to set up Randy Bullock for a game-winning field goal at the very end on a long pass to Kenbrell Thompkins, who beat rookie Byron Jones.    Fitzpatrick's sole aerial score went to Decker (6-55), while Brandon Marshall (4-74) led the team in receiving yardage. Both players missed some action and had to go to the locker room, but they weren't out for very long. Marshall, as mentioned, had a deep drop. Phil Simms claimed that the ball was uncatchable, yet it hit Marshall right in the hands. This, of course, was a conflict of interest, as Simms and Marshall are co-hosts on <i>Inside the NFL</i>. This was yet another example of Simms being absolutely incompetent. Another occasion was when Simms said that the Cowboys were in great hands with Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel behind Tony Romo. Simms needs to be dismissed from the CBS broadcast because he's absolutely horrible, bland and biased.    Chris Ivory disappointed his fantasy owners, as he mustered just 37 yards on 13 carries despite the fact that Eddie Lacy and James Starks trampled this Dallas defense a week ago. Ivory had a chance to score, but was stuffed on a 4.h down near the goal line. Bilal Powell, meanwhile, was more impressive. He ran for 25 yards and a touchdown on just 6 attempts, and he also was a big part of the passing game once again, snatching 7 catches for 54 receiving yards.    As for the Cowboys, they benched Cassel in the second quarter after a very ugly performance. Cassel was just 3-of-8 for 37 yards and an interception that was so horrible that the officials ruled it as intentional grounding. Following a 19-yard loss on a sack, Jason Garrett made the change, moving to Kellen Moore, who was better, but only by default. Moore went 15-of-25 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Moore is severely limited and seemed overmatched. One of his picks was a desperation heave at the end, but Moore's other 2 interception were ugly. The first was a weak throw that he heaved up for grabs, while the second was telegraphed in the end zone. Moore hit some of his targets and moved the chains on occasion, but he's not an NFL-caliber quarterback.    "

   "comment":"Kellen Moore was awful, despite Jerry Jones' enthusiasm concerning him. Moore looked like a high school quarterback, at least in terms of his arm strength. He completed just 13-of-31 passes for 186 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault; the ball could've been caught, but was deflected.    To be somewhat fair to Moore and his pop-gun arm, he had no 1 to throw to. Dez Bryant was out, while "
