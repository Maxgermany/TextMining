Anquan Boldin caught 2 balls for 72 yards and a touchdown himself, but he had to leave the game with a hamstring (thanks, Al Michaels).    This is a moot point because the Cardinals won, but it seemed like the zebras seemingly missed every call in Arizona's favor, prompting Wraith to ask So how much money do the refs have on the Falcons? Larry Fitzgerald was mugged twice on what should have been obvious pass interference infractions. Bert Berry was also held in the end zone for a possible safety. It's almost as if the officials were thinking, Wait a second, these Cardinals aren't supposed to be here! That looks like a penalty, but I'm not quite sure what to do! Hopefully for all the new Arizona fans out there, this doesn't carry over to the Carolina/New York game.   "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald yelled in frustration. In Anderson's defense though, he wasn't given good pass protection. The Rams totaled only 2 sacks, but Anderson was constantly under pressure. In particular, right tackle Brandon Keith was awful.    As a positive, Arizona's running game looked good without Chris Wells. Tim Hightower had 54 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries, while LaRod Stephens-Howling tallied 49 yards on 7 attempts. On 1 drive late in the second quarter, Arizona ripped off consecutive runs of 21 (Howling), 15 (Howling), 19 (Hightower), 20 (Hightower) and 1 for a touchdown (Hightower). I really don't understand why the Cardinals didn't run the ball more often.    Larry Fitzgerald had 3 catches for 43 yards and a touchdown. Not what Fitzgerald owners were expecting from their stud receiver against the Rams. But get used to it with Anderson under center.    The Cardinals were very sloppy in this contest; they fumbled a whopping 7 times, losing possession on 4 instances.    Contrary to the Cardinals, the Rams are heading in the right direction. Forget the 3 interceptions (2 came late in desperation mode) because "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald and instead got the ball to Donte Whitner. The 49ers made short work of the short field, needing just 4 plays capped off by an 18-yard pass to Davis for a 23-0 lead and the rout was on. Dashon Goldson ended the Cardinals' next drive with an interception, ending the misery that was Skelton's day. He finished 6-of-19 for 99 yards with 3 picks and a 10.5 QB rating. I'm not convinced Red Skelton would have been worse. After San Francisco stalled and punted, Navorro Bowman came up with the fumble by Peterson who definitely played like a rookie. However, Smith was intercepted by Daryl Washington on third-and-goal on a very poor decision. This was a setback game for Smith who had no business throwing a dangerous pass with the game well in hand. Then we got a special treat when Richard Bartel entered to play quarterback. He looks like the kind of guy who enjoys a dip of tobacco and thinks Yeah coach, put me in, I got you while sitting on the sideline looking like a gunfighter from the Wild West. Arizona went to the shotgun, but the drive went nowhere. When they got the ball back on the 49ers' second punt of the game, the Cardinals finally got somewhere thanks to Early Doucet and Goldson mixing it up after the play. Doucet popped Goldson who retaliated with a right hook that missed and a couple more punches that landed him an ejection on a play that actually featured rookie Aldon Smith sacking Bartel. Then Doucet caught a couple passes, veteran Chester Taylor broke off a 34-yard run and Larry Fitzgerald caught the first touchdown pass ever thrown by Bartel. By the way, Fitzgerald went over 9,000 yards receiving in this game. At 23-7, technically, this was still a game. Arizona got the ball back with 4:58 to play and scratched their way to the red zone before San Francisco decided enough was enough. From the 16-yard line, Bartel missed on 3 straight passes, and when he finally connected with Doucet, it was well short of the first down, and that was that. The 49ers drained the final 3:27 with Dixon running and Smith kneeling. It was a great win because Gore was able to rest a little bit, but Smith (20-of-38 for 267 yards 2 TDs, 1 INT) did not play very well. If not for the defense being dominant and the running game (164 yards) working, this might have been a much different story. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald in the end zone, was replaced by Ryan Lindley, who was somehow even worse. Lindley just didn't look like he was ready to play. He was incredibly 10.ative in the pocket and even lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Lindley finished just 9-of-20 for 64 yards. He did not look like an NFL quarterback, though he was robbed of a nice completion to Larry Fitzgerald with 3 minutes remaining. Fitzgerald inexplicably dropped the ball, which would have given the Cardinals possession inside the Atlanta 10. Instead, the Cardinals eventually turned the ball over on downs and lost.    Fitzgerald had just 1 catch for 11 yards. He had that aforementioned missed opportunity for a touchdown, but cost his team the game. I can't ever remember saying that about the future Hall-of-Famer. By the way, the only Cardinal who had more than 2 receptions was "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald for a long gain on 1 occasion and then was booed off the field when he hilariously heaved the ball toward some Cardinal players standing on the sideline amid no pressure. As I wrote last week, Lindley just doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL. John Skelton wasn't very good beforehand, but it was irresponsible for Ken Whisenhunt to bench him in favor of someone who is just too overmatched to play on this level.    Meanwhile, Sam Bradford completed just 8 passes on 17 attempts, but for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was brutal, as Bradford unnecessarily forced the issue into double coverage in the end zone, but he was great otherwise despite dealing with heavy pressure early on. Bradford had several long completions of 38, 37, 37, 25 and 22 yards. Three of those went to Chris Givens (5-115, TD).    The Rams were also effective in terms of moving the chains on the ground. Steven Jackson once again handled most of the workload, rushing for 139 yards on 24 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, Chris Wells scored twice, but was otherwise pretty pedestrian. He gained 48 yards on 17 carries.    Speaking of pedestrian, Larry Fitzgerald's numbers were once again awful; he caught 3 balls for 31 yards. He's dealing with bracket coverage, and the Cardinals just don't have the quarterback to deliver the football to him. Lindley spent most of the time throwing to "

Lindley's completion rate looked like a batting average, as he connected on just 10-of-31 attempts for just 72 yards and a pick. That's a yards-per-attempt average of 2.3. I don't think I've ever seen a YPA that low on so many passes. I'm still not sure why John Skelton was benched in favor of this bum; Lindley just isn't prepared to play on this level.    As you might expect, the skill-position players struggled statistically because of the ineptness of the 2 quarterbacks. I mentioned Fitzgerald - he actually led the team with 23 receiving yards (1 catch). Meanwhile, Arizona's leading rusher was safety "

Stanton did struggle a bit in the second half, going 5-of-13 for 52 yards following intermission. He also nearly had a pick when he heaved the ball into double coverage. The problem was that the Giants continuously screwed themselves over with mistakes. There was 1 killer sequence.

Perhaps the 1 positive for the Giants is that Eli Manning actually played well. Manning was a mess during the exhibition and in the season opener, but he was sharp for the most part in this contest, going 26-of-39 for 277 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. One of the picks wasn't his fault because the ball was tipped, but he was responsible for a strip-sack because he didn't recognize the blind-side pressure and held on to the ball too long. Manning's play-makers screwed him over. There were several dropped passes, including 1 by Rueben Randle on what would've been a big gain with 3 minutes remaining in regulation. Andre Williams also dropped a pass after Jennings seemed to be temporarily benched following his fumble.

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald, all while dropping several potential Drew Stanton interceptions. Again, these were just some of the blunders the 49ers committed. There were many more that I didn't mention. It's so strange because San Francisco used to be so well-coached. That's not the case this year, as Jim Harbaugh appears to have lost control of his team.    All of the mistakes ruined what was a solid performance from Colin Kaepernick. The 49er signal-caller ran more than he has in a regular-season game in a long while, as he scrambled 13 times for 54 rushing yards. He showed off great athleticism to elude some sacks, including 1 instance in which Thomas Keiser had him by the jersey. Kaepernick was able to shed him to help his team put points on the board during that possession. As a passer, Kaepernick misfired on just 8 occasions, going 29-of-37 for 245 yards and a touchdown. He got away with some mistakes early - Antonio Cromartie dropped 2 potential pick-sixes - and he misfired badly on his final attempt, but he was definitely not at fault for this defeat. Kaepernick's sole score went to Michael Crabtree, who reeled in 10 of his 11 targets for 80 yards. However, Stevie Johnson paced the 49ers in catches (9) and receiving yards (103). Boldin didn't do much (6-36) aside from costing his team points. You'd think a veteran like him would know better. Harbaugh spent some time yelling at Boldin on the sideline, but the message was lost because his team wouldn't stop shooting themselves in the foot.    The 49ers struggled to run the ball. Frank Gore managed just 10 yards on 6 carries, and making matters worse for his fantasy owners, Carlos Hyde (3-13) vultured a touchdown.    As for the victors, Drew Stanton went 18-of-33 for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns, both of which were thrown to third-round rookie John Brown (4-52). As mentioned, Stanton got away with a couple of interceptions. However, he was very hot in the second half, going 10-of-16 for 161 yards and a pair of scoles following the break. The 49ers helped him out with their dumb mistakes, but it was an impressive second-half performance nonetheless.    Stanton struggled to get the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, as the future Hall of Famer didn't log a single reception until the 4.h quarter for the second time in 3 games. Fitzgerald finally hauled in his 3 targets (for 34 yards) in the final period, but he hurt his team by losing a fumble inside the San Francisco 5-yard line. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald. Looking like he's been finished at times this year, Fitzgerald rebounded with a great performance in a victory over the Redskins to improve his team to 4-1. Fitzgerald caught all 6 passes thrown his way for 98 yards and a touchdown. This included a great, diving catch for a gain of 18 yards in the third quarter. It was refreshing to see the future Hall of Famer be competent again; all he needed was improved quarterbacking.    Palmer also had a solid outing, going 28-of-44 for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns. Palmer was deemed 80 percent heading into this contest, and that's exactly how he looked, as most of his throws were on the mark, but he also tossed some weak-looking passes at times. Still, he was much better than Logas Thomas and happened to be an upgrade over Drew Stanton.    Michael Floyd hauled in Palmer's other touchdown, catching 4 balls for 47 yards. Andre Ellington, meanwhile, reeled in 6 receptions for 26 yards on top of his 67 rushing yards on 19 carries.    As for the Redskins, Kirk Cousins had a miserable performance that had many calling for Colt McCoy after the game. The stats show that Cousins went 24-of-38 for 354 yards and 2 touchdowns, but 1 of his scores was a short pass that DeSean Jackson turned into a big gain, while the other came in garbage time to Pierre Garcon (4-31). Meanwhile, the picks hurt. The first was high off his back foot, and DeSean Jackson added to it by hitting the Arizona player late out of bounds. Cousins' second interception was forced, while the third was a pick-six to blow the cover. Rashad Johnson skipped into the end zone, seemingly unaware that he cost (or won) bettors precious money.    Jackson had an interesting game. He scored on a 64-yard touchdown, which, as mentioned, was a short pass that he took the distance. He nearly had another long touchdown, but was tackled by his own blocking lineman. Jackson (3-115, TD) had just 1 reception after halftime; the Cardinals had Antonio Cromartie cover him instead of the struggling Patrick Peterson. Jackson was then whistled for a dirty hit out of bounds. Oh, and to top it off, FOX announcer Dick Stockton called Larry Fitzgerald DeSean Jackson at 1 point.    "

There's some question as to whether Fitzgerald was past the line to gain, but the Lions couldn't challenge because they were out of timeouts. Jim Caldwell used all of them prior to the 2-minute warning, which was a poor coaching gaffe.    Stanton went 21-of-32 for 306 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of picks. Those numbers look much better than how Stanton actually played, as he struggled to move the chains following the initial scoring drives.    Both of Stanton's aerial scores went to Michael Floyd, who only made 2 catches for 54 yards. John Brown (5-69) led the team in receiving, while Fitzgerald (2-33) didn't do much because he hurt his knee. He'll have an MRI on Monday, but it's a good sign that he was able to gut it out and snare the game-sealing reception.    "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald even called this the biggest regular-season game of this career. And yet, Seattle dominated. The team racked up a ridiculous 596 net yards of offense, outgaining the Cardinals by 380 yards. That's crazy. What's even more insane is that the Seahawks averaged 8.9 yards per play, compared to 3.4 for Arizona. Basically, that means Seattle generated a first down nearly every time they snapped the football. The Seahawks could've won by an even greater margin had Steven Hauschka not whiffed on 3 field goals. So much for the supposedly vaunted Cardinals' defense. Seattle's victory means that the team controls its own destiny for the NFC West title and homefield advantage. All the Seahawks need to do is beat the Rams at home next week.    Russell Wilson was majestic. Playing like an MVP, he went 20-of-31 for 339 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he also scrambled 6 times for 88 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. Wilson did it all; he eluded sacks, found open receivers, scampered for a 55-yard gain and hit Luke Willson for an 80-yard touchdown when this game was still in doubt. Wilson's touchdown run can be seen on <i>SportsCenter</i>; the reigning Super Bowl champion quarterback stiff-armed Alex Okafor, juked Antonio Cromartie and then sprinted into the end zone. It looked like something out of a movie.    Marshawn Lynch, meanwhile, didn't see a single touch in the first quarter. He had a stomach bug and ran out of the locker room with a stocking cap on after the first play. However, he grabbed some Skittles (seriously), stuffed them into his mouth and entered the game. He was stuffed on his initial carry, but eventually had a strong touchdown run. Of course, his best play was a 79-yard burst in which he broke numerous tackles, including 1 from Patrick Peterson, who helplessly tried to strip the ball out of his arm. Lynch finished with 113 yards and a 2 touchdowns on just 10 carries. While he was out, Robert Turbin (10-38) and Christine Michael (6-26) were able to split the workload.    Arizona hasn't been able to cover tight ends all year, and Willson exposed that, leading the Seahawks with 139 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns on just 3 receptions, torching the anemic Larry Foote each time. Doug Baldwin (7-113) also had a big game, while rookie Paul Richardson (7-52) also contributed. Richardson saw more targets than usual because Jermaine Kearse was knocked out with a hamstring in the second quarter.    Meanwhile, the Cardinals are barely worth mentioning. Everything they've worked for this whole season is for naught because of injuries to the quarterback position. They did keep this game close for a while - it was 14-6 entering the 4.h quarter - but missed out on numerous opportunities. Ryan Lindley couldn't get the ball to an open John Brown on a third down. Michael Floyd dropped a deep pass. Lindley underthrew Brown a bit in the end zone. Peterson dropped an interception which would've given Arizona the ball in the red zone. Floyd tipped a pass away from Larry Fitzgerald for a first-down conversion on a miscue. Cromartie fell down on a long Baldwin reception. The Cardinals needed things to go their way considering their quarterback situation; instead, they just couldn't get any breaks beyond Hauschka's missed field goals.    Arizona's defense sucked, but Lindley was even worse. His overall numbers say it all, as he went 14-of-35 for 178 yards and an interception. He had some nice throws, including a nice rainbow to Floyd, who caught the pass over "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald actually had to serve as defensive backs to break up interceptions on the same drive in the second quarter. Lindley finished 23-of-39 for 316 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 picks. Again, he did a good job of moving the chains on occasion, and he was even screwed by a big John Brown drop in the 4.h quarter, but he needs to be a lot more careful with the football to give the Cardinals any sort of chance in the playoffs.    Floyd and Brown saw way more targets than any other Cardinals. Floyd reeled in 8 of the balls thrown to him for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brown, seeing 9 targets, caught 4 balls for 51 yards. Fitzgerald, meanwhile, continued to struggle off his injury, catching just 2 passes for 29 yards.    "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald to make it 38-7. Palmer and Fitzgerald were connecting at will all game, and thankfully for their fantasy football investors, Bruce Arians is not 1 to let up on the gas, as seen by their second touchdown with 5 minutes left in the game, up 40-7. That kind of blood lust is what we fantasy footballers like to see!    Fitzgerald hogged the bulk of the targets with 11 of Palmer's 32 attempts and 9 of his 20 completions. That's almost half for Fitz. Now over the last 2 games, Fitzgerald has 17 receptions for 246 yards and 5 touchdowns. I think that's pretty good.    Palmer was on target all game, but had such a large lead he didn't need to push the throttle. He did end up with 311 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He's now averaging 3 touchdown passes and 268 yards passing a game. He did take his first sack of the year and was hurried and hit more than he has been this season. The fact Arians kept him in the game was interesting.    "

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out."

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald. Palmer finished the possession by hitting a wide-open Troy Niklas for an 11-yard touchdown. Arizona started another drive well before Chris Johnson fumbled the ball away as Karlos Dansby punched the ball out. Armonty Bryant scooped it up and returned the fumble 34 yards to the Cardinals' 9-yard line before Palmer was able to upend Bryant. McCown took advantage by throwing a bullet to Brian Hartline for a touchdown after he got behind Tyrann Mathieu. The Browns struck again as McCown hit a quick slant to Duke Johnson, who smoked Kevin Minter and took off on a 51-yard scamper. McCown finished it with a back-shoulder fade as Gary Barnidge beat Tony Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. McCown kept ripping the Cardinals' defense down the field and he Hartline for another short touchdown pass. Arizona got moving afterward, but Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away inside the Browns' 10-yard line after getting stripped by K'Waun Williams. The Cardinals got the ball back soon enough and moved into Cleveland territory, where Michael Floyd caught a touchdown pass. But a penalty brought that score back, so Arizona settled for a field goal to cut the Browns' lead to 20-10 at the half. Really, Cleveland was lucky to be leading as Palmer overthrew Michael Floyd and Fitzgerald running wide open down the field for touchdowns. In the third quarter, Floyd beat Joe Haden down the sideline as Palmer finally connected on a deep ball for a 60-yard touchdown pass. McCown was injured after taking a hit and was trying to gut it out, but Arizona's defense made good halftime adjustments to completely dominate Cleveland in the second half. The Cardinals got in position for more points with a 39-yard pass to Jaron Brown. The drive finished with a 1-yard score to Niklas, and just like that the Browns were down 24-20 midway through the third quarter. A terrible Palmer interception to Tashon Gipson and another fumble by Chris Johnson kept the Browns in the game, but McCown forced a pass downfield into double coverage, and Reshad Johnson intercepted the ball in the end zone. Arizona matched down the field and Palmer hit the back-shoulder pass to Fitzgerald for a 6-yard score. Arizona tacked on another field goal to clinch its fifth win of the season.    Carson Palmer finished 23-of-38 for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and an interception. He remains 1 of the top fantasy options at his position.    Chris Johnson ran for 109 yards on 30 carries, but lost 2 fumbles. It was disappointing that he didn't do more in such a great matchup.    Michael Floyd (4-106-1) and Larry Fitzgerald (9-84-1) led the Cardinals' receivers with John Brown out."

   "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald, all had magnificent performances. Peterson, especially, was the difference. He struggled to do anything in New Orleans, so trading for him seemed like grasping at straws. It was a life boat instead, as Peterson was absolutely dominant. He gashed the hapless Buccaneers for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. This stat line was not the byproduct of fluky runs; Peterson showed the same sort of burst, power and juke moves that he displayed in his prime. I can't explain it, but it happened. Peterson was amazing, and if he keeps running like this, Arizona will be able to compete for the NFC West title.    Palmer, meanwhile, was also terrific. I can't believe I wrote that sentence after watching him struggle for the first 5 weeks of the season, but Palmer didn't even have an incompletion in this contest until the third quarter! He was 13-of-13 for 211 yards and 2 touchdowns in the opening half alone. Palmer didn't do much following halftime, which would explain why his stats didn't change much - he finished 18-of-22 for 283 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception on a careless deep shot into double coverage - but this is obviously an encouraging development for the Cardinals. It's hard not to forget how much Palmer struggled in the 5 previous weeks - plus, Palmer had a pick dropped by a linebacker in the 4.h quarter - but perhaps he'll continue to play better now that he appears to have a strong running game aiding him.    The last of the veterans, Fitzgerald snared 10 of his 11 targets for 138 yards and a touchdown. As with Peterson and Palmer, Fitzgerald performed as if he were in his prime, though unlike the other 2 veterans, he had thrived earlier this season. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, he made a mistake when he lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Along with Fitzgerald, "
