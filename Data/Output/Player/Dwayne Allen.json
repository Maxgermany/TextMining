   "comment":"Allen drew a long pass interference from Koa Misi to set up a 9.yard touchdown pass on a frozen rope from Luck to Reggie Wayne (7-78). Tannehill responded to Luck's first touchdown pass with a 31-yard scoring pass to Charles Clay. Miami scored again with a beautiful 18-yard touchdown run by Reggie Bush (10-41). He zig-zagged his way around defenders to dart into the end zone. Luck laid out a perfect 48-yard pass to Donnie Avery (5-108) late in the second quarter. It was a great throw that beat the double coverage. Luck then launched a great deep ball to T.Y. Hilton (6-102) that should've been a touchdown, but the pass was dropped. The drive settled for a field goal. Luck had 273 yards at the half, and it could've been a lot more if it his receivers weren't dropping passes. Luck put the Colts in the lead during the third quarter. He converted a third-and-16 with a 19-yard pass to LaVon Brazill (2-25) and finished the drive with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Hilton. Tannehill answered with some clutch throws to get a field goal and tie the score at 20. Luck answered with a drive for a 43-yard goal that was the game-winner. He had 1 terrible decision in the final minutes while trying to avoid a sack, but Sean Smith dropped an interception. Luck was amazing on third down versus the Dolphins. He converted many third-and-longs, including a critical 1 to Allen on a third-and-11 deep in Indianapolis territory. The Colts finished 12-of-18 on third down. Luck was 30-of-48 for 433 yards with 2 touchdowns in his record-setting day. Tannehill had 1 more shot, but the Colts' defense stopped him. He completed 22-of-38 passes for 290 yards and 1 touchdown.

   "comment":"Allen draw a pass interference. Despite Clete Blakeman's crooked officiating - there was a terrible spot on a Dan Herron run following a review - Luck found T.Y. Hilton in the end zone. Luck finished 24-of-53 for 294 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. It certainly wasn't pretty - Luck was nearly picked on several other occasions - but he got the job done in the end despite extremely difficult conditions.    I mentioned that there were several issues for Luck. The pressure was 1. while Reggie Wayne was the other. The future Hall of Fame receiver had 1 of the worst performances of his career. He reeled in just 1 of his 8 targets for just 5 yards. He had a whopping 4 drops. One would've moved the chains, but the drop eventually led to a punt. Another ruined a potential big gain. A third was on the 2-point conversion, which would have pushed this spread (though I'm sure Blakeman would've come up with some sort of penalty).    The Colts actually have a highly productive receiver, and that would be Hilton, who had a monstrous outing. He saw a ridiculous 19 targets and snatched 10 of them for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns. Coby Fleener (5-56) was second in receiving despite the return of Allen (1-5).    The Colts struggled to run the ball, as Luck was the team's leading rusher with 37 yards on the ground. "

   "comment":"Allen, 8 to Hilton, and a short touchdown strike to Moncrief. The Lions took a 21-10 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Luck got rolling with a 51-yard pass to Philip Dorsett (4-94), who beat Darius Slay for the reception. Allen (4-53-1) got open in busted coverage for a 19-yard score. Luck went back to Allen for a 2.point conversion and midway through the third quarter, the Lions' lead was cut to 21-18. Stafford answered ripping the ball down the field and finished it with a short touchdown toss to Abdullah, who was left uncovered in the flat. Luck came back to produce another field-goal drive. The Lions punted the ball away, and Luck went right back to work with a 32-yard pass to Hilton to get into Detroit territory. The Lions' lead evaporated when Luck hit tight end "

   "comment":"Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, Phillip Dorsett was a disappointment, catching 3 passes for 27 yards. Jack Doyle (6-65) and Dwayne Allen (3-35) picked up the slack with Donte Moncrief being out. Allen, as mentioned, dropped a touchdown.    Right after Allen missed out on a score, Frank Gore took advantage with an end zone trip of his own. He gained 82 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. "

   "comment":"Allen then was guilty of a drop that would've gone for about 15 yards, and this was followed by an Andrew Luck interception; Luck was hit as he threw by Dante Fowler, setting up a short Jacksonville touchdown. Two more drops occurred on the next drive, coupled with another sack of Luck. An Allen false start then ruined a possession, as the Colts were set up with a third-and-1 in Jacksonville territory. Indianapolis then committed tons of senseless penalties on defense, including numerous, unnecessary late hits. There was a lot of talk about Gus Bradley possibly getting fired following this contest, but Chuck Pagano and Ryan Grigson should be the 1. left in London. Grigson has screwed up repeatedly, failing to improve Luck's pass protection, which was a major issue in this game, as Luck was hit seemingly on every other play. Pagano, meanwhile, did a horrible job of preparing his team for this divisional battle. With the AFC South improved, it's difficult to imagine the Colts having consistent success as long as both Grigson and Pagano are employed.    Luck finished 27-of-42 for 234 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, but those numbers are very deceiving. Most of Luck's yardage, as well as his 2 scores, came when his team was down double digits, so most of his production came in garbage time. Luck was only at about 80 yards entering the 4.h quarter! That said, Luck didn't play poorly. He was victimized by countless drops. Pressure was also a factor. He was sacked 6 times and hit on numerous other occasions. His right guard and right tackle were out of the lineup, but those missing players weren't very good. It's almost a crime that Grigson is derailing Luck's career.    Luck's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Allen. Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2.and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as Willie Young logged a trio of sacks. Luck took 6 sacks the week before by the Jaguars, who put no pressure on quarterbacks, so this is obviously an issue. Ryan Grigson discussed not being able to build a championship defense because of Luck's contract... so what about the offensive line?    Luck's 2 touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (10-171) and Dwayne Allen (6-50). They were the only Indianapolis players to eclipse the 30-yard mark. This includes Dorsett, who was once again disappointing. He caught 2 balls for 26 yards, only seeing 3 targets. He was expected to be a greater factor with Donte Moncrief out with an injury, but that hasn't been the case.    The Colts didn't run the ball very much, but when they did, they had success doing so. "

   "comment":"Allen on a 4.h-and-4. Tolzien, however, self-destructed late. He overthrew a receiver, allowing Michael Mitchell to snatch an interception. Tolzien was picked off shortly after on an underthrown pass. Earlier, he hurled the ball behind his receiver on a 4.h-and-1 in the red zone, negating a scoring chance. The Colts failed once again later in the red zone. They passed on 2 field goals, and had they decided to kick them, they would've been down just 8 in the 4.h quarter and wouldn't have had to force the issue. For his overall numbers, Tolzien went 22-of-36 for 205 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 interceptions. He played much better than expected. Considering he was recently a third-string quarterback playing on just 3 days of preparation, Tolzien could've easily been a disaster, but he made numerous impressive throws, showing that he can definitely be a backup in this league. He easily could've posted better numbers, but was hurt by some deep drops.    T.Y. Hilton led the Colts with 54 receiving yards on 3 catches. Hilton was guilty of a drop way down the field, but he hauled in a 32-yarder and took a crushing hit at the end of it. He was down for a while, but was able to return to action. Meanwhile, Donte Moncrief (6-45) scored Tolzien's sole touchdown. He was also guilty of a drop around the 5-yard line. Dwayne Allen (5-49) was also a solid contributor.    "

   "comment":"Allen fall down, and that led to Quintin Demps picking off the pass. It set up the Texans at the Colts' 16-yard line, but the Colts held the Texans to a game-tying field goal. Osweiler was able to drive to midfield on his next possession, but threw an interception to Akeem Ayers to set up the Colts just across the 50. Fortunately for Osweiler, the Texans' defense forced a 3.and-out. Houston got moving thanks to runs from Lamar Miller, a 22-yard third-down conversion to DeAndre Hopkins, and a third-and-5 was converted by Akeem Hunt with a run of 19 yards. A terrific catch by Fiedorowicz then set up the Texans at Indianapolis' 1-yard line, from where Miller charged into the end zone to finish the impressive drive and give them the 10-3 lead. Just before the half, Adam Vinatieri missed a 55-yard field goal as the ball fell short. The Texans took advantage of the short field with a couple of completions to get a 52-yard field goal from Nick Novak. They took a 13-3 lead into the locker room. Luck was only 9-of-22 for fewer than 100 yards by halftime. Early in the third quarter, Luck was clobbered by Jadeveon Clowney, which led to a floating pass that was picked off by Andre Hal. He returned the interception inside the Colts' 20-yard line. Darryl Morris dropped a potential interception in the end zone, but the Texans settled for a field goal. The Colts had a chance after they were set up in the red zone by a 41-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, and they turned that into a screen pass to Frank Gore for an 18-yard touchdown. Down 16-10, Colts moved into position to take the lead on a drive that had a completion to Chester Rogers for 21 yards, a 13-yard run by Gore, and then a 28-yard penalty on Robert Nelson, which set up the Colts at the 5.yard line. On third-and-goal, however, Clowney slammed into Luck for a blind-side strip-sack. That loose ball was recovered by Houston's Whitney Mercilus. Indianapolis was running a poorly designed play at the time, as tight end Dwayne Allen was blocking Clowney 1.on-one, and Clowney destroyed Allen. The Texans had a 20-yard pass to Fiedorowicz (3-32) and a 20-yard run from Miller to set up a 41-yard field goal from Novak, taking a 19-10 lead early in the 4.h quarter. The Colts struck back as Luck hit T.Y. Hilton for a 35-yard touchdown, who had beatend Robert Nelson to get wide open. Miller had a run of 20 yards and a gain of 16 yards on a screen to give the Texans another field goal as they ran off more than 6 minutes from the clock. Those 3 points left Luck needing a touchdown, but having less than 3 minutes remaining and no timeouts. Indianapolis crossed midfield, but the Texans forced an incompletion on a 4.h-and-1 on a horrible called screen pass by the Colts.    Luck completed 24-of-45 passes for 276 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Hilton caught 9 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. Dwayne Allen had 3 touchdowns against the Jets, but was shut out by Houston.    Gore had 41 yards on only 10 carries.    Miller was the workhorse for Houston, running for 107 yards on 21 carries with a touchdown and 15 yards receiving.    Hopkins caught 2 passes for 33 yards, but drew some critical pass-interference penalties on point-producing drives.    Osweiler completed 14-of-24 passes for 147 yards and 1 interception. He had some nice passes, but Houston's red-zone offense was brutal. Fortunately for the Texans, the defense picked them up and Nick Novak was a perfect 5-for-5 on field goals.    The Texans' defense was superb despite missing 2 of its top-three cornerbacks from injuries. Clowney stepped up with a huge game to produce 2 turnovers for his team. "

Congratulations are in order for Frank Gore, who became the first running back, 33 years or older, to rush for 1,000 yards in a season since John Riggins did so in 1984. Gore tallied 62 yards on 16 carries.    Condolences are in order for Adam Vinatieri, who missed out on a $500,000 bonus because he whiffed on a field goal in this game.    I thought the Jaguars would be flat after Blake Bortles and Allen Robinson actually tried hard for the first time all year last week. I was wrong, as they somehow summoned the energy once again. Bortles finished 25-of-39 for 301 yards and a touchdown. However, it wasn't all rosy for the first-round bust, as he was responsible for 2 separate strip-sacks, 1 of which Mathis was able to force. Mathis' actually really helped win the game, as the Jaguars were in the red zone to perhaps put the game away in the 4.h quarter. The Colts collected the turnover, however, and they were able to march down the field and win this game.    A major reason why Bortles was able to perform so well happened to be the injuries the Colts had in their secondary. Their Nos. 2 and 3 cornerbacks in this game were newly signed "
