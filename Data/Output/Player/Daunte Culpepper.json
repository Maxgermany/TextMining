Culpepper should consider himself fortunate; if it weren't for the moronic Lions, he wouldn't even be in the NFL right now. Instead, he's stealing money from a nonchalant fossil who should be thrown in jail for running this franchise into the ground.    Stanton played briefly, going 2-of-6 for 13 yards. He left the game early with a concussion. Hopefully for the sake of Lions fans, Stanton is healthy and gets a chance so the team knows whether or not to draft a bust quarterback come April.    Poor "

Johnson and White each tallied more than 100 rushing yards for the second time this year. They both scored 2 touchdowns. Johnson rushed for 125 yards, while White had 106. Most of White's production came when the game was out of hand.    Kerry Collins was just an economical 11-of-18 for 127 yards. Consequently, no Titan receiver caught more than 2 passes.    As for the Lions... well... at least Calvin Johnson had a decent game. Megatron caught 5 balls for 66 yards. He was targeted many more times, but Culpepper (13-of-26, 134 yards, TD, INT) just couldn't get him the ball. Johnson's longest gain (20 yards) came when "

   "comment":"Culpepper, who played at the end of the game, looked like Joe Montana compared to Stanton. Now we know why Rod Marinelli didn't want to start him. Stanton's passes were all over the place. He drunkenly tossed 3 interceptions, 2 of which were deep in 49ers territory. And it's not like those passes were tipped or anything; they weren't even near his intended targets. He also fumbled once. Stanton was so bad that he cannot be allowed to take another NFL snap. He's an embarrassment to Michigan State University, the Detroit Lions, the entire National Football League and the entire sport of football.    Despite Stanton's alcohol-juiced balls, "
