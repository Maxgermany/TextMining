He did a great job converting third downs, as he connected on a pair of 3rd-and-11s on the opening drive. Detroit was 11-of-18 on third down. What's amazing about Culpepper's numbers is that he was frequently pressured; the Steelers sacked him 7 times. "

Stanton's passes were all over the place. He drunkenly tossed 3 interceptions, 2 of which were deep in 49ers territory. And it's not like those passes were tipped or anything; they weren't even near his intended targets. He also fumbled once. Stanton was so bad that he cannot be allowed to take another NFL snap. He's an embarrassment to Michigan State University, the Detroit Lions, the entire National Football League and the entire sport of football.    Despite Stanton's alcohol-juiced balls, "
