   "comment":"Moncrief and Coby Fleener. Adam Vinatieri drilled a 54-yard field goal to get on the board first. The Jaguars answered with Blake Bortles hitting Allen Hurns for 26 yards. Then, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a go route that burned Darius Butler for 48 yards. If Robinson didn't have to dive for the ball, and it had hit him in stride, it could have gone for a touchdown. Instead, the Jaguars were stopped in a goal-line situation to settle for a short field goal. Jacksonville's defense came through with Josh Robinson fumbling the ball away on a tackle by Dan Skuta. Bortles then hit Clay Harbor for 21 and rolled out to hit Hurns for an 8-yard touchdown. The Colts tied it up on a drive that was given away because of 5 penalties on the Jaguars. Hasselbeck threw a short touchdown pass to Fleener. Before the half, Bortles led a field goal drive to take a 13-10 lead into the locker room. The Colts had a possession set up with good field position in the second half, and they moved it closer for a chip-shot field goal from Vinatieri. Hasselbeck got into rhythm distributing passes around and getting T.Y. Hilton involved. The Colts looked like they were going to go into the end zone for the lead, but Gore fumbled the ball into the end zone after having it punched out by Jags safety Josh Evans, and it was recovered by the Jaguars. Late in the game with less than a minute remaining, Bortles took off on a 14-yard run, hit Marcedes Lewis for 12 yards and T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking. Donte Moncrief (6-75) also contributed and continued to play ahead of Andre Johnson."

A few plays later, Hasselbeck connected with Hilton for 20 yards, and that set up another field goal for Indianapolis. From there it was all the Jaguars. Jacksonville's offense kept moving the ball, assisted by a 34-yard pass interference call on Jalil Brown that moved the ball to the Colts' 16-yard line. Denard Robinson ran the ball 12 yards before Bortles threw a dart to Allen Robinson for a short touchdown. That expanded the Jaguars' lead to 30-16. Denard Robinson soon ripped the Colts on a 31-yard run thanks to a great block from A.J. Cann. Two passes to Julius Thomas then moved the ball inside the 5 before Bortles hit Thomas for a short score. That gave Jacksonville a 37-16 lead. The pummeling for Hasselbeck continued when he got shoved hard out of bounds by Telvin Smith. Charlie Whitehurst had to enter the game for a second time after Hasselbeck left the game with a rib injury. Whitehurst couldn't move the ball and overthrew on a fourth-and-10 to give the Jaguars the ball near midfield. They moved the ball to the 2-yard line, from where Denard Robinson scored. Jonathan Cyprien went on to intercept Whitehurst around midfield and return it to the 1-yard line. Bortles leapt over the goal line on fourth-and-goal to hang the Jaguars' 50th point on the Colts.    Bortles completed 16-of-30 for 250 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 17 yards on 4 carries with a score. Hurns led the Jaguars through the air with 105 yards on 3 receptions and a score. Julius Thomas had 54 yards on give catches with a score. Allen Robinson made only 1 catch, but it was a 4-yard touchdown.    Yeldon ran well with 62 yards on 11 carries, but was banged up with an knee injury. Denard Robinson was very impressive to close out the game with 75 yards on 14 carries and a score.    Hasselbeck was 18-of-35 for 252 yards. Whitehurst was only 2-of-8 for 8 yards an an interception.    Frank Gore had 60 yards on 16 carries to lead the Colts.    Hilton logged 132 yards on 4 receptions. Moncrief had 3 receptions for 52 yards.    Defensively, the Jaguars got good games from Telvin Smith (9 tackles) and "

   "comment":"Moncrief for an 11-yard touchdown. A holding call and sack from Kendall Langford quickly got the ball back for Indianapolis with a nice punt return to the Texans' 35-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Andre Johnson moved the ball to the 17-yard line. That produced a chip-shot field goal for the Colts and a 10-0 lead. Houston's offense finally did something positive with a 41-yard run from Blue, but Bill O'Brien made a very questionable decision to have Nick Novak attempt a 57-yard field goal that wasn't even close. Before the half, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates moved the ball into Colts' territory, but went down with a knee injury that ended his day. Weeden finished the drive with a few completions to get inside the 5-yard line before having to settle for a field goal. The Colts took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bernardrick McKinney sacked Hasselbeck at the 1-yard line on a third down, and that set up the Texans to start a drive at the Colts' 32-yard line. Penalties on Houston's inept tight ends killed some nice plays, and Houston settled for a 47-yard field goal from Novak. After going 25 straight drives without a touchdown, the Texans started at their 11-yard line, and Weeden moved down the field with passes to Hopkins. Houston converted a fourth-and-1 with Blue, and had a pass interference on Dwight Lowery move the ball to inside the 20-yard line. To end the drive, Weeden hit Jaelen Strong on the run for an 8-yard touchdown and a 13-10 Houston lead. After trading punts, the Colts got the ball back at midfield with 3 minutes remaining. Hasselbeck completed a pass to Griff Whalen, but Johnathan Joseph knocked the ball loose and Kareem Jackson returned the fumble 34 yards to Indianapolis' 21-yard line. That set up a short field goal for Novak to give the Texans a 16-10 lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Hasselbeck throw a ball up for grabs down the middle of the field, and A.J. Bouye ran underneath it for a game-clinching interception.    Hasselbeck completed 17-of-30 for 147 yards with a touchdown and interception. Moncrief led the Colts in receiving with 5 receptions for 51 yards and a score. Johnson (3-52 and "

   "comment":"Moncrief on a play that could have resulted in a touchdown. It was a throw that the quarterback should have made, and it could have cost the Colts had the Packers completed the comeback. Luck threw 2 early interceptions, and both were avoidable. The first was the worst of the 2. He had a wide-open receiver in space, but instead of throwing a hard pass, he lofted it. That allowed Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to come over and get under the ball. The second pick came on a throw that should never have happened. Luck had quite a bit of time to throw before he was put under pressure. He did not get a pass off until he was getting hit. As a result, he overthrew Jack Doyle on the play and Clinton-Dix again was the beneficiary. Luck would have been better off taking the sack or lofting it out of bounds. He needs to improve his decision-making if he wants to be a truly elite quarterback.    For most of the day, Luck relied on 3 receivers to do a brunt of the work. T.Y. Hilton (6-81) led the team in both catches and yardage. The speedy top option is still not at full health as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Still, his big-play ability makes him a high-upside WR1 week in and week out in fantasy. After Hilton, Jack Doyle (5-61) and Donte Moncrief (3-55, 1 TD) were the major producers. Moncrief looked healthy in his second game back from injury, and he should be the bona fide No. 2 option for Luck. In fantasy, he is probably a high-end WR3 most weeks, unless the team has a great matchup. Doyle, meanwhile, has turned himself into a security blanket for Luck. Doyle led the team in targets with 9, and he seems to be getting better each week. Doyle is a TE2 with upside, so if you are hurting at the position, try to pick him up.    In terms of the running game, "
