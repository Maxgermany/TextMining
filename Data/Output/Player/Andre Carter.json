   "comment":"Carter sacked Rex Grossman in the end zone and caused a fumble that was recovered by Vince Wilfork for a touchdown. The Redskins answered with wide receiver Donte' Stallworth beating cornerback Devin McCourty for a 51-yard reception on a go route downfield. It was a great thrown from Grossman to drop the ball in to Stallworth and set up a field goal. New England tight end Ron Gronkowksi made an amazing 50-yard reception where he broke about 5 tackles to get downfield. It set up a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Gronkowski, writing new a record for touchdowns from a tight end in a season. It was the start to a massive game from Gronkowski. Washington answered with some good runs from Roy Helu and a touchdown strike from Grossman to Jabar Gaffney. Down 14-10, the Redskins pulled off a gadget play. On a reverse to wide receiver Brandon Banks, Santana Moss broke open running downfield. Banks launched a ball up and it fell into Moss for a 49-yard touchdown. New England then got 2 field goals, but Washington followed that by kicking 1 to make it 20-20 at halftime. In the third quarter, Brady and Gronkowski hooked up for a beautiful touchdown. After a big pressure, Brady lofted the ball over Gronkowski's shoulder. He caught the ball just past the line of scrimmage and shed a tackle from Ryan Kerrigan to break down the field for a 37-yard touchdown. The Redskins tied it up with a quality drive by Grossman and Helu. It ended in a 6.yard touchdown pass to David Anderson. The Patriots got the game-winning score on a 24-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wes Welker. In the 4.h quarter, each defense gave up more yards but caused timely turnovers to keep the offenses from scoring points. A touchdown pass from Grossman to Moss was called back on a push-off penalty by Moss. The veteran coughed up a pass that was intercepted by Jerod Mayo to seal the Patriots' win. Brady finished the game 22-of-37 for 357 yards and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. The interception by Josh Wilson came in the end zone and led to a huge shouting match on the sideline between Brady and coach Bill O'Brien. Welker (7-86) and Gronkowski (6-160) were too much for Washington's secondary to contain. Grossman was 19-of-32 for 252 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Helu (27-126), Stallworth (4-96), Moss (3-81) and Gaffney (6-92) all had good games against the New England defense. The Redskins' offensive line did well in run blocking, but their pass blocking needs to improve. Carter had another good game for New England. The Patriots' defense has to up their game down the stretch, or the team could make a quick postseason exit. The secondary stinks. When New England faces better teams in the playoffs, they could get killed through the air. If the Redskins' offense can roll up yards (463) and points, then the Patriots have to worry about taking on a balanced team like the Steelers, or if they somehow make it to the Super Bowl, a team like the Packers or the Saints.
