   "comment":"Anderson, but he made his first mistake of the day when throwing the ball up for grabs into the end zone on a first down. The pass was picked off, allowing Tennessee to improve to 8-4.    The Titans had no answer for DeAndre Hopkins, who made some ridiculous catches in this contest. He started right away with a 1.handed grab on the opening drive. He then made a terrific toe-tap reception for 17 yards along the sideline. Hopkins tortured Tennessee's secondary, but didn't finish with a great stat line; he had 8 catches for 80 yards. He nearly scored a touchdown in the opening quarter, but managed to get just 1 foot inbounds. As for Savage's other weapons, tight end Stephen Anderson was next on the stat sheet with 5 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. "
