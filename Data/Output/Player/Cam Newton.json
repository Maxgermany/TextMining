   "comment":"Cam Newton was awesome, shattering Peyton Manning's rookie record for most passing yards in a Week 1 game. Newton, who went 24-of-37 for 422 yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 1 rushing touchdown (on a sneak) and an interception, destroyed Manning's mark of 302. What Newton did was completely legitimate. He was very accurate, both deep and short. The kicker is that he didn't even have much time in the pocket; on several plays he had to escape pressure, failing most of the time, as Arizona's defense was much quicker than any stop unit he faced in the SEC. I'm really excited to see what Newton does going forward. As Tony Dungy said on NBC's highlight show, rookies don't come in and do this, especially on the road. Newton really looks like something special.    I'd like to congratulate "

   "comment":"Cam Newton and Blaine Gabbert was mostly ruined by rain. If you didn't catch any highlights of this contest, it was a torrential downpour for most of the afternoon. In fact, it was so bad that most of the Carolina fans fled the stadium. It was impossible to even see who had the ball. Despite the rain, Gabbert was able to hook up with Mike Thomas on a 36-yard touchdown as time expired in the first half. It was reminiscent of the David Garrard-to-Thomas Hail Mary, though Jacksonville didn't get the victory this time. Gabbert was pretty mediocre otherwise. He went 12-of-21 for 139 yards, 1 touchdown an interception and 3 fumbles. He did have his first pass - a nice, 13-yard completion to Jason Hill - wiped out because of a Eugene Monroe penalty. However, Gabbert's pocket presence was a big problem; he struggled with pressure and even took a safety. Most of his yardage came on screen passes to Jones-Drew.    Speaking of Jones-Drew, there's no doubt now that he's healthy; the Pro Bowl running back gained 122 yards on 24 carries to go along with 3 catches for 45 receiving yards.    The rain cleared up as the game progressed, and the Panthers were able to finally take the lead in the 4.h quarter when Cam Newton hit Greg Olsen (7-57, TD) for a 16-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Cam Newton said this past week that the Panthers would be undefeated if he didn't commit any turnovers. Ironically, this game was tied at 14 at the half solely because of Newton's give-aways. He was strip-sacked twice, leading to a pair of Minnesota touchdowns. Not only is Newton good; his analysis is completely accurate.)    A couple weeks prior to the 2011 NFL Draft, I mocked Christian Ponder No. 16 overall and was roundly ripped for having him so high. As we all know now, he was selected No. 12 and is proving to be worth the investment. Most times it is not fair to say Ponder won in a battle of rookie quarterbacks over first-overall pick Cam Newton. In this case it is absolutely true. I will explain that later. The opening kickoff was the only 1 Minnesota returned the entire game. "

   "comment":"Cam Newton nearly tossed a pick on a high throw during the ensuing drive. He then heaved an ugly interception on the next play. 3. Panthers: An unnecessary roughness penalty gave Detroit a first down on what would have been a 4th-and-8. 4. Lions: Stafford was picked again in the end zone. 5. Lions: Keiland Williams lost a fumble in his own territory. 6. Panthers: A nice DeAngelo Williams run was negated because of a hold by a receiver. 7. Lions: Detroit surrendered a 102-yard kickoff return touchdown to someone named Kealoha Pilares. Sounds like some workout regimen. 8. Lions: The team gave the Panthers a first down on a 4th-and-4 because of an illegal use of hands penalty. Cam Newton would later score a touchdown as a result.    As mentioned, Carolina had a 24-7 lead in this game, so how did they blow both the straight-up victory and the cover? Well, they were the only 1. making dumb mistakes in the second half. All they did after intermission was drop passes, take sacks, throw picks and miss tackles. It was amazing how much of a 180 this game took.    Newton was just dreadful after the break. He had a nice, game-tying touchdown drive with 5 minutes remaining, but his 3 picks were a killer. He finished 22-of-38, 280 yards, 1 touchdown and 4 interceptions to go along with 2 rushing scores.    Newton's top receiver was a running back; "

Yates then had an awful interception on the next drive The Panthers, meanwhile, went up 21-0 on a crazy Fumblerooski play that caught the Texans completely unawares.    Houston's defense sucked the entire afternoon, but I'm not sure if it's because this game meant nothing to them, or if it was because Phillips was missing. Cam Newton basically did what he wanted, finishing 13-of-23 for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 55 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The Texans brought him down just twice.    "

LeGarrette Blount, meanwhile, fumbled the ball away on Tampa Bay's first offensive play, effectively spotting Carolina 3 more. Blount was benched for the rest of the first half after the turnover.

   "comment":"Cam Newton struggled last preseason and got off to a slow start in 2012. History is apparently repeating itself, as Newton went 16-of-23, but for only 125 yards and a touchdown. Newton needs to do more scrambling; he ran just 5 times for 38 yards. Defenses fear Newton when he takes off, so his hesitancy to run is music to opposing defensive coordinators' ears. Newton can't receive too much blame for this loss, however, as the coaching staff screwed up by punting it away on too many 4.h-and-short situations. Newton can pretty much pick up any short-yardage situation by moving the pile, so I have no idea what Ron Rivera was thinking - especially after losing in similar fashion at Atlanta last season.    Only 3 Panthers had more than 1 reception: "

   "comment":"Cam Newton, who had just 4 scrambles for 15 rushing yards. It seems like Newton wants to be a pocket passer who rushes as a last resort, but Newton is just doing what opposing defensive coordinators want. If he doesn't use his legs, he's so much easier to defend. Newton finished 21-of-38 for 229 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception on a miscommunication. The numbers don't look that bad, but he missed a number of receivers downfield. He's just not the same quarterback who finished the 2012 campaign on a hot streak. He's struggling without former offensive coordinator, Rob Chudzinski. It wouldn't hurt if the Panthers found a No. 2 wideout for Newton. "

   "comment":"Cam Newton's pocket, as Newton barely saw any pressure throughout the afternoon. The Vikings finally got to him in the second quarter, but it came with a face mask that gave Carolina a free first down. Thanks to the lack of pressure, Newton was able to convert third-and-longs with ease during the afternoon (7-of-12). He was able to finish a near-perfect 20-of-26 for 242 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also used his legs for a change, scrambling 9 times for 30 rushing yards and a 4.h score.    Newton's 3 aerial touchdowns all went to different players: "

   "comment":"Cam Newton sneak once, and it didn't work, but I feel like Newton should've been given more opportunities to rush the ball into the end zone. Second, and this is much more disconcerting, official Carl Cheffers and his crew completely sabotaged this game for Carolina, as they seemed like they were doing everything in their power to make sure there was a San Francisco-Seattle matchup next week, which will obviously draw higher ratings. That's the only reasonable explanation for this 1.sided officiating. Here are some examples of Cheffers' incompetence and/or corruption: - Michael Mitchell was whistled for an awful unecessary roughness penalty on the first drive - Troy Aikman was as livid as he gets upon seeing the infraction for the late hit - and this helped set up a San Francisco field goal. - Steve Smith was hit late similarly on Carolina's opening possession, yet no flag was thrown. - The 49ers were whistled for a defensive hold on the next drive in which Luke Kuechly barely touched the opponent. - Captain Munnerlyn was flagged for an unnecessary roughness for headbutting a Panther. This was a questionable penalty, but the thing that made this an absolutely horrific call was that Anquan Boldin wasn't whistled for the same exact thing right before San Francisco scored its first touchdown at the end of the opening half. - As Mike Pereira pointed out, the 49ers had 12 men in the huddle prior to that touchdown, yet Cheffers allowed them to take a player off the field. This is illegal, and San Francisco should've moved backward 5 yards, which would've probably forced a field goal, given that the team didn't have much time remaining on the clock.    Given that the Panthers were battling the unstoppable combination of Jim Harbaugh and the officials, it's understandable that some of the players would get deflated. This, however, does not excuse Cam Newton sulking on the sideline. He showed terrible body language, and even though a comeback was possible down 23-10 with 8 minutes remaining, it was obvious that the 49ers would come away with the victory. Newton had a horrific second half. After going 8-of-10 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (the pass thrown behind "

   "comment":"Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.

   "comment":"Cam Newton interception. Seattle then had Newton wrapped up for a sack on 2 occasions on the same play, but Newton muscled out of the tackles and picked up a first down. There were more egregious mistakes, however. Russell Wilson should've thrown a touchdown to Marshawn Lynch, but the running back let the ball pop out of his hands, and it ended up falling to cornerback Josh Norman for an interception. Wilson then missed a score of his own; he had Cooper Helfet wide open for a score, but the attempt inexplicably fell way short. Luke Willson followed that up with a drop near the goal line on the same possession. After that, Wilson had issues holding on to the ball. He dropped a read-option exchange. He was lucky to retain possession, but only temporarily, because he gave away a turnover when there was a botched snap.    Wilson still came away with the victory though, and that's all that will matter during the playoff push. Wilson went 20-of-32 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick that wasn't his fault. Wilson missed several open targets, but picked up some decent chunks on the ground, gaining 35 rushing yards on 6 scrambles.    Wilson's sole score ended up going to Willson, which won the game. Doug Baldwin was the only Seahawk with more than 32 receiving yards. He caught 6 of his 8 targets for 61 yards.    Chris Mortensen reported that this will be Marshawn Lynch's final season with the Seahawks, but that Lynch would not be traded. Had Lynch been on the block, he would've lost some value based on this performance. He was responsible for Wilson's interception, negating at least 3 points. He also rushed for 62 yards on 14 carries, but didn't do much on the ground until a late, 25-yard burst. He was at the 3.yard-average mark for most of the afternoon.    As for the Panthers, Cam Newton had a miserable second half. He did a good job of moving the chains prior to intermission, but he had a complete meltdown after the break, going 4-of-12 for 81 yards and an interception to finish the game. The pick was terrible, as it was an ugly shovel pass. His only long completion following halftime was an amazing 51-yard reception by "

   "comment":"Cam Newton's health has sparked this incredible surge. Newton was highly ineffective earlier in the year because he was nursing numerous injuries. That's not the case anymore, as Newton has been running circles around his opponents recently. The Falcons looked completely inept trying to stop him, as he basically did whatever he wanted to in this divisional title game. Newton threw just 16 passes, but completed 10 of them for 114 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled 6 times for 51 rushing yards and a second score. On 1 play, the Falcons had him dead to rights, but he was able to wiggle out of a couple of sacks and sprint for a first down. We saw the Newton of old in this contest, running read-options and scrambling without hesitation, all while confidently doing his trademark Superman celebration.    Newton's sole score went to "

   "comment":"Cam Newton was nearly intercepted on 2 other occasions after actually being picked by Richard Sherman, and the team fumbled twice and was lucky to recover both times. Carolina had several 3.and-outs to open the contest, but everything changed when starting cornerback Byron Maxwell left the game with a shortness of breath. Newton then recognized the mismatch, targeting backup corner Tharold Simon on most of his throws. Newton had a ton of success moving the chains this way, but he had to dink and dunk doing so because of the Seattle edge in the trenches. As with any dink-and-dunk offense, Carolina's scoring unit was disrupted by mistakes, such as penalties, drops and sacks. It's clear that the team needs to upgrade the offensive line as well as the receiving corps this offseason. Newton finished 23-of-36 for 246 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He played well considering the competition, but the picks were a killer, and as mentioned, things could've been much worse for him. It should be noted that he was effective on the ground, gaining 37 yards on 11 scrambles.    Both of Newton's touchdowns went to Kelvin Benjamin, who had 7 catches for 75 yards. He was 1 of only 2 Panthers to accumulate more than 35 receiving yards, and the other was "

   "comment":"Cam Newton's career, the Panthers dominated all the way. The offense and the defense were both stellar as the Panthers won their 14th-straight regular-season game, including 8 straight at home. The victory kept the Panthers on track for home-field advantage in the NFC playoffs. The loss was Washington's ninth straight on the road, but it didn't hurt the Redskins' playoff chances all that much. At 4-6, Washington is only a game behind the first-place New York Giants (5-5) in the NFC East.    Newton has had days with more passing yards. But he threw for a career-high 5 touchdown passes, including 4 in the first half. He's a quarterback you should be starting in any fantasy league or DFS format because he's been playing the best football of his career in recent weeks. Newton finished with 21 completions on 34 attempts for 246 yards.    Carolina running back "

   "comment":"Cam Newton has, that he doesn't need the best receivers in the league to be able to dominate at his position.    Carson Palmer sat early in this matchup, but he was not on his game this week, completing just 12-of-25 passes for 129 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. His receivers made a few bad drops, but Palmer and this team as a group were not prepared for the intensity the Seahawks brought.    Besides Wilson's accuracy and poise, Tyler Lockett was a 1.man wrecking crew as a punt returner, reeling off returns of 66, 49 and 42 yards and finishing with a franchise record 139 punt-return yards in a single game.    Lockett's presence on special teams, along with his skills as a receiver, coupled with Doug Baldwin's great route running in the slot and even "

   "comment":"Cam Newton was on the field and taking hits in the 4.h quarter, I have no idea. The Panthers would have been completely screwed had Newton sustained an injury in meaningless action.    The Carolina Panthers got help from the Seattle Seahawks, but, as it turned out, they didn't need it. The Panthers (15-1) took care of their own business by blowing out Tampa Bay. At the same time, Seattle was beating the Arizona Cardinals. Either scenario was enough to give the Panthers the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Carolina coach Ron Rivera decided to ignore what was happening between Seattle and Arizona and played his starters most of the game. That worked out just fine as the Panthers never were in danger of losing.    Cam Newton did nothing to hurt his case for the Most Valuable Player award. Newton completed 21-of-26 passes for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also rushed 6 times for 10 yards and 2 touchdowns. He took some big hits early from Tampa's pass rush, but he basically did whatever he wanted to in the second half.    With running back Jonathan Stewart sitting out another game due to injury, the Panthers turned to rookie "

However, Newton took some crushing hits. He had a shot to the head on 1 play, and then the Cardinals went low on his legs, causing him to cover up his face in pain while sitting down on the sideline. Curiously, there was no penalty, as Newton complained to senile official Walt Coleman, who probably asked what year it was in response. In his post-game press conference, Newton told the media that he'll discuss the matter with Roger Goodell. Newton barely completed half of his passes, going 14-of-27 for 212 yards. However, he was battling a strong defense, and he was also able to scramble 7 times for 43 rushing yards. Newton, as mentioned, was banged around quite often. He was also fortunate to get away with not throwing an interception, as he appeared to launch a pick on a deep underthrow to "

Wilson could've been picked on a several occasions, but he came up big in the clutch. He was like a magician in the pocket on 1 play, avoiding several potential sacks and finding "

The perennial Pro Bowler is such an important part of the offense, and he'll need to return for the Panthers to rebound. Newton finished 17-of-26 for 167 yards and 3 interceptions. As ugly as his afternoon was, it could've been even worse. He was nearly picked on a couple of other occasions, and he was strip-sacked, but the ball popped into the air and landed right into his arms.

   "comment":"Cam Newton had 1 of the best performances since his MVP season in 2015. Newton was the leader of the Panthers' offense, and focused on utilizing both his arm strength and mobility to take down the Patriots. Newton went 22-of-29 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. Throughout the contest, Newton was able to find massive gaps in the Patriots' defense thanks to coverage busts and good routes by his receivers. Newton displayed excellent accuracy and field vision, and rarely had a regrettable throw. His only bad plays came on a couple of overthrows. The first was on his interception, where he launched a pass into double coverage. The second came on the game-winning drive, where Newton overshot "

   "comment":"Cam Newton for another touchdown. It was a great play and demonstrated that Jackson has a lot of promise as a young safety.    For the Panthers, this was an extremely disappointing performance against what was projected to be an easy opponent. The Panthers never got going on offense, and no player had any sort of promising showing. Most of the players on the Panthers had bad outings, but a good chunk of the blame for this loss can fall on the offensive line. Things did not go well for them, as they lost center Ryan Kalil and Trai Turner to injuries in the contest. The unit was dreadful for most of the day, and they allowed Leonard Floyd and Akiem Hicks to put pressure on Cam Newton all day. Newton was sacked 5 times, and never looked comfortable in the pocket. At points, it didn't look like he was fully healthy, and he seemed to be limping around the field a bit. Without protection, Newton was scrambling too often, and his accuracy suffered as a result. Newton frequently missed his receivers when he was in motion and had to settle for checkdowns.    While this was not Newton's best performance, he still did have some nice moments. Early in the contest, he made some nice midfield strikes to his receivers. But as the game went along, the pressure got to him. He finished 21-of-34 with 211 yards and 2 picks, though he also ran for 50 yards on 9 carries. The second pick wasn't his fault, as it glanced off "
