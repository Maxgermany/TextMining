Newton, who went 24-of-37 for 422 yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 1 rushing touchdown (on a sneak) and an interception, destroyed Manning's mark of 302. What Newton did was completely legitimate. He was very accurate, both deep and short. The kicker is that he didn't even have much time in the pocket; on several plays he had to escape pressure, failing most of the time, as Arizona's defense was much quicker than any stop unit he faced in the SEC. I'm really excited to see what Newton does going forward. As Tony Dungy said on NBC's highlight show, rookies don't come in and do this, especially on the road. Newton really looks like something special.    I'd like to congratulate "

   "comment":"Newton and Blaine Gabbert was mostly ruined by rain. If you didn't catch any highlights of this contest, it was a torrential downpour for most of the afternoon. In fact, it was so bad that most of the Carolina fans fled the stadium. It was impossible to even see who had the ball. Despite the rain, Gabbert was able to hook up with Mike Thomas on a 36-yard touchdown as time expired in the first half. It was reminiscent of the David Garrard-to-Thomas Hail Mary, though Jacksonville didn't get the victory this time. Gabbert was pretty mediocre otherwise. He went 12-of-21 for 139 yards, 1 touchdown an interception and 3 fumbles. He did have his first pass - a nice, 13-yard completion to Jason Hill - wiped out because of a Eugene Monroe penalty. However, Gabbert's pocket presence was a big problem; he struggled with pressure and even took a safety. Most of his yardage came on screen passes to Jones-Drew.    Speaking of Jones-Drew, there's no doubt now that he's healthy; the Pro Bowl running back gained 122 yards on 24 carries to go along with 3 catches for 45 receiving yards.    The rain cleared up as the game progressed, and the Panthers were able to finally take the lead in the fourth quarter when Cam Newton hit Greg Olsen (7-57, TD) for a 16-yard touchdown."

   "comment":"Newton, neither of which were really his fault. The first pick was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The ball sailed into Brent Grimes' arms into the end zone, which probably could have been prevented if Steve Smith didn't give up. The second was a really great play by defensive tackle Corey Peters, who recognized a Carolina screen attempt. Side note: I don't think I had ever seen an interception on a screen pass before this season, and I've had 3 go against me through 6 weeks thus far. Unreal.    Newton finished 21-of-35 for 237 yards and 3 picks (the third interception was a meaningless, last-second throw). However, he saved his fantasy day with 50 rushing yards and a score. He once again led the team in rushing, with "

Instead, Williams shed the defender and ran into the end zone.    That was just early on. I understand some stupid early mistakes affecting a team, but the Panthers appeared hungover throughout.

   "comment":"Newton tossed 2 ugly interceptions after the break, allowing the Falcons to make their comeback and cover the 3-point spread. The complete 180 (or 360, as Emmitt would say) was remarkable. Carolina outgained Atlanta in the first half, 245-117, while the Falcons had the yardage edge after the break, 277-171.    I gave Matt Ryan a lot of grief last week for performing poorly - and he did - but I'll give him credit for what he did at Carolina. Ryan went 22-of-38 for 320 yards and 4 touchdowns. His completion percentage would have been a lot better if it wasn't for all the drops. Julio Jones himself had what seemed like a billion drops in the third quarter. Jones would make up for it though with a pair of touchdowns (17, 75 yards) that gave the Falcons the lead and cover in the fourth quarter. The Falcon rookie receiver made 3 receptions in total for 104 yards and those scores. Roddy White (84 yards, TD) and Tony Gonzalez (7-82) both hauled in 7 grabs.    Michael Turner had a bit of a disappointing game considering the opposition. He rushed for 76 yards on 21 attempts.    The Panthers also struggled to run the football. DeAngelo Williams broke off a 74-yard touchdown in the second quarter, but did nothing otherwise (7-87). The same can be said for Jonathan Stewart (8-29).    Newton was also limited on the ground; he rushed for only 36 yards to go along with his average passing numbers (19-of-39, 276 yards, 2 TDs, 2 INTs). The rookie signal-caller was really erratic in the second half. In addition to those aforementioned picks, he had major trouble with his accuracy, mechanics and reads. He still gave the Panthers a chance to win though, but "

Jonathan Stewart outgained DeAngelo Williams - and he didn't even play.    This game started out like the Carolina Panthers thought they were still playing in the preseason. Tampa Bay was ready to play and the Panthers were sleep walking through the first half. The Buccaneers' defense played tough for 4 quarters and carried the team to a win. The Bucs' defensive line deserves a lot of the credit, especially defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He had a superb game, blowing up runs and rushing the quarterback. On the flip side, the Panthers' offensive line was atrocious. It didn't protect Newton well and was God-awful in run blocking. Carolina's offense couldn't extend drives, and as result, Tampa Bay dominated the time of possession. The Panthers had minus-1 yard rushing at halftime and finished with only 10 yards total on the ground. DeAngelo Williams had minus-1 yards on 6 carries. If Carolina's line doesn't pick up its play, it is going to be a painful season for the running game. The Bucs produced timely turnovers with interceptions by "

Newton needs to do more scrambling; he ran just 5 times for 38 yards. Defenses fear Newton when he takes off, so his hesitancy to run is music to opposing defensive coordinators' ears. Newton can't receive too much blame for this loss, however, as the coaching staff screwed up by punting it away on too many fourth-and-short situations. Newton can pretty much pick up any short-yardage situation by moving the pile, so I have no idea what Ron Rivera was thinking - especially after losing in similar fashion at Atlanta last season.

If he doesn't use his legs, he's so much easier to defend. Newton finished 21-of-38 for 229 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception on a miscommunication. The numbers don't look that bad, but he missed a number of receivers downfield. He's just not the same quarterback who finished the 2012 campaign on a hot streak. He's struggling without former offensive coordinator, Rob Chudzinski. It wouldn't hurt if the Panthers found a No. 2 wideout for Newton. "

   "comment":"Newton sneak once, and it didn't work, but I feel like Newton should've been given more opportunities to rush the ball into the end zone. Second, and this is much more disconcerting, official Carl Cheffers and his crew completely sabotaged this game for Carolina, as they seemed like they were doing everything in their power to make sure there was a San Francisco-Seattle matchup next week, which will obviously draw higher ratings. That's the only reasonable explanation for this 1-sided officiating. Here are some examples of Cheffers' incompetence and/or corruption: - Michael Mitchell was whistled for an awful unecessary roughness penalty on the first drive - Troy Aikman was as livid as he gets upon seeing the infraction for the late hit - and this helped set up a San Francisco field goal. - "

Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.

   "comment":"Newton all evening. Even Jarvis Jones registered a sack. He easily beat Byron Bell, who had a rough night. In addition blocking poorly, Bell also nullified a first down with a face mask infraction. Carolina didn't help matters with dumb penalties and turnovers. Playing like the 49ers, the Panthers continuously shot themselves in the foot with terrible errors. I already mentioned the Bell infraction and that Newton was strip-sacked by Jones. In the third quarter, an encroachment infraction on a field goal attempt put the defense back on the field. The Steelers scored a touchdown 1 play later. And then there was Philly Brown's muffed punt which he picked up and tried to advance, only to have it knocked out of his hands and secured in the end zone for a Pittsburgh touchdown. That was the nail in the coffin, as the Panthers were down 10 with 11 minutes remaining and receiving possession. That blunder put this game out of reach.    Newton had a night to forget. His numbers don't look bad - 24-of-35, 250 yards, touchdown - but he looked hobbled and resorted to short attempts for the most part. The Steelers hit him hard - which included a violent "

   "comment":"Newton was also beaten to a pulp. He didn't leave the game until it got out of hand, but he was constantly hit and harassed. His offensive line couldn't do anything to protect him, as Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to "

Newton's passing numbers weren't as great; he finished 17-of-30 for only 167 yards, 1 touchdown and a terrible interception in which he ran backward to avoid pressure by "

That's not the case anymore, as Newton has been running circles around his opponents recently. The Falcons looked completely inept trying to stop him, as he basically did whatever he wanted to in this divisional title game. Newton threw just 16 passes, but completed 10 of them for 114 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled 6 times for 51 rushing yards and a second score. On 1 play, the Falcons had him dead to rights, but he was able to wiggle out of a couple of sacks and sprint for a first down. We saw the Newton of old in this contest, running read-options and scrambling without hesitation, all while confidently doing his trademark Superman celebration.    Newton's sole score went to "

It took him a while to get up when kneeling down, and he was constantly wincing in pain. Newton also missed numerous open receivers throughout the contest. Had he connected on some routine passes, this game wouldn't have been close. Newton did have some impressive scrambles to convert several third-and-long situations right after halftime, but he did not have a very encouraging performance. Newton barely completed half of his passes, finishing 18-of-32 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns, an interception and a lost fumble. The pick was nearly returned for 6 by "

   "comment":"Newton and the offense. The victory puts the Panthers (4-0) in great shape as they head into their bye week. Linebacker Luke Kuechly, who has missed the last 3 games with a concussion, should be able to return against Seattle after the bye, and that can only help a defense that already is playing very well.    Carolina cornerback Josh Norman is making an early case for Defensive Player of the Year. Norman had 2 interceptions, including 1 he returned 46 yards for a touchdown. Norman already has 4 interceptions on the season.    Wide receiver Ted Ginn is looking like a player worthy of starting in fantasy. Ginn had only 2 catches, but both of them went for touchdowns. Ginn is known as a deep threat. But, both touchdowns came on short passes. Even when Jerricho Cotchery returns from injury, Ginn still is going to get a fair amount of targets.    The injuries at wide receiver have forced the Panthers to play some young players. Rookie Devin Funchess hasn't stepped up yet though. Funchess was targeted twice and did not have a reception. He's not worth having on your fantasy team.    Running back Jonathan Stewart had a quiet day. Stewart had 50 yards on 10 carries and lost a fumble that tight end Ed Dickson grabbed and ran in for a touchdown. Stewart could have put up bigger numbers, but Carolina elected to rest him and give the carries to Cameron Artis-Payne once the Panthers had a comfortable lead.    Newton continued his steady season on a day when the defense kept handing him good field position. Newton completed 11-of-22 passes for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 51 yards rushing on 12 carries.    For the Buccaneers (1-3), rookie quarterback Jameis Winston had an absolutely dismal day. He was intercepted 4 times and lost a fumble. Winston did put up 287 passing yards and 2 interceptions. But a big chunk of his yardage came after the game was out of hand and the Bucs were throwing on virtually every down.    One of the few bright spots for the Bucs was running back "

   "comment":"Newton hit tight end Greg Olsen with a late touchdown pass to seal a 27-23 victory. Count that as Newton's coming-out party. Newton and the Panthers entered the game 0-4 against the Seahawks (2-4) in the last 3 years, including a playoff game last season. But the Panthers went across the continent and got a win against a team that has been very good the last few years. You now can list Carolina among the Super Bowl favorites. Newton had struggled in the last 4 meetings with the Seahawks, but he got the job done this time.    Newton can be streaky, but he came through in the clutch this time. His scoring pass to Olsen was perfect. Newton completed 20-of-36 passes for 269 yards with 2 interceptions. Newton, however, made up for the turnovers with a passing touchdown and a run for a score. He remains a player you have to start in any fantasy league.    Speaking of players who must start in fantasy leagues, you have to begin with Olsen. Even though he's getting heavy coverage, Olsen had 7 catches for 131 yards and the touchdown.    Carolina had some nice balance in its offense. "

Philadelphia promptly set up another score as Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Newton's career, the Panthers dominated all the way. The offense and the defense were both stellar as the Panthers won their 14th-straight regular-season game, including 8 straight at home. The victory kept the Panthers on track for home-field advantage in the NFC playoffs. The loss was Washington's ninth straight on the road, but it didn't hurt the Redskins' playoff chances all that much. At 4-6, Washington is only a game behind the first-place New York Giants (5-5) in the NFC East.    Newton has had days with more passing yards. But he threw for a career-high 5 touchdown passes, including 4 in the first half. He's a quarterback you should be starting in any fantasy league or DFS format because he's been playing the best football of his career in recent weeks. Newton finished with 21 completions on 34 attempts for 246 yards.    Carolina running back "

   "comment":"Newton has, that he doesn't need the best receivers in the league to be able to dominate at his position.    Carson Palmer sat early in this matchup, but he was not on his game this week, completing just 12-of-25 passes for 129 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. His receivers made a few bad drops, but Palmer and this team as a group were not prepared for the intensity the Seahawks brought.    Besides Wilson's accuracy and poise, Tyler Lockett was a 1-man wrecking crew as a punt returner, reeling off returns of 66, 49 and 42 yards and finishing with a franchise record 139 punt-return yards in a single game.    Lockett's presence on special teams, along with his skills as a receiver, coupled with Doug Baldwin's great route running in the slot and even "

   "comment":"Newton was on the field and taking hits in the fourth quarter, I have no idea. The Panthers would have been completely screwed had Newton sustained an injury in meaningless action.    The Carolina Panthers got help from the Seattle Seahawks, but, as it turned out, they didn't need it. The Panthers (15-1) took care of their own business by blowing out Tampa Bay. At the same time, Seattle was beating the Arizona Cardinals. Either scenario was enough to give the Panthers the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Carolina coach Ron Rivera decided to ignore what was happening between Seattle and Arizona and played his starters most of the game. That worked out just fine as the Panthers never were in danger of losing.    Cam Newton did nothing to hurt his case for the Most Valuable Player award. Newton completed 21-of-26 passes for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also rushed 6 times for 10 yards and 2 touchdowns. He took some big hits early from Tampa's pass rush, but he basically did whatever he wanted to in the second half.    With running back Jonathan Stewart sitting out another game due to injury, the Panthers turned to rookie "

The result was a more competitive battle in which the Panthers led by double digits at halftime. And yet, they still lost. The difference, once again, was Denver's defense. The Broncos' stop unit didn't fare all that well in the first half, but Wade Phillips made some tremendous adjustments at intermission. Following halftime, the Panthers gained just 123 net yards (210 beforehand), and Newton went just 7-of-16 for 83 yards and an interception in the final 2 quarters. He took some crushing hits. On 1 instance, he was down for a while on the sideline and appeared to be injured. On another, it seemed like he sustained a concussion, and Derek Anderson even began warming up. Newton stayed on the field, however, and even had the Panthers in a position to kick the game-winning field goal, but "

However, Newton took some crushing hits. He had a shot to the head on 1 play, and then the Cardinals went low on his legs, causing him to cover up his face in pain while sitting down on the sideline. Curiously, there was no penalty, as Newton complained to senile official Walt Coleman, who probably asked what year it was in response. In his post-game press conference, Newton told the media that he'll discuss the matter with Roger Goodell. Newton barely completed half of his passes, going 14-of-27 for 212 yards. However, he was battling a strong defense, and he was also able to scramble 7 times for 43 rushing yards. Newton, as mentioned, was banged around quite often. He was also fortunate to get away with not throwing an interception, as he appeared to launch a pick on a deep underthrow to "

   "comment":"Newton managed to connect with Kelvin Benjamin for an 18-yard gain to seal the victory. That was Carolina's only first down of the final frame.    Newton finished with underwhelming numbers, going 14-of-33 for 192 yards and a touchdown. It's noteworthy that Newton was especially awful after halftime; he was 6-of-14 for 58 yards following the break. Keep in mind that this occurred against New Orleans' putrid defense. Kalil's absence had that much of an impact.    Newton's sole touchdown was thrown to "

On the opening drive, Ryan ripped the ball down the field, distributing it to a variety of weapons before throwing open tight end Josh Perkins (2-34-1) over Thomas Davis for a 26-yard touchdown. Carolina started moving the ball, but then rookie Brian Poole intercepted Cam Newton with a return close to midfield. The Falcons turned that into a 51-yard field goal for "

He was nearly picked in the opening quarter, but Foster dropped the ball. He was actually intercepted just prior to halftime, as Jaquiski Tartt made an acrobatic pick on an underthrown ball. This was a rare occurrence of Tartt making a positive play, as the backup safety, playing for Jimmie Ward, was beaten on numerous occasions. He also committed a dumb penalty. Tartt's incompetence allowed Newton to be functional, whereas better safety play would've crushed Carolina's offense.

Newton went 22-of-29 for 316 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. Throughout the contest, Newton was able to find massive gaps in the Patriots' defense thanks to coverage busts and good routes by his receivers. Newton displayed excellent accuracy and field vision, and rarely had a regrettable throw. His only bad plays came on a couple of overthrows. The first was on his interception, where he launched a pass into double coverage. The second came on the game-winning drive, where Newton overshot "

   "comment":"Newton is absolutely healthy now. That was not the case several weeks ago when the Saints obliterated the Panthers, but he certainly looks like he's in MVP form once again. With Newton playing at a high level, the Lions simply couldn't keep up with Carolina, resulting in a blowout. And yes, despite the 27-24 final score, this was a blowout. The Panthers led 27-10 in the fourth quarter. By the end of the third frame, the Lions had produced just 129 yards of offense, compared to Carolina's 336. "

   "comment":"Newton for another touchdown. It was a great play and demonstrated that Jackson has a lot of promise as a young safety.    For the Panthers, this was an extremely disappointing performance against what was projected to be an easy opponent. The Panthers never got going on offense, and no player had any sort of promising showing. Most of the players on the Panthers had bad outings, but a good chunk of the blame for this loss can fall on the offensive line. Things did not go well for them, as they lost center Ryan Kalil and Trai Turner to injuries in the contest. The unit was dreadful for most of the day, and they allowed Leonard Floyd and Akiem Hicks to put pressure on Cam Newton all day. Newton was sacked 5 times, and never looked comfortable in the pocket. At points, it didn't look like he was fully healthy, and he seemed to be limping around the field a bit. Without protection, Newton was scrambling too often, and his accuracy suffered as a result. Newton frequently missed his receivers when he was in motion and had to settle for checkdowns.    While this was not Newton's best performance, he still did have some nice moments. Early in the contest, he made some nice midfield strikes to his receivers. But as the game went along, the pressure got to him. He finished 21-of-34 with 211 yards and 2 picks, though he also ran for 50 yards on 9 carries. The second pick wasn't his fault, as it glanced off "
