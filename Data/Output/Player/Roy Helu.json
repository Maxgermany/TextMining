Starting in his place was Ricky Jean Francois, no doubt pumped over his alma mater LSU's huge win the previous night. Two short runs and a failed pass to "

Robert Griffin didn't look like his old self, but he was good enough to pull off the victory. He went 18-of-31 for 227 yards and a touchdown. He scrambled thrice for 10 yards, as the Raiders were completely prepared for the read-option (understandably so because they have to defend Pryor in practice). In fact, Griffin was sacked on a 4.h-down try in the second quarter. He had a gain of 7 yards, but didn't do anything else on the ground. Griffin's 1 touchdown was tossed to "

As for the Jaguars, the front office should strongly consider firing Gus Bradley. It's mind-boggling how unprepared Jacksonville was for this contest. Bradley also made dumb mistakes like calling a timeout prior to halftime when Washington still had the ball near midfield. Bradley's timeout allowed the Redskins to attempt a Hail Mary when the clock would've expired instead. Nothing happened, but Bradley could've cost his team big time. Bradley's worst offense is not going with Blake Bortles. Continuing to start "
