   "comment":"Helu and a touchdown strike from Grossman to Jabar Gaffney. Down 14-10, the Redskins pulled off a gadget play. On a reverse to wide receiver Brandon Banks, Santana Moss broke open running downfield. Banks launched a ball up and it fell into Moss for a 49-yard touchdown. New England then got 2 field goals, but Washington followed that by kicking 1 to make it 20-20 at halftime. In the third quarter, Brady and Gronkowski hooked up for a beautiful touchdown. After a big pressure, Brady lofted the ball over Gronkowski's shoulder. He caught the ball just past the line of scrimmage and shed a tackle from Ryan Kerrigan to break down the field for a 37-yard touchdown. The Redskins tied it up with a quality drive by Grossman and Helu. It ended in a 6-yard touchdown pass to "

He scrambled thrice for 10 yards, as the Raiders were completely prepared for the read-option (understandably so because they have to defend Pryor in practice). In fact, Griffin was sacked on a fourth-down try in the second quarter. He had a gain of 7 yards, but didn't do anything else on the ground. Griffin's 1 touchdown was tossed to "

Morris tallied 85 yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 carries, while Helu gained 25 yards on 8 attempts before leaving the game with a knee injury.    As for the Jaguars, the front office should strongly consider firing Gus Bradley. It's mind-boggling how unprepared Jacksonville was for this contest. Bradley also made dumb mistakes like calling a timeout prior to halftime when Washington still had the ball near midfield. Bradley's timeout allowed the Redskins to attempt a Hail Mary when the clock would've expired instead. Nothing happened, but Bradley could've cost his team big time. Bradley's worst offense is not going with Blake Bortles. Continuing to start "
