   "comment":"Eric Decker (8-133). Manning was pressured often for the third week in a row; he was sacked twice, but it could have been uglier for him if he wasn't capable of releasing the ball so quickly. Denver's offensive line has to be a concern heading into the playoffs, though getting guard Chris Kuper back from injury will help.    Decker was the only Denver wideout who had more than 36 receiving yards. Demaryius Thomas did very little (4-13), thanks to the aforementioned miscues early on.    The Broncos became the latest team to gash the Ravens on the ground. Moreno compiled 118 yards and a touchdown on just 22 carries, which includes 1 play where he impressively leapt over "

   "comment":"Eric Decker for a touchdown on a trick play. All of this was just in the first half. The Jets were much cleaner following intermission. Smith made just 1 mistake, as he took a bad sack to put the team out of field-goal range. He was otherwise flawless, completing every single pass in the second half (8-of-8, 67 yards). Overall, he was 23-of-28 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick.    Smith's sole score was a flip to Chris Johnson (5 catches, 23 yards), who was actually outgained on the ground by Chris Ivory. Of course, most of Ivory's yardage came on a 71-yard touchdown in which the Raiders seemingly did everything wrong. They tackled each other, plugged the wrong gaps, etc. It was awful, as Ivory should never have gains of 71 yards. Johnson, meanwhile, registered 68 yards on 13 carries. That was more of Oakland struggling than Johnson looking good. This could be his best performance of the season.    Only 1 Jet was targeted more than 5 times. That would be Eric Decker, who hauled in 5 of the 6 balls thrown his way for 74 yards. As mentioned, QBDK missed him for a touchdown.   "

Ivory was the better runner overall, as nearly half of Johnson's yards came on 1 47-yard dash. It was an impressive play, but it epitomized his performance on the field over the past few years: some flash, but absolutely no substance.    The Dolphins prevailed, but don't tell Jon Gruden that. After Miami intercepted Smith to pull through, Gruden exclaimed, A huge signature win for the Jets!

   "comment":"Eric Decker, who beat Cortland Finnegan. Chris Ivory was then wide open for a touchdown when he leaked out of the backfield. The bewildered Dolphins didn't look like they knew what hit them, and it wouldn't get any better. The Jets generated 494 net yards of offense and gained a whopping 8 yards per play. Smith finished 20-of-25 for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a fumble that occurred because of terrible ball security. Granted, the Dolphins were extremely lethargic, but Smith had an amazing performance. Perhaps it'll give the Jets some optimism that he can turn into a decent quarterback with some good offensive coaching. They better hope so, as they'll probably be out of position to take either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as you can see in my .    It helped Smith that Eric Decker came alive. The former Bronco didn't produce numbers anywhere close to what he posted in Denver, but his season finale was exceptional. He caught 10 of the 11 targets thrown his way for a whopping 221 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught a number of deep bombs, including a 74-yarder where he easily beat coverage, and a 50-yarder, which he snagged over "

   "comment":"Eric Decker went for about 25 yards. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick found Decker wide open in the end zone to give New York a 7-3 lead. Promptly, Bortles had a deflected pass intercepted by Marcus Williams to set up the Jets at the 32-yard line. A 4.h-and-3 was converted by Fitzpatrick to Decker, and Chris Ivory scored on a third-and-1. The Jaguars moved the ball into Jets territory in the final seconds and Bortles made a beautiful throw to Allen Hurns for a 30-yard touchdown after beating Antonio Cromartie. The Jets took a 14-10 lead into the locker room. Bortles led a field goal drive in the third quarter before Fitzpatrick hit a wide-open Jeff Cumberland for a 44-yard gain. A screen to Ivory went for 16 yards to the Jaguars' 1-yard line, and he plunged into the end zone 2 plays later. In the 4.h quarter, Bortles got going by hitting Allen Robinson for a 44-yard pass after he beat Darrelle Revis to get open before catching the pass with Marcus Williams all over him. A 16-yard pass to Hurns set up a Jacksonville field goal. The Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, and Bortles threw a 27-yard pass to Marcedes Lewis, and Yeldon ripped off a 45-yard run to get into Jets territory. However, Bortles was strip-sacked by Calvin Pace, who recovered the fumble for New York. Jacksonville's defense forced a punt, but muffed the punt, and Kellen Davis recovered for New York at the Jaguars' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Brandon Marshall made a phenomenal, diving, 20-yard touchdown catch. Quickly, Bortles ripped the ball down the field before throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Walters. Marshall recovered the onside kick. Ivory fumbled a third-down run, but was extremely lucky that Marshall recovered that loose ball as well. With a minute remaining, the Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, but Bortles threw a pick to Marcus Williams to end the game.    Blake Bortles completed 24-of-40 passes for 381 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Bortles played well with a lot of excellent reads and throws. He's vastly improved this season.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 64 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 37 yards. His offensive line struggled to open holes.    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 121 yards, and Allen Hurns logged 5 catches for 122 yards and a score. Robinson and Hurns outplayed New York's veteran corner tandem of Revis and Cromartie. Julius Thomas (3-14) didn't do much for Jacksonville.    Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 21-of-34 for 272 yards with 2 touchdowns. At less than 100 percent with his hand injury, Fitzpatrick was a huge upgrade for New York compared to last week.    Chris Ivory had only 26 yards on 23 carries with 2 touchdowns on the ground and 3 receptions for 22 yards. The Jaguars' front 7 was excellent against the run.    Eric Decker tallied 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars really struggled to cover Decker. Brandon Marshall (4-44-1) had some clutch plays in the 4.h quarter to lift the Jets to a win.    Jets safety Marcus Williams was huge with his 2 interceptions and half of a sacks.
