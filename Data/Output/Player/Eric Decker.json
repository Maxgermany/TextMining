   "comment":"Decker 21-yard apparent catch that was overturned after a Pittsburgh challenge.    Tebow finished 10-of-21 for 316 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 50 rushing yards and a third score on the ground. If you were unfortunate enough to miss this contest, Tebow was simply amazing. He was really accurate downfield, including 1 pass in which he made a perfect back-shoulder throw. He went through his progressions like any good quarterback. He showed great pocket awareness. And of course, he ran when needed to, displaying his trademark rushing ability. The Broncos led throughout, beginning in the second quarter, but it looked like they might lose this playoff battle late in the 4.h quarter and overtime. The ironic thing was it would have been everyone's fault but Tebow's. Willis McGahee (19-61) fumbled at midfield prior to Pittsburgh's game-tying drive. The defense struggled to stop a hobbled Ben Roethlisberger, including Champ Bailey, who dropped an interception that went right through his hands right before Big Ben hit Jerricho Cotchery for the tying score.    @HunterAnsley tweeted, Josh McDaniels, the easiest target for lazy NFL fans, drafted both players that just won that game. Pretty crazy, huh? Thomas was amazing despite the aforementioned drop, catching 4 balls for 204 yards and the 80-yard decisive touchdown, torching corner Ike Taylor all evening. Even crazier is that Tebow and Thomas will have to battle McDaniels next week.    As for the other quarterback, it was clear that Roethlisberger was hobbled by his high ankle sprain in the first 3 quarters, but he finished strong, even showing some nice mobility on a couple of scrambles. Big Ben went 22-of-40 for 289 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.    Five Steelers caught at least 5 passes: Emmanuel Sanders (6-81), Antonio Brown (5-70) and Heath Miller (5-60). Mike Wallace barely did anything aerially (3-26) because Bailey shut him down, but he was able to score a rushing touchdown on the 1-yard line.    Pittsburgh had so many injuries in this contest. Ryan Clark, Maurkice Pouncey and Rashard Mendenhall were out. Max Starks, Casey Hampton and Brett Keisel all left with various maladies. Save for Mendenhall's absence (Isaac Redman rushed for 121 yards on 17 carries), all of the injuries were felt. There was a botched snap in the second quarter. Roethlisberger was often pressured (5 sacks), while the Steeler defense accumulated no sacks and no turnovers. And of course, Tebow beat the Broncos deep in overtime - a play that perhaps may not have resulted in a touchdown if Clark were there.    A quick word on the officiating in this contest: It was putrid. I don't know how the officials were able to overturn Decker's completion in which the wideout sprained his MCL because it wasn't anywhere close to being conclusive. A more egregious blown call was a clear Pittsburgh lateral that John Fox couldn't challenge for some strange reason. And then there were multiple blatant face masks that the Steelers got away with. I was so frustrated on the forums that I half-joked that the Pittsburgh players were idiots for calling tails during the overtime coin toss because it was clear the ref had a 2.headed coin.

   "comment":"Decker was awesome as he dominated Kansas City's secondary. The Chiefs got the ball moving on their opening drive with a 24-yard completion to Dwayne Bowe to move the ball inside the 15. After a completion to Anthony Fasano (3-28) moved the ball to the 2. Smith rolled out and threw the ball right to Wesley Woodyard for an interception in the end zone. Peyton Manning gave it right back when he threw a floater downfield that was batted around before Quentin Demps controlled the ball for a pick. Smith came back to hit Junior Hemingway (3-42) for a 17-yard score. The Broncos answered with a 34-yard screen pass to Knowshon Moreno. Manning then threw a perfect strike on a deep post to Decker for a 41-yard touchdown. Decker beat "

   "comment":"Decker and Knowshon Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past 3 weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does 10. to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him 4 away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish 1 to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on 8 carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on 3 tries.    As mentioned, Caldwell was the 1 who found the end zone on both occasions, leaving Demaryius Thomas (4-45), Julius Thomas (4-49) and Decker (2-42) with meager numbers.    Denver's defense, meanwhile, couldn't do anything right. This includes... - Stopping the run. "

   "comment":"Decker was clearly bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds, but the officials didn't want to ruin history - he still managed to come back and throw a final score to Thomas to officially pass his arch rival on the all-time list. Thanks to his final stat line - 32-of-51, 400 yards and 4 touchdowns - Manning is now 265 yards shy of Drew Brees' single-season record for passing yardage. He should be able to eclipse that mark as well; the Raiders will offer very little resistance next week, and Manning will have to play because the Patriots beat the Ravens, meaning Denver will have to triumph in Week 17 to secure homefield advantage, barring a New England loss to Buffalo.    However, all of this should be irrelevant. Manning has posted records and earned regular-season MVPs before, yet he's often come up short in the playoffs. His 2013 campaign will ultimately be measured by how successful he is beyond Week 17, meaning what happened in the first quarter of this contest is far more significant than Manning's flurry of touchdowns late in the game. On Houston's second possession, Von Miller went down with a knee injury. He would eventually walk off on his own power, but the Denver Post reported that the Broncos fear that the star linebacker tore his ACL. Miller will undergo tests on Monday. If he's out for the playoffs, it's highly unlikely that Manning will earn his second Super Bowl ring. As great as Manning has been this season, he probably won't be able to win if 1 of the league's best defensive players is sidelined.    Miller's absence didn't have much of an impact on this contest because Matt Schaub was just so completely inept. Schaub failed to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-37 for 176 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Schaub was a mess. He missed an open Andre Johnson (4-63) for a touchdown in the first half. One of his picks was completely lazy, as he tried to force something that just wasn't there while rolling out of the pocket. He also fumbled following intermission, but his tight end, Ryan Griffin (5-66), pounced on the ball.    Manning wasn't the only player to make history in this game. Andre Johnson became just the second player in NFL history to log 100-plus receptions in 5 or more seasons. Wes Welker was the first.    The Texans couldn't run the ball at all without Ben Tate. Dennis Johnson started, but did nothing, mustering just 29 yards on 12 carries.    Some stats/facts for the Broncos: - Manning wasn't picked, but Houston safety Shiloh Keo nearly had 2 interceptions. One was thrown right to his hands in the end zone, but he just dropped it. - Manning's aforementioned 4 touchdowns went to Decker (10-131), Demaryius Thomas (8-123) and Julius Thomas (6-78)."

   "comment":"Decker for a touchdown on a trick play. All of this was just in the first half. The Jets were much cleaner following intermission. Smith made just 1 mistake, as he took a bad sack to put the team out of field-goal range. He was otherwise flawless, completing every single pass in the second half (8-of-8, 67 yards). Overall, he was 23-of-28 for 221 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick.    Smith's sole score was a flip to Chris Johnson (5 catches, 23 yards), who was actually outgained on the ground by Chris Ivory. Of course, most of Ivory's yardage came on a 71-yard touchdown in which the Raiders seemingly did everything wrong. They tackled each other, plugged the wrong gaps, etc. It was awful, as Ivory should never have gains of 71 yards. Johnson, meanwhile, registered 68 yards on 13 carries. That was more of Oakland struggling than Johnson looking good. This could be his best performance of the season.    Only 1 Jet was targeted more than 5 times. That would be Eric Decker, who hauled in 5 of the 6 balls thrown his way for 74 yards. As mentioned, QBDK missed him for a touchdown.   "

   "comment":"Decker pulled his hamstring. Smith finished 6-of-18 for just 73 yards after intermission. Of course, you may have seen the most controversial play of this game when a tying Smith touchdown to Jeremy Kerley was nullified by an illegal timeout called by Marty Mornhinweg. Rex Ryan, who is the only person who could've called a timeout from the Jets' sideline, was completely befuddled that the score was wiped out. He didn't even find out until during the post-game press conference that Mornhinweg was the 1 who requested the stoppage. Ryan isn't faultless though. He made some blunders of his own, as he had to waste timeouts in the second half for having too many men on the field. Those errors go along with Muhammad Wilkerson's ejection for throwing 2 punches. Meanwhile, Smith got away with a couple of turnovers after intermission. Smith nearly threw an interception, and he also appeared to heave a backward pass that was inexplicably ruled an incompletion. The reversal even had CBS ref Mike Carey perplexed.    Smith missed Decker, who snagged a team-high 4 balls for 63 yards and Smith's lone aerial touchdown. When Decker left the game, Smith had to focus on Kerley and his mediocre tight ends. It's no surprise that New York's offense was stymied against a porous defense in the second half.    "

He was able to enter the game later in the 4.h quarter, but it was too late by then. Still, it was a reminder of how brittle QBDK is, and why teams simply can't rely on him to be a starter. Simms, by the way, did nothing in QBDK's absence, going 3-of-8 for 39 yards.    "

Ivory was the better runner overall, as nearly half of Johnson's yards came on 1 47-yard dash. It was an impressive play, but it epitomized his performance on the field over the past few years: some flash, but absolutely no substance.    The Dolphins prevailed, but don't tell Jon Gruden that. After Miami intercepted Smith to pull through, Gruden exclaimed, A huge signature win for the Jets! Thanks for paying attention to the game, Gruden. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

The bewildered Dolphins didn't look like they knew what hit them, and it wouldn't get any better. The Jets generated 494 net yards of offense and gained a whopping 8 yards per play. Smith finished 20-of-25 for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns. His only blemish on the afternoon was a fumble that occurred because of terrible ball security. Granted, the Dolphins were extremely lethargic, but Smith had an amazing performance. Perhaps it'll give the Jets some optimism that he can turn into a decent quarterback with some good offensive coaching. They better hope so, as they'll probably be out of position to take either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as you can see in my 2015 NFL Mock Draft.    It helped Smith that Eric Decker came alive. The former Bronco didn't produce numbers anywhere close to what he posted in Denver, but his season finale was exceptional. He caught 10 of the 11 targets thrown his way for a whopping 221 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught a number of deep bombs, including a 74-yarder where he easily beat coverage, and a 50-yarder, which he snagged over "

   "comment":"Decker were ruled out, leaving only Brandon Marshall for Ryan Fitzpatrick to work with. As a result, the Jets achieved their second first down of the game after the 2-minute warning right before halftime. Fitzpatrick went 35-of-58 for only 283 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. All of Fitzpatrick's picks came in the second half, as he was trying desperately to lead his team back. One interception made by second-round rookie Eric Rowe, who had fantastic coverage. Fitzpatrick was also betrayed by some drops from Quincy Enunwa, but he needs to be blamed, as he missed several opportunities, including 1 where he had Devin Smith wide open for a touchdown in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick simply missed him.    With Decker out, it's not a surprise that Brandon Marshall dominated the targets. Fourteen balls went his way, and he caught 10 of them for 109 yards and a touchdown. Marshall, however, had 1 of the dumbest plays of the year, when he foolishly tried to lateral to no 1 in particular while being tackled. Marshall was charged with a fumble as a consequence. Toward the end of the game, he dropped a pass that was tipped and intercepted. Marshall's stat line was great, and he'll continue to produce, but he cost his team a potential victory with those 2 errors.    Other notables in the New York passing game: "

   "comment":"Decker fumbled on the Jets' first offensive play, leading to a Washington touchdown. The other starting wideout, Brandon Marshall, was then guilty of a fumble of his own when Bashaud Breeland ripped the ball out of his hands, with the help of a Keenan Robinson hit, to force a fumble. That wasn't Breeland's only turnover of the opening half; he also caught an interception that bounced off Marshall's hands. The Redskins, despite missing 3 starters on their offensive line, were leading 13-10 in the third quarter. However, the turnovers stopped coming in, as New York took much better care of the football in the second half. Washington, which continued to struggle to move the chains on offense, wilted on the other side of the ball as well, eventually leading to a brutal blowout.    Washington's stop unit made Ryan Fitzpatrick look like a Pro Bowl quarterback. He misfired on just 7 attempts, going 19-of-26 for 253 yards, 2 passing touchdowns and the aforementioned interception, which wasn't his fault. He also scored a third time on the ground, as he scrambled 4 times for 31 rushing yards. Don't think this is a sign of things to come. Fitzpatrick isn't any good, but he was able to benefit by shredding an injury-ravaged defense.    I didn't expect the Redskins to stop the pass very well, but I was shocked that they struggled so much against the run. They came into the afternoon with a top-10 ground defense, but allowed Chris Ivory to burst for 146 yards and a touchdown to go along with 3 catches for 50 receiving yards. Most of his runs were positive, though he was stuffed on what seemed like a crucial third-and-1 on the opening drive of the second half. The Jets ended up kicking a field goal to tie the game at 13. It didn't matter, however, as New York exploded after that.    While Marshall and Decker both made mistakes, they both made their fantasy owners very happy, as each scored a touchdown. Marshall caught 7 balls for 111 yards, while Decker snatched 4 passes for 59 yards. Decker would've enjoyed a better performance had he not dropped 2 throws.    As for the Redskins' offense, they barely could do anything because they were missing their starting left tackle, left guard and center. "

   "comment":"Decker on a crucial third down. He made some gutsy plays - he even opened a giant cut above his nose, which was bleeding for most of the evening, but he's just not a good quarterback. Fitzpatrick finished 26-of-39 for 299 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception, which was a terrible read. To be fair, he endured some drops, including what would've been a 30-yard gain by Brandon Marshall, and he managed to set up Randy Bullock for a game-winning field goal at the very end on a long pass to Kenbrell Thompkins, who beat rookie Byron Jones.    Fitzpatrick's sole aerial score went to Decker (6-55), while Brandon Marshall (4-74) led the team in receiving yardage. Both players missed some action and had to go to the locker room, but they weren't out for very long. Marshall, as mentioned, had a deep drop. Phil Simms claimed that the ball was uncatchable, yet it hit Marshall right in the hands. This, of course, was a conflict of interest, as Simms and Marshall are co-hosts on Inside the NFL. This was yet another example of Simms being absolutely incompetent. Another occasion was when Simms said that the Cowboys were in great hands with "

And amazingly, this came without New York's suspended defensive end Sheldon Richardson. But, the pressure didn't keep Dalton from continuing to connect with A.J. Green.    Ryan Fitzpatrick, on the other hand, couldn't connect on any big passes and finished with a pitiful 5.4 yards per attempt compared to Dalton's 12.2 YPA. When a quarterback is connecting on such short passes, he needs to have a high completion rate, but Fitzpatrick finished the day with just a 54.3 completion percentage compared to Dalton's 76.7.

Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    "
