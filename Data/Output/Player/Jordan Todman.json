Watt put an end to that by burning Luke Joeckel for a strip-sack that was recovered by the Jaguars, and a few plays later, Watt beat a running back for another sack. That forced Jacksonville to settle for a 53-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. Houston moved the ball into Jacksonville territory again, but Keenum threw behind DeAndre Hopkins (2-5). Dwayne Gratz caught a deflection and raced down the field for a 55-yard pick-six. It got worse for the Texans, as Foster went down with an injury and hobbled into the locker room. Even without having to defend Foster (5-23), the Jaguars' defense continued to get gashed, as Houston moved the ball down the field before Alfred Blue (17-39) scored a short touchdown. The Texans took a 14-10 lead into the half. Todman (7-52 rushing, 5-46) got the Jaguars moving in the third quarter with a 34-yard run into Houston territory, but Scobee missed a 51-yard field goal. Keenum and the Texans' offensive line started breaking down as the fill-in signal-caller turned the ball over on a coverage strip-sack by Brian Davis.
