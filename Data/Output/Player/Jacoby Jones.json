   "comment":"Jacoby Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats.Jones and Kevin Walter both stepped up and posted respectable stats. Jones and Walter both had 67 yards on 4 and 5 receptions, respectively.    Gary Kubiak said he was starting Ryan Moats, and he kept his word. Moats had more carries (16) than Slaton (6). Moats also out-gained Slaton, 38-17, and each had a touchdown. As mentioned, Moats ironically cost Houston a fumble.    At halftime, Peyton Manning had some pretty amazing statistics. He was 26-of-40 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Once again, those were halftime numbers. He was on pace for 80 attempts and 484 yards at that point. Fortunately for Manning's rotator cuff, he had just 10 attempts in the second half. He finished 34-of-50, 318 yards, 1 score and 1 pick.    Speaking of amazing numbers, "

He juked Aqib Talib and safety Sean Jones to burst downfield for a 78-yard score. The Buccaneers' offense was ineffective for most of the first half until late in the second quarter. They drove inside the 10-yard line but were stopped on 3 tries. Tampa Bay went for it on 4th-and-2 from the 5-yard line, but "

Jones, but what he did in the final 2-and-a-half minutes capped off a brilliant game. He finished 26-of-44 for 300 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception to along with 36 rushing yards on 5 scrambles (including a 17-yard gain on the final drive). The pick was a poor overthrow, but you can also go the other way and point out that Yates should have had a deep completion on the opening drive that was dropped by Jacoby Jones.

He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy. He was understandably dejected afterward, and Foster looked even more frustrated. You have to feel for the Texans, who would probably be the Super Bowl favorites if Jones, Merril Hoge and Cris Carter would be calling him the worst quarterback of all time after this performance. The difference between Flacco and Tebow though is that the Baltimore quarterback did have time to throw on some occasions, so his performance has to be more discouraging to Raven fans than what Denver supporters feel about their signal-caller. - It doesn't help that Flacco once again had awful play-calling. Cam Cameron idiotically forgot to involve Ray Rice early on. Rice finished with 21 carries, gaining 60 rushing yards in the process, but had just 4 catches. Even worse, Cameron was guilty of some really predictable play-calling at the goal line in the 4.h quarter. He did a good job with this in the first quarter, signaling in a play-action pass from Flacco to Kris Wilson, which resulted in a touchdown, so I don't understand why Cameron went back to stupidity when he could have sealed the deal. No, wait. I do understand what happened. Cameron is just that completely inept. - What happened to Baltimore's run defense? I figured it would be better with Ray Lewis healthy, but Arian Foster managed to rush for 132 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. This made things easier for T.J. Yates. Of course, Yates' turnovers made things easier for the Ravens. Yates went 17-of-35 for 184 yards and 3 interceptions. He could have been picked off on 5 occasions, but Ed Reed dropped 2 interceptions in the first half. Yates' problem wasn't accuracy; in fact, most of his throws were on the money. The issue was that he predetermined where he wanted to go on some of his attempts. He stared down Andre Johnson far too often, including the last real drive of the contest when he foolishly heaved a ball downfield despite being at midfield and having ample time remaining on the clock.    Yates wasn't the only player giving the ball up. Jacoby Jones made 1 of the dumbest plays in NFL history when he picked up a bouncing punt amid traffic. He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy.

   "comment":"Jacoby Jones (2-42). Jones limped off the field in the first quarter. Aaron Rodgers then proceeded to struggle. He targeted Jordy Nelson and Jarrett Boykin a bunch, but those passes fell incomplete because of drops and miscommunications. Rodgers' frustrating afternoon got even worse when Randall Cobb was carted off into the locker room. Suddenly, the only wideouts Rodgers had at his disposal were Nelson and Boykin. But that wasn't it in terms of injuries. Rush linebacker Nick Perry, who had a sack-fumble of Joe Flacco at the very end of the first half to set up a Mason Crosby field goal, had to leave the game. The Packers then had to roll with players named Nate Palmer and Andy Mulumba as its outside linebackers. The defense understandably wasn't the same after that, but the offense made the appropriate adjustments. Rodgers completed fewer than half of his passes prior to intermission and had a pick dropped by Daryl Smith, but was 7-of-11 for 199 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (a great play by Jimmy Smith) after the break. Rodgers ultimately finished 17-of-32 for 315 yards, 1 score and the pick. The stop unit, meanwhile, had some great performances from rookie Micah Hyde and A.J. Hawk (3 sacks).    The Packers may have lost a game like this last year, but they were able to pull out a victory, thanks to Eddie Lacy. The rookie runner was a stud, bulldozing Baltimore's strong ground defense for 120 yards on 23 carries. The Ravens had no answer for him as Green Bay was running out the clock. Lacy even converted a first down and smartly slided down inbounds, which allowed Green Bay to take a couple of knees and walk off the field with its third win of the year.    Nelson, as you may guess, had a solid statistical performance; he had 4 catches for 113 yards and a touchdown. Jermichael Finley (3-75) wasn't much of a factor, as a 52-yard reception of his came when Green Bay was running out the clock.    Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage. This included some red-zone ineptness in the second quarter. Ray Rice was stuffed 3 times inside the 2-yard line. The Ravens eschewed kicking a field goal, so the 3 points obviously would've had a big impact in such a low-scoring affair. It wasn't until garbage time that Baltimore was able to get something going. Most of Flacco's yardage was meaningless. To give you an idea, he was 8-of-19 for 113 yards and a lost fumble by halftime.    Ray Rice couldn't get anything on the ground; he mustered only 34 yards on 14 carries even though the Packers ranked 20th against the run entering this contest in terms of YPC allowed to opposing running backs. This was just a spirited performance by a Green Bay defense that seemed to want to prove that it could still shine without Clay Matthews.    Flacco's touchdowns went to Dallas Clark (4-81) and Jacoby Jones (2-42). "

   "comment":"Jacoby Jones kickoff return and helped slow the speedy Raven down enough to allow Cortez Allen to catch him. Cris Collinsworth indicated that the officials could've ruled a touchdown if they had decided that Jones would have scored if Tomlin hadn't interfered. The refs completely missed it, however. Jones noted afterward that he saw Tomlin, who hurt his chances of scoring. However, he wasn't bitter about it. I probably would've done the same thing if I knew I was back there, Smith said. Down 12 and 8 on 2 separate 4.h-quarter drives, Ben Roethlisberger led his team down the field twice into the end zone. The second score proved to be costly, as Le'Veon Bell collided with Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith and suffered what looked like an ugly concussion. The Steelers also lost center Fernando Velasco in addition to their top 2 offense tackles, so it's quite remarkable that they found the end zone. They missed on the 2.point conversion, however, as Emmanuel Sanders couldn't hold on to the ball on what would've been a tough reception.    Roethlisberger had a solid game, going 28-of-44 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. Despite all of the injuries to the offensive line, he wasn't sacked on a single occasion. He had some vintage Big Ben plays where he navigated the pocket amid pressure and still managed to connect with 1 of his targets downfield. However, he was ultimately betrayed by Sanders (6-43, TD), who had 3 drops, including 2 in the end zone.    Bell also scored once and nearly had a second touchdown on the play in which he suffered a concussion. He actually crossed the goal line, but replay ruled that he was short because his helmet popped off beforehand. Bell finished with 73 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 63 receiving yards. Again, the concussion looked pretty bad, but he'll have 10 days to get cleared for Week 14.    Heath Miller led the Steelers in receptions (8) for 86 yards. Antonio Brown (5-59) didn't have a huge game.    As for the winners, Joe Flacco went 24-of-35 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Not included in these stats are a couple of long pass interferences that his receivers drew. Flacco had a great deep ball going, particularly with Torrey Smith (6-93, TD) and Jacoby Jones (4-53). Smith, however, had 2 drops, including 1 inside the 5-yard line in the 4.h quarter. That 1 looked to be huge because a touchdown instead of a fifth field goal would've iced this game.    Jones kickoff return and helped slow the speedy Raven down enough to allow Cortez Allen to catch him.

He made some nice throws and connected with A.J. Green for a 53-yard scoring bomb, though that pass was underthrown. Dalton did manage to set the franchise single-season record for passing yardage and touchdowns with his numbers, but his struggles shouldn't be lost because they're a huge concern going forward.    Injuries are an issue for Cincinnati as well. Dalton didn't have either of his 2 tight ends in this matchup. He also missed left tackle Anthony Collins in the second half, as Collins left the game with an ankle. The Bengals already had tons of injuries, so they can't afford to see any more players get hurt.    Cincinnati was able to win this game because Joe Flacco had yet another poor outing. Flacco, who already had knee issues, looked like he hurt his shoulder on a first-quarter hit. He was then banged again soon after, and Tyrod Taylor started warming up. Flacco remained under center, but was largely ineffective, going 30-of-50 for only 192 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. One pick was tipped at the line of scrimmage, but the interception that sealed the game was thrown behind his intended target and returned for 6. Flacco also missed an open Jacoby Jones for a touchdown.    Flacco's sole score went to "

   "comment":"Jacoby Jones and DeAngelo Williams.Jones and DeAngelo Williams. The team then went on a tear, scoring 39 unanswered points. Ben Roethlisberger was out of his mind, going 24-of-39 for 364 yards and 4 touchdowns. He nearly had a fifth score midway through the final quarter, but Martavis Bryant dropped a pass that was only slightly high.    Having a strong running game to support Roethlisberger was huge. DeAngelo Williams was fantastic, trampling the Colts for 134 yards on 26 carries. Cris Collinsworth gushed all night at how incredible Williams' vision and cutting ability were. He's not even close to the same running back we saw in Carolina. Williams told the media that he finally figured things out; he's now apparently running with his feet instead of his head. It works, apparently, as Williams ripped off quality run after quality run.    The Colts eventually figured out that they couldn't double team Antonio Brown because they had to dedicate more defenders to stop Williams. Brown went off, snatching 8 of his 11 targets for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brown, who also scored on a punt return, had an amusing celebration after that sequence, when he jumped into the goal post and appeared to injure himself for a split second, but he turned out to be fine. Brown became the 7.h player in league history since the merger to score 2 receiving touchdowns and a punt return since the merger.    Roethlisberger's other touchdowns went to Bryant (4-114) and Markus Wheaton (3-50). Bryant just missed out on a career night; he dropped 2 touchdowns, which was especially painful for me because I had him paired with Roethlisberger in FanDuel. Wheaton, meanwhile, had all of his production in the first half. His score came right after Bryant's first drop.    A bit on the Colts: They didn't stand much of a chance to compete with the Steelers in a shootout. Matt Hasselbeck has beaten some mediocre opponents like the Buccaneers and Falcons, but Pittsburgh was just a different animal. Hasselbeck was exposed, going 16-of-26 for 169 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. One pick occurred because he didn't see Jarvis Jones dropping in coverage in the red zone. The second was a telegraphed throw. Hasselbeck wasn't terrible, but he just gave his team no chance against an elite foe because he's no longer good enough. Fortunately for the Colts, Andrew Luck is due back in Week 15.    Another silver lining for Indianapolis is that "
