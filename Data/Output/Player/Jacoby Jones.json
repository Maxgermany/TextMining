   "comment":"Jacoby Jones made 1 of the dumbest plays in NFL history when he picked up a bouncing punt amid traffic. He predictably fumbled, giving the Ravens a short field and a subsequent touchdown.    Aside from Foster, Johnson was the only Texan to catch more than 2 balls; he racked up 8 receptions for 111, looking extremely healthy. He was understandably dejected afterward, and Foster looked even more frustrated. You have to feel for the Texans, who would probably be the Super Bowl favorites if "

   "comment":"Jacoby Jones kickoff return and helped slow the speedy Raven down enough to allow Cortez Allen to catch him. Cris Collinsworth indicated that the officials could've ruled a touchdown if they had decided that Jones would have scored if Tomlin hadn't interfered. The refs completely missed it, however. Jones noted afterward that he saw Tomlin, who hurt his chances of scoring. However, he wasn't bitter about it. I probably would've done the same thing if I knew I was back there, Smith said. Down 12 and 8 on 2 separate 4.h-quarter drives, Ben Roethlisberger led his team down the field twice into the end zone. The second score proved to be costly, as Le'Veon Bell collided with Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith and suffered what looked like an ugly concussion. The Steelers also lost center Fernando Velasco in addition to their top 2 offense tackles, so it's quite remarkable that they found the end zone. They missed on the 2.point conversion, however, as Emmanuel Sanders couldn't hold on to the ball on what would've been a tough reception.    Roethlisberger had a solid game, going 28-of-44 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. Despite all of the injuries to the offensive line, he wasn't sacked on a single occasion. He had some vintage Big Ben plays where he navigated the pocket amid pressure and still managed to connect with 1 of his targets downfield. However, he was ultimately betrayed by Sanders (6-43, TD), who had 3 drops, including 2 in the end zone.    Bell also scored once and nearly had a second touchdown on the play in which he suffered a concussion. He actually crossed the goal line, but replay ruled that he was short because his helmet popped off beforehand. Bell finished with 73 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 63 receiving yards. Again, the concussion looked pretty bad, but he'll have 10 days to get cleared for Week 14.    Heath Miller led the Steelers in receptions (8) for 86 yards. Antonio Brown (5-59) didn't have a huge game.    As for the winners, Joe Flacco went 24-of-35 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Not included in these stats are a couple of long pass interferences that his receivers drew. Flacco had a great deep ball going, particularly with Torrey Smith (6-93, TD) and Jacoby Jones (4-53). Smith, however, had 2 drops, including 1 inside the 5-yard line in the 4.h quarter. That 1 looked to be huge because a touchdown instead of a fifth field goal would've iced this game.    "
