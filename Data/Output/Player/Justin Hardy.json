  "comment":"Justin Hardy for a touchdown that saw him cram the ball in between 2 defenders in the middle of the end zone. Hardy got his feet down just before going out, and it was a very nice play overall. Ryan's ability in the play-action passing game was great on Sunday as well, and that allowed him to find some success. On his short touchdown pass to Austin Hooper, he got the Cowboys to bite on the run and tossed the ball to the wide-open Hooper. Part of the success was due to the strong play call, but Ryan's ability to sell it helped the team to succeed. Overall, Ryan went 22-of-29 for 215 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. The pick wasn't entirely his fault, as it was tipped in the air by his receiver. The numbers aren't terrific, but Ryan looked closer to the quarterback who nearly won the Super Bowl last year in this contest. He may be limited by Steve Sarkisian's mediocre play calling most weeks, but maybe this will give Ryan some momentum going forward.    Thanks to Ryan's success, the Falcons' receiving attack was able to support multiple players on Sunday. His top targets were Julio Jones (6-57) and Hooper (6-49, 1 TD). Jones was able to beat the Dallas defensive backs easily and made some nice grabs throughout the day. Ryan did spread the ball around a lot though, which limited Jones' upside. Still, he is a WR1 most weeks, and at the worst, he is a very high-end WR2. Hooper continued to have an up-and-down season in this contest. He was able to find space over the middle of the field with Sean Lee out, and that's where he generated a lot of his yardage. It's hard to trust Hooper as a TE1, but he can be streamed depending on the matchup. Elsewhere in the passing game, Taylor Gabriel (3-58) had a nice day thanks to his speed, while Justin Hardy caught Ryan's second touchdown.    On the ground, the Falcons had to make a quick adjustment very early in the contest. On his second carry, ",
