In other words, Tampa had life, but it was still in the ICU.    Raheem Morris needs to be fired. The Buccaneers flat-out quit on him. Some of the NFL Network analysts believed that was because of the news that broke this week about Morris perhaps being fired, but the team has been mailing it in since losing to the Packers. The players are just taking after their leader. Morris doesn't work nearly as hard as other head coaches. Thus, it's no surprise that the team often quits and gets whistled for stupid penalties.

Brees answered with a 56-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham in blown coverage by Watson. The Bucs struggled to cover Graham (10-179) throughout the afternoon, so he had a monster game. Graham was deadly in the first half and came up clutch in the final minute. He had another catch down to the 1.yard line, but Tampa Bay put together a goal-line stand with a 4.h-and-goal stop just before halftime. New Orleans was up 13-7 and knocking on the door for more points, when Brees made a terrible pass that was thrown to "
