   "comment":"Jermaine Gresham dropped multiple balls, and the latter allowed a ball to slip through his hands in the end zone. Dalton went 15-of-24 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his numbers would've been so much better if his supporting cast hadn't capsized.    Dalton's scores went to Green, who lost a fumble, and Sanu (5-70). Bernard probably should've been utilized more in the passing game, as he caught just 2 passes. He finished with 62 rushing yards on 13 carries.    I have to vent about Jerome Boger, who is easily the worst official in the NFL. Boger and his crew committed numerous blunders throughout the evening, including: - A horrible illegal contact what wiped out a Revis interception. - Gronkowski was whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty followed a routine helmet tap that you see about 20 times per game. - There was an awful pass interference call on the Bengals following a Brady pass to Danny Amedola. There wasn't even any contact while the pass was in the air. - The Bengals lobbied for an intentional grounding and won their argument about a minute after the play was over. I've never seen an official so easily influenced by players. - Boger flagged the Patriots for a blindside block even though he called the play dead beforehand. That infraction made absolutely no sense. - Boger botched a play toward the end of the first half when he misunderstood the difference between a forward fumble and a lateral during a Patriots' defensive return. - Boger incorrectly ruled a Green touchdown when it was obvious the star wideout was bobbling the ball while falling out of bounds. There were other errors I didn't list. Roger Goodell needs to remove Boger because he's an embarrassment to the NFL.   "
