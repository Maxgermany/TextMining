   "comment":"Gresham dropped multiple balls, and the latter allowed a ball to slip through his hands in the end zone. Dalton went 15-of-24 for 204 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his numbers would've been so much better if his supporting cast hadn't capsized.    Dalton's scores went to Green, who lost a fumble, and Sanu (5-70). Bernard probably should've been utilized more in the passing game, as he caught just 2 passes. He finished with 62 rushing yards on 13 carries.    I have to vent about Jerome Boger, who is easily the worst official in the NFL. Boger and his crew committed numerous blunders throughout the evening, including: - A horrible illegal contact what wiped out a Revis interception. - Gronkowski was whistled for an unsportsmanlike penalty followed a routine helmet tap that you see about 20 times per game. - There was an awful pass interference call on the Bengals following a Brady pass to Danny Amedola. There wasn't even any contact while the pass was in the air. - The Bengals lobbied for an intentional grounding and won their argument about a minute after the play was over. I've never seen an official so easily influenced by players. - Boger flagged the Patriots for a blindside block even though he called the play dead beforehand. That infraction made absolutely no sense. - Boger botched a play toward the end of the first half when he misunderstood the difference between a forward fumble and a lateral during a Patriots' defensive return. - Boger incorrectly ruled a Green touchdown when it was obvious the star wideout was bobbling the ball while falling out of bounds. There were other errors I didn't list. Roger Goodell needs to remove Boger because he's an embarrassment to the NFL.   "

   "comment":"Gresham ran a bad route. However, Dalton had some interceptions dropped, and then he heaved his third on an overthrow, which Buster Skrine wrestled away from the intended target. As mentioned, the Bengals were guilty of many drops, so while Dalton was dreadful, this performance wasn't entirely his fault. Green, who was limited by Haden, let several balls fall through his hand.    I noted that Hill lost a fumble. He had some nice runs otherwise, tallying 55 yards on 12 carries. The Bengals made a huge mistake by limiting Hill's attempts. Even though they were behind early, they should have kept feeding the ball to Hill, as the Browns have struggled against the run all year. Then again, Cincinnati's ground attack wasn't going to be as potent as normal, given that mauler Andre Smith was out. Desmond Bryant took advantage of this, sacking Dalton on back-to-back plays.    Gresham led the Bengals with 29 receiving yards off 3 catches. "

   "comment":"Gresham followed that up with a dropped pass on a third down. Following halftime, safety D.J. Swearinger dropped an easy Ryan interception, giving Atlanta new life. Ryan was able to take the opportunity to pick up a first down on a third-and-10 scramble. And if all that wasn't bad enough, the Cardinals forced a punt, down 24-13 early in the fourth quarter, but Calais Campbell inexplicably lined up offside. The Falcons' drive continued, and was capped off with a touchdown, giving them an insurmountable 31-13 advantage. The Falcons, meanwhile, didn't do anything that impressive, despite their blowout victory. Most of their chunks of offense came on fluky plays, whether they were screen passes to Taylor Gabriel, or Ryan third-down scrambles, or poor pass-interference calls on Patrick Peterson. Again, Atlanta was being outgained in yards per play the entire afternoon, so its offense wasn't as good as Arizona's, and anyone who paid close attention to this game would probably agree.    Ryan finished 26-of-34 for 269 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He played well overall, but wasn't great. Statistics can often be misleading, and that was certainly the case in this instance. Two of Ryan's longest completions, a 35- and a 25-yarder, were short tosses to Gabriel, who did all the work against a sloppy Arizona defense. Ryan's pick wasn't his fault, as it was a Julio Jones bobbled that popped up into the air, but Ryan should've been picked on a couple of other occasions, as referenced earlier. Perhaps his best play was the aforementioned 11-yard scramble on third-and-10 that helped seal the victory.    Gabriel happened to be Atlanta's leading receiver. He caught 4 balls for 75 yards and 2 touchdowns, which came on a combined 60 receiving yards. Gabriel also had a 27-yard rush. It's baffling that the Browns let him go for nothing; Gabriel isn't reliable enough to be a fantasy option, but he's a dynamic weapon to have in an offense, and he'll serve the Falcons well going forward.    Jones, meanwhile, couldn't get much going against Peterson. Arizona's stud corner was unjustly flagged for interference on some occasions, but he managed to limit Jones to 4 grabs for 35 yards. Peterson missed a few plays with an injury and looked somewhat gimpy upon his return, but Jones couldn't take advantage. Meanwhile, Mohamed Sanu caught all 8 of his targets for 65 yards. He was the recipient of a fourth-and-3 conversion on the opening drive.    The Cardinals were able to limit Devonta Freeman for the most part, though he had some nice bursts late in the game when Arizona's effort level went down. Freeman gained 60 yards and 2 touchdowns on 16 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, it's baffling to me why David Johnson was given just 13 carries. Don't blame the deficit, as this was a close affair for 2-and-a-half quarters, and Johnson had just 10 rushes at halftime. Johnson gained 58 yards on those 13 attempts. He did catch 8 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown, but Bruce Arians has to be downgraded for this silly game plan, given that the Falcons have been proven to be soft up the middle.    While Johnson carried just 13 times, a decrepit Carson Palmer aired the ball out on 45 occasions despite continued poor pass protection; 21 times in the first half. Again, Arians is looking more clueless each week. Palmer went 25-of-45 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers don't look horrible until factoring in the fact that Atlanta was missing top cornerback Desmond Trufant. Also, 1 of Palmer's scores came in garbage time.    With Trufant out, Larry Fitzgerald was expected to have a big game. That did not happen, as Fitzgerald caught 4 passes for only 53 yards. He was targeted just 4 times for some reason. Fitzgerald opened the game with a crazy, 1-handed grab over Brian Poole, but saw just 3 targets after that. Arians opted to work Gresham (5-35, TD) over the middle of the field instead, which turned out to be yet another mistake. This was just yet another baffling error from Arizona in this game.
