   "comment":"Malcolm Butler that brought Ward off the bench in celebration. Demaryius Thomas, meanwhile, made just 2 catches for 12 yards. He dropped a pass, of course.    It continues to be a mystery why the Broncos continue to waste downs giving Ronnie Hillman the ball. Hillman (11-16) was outgained by C.J. Anderson (16-72) by a wide margin once again. Hillman also lazily didn't try to pick up the ball on Manning's apparent backward pass.    As bad as Hillman was, I'm sure Belichick would've killed to have him on his roster, given how incompetent his running backs were. It was so bad that Brady was the Patriots' leading rusher with 13 yards on 3 scrambles. "

The stats are disappointing for his fantasy owners, but Hopkins did all he could. At 1 point, he made an amazing, back-shoulder grab while falling out of bounds.    Osweiler's other primary targets didn't do much. "

They were stopped at the 1-yard line, with Bernard being stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a 4.h-down try. I keep saying this, but Cincinnati's red-zone offense will improve once Tyler Eifert returns from injury, whenever that may be.   "

That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by "
