   "comment":"Malcolm Butler to come up with an impressive, diving catch, setting up yet another New England score. Taylor then took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, which was followed by a 33-yard punt. The Patriots established a 2.touchdown lead, yet the mistakes continued for the Bills. An illegal formation wiped out a 22-yard "

  "comment":"Malcolm Butler stepped in front of a defender to set up a New England touchdown, and he was also picked on a 4.h-and-1 try while under pressure in the second half. That said, the Jets were screwed at the end of this game, and they should've been able to force overtime. Down 10, they managed to score a touchdown to bring the margin to within 3. but the play was overturned because Austin Seferian-Jenkins bobbled the ball. The officials ruled that Seferian-Jenkins fumbled, resulting in a touchback, but it was clear that the tight end had regained possession. The CBS announcers were irate about this, and I agreed. It should've been a Jet touchdown, and New York should have forced overtime. Of course, the Patriots could have just prevailed in the extra session, but the Jets at least would've had the chance to pull a huge upset.    Brady finished 20-of-38 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better performance, but was hurt by some drops. One of those was by ",
