   "comment":"Kalil was once again anemic. It looked like he just stopped blocking Buffalo linemen in some instances. He surrendered multiple sacks, which disrupted a couple of promising drives. He also negated a Bridgewater 15-yard completion to Chase Ford with an illegal-hands-to-the-face infraction, and he followed that up by surrendering a sack to Jerry Hughes. It's amazing how terrible Kalil has gotten. He needs to be benched.    Bridgewater's sole score, as mentioned, went to Patterson, who managed to catch just 2 passes for 9 yards. Jennings was the team's leading receiver with 6 grabs for 77 yards.    "

   "comment":"Kalil; it's astonishing how the former Pro Bowl left tackle has transformed into 1 of the worst offensive linemen in the NFL. It was so bad that at 1 point, Bridgewater drifted back 25 yards in the pocket on 1 play to avoid pressure. Bridgewater went 18-of-28 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, which was just a desperation heave into the end zone. However, the score occurred after the aforementioned fake punt, as Chicago's defense wasn't prepared.    With Bridgewater struggling with time in the pocket, he couldn't connect with his primary receivers. "
