   "comment":"Ronnie Brown run. Pat White, meanwhile ran for no gain and was incomplete on 1 attempt, missing an open Ted Ginn downfield.    As for Miami's regular offense, the 7 points it put up pretty much speaks for itself. The score could have been a lot closer, but Anthony Fasano fumbled the ball away at the Atlanta 10. In total, the Dolphins had 4 turnovers after coming up with a plus-17 turnover differential last year - a sign that things won't be the same in 2009.    Chad Pennington was 21-of-29, but threw for just 176 yards, which gives him a pretty weak YPA of 6.1. Pennington also had a touchdown and an interception.    Perhaps Miami's greatest mistake was not getting Ronnie Brown involved enough. Despite the fact that Brown averaged 4.3 yards per carry against Atlanta's pedestrian run defense, Brown was given only 10 carries. He also had just 3 receptions for 10 more yards. I understand being scared of Brown wearing down late in the year, but with games coming up against Indianapolis and San Diego, this was 1 the Dolphins had to have.    Another concern the Dolphins suddenly have is pass protection; the Falcons, not known for being able to get after the quarterback consistently, managed 4 sacks on Pennington. "

   "comment":"Ronnie Brown in the second quarter. He was trying to find the end zone on an inside run from the San Francisco 1-yard line. After realizing he would not make it, something froze his brain, prompting a backward pass attempt. He failed according to the refs, and it was ruled a fumble. The turnover basically took 3 points off the board, assuming they attempted and converted an easy field goal from about the 3. After driving the field at will, Philadelphia led only 20-3 at halftime, but should have been up by much more. The 49ers found some offense to start the second half only to watch "

   "comment":"Ronnie Brown, they moved it into range for Nick Novak, who converted to keep the season alive. San Diego, now 9-6, still needs some help to earn 1 of the 2 wild-card spots, but at least it has a chance.    Rivers finished 33-of-54 for 356 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. It was ugly early; Rivers' first pick wasn't too bad, as Perrish Cox had great coverage, but his next 1 was returned for 6. as it was heaved right to Antoine Bethea. Rivers' third interception came after halftime; it was a high throw that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. As mentioned though, Rivers caught fire at the very end to help his team's hopes alive.    Rivers' main targets were Royal (10-94, TD) and Antonio Gates, who had 7 catches for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns. Floyd (4-50) secured the 4.h score. Meanwhile, someone named Dontrelle Inman, who had never caught a pass in the NFL prior to Saturday night, logged 7 receptions for 79 yards, stepping in for an injured Keenan Allen, as well as an ineffective Seyi Ajirotutu following halftime. Inman's numbers included a key grab on 4.h-and-10 of the final drive of regulation. He's worth picking up in dynasty formats.    With Ryan Mathews out, the Chargers utilized a 3.headed platoon at running back, with Branden Oliver leading the way. He paced the team in rushing with 53 yards on 13 carries and also had 3 catches for 28 receiving yards. He had some nice spurts where he avoided 49er defenders, but the Chargers went with Ronnie Brown (7-33) when the game was on the line. "
