   "comment":"Ronnie Brown run. Pat White, meanwhile ran for no gain and was incomplete on 1 attempt, missing an open Ted Ginn downfield.    As for Miami's regular offense, the 7 points it put up pretty much speaks for itself. The score could have been a lot closer, but Anthony Fasano fumbled the ball away at the Atlanta 10. In total, the Dolphins had 4 turnovers after coming up with a plus-17 turnover differential last year - a sign that things won't be the same in 2009.    Chad Pennington was 21-of-29, but threw for just 176 yards, which gives him a pretty weak YPA of 6.1. Pennington also had a touchdown and an interception.    Perhaps Miami's greatest mistake was not getting Ronnie Brown involved enough. Despite the fact that Brown averaged 4.3 yards per carry against Atlanta's pedestrian run defense, Brown was given only 10 carries. He also had just 3 receptions for 10 more yards. I understand being scared of Brown wearing down late in the year, but with games coming up against Indianapolis and San Diego, this was 1 the Dolphins had to have.    Another concern the Dolphins suddenly have is pass protection; the Falcons, not known for being able to get after the quarterback consistently, managed 4 sacks on Pennington. Brown run.

   "comment":"Ronnie Brown (4-7) didn't see much action - obviously a major disappointment to the 1 person on this planet who thought the Eagles would utilize a 2.back offense.   Brown missed a 47-yard field goal in the third quarter. - Bradford missed an open Amendola for a touchdown at the end of the third quarter.    Bradford's overall numbers were 17-of-30 for 188 yards, with a hidden 42 yards that he essentially threw for on a pass interference penalty off a beautiful play fake. As indicated, he was betrayed by his awful receivers. The offensive line also struggled to protect him.    As for the Eagles, QB Dog Killer once again had issues reading the blitz, and he had to use his scrambling ability (10-98) to get out of trouble. His passing numbers weren't very good (14-of-32, 187 yards, 2 TDs). He was fortunate not to have an interception when he forced a ball to DeSean Jackson (6-102, TD) into double coverage early on.    Jeremy Maclin had just 1 reception for 20 yards. I hope you took my advice and sat him; he needs to play himself into game shape.    LeSean McCoy scored twice, rushing for 122 yards on 15 carries in the process. Ronnie Brown (4-7) didn't see much action - obviously a major disappointment to the 1 person on this planet who thought the Eagles would utilize a 2.back offense.   "

   "comment":"Ronnie Brown, they moved it into range for Nick Novak, who converted to keep the season alive. San Diego, now 9-6, still needs some help to earn 1 of the 2 wild-card spots, but at least it has a chance.    Rivers finished 33-of-54 for 356 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. It was ugly early; Rivers' first pick wasn't too bad, as Perrish Cox had great coverage, but his next 1 was returned for 6. as it was heaved right to Antoine Bethea. Rivers' third interception came after halftime; it was a high throw that occurred because he couldn't step into his throw. As mentioned though, Rivers caught fire at the very end to help his team's hopes alive.    Rivers' main targets were Royal (10-94, TD) and Antonio Gates, who had 7 catches for 92 yards and 2 touchdowns. Floyd (4-50) secured the 4.h score. Meanwhile, someone named Dontrelle Inman, who had never caught a pass in the NFL prior to Saturday night, logged 7 receptions for 79 yards, stepping in for an injured Keenan Allen, as well as an ineffective Seyi Ajirotutu following halftime. Inman's numbers included a key grab on 4.h-and-10 of the final drive of regulation. He's worth picking up in dynasty formats.    With Ryan Mathews out, the Chargers utilized a 3.headed platoon at running back, with Branden Oliver leading the way. He paced the team in rushing with 53 yards on 13 carries and also had 3 catches for 28 receiving yards. He had some nice spurts where he avoided 49er defenders, but the Chargers went with Ronnie Brown (7-33) when the game was on the line.
