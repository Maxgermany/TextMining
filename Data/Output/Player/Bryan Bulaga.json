With barely any time to throw, Rodgers went 15-of-28 for 151 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The pick was a killer, as it occurred in the end zone when it appeared as though the Packers would get back into it in the second quarter. Rodgers foolishly forced the issue, heaving a ball that had no chance of being caught. Rodgers later had some turnovers in the second half. He fumbled thrice, losing 2 of them. Both were returned for scores.    In addition to poor blocking, Rodgers also didn't get any sort of help from his wideouts. "
