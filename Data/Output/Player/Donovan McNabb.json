   "comment":"Donovan McNabb. They're never going to win a Super Bowl, and I have to wonder if that combination will ever make the playoffs again. McNabb began the game 1-of-5 for zero yards, as the Eagles mustered just a single yard in the first quarter. McNabb finished with 339 yards and a score, but tossed 3 interceptions, including 2 in the red zone at the end of the first half, 1 of which led to a Bengals touchdown. McNabb's afternoon could have been a lot worse. He nearly launched 3 other picks, including 1 in his own territory in overtime, which would have given the Bengals a sure-fire field goal for the victory. McNabb has to go. The Eagles need to start Kevin Kolb. McNabb isn't a bad quarterback, by any means, but he's never been able to reach his potential because Andy Reid stuck him in the wrong system. McNabb is not a West Coast quarterback. Reid, meanwhile, is extremely clueless and overwhelmed in close games, which would explain why he's just 1-8-1 in contests decided by 4 points or less dating back to the 2006 playoffs. Reid never makes the right choices - he went for it on 4.h-and-one, converted, and then decided to kick on 4.h-and-one just 10 yards closer, even though he had an easy field goal in both instances - and he's indecisive, which leads to unwarranted timeouts and delay-of-game penalties. To top it off, many of the Eagles players said after the game that they weren't aware that the contest could end in a tie. How could they not know!? This is just a microcosm of how stupid the Eagles are most of the time. Reid has to go. The only reason he hasn't been fired yet is because owner Jeffrey Lurie is friends with him, and is content with staying competitive. Winning a Super Bowl apparently is a secondary concern for Lurie. Selling tickets and merchandise always seems to come first.    At any rate, "

It's nice and everything, but it's meaningless if the Eagles don't win their next 4 to give themselves a shot at the postseason.    Saying this as a citizen of Philadelphia, the people in this city should be embarrassed of themselves. McNabb got off to a hot start, completing his first 6 passes and jumping out to a 14-0 lead. He finally misfired on a third-and-13, yet people began booing. I'm sorry, but that's pretty ridiculous. Show a little class, people.    Speaking of McNabb, could his benching have been a blessing in disguise? I haven't seen McNabb run willingly so often in years. The stats don't show it (4 carries, 24 yards) but he helped the offense out by picking up multiple first downs on the ground. From a passing standpoint, McNabb was prolific, going 27-of-39 for 260 yards and 4 touchdowns. McNabb located "

He made some nice throws, saw 4 passes dropped and scampered for a 17-yard gain, but also had some bad misfires. Dallas' defense is really good, so it's hard to really blame him. Overall, it was a good debut for the former Eagle.    It was all "

   "comment":"Donovan McNabb's return to Philadelphia. What would the fan reaction be? Would McNabb torch the Eagles' secondary? And how would QB Dog Killer stack up against Philadelphia's previous quarterback? Well, the crowd predictably cheered McNabb in pre-game announcements, but booed him on the field; McNabb himself was very mediocre; and QB Dog Killer would suffer a rib injury on a play that didn't even count. The end result was an ugly 17-12 snooze fest.    McNabb went 8-of-19 for 125 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. It was a mixed back for McNabb; he made some great throws, but missed some wide-open receivers on other passes. What McNabb did well was scramble for multiple first downs, finishing with 39 rushing yards on 5 runs.    "

   "comment":"Donovan McNabb? That seems like a long time ago. This Washington squad looks more like the miserable 4-12 team that completely humiliated itself on national TV on a couple of occasions late last year. This game was over by halftime, with New York owning a 28-0 lead early in the third quarter and 102-yard edge by intermission.    The Redskins looked completely helpless to stop New York's ground attack; Brandon Jacobs (8-103, 2 TDs) and Ahmad Bradshaw (25-97, 2 TDs) both had monstrous performances.    With the Giants owning a big lead throughout, Eli Manning didn't have to do much. Manning went 15-of-25 for 161 yards and an interception. Derek Hagan was his top receiver (7-65).    Donovan McNabb, meanwhile, was dreadful yet again. He went 26-of-44 for 296 yards, a late touchdown and 2 interceptions. He also fumbled thrice. McNabb had a couple of other potential picks that were dropped, so his afternoon could have been much worse.    McNabb's garbage-time score went to "

In the first half Peterson ran for 83 yards on 15 carries with 2 short touchdown runs. Peterson also had a fumble, but it was recovered by Minnesota. Gerhart had 36 yards on 2 carries with 1 reception for 42 yards. At halftime, McNabb completed 11-of-17 passes for 153 yards with no interceptions or touchdowns. McNabb had a good run for a first down to extend the Vikings' second touchdown drive. He did a good job as a game manager early, but couldn't come up with needed plays in clutch time in the second half. At halftime, Minnesota had a 17-0 lead. Peterson, McNabb and Vikings were slow to move the ball in the second half. Peterson had only 9 yards rushing on 4 carries in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Minnesota had a field goal drive, but the offense didn't do enough to seal the win for the Vikings and that let the Bucs offense pull out a comeback.    Peterson ran for 120 yards on 25 carries with 2 touchdowns. McNabb completed 16-of-27 passes for 193 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Wide receiver "
