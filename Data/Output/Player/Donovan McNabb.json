   "comment":"Donovan McNabb. It's really amazing. The Giants have zero sacks in 3 games against Philadelphia. In the other 14 contests this season, they accumulated 42 sacks.    Because he didn't take a sack, McNabb was able to put together a solid performance against a very tough Giants defense. McNabb was 22-of-40 for 217 yards, 2 touchdowns (1 rushing, 1 passing) and 2 picks. One of McNabb's interceptions was on a tipped ball, while the other came on a desperate throw on third-and-long, which basically ended up being a long punt. Perhaps McNabb's best play was rolling out of the pocket and hooking up for a 21-yard gain with McNabb. It's really amazing. The Giants have zero sacks in 3 games against Philadelphia.
