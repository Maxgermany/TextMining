   "comment":"Colton Schmidt just dropped the snap. The punter went to kick the ball and just dropped it before he swung his leg. As a result, he picked it up and somehow ran it 15 yards for the first down. Had that not happened, the Patriots would have gotten the ball deep in Bills territory with a big chance to pull away. The other weird play came on a designed halfback pass. "
