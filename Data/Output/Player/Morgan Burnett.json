   "comment":"Burnett, and then he fumbled, but was fortunate to have 1 of his teammates recover. Manning eventually put together a touchdown drive to get a back-door push, but it wasn't nearly enough to make up for all of his early mistakes. Manning finished 18-of-35 for 199 yards, a touchdown and a lost fumble, and even those ugly stats were helped by garbage time; Manning was 6-of-16 for 87 yards in the opening half. I don't know what's going on with him, and the poor play of the offensive line didn't help, but he looks like he's mentally checked out. The Giants need to begin scouting quarterbacks for a successor in the very near future. Here's a list of our 2017 NFL Draft Quarterback Prospect Rankings.    Beckham hauled in Manning's garbage-time touchdown. He ended up with 5 catches for 56 yards. He could've had a much better evening had Manning not endured woeful accuracy issues. The good news is that Beckham appeared to be in good spirits, as he jokingly kissed the kicking net after he scored.    The Giants had only 1 other player who caught more than 2 passes; "

   "comment":"Burnett on the first drive, and the stud safety was sorely missed, especially in the 4.h quarter when his teammates were worn down. Linemen David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga were also banged up, but they remained in the game (Bakhtiari missed a series). The Packers will need both Burnett and Nelson back for next week's contest in Atlanta.    Cook was the big hero for the Packers for his spectacular catch. Cook was huge, logging 6 catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. He was guilty of a drop to negate a long gain, but he more than made up for it on the final drive. Adams finished with 5 catches for 76 yards, ranking second in yardage. He could've had a better day had the Cowboys not been constantly guilty of tugging on his jersey and not being called for it. "
