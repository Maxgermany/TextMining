   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell with his opposite hand. Roethlisberger's passes weren't even close. He overthrew Bell. He was almost pick-sixed by Patrick Robinson. He flung an interception on a deep shot toward the end zone. He was nearly picked on another high attempt. In the second half, he missed an open Heath Miller for a touchdown and then made a terrible decision to throw late across his body for another near-interception, and he was picked off on a second occasion when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on Drew Brees that allowed the Saints to keep a drive alive. Give the Saints credit for taking advantage of the Steelers' injuries and errors. They didn't have a promising start though, as Marques Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson. Despite all of that, New Orleans snapped out of its funk, and Brees was able to torch Pittsburgh's sorry secondary by going 19-of-27 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns.    All of Brees' touchdowns went to different players, with Stills (5-162) leading the team in receiving. Stills' score was a 69-yarder in which he beat Ike Taylor, who was making his return from injury, with a double move. Marques Colston (3-16), Nick Toon, Ben Watson and Erik Lorig all found the end zone, with the former atoning for 2 drops. Jimmy Graham inexplicably didn't draw a single target. He didn't get hurt; the Steelers just made sure he wouldn't beat them, double- and triple-teaming him on every single play.    The Steelers couldn't stop the run at all. Mark Ingram made up for a couple of poor outings by gashing Pittsburgh for 122 yards on 23 carries.    Some random notes for the Steelers: - Le'Veon Bell was outgained on the ground by Ingram - 21 carries, 95 rushing yards, 1 touchdown - but he atoned for it by catching 8 balls for a whopping 159 receiving yards. With Roethlisberger limited, he had no choice but to dump the ball off to Bell. - Antonio Brown scored twice, though both touchdowns came in garbage time. He finished with 8 receptions for 97 yards. - Heath Miler drew 14 targets. He snatched 8 of them for 82 yards. - Brett Kiesel is believed to have torn his tricep in this loss. He's done for the season if his Monday MRI confirms it.   "

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell run, but Roethlisberger's fantasy owners may have lost their championship because of Miller and Brown's miscues. The 1 potential dark cloud over this victory was that Roethlisberger injured his knee on his touchdown to Brown, but that may not be much of a big deal because he ran into the locker room to get treated. Roethlisberger was also nearly guilty of a fumble, but the call was turned into an incompletion after replay, though it appeared as though he indeed lost the ball.    I mentioned that Brown eventually reached the end zone. He tied Miller for the team in lead in receptions, barely outgaining the tight end, 72-68. Brown and Miller were the only Steelers to record more than 2 receptions.    I was shocked that Bell didn't expose Kansas City's league-worst run defense. I thought there was a chance he'd eclipse 200 yards and perhaps challenge for the single-game record. Instead, he mustered only 63 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. He didn't have a run longer than 7 yards.    Meanwhile, the Chiefs, as mentioned, struggled in the red zone, but "

The bad news for Bell's fantasy backers were his zero targets, which somehow led to zero receptions, which is the first time Bell has ever gone catchless in a game.    Pittsburgh pass defensed a whopping 8 passes, which shows you not only how swarming the Steelers were, but also how Palmer was not always on target. He ended up completing 29-of-45 passes for 421 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.    The Steelers are amazingly 2-1 while Ben Roethlisberger has been out, and they probably should have won that Thursday night game against the Ravens. When Roethlisberger does return, this offense is going to be crazy good, and their defense has seemed to step up during Roethlisberger's absence as well.

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell suffering a second-quarter injury was brutal. Pittsburgh couldn't move the ball whatsoever after that, costing me 2 units. Blegh.    Ben Roethlisberger returned from his MCL sprain and 4 weeks on the sideline to lead the Steelers down the field on their opening drive, completing 4-of-5 passes for 80 yards and a 1-yard pass touchdown to Antonio Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.    After that initial drive, this game was a defensive struggle, with interceptions and field goals dominating until the 4.h quarter. Andy Dalton had his worst game of the season, completing 23-of-38 passes (60.5 percent) for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.    The only real connection Dalton was on target with all game was A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, "

On the day, the 2 teams accumulated 21 penalties for 193 yards, which is slightly less than the Raiders last week, but still too much for most football games.    At any rate, another field goal and then a blocked punt for a touchdown put the Ravens in control 21-0 with just 13 minutes left in the game. That's when Pittsburgh's offense finally woke up.

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell and then a 3-yard touchdown pass to Eli Rogers to put Pittsburgh up 12-3 right before the first quarter was up. And yes, those 12 points weren't 4 field goals; they were 2 touchdowns and 2 missed 2.point conversions. Mike Tomlin's proclivity for the 2.point conversion came back to bite him this week, as the Steelers scored 4 touchdowns on the day and failed all 4 of their conversions. With just 12 seconds left in the first quarter, down 12-3, Dak Prescott hit Ezekiel Elliott on a screen pass that Elliott took 83 yards for his first touchdown of the day. He had blockers helping him down the sideline, but his long speed was evident as he blew by the Steelers' defense. The second quarter and much of the third quarter slowed down a bit, as the 2 teams traded 2 field goals each to give the Steelers an 18-16 lead with a couple of minutes left in the third quarter. That's when Dak Prescott made 1 of the best plays of his career so far, as he eluded a heavy pass rush and hit Dez Bryant for a 50-yard touchdown. Prescott started off slowly in this 1. He missed a few throws and lost an early fumble, but he never lost his poise and came on strong, leading his team on 7 scoring drives. He completed 22-of-32 passes for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns, and has firmly taken control of the starting quarterback job over Tony Romo. Roethlisberger and the Steelers came back after the Bryant touchdown and retook the lead with a 1.yard rushing touchdown for Le'Veon Bell with 7:51 left in the game. Bell hadn't scored a touchdown this season, but he managed 2 in this game, plus totaled 134 yards on 17 carries and 9 receptions. He looked unstoppable at times as he stood at the line just waiting for a crease, which he would then explode through. He is fun to watch. That Bell touchdown put the Steelers up 24-23, as they missed yet another 2.point conversion. It was again time for the Cowboys with 7:51 left in the game, and they methodically drove down the field with their mammoth offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott navigating behind it. With 2 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys were 14 yards from a touchdown and could easily milk more clock, but the Steelers smartly backed off a bit and let Elliott coast in untouched for a 14-yard touchdown. This fact could be debated, as the Cowboys' offensive line can make any team look like they are giving up, but it was the best play for the Steelers, and it looked like they let him score. That touchdown gave Dallas a 29-24 lead and allowed the Steelers a minute and 55 seconds to move back down the field for the win, which they did, but too quickly. Roethlisberger and company had no trouble moving the ball down field, and then Roethlisberger pulled a Dan Marino and faked a clock-killing spike only to toss a beautiful 15-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell didn't fumble and the Steelers didn't allow a garbage-time touchdown.    Both of these teams came into this tilt with playoff aspirations, and despite this not being a division game, the Steelers needed to stay on pace with the Baltimore Ravens. Meanwihle, the Giants needed to win to have any chance of catching the Cowboys. The Giants entered having won 6 straight, but their offense has had trouble clicking, even against subpar defenses like the Cleveland Browns last week. Those 6 wins also came against teams with a combined 20-46-1 record. This Steelers team was a step above New York's previous competition, and it showed. The Steelers have grown more conservative in order to keep Ben Roethlisberger healthy. Short passes and runs to Le'Veon Bell are the motor to this offense right now, and with his ability, the Steelers are still able to move the ball without much trouble as evidenced by Bell's 182 total yards on a massive 35 touches. Bell has now rushed for 118 or more yards in each of his last 3 games and is averaging 175 total yards over those games. His workload is a little concerning, but his ability to avoid big hits does help him a little, plus many of his touches come through the air, with 7 receptions per game this season. Receptions usually end in less-smashed-up body parts than rushing up the middle. In this game, Bell appeared to be a magician at times, popping out of places that most backs would be planted into the ground, and the Giants' defense has been good and even showed that in this game.    The trouble for the Giants was their offense. "

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell tore up New Era Field, both literally and figuratively, as the Pittsburgh Steelers cruised to a 27-20 victory over the Bills. Bell outgained the whole home team, 298 to 275 yards. Ben Roethlisberger was not his best on the road and in the snow, giving the Bills the ball on 3 interceptions, but the Steelers' defense and, of course, Bell were able to take care of the win despite Roethlisberger's miscues. It's tough to discuss this game in terms other than Le'Veon Bell's dominance, so let's just take a quick look at the stats. First off, the Bills came into this game allowing just 3.8 yards per carry and 115.5 total yards per game to opposing running backs, ranking them 6.h and 8. in those categories - well, until today. Bell rushed a whopping 38 times for a Steelers record 236 yards, for a healthy 6.21 yards per carry and 3 rushing touchdowns. Besides being a Steelers record, the rushing yards were a record for the Bills as well, who had never allowed such a number. Bell also tacked 62 more yards through the air as he caught 4-of-5 targets. And besides the astronomical numbers, Bell put on a show with his legs. As always, he showed the patience of a Zen master before exploding like a jackrabbit out of a paper bag. Many times you knew he would be devoured inside a mass of defenders before escaping.    The Bills managed to make the score look presentable with garbage-time points, but this game appeared to be a mismatch most of the way. After 2 drives, "

It's hard to know for sure if Pittsburgh's coaching staff held him back due to his holdout, which lasted until just 6 days ago, but Cleveland's defense did not give up many holes up front, so the short practice time, the offensive line and the defense likely all contributed to the down game for Bell. There's no doubt though, that Bell will be more in-synch with the offense as he gets more practice reps under his belt. The Steelers' offense didn't really move the ball until Roethlisberger and "

Bell might still be a little behind the 8.ball, but he looked like his elusive self on many runs, but the Vikings' front line played him well by not overcommitting and taking away screens. Bell ended up with a huge workload of 27 carries and 4 receptions, but only totaled 91 yards and no touchdowns. It's coming.    The Vikings kept this game close throughout, but close for a team with a good quarterback, as it was, Keenum never felt like a threat to bring his team from behind, even after Minnesota scored to bring it within 8 points with 10 minutes left in the third quarter. Keenum ended up averaging just 3.7 yards per pass attempt. The Vikings' defense, without the mistakes, is a force to be reckoned with. But the team very much needs Bradford to get back and healthy if it wants to contend against the upper echelon of the league. Minnesota has the personnel, but Bradford is the key.    The Steelers' offense is not hitting on all cylinders, but they have been good enough to win their first 2 games against short-handed or inferior competition. Pittsburgh will need to get it going at some point, and there have been enough flashes to believe it will come around eventually.    The Steelers travel to Chicago next week and should be set up to start the season 3-0 after "

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell has started the season slowly, especially for his high statistical standards. Through 3 games, he had rushed 52 times for 180 yards and a touchdown, while catching 13 passes for 56 yards. But, on Sunday, against the Ravens' usually stout run defense, he rushed 35 times for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns, while catching 4 passes for an additional 42 yards. In this 1 game, he doubled his touchdowns and came close to reaching his total rushing yards and receiving yards. The Steelers got their offense rolling early by focusing on Bell as the engine, giving him the ball 5 straight times to start the afternoon, and they never went away from him on his way to a huge game. This wasn't surprising for a player like Bell, but to go into Baltimore and run on the Ravens like the Steelers did is a little surprising. The Steelers very much needed the run game to take off, as "

Instead, the Steelers attacked them through the air much more often than an outside observer like myself would consider healthy. Bell did see 25 touches, but 10 of those were receptions for 46 yards. Those will be useful for your PPR league, but 4.6 yards per reception isn't getting you far.    "

   "comment":"Le'Veon Bell. Bell was misused against the Jaguars last week and was rightfully questioning his role in that game, but this week, there was no doubt who the Steelers were going to ride all day long. Bell showed his usual patience as he ripped off large chunks of yardage, finishing the day with 32 carries for 179 yards and a touchdown, with an additional 3-of-6 receptions for 12 yards. With so many top players going down with injuries, it was a treat to watch Bell show what an elite NFL back can do when at the top of his game.    Kansas City got off to an extremely slow start to this game. That slow start lasted into the third quarter, as the home team had just 25 total yards of offense with 4 minutes remaining in the third quarter! The Steelers have been playing good pass defense, but they also hadn't faced the caliber of competition "
