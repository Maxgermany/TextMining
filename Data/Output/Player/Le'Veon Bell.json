Bush also struggled to get anything on the ground. He managed only 31 yards on 12 carries to go along with 2 catches for 23 receiving yards and the aforementioned fumble. He nearly had a second lost fumble, but the officials made a bad call. He nearly lost a second fumble, and as a consequence, was benched in favor of Joique Bell (9-49), who outgained him and also scored. In fact, the only reason Bush saw action in the second half was because Bell suffered an injury.    This is obviously a disappointing result for the Lions. Good teams are supposed to beat lesser opponents on the road, but Detroit came up short. The players disappointed, as did Jim Schwartz, who made a stupid decision to fake a field goal deep in Pittsburgh territory. The Steelers snuffed out the play, giving them momentum when they were down in the second half. Schwartz then spent some time lashing out at the media afterward, as he was rightfully criticized for not opting to go up a touchdown when he had a 4.point lead.   "

Brown beat Joe Haden on his touchdown, and he had his way with him the entire afternoon.    The only other Steelers with multiple catches were Heath Miller (5-41) and Bell (2-18). Speaking of Bell, he did a solid job running the ball (23-80), though he lost a short-yardage try near midfield to "

   "comment":"Bell collided with Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith and suffered what looked like an ugly concussion. The Steelers also lost center Fernando Velasco in addition to their top 2 offense tackles, so it's quite remarkable that they found the end zone. They missed on the 2.point conversion, however, as Emmanuel Sanders couldn't hold on to the ball on what would've been a tough reception.    Roethlisberger had a solid game, going 28-of-44 for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. Despite all of the injuries to the offensive line, he wasn't sacked on a single occasion. He had some vintage Big Ben plays where he navigated the pocket amid pressure and still managed to connect with 1 of his targets downfield. However, he was ultimately betrayed by Sanders (6-43, TD), who had 3 drops, including 2 in the end zone.    Bell also scored once and nearly had a second touchdown on the play in which he suffered a concussion. He actually crossed the goal line, but replay ruled that he was short because his helmet popped off beforehand. Bell finished with 73 yards on 16 carries to go along with 7 catches for 63 receiving yards. Again, the concussion looked pretty bad, but he'll have 10 days to get cleared for Week 14.    "

The 1 potential dark cloud over this victory was that Roethlisberger injured his knee on his touchdown to Brown, but that may not be much of a big deal because he ran into the locker room to get treated. Roethlisberger was also nearly guilty of a fumble, but the call was turned into an incompletion after replay, though it appeared as though he indeed lost the ball.    I mentioned that Brown eventually reached the end zone. He tied Miller for the team in lead in receptions, barely outgaining the tight end, 72-68. Brown and Miller were the only Steelers to record more than 2 receptions.    I was shocked that Bell didn't expose Kansas City's league-worst run defense. I thought there was a chance he'd eclipse 200 yards and perhaps challenge for the single-game record. Instead, he mustered only 63 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts. He didn't have a run longer than 7 yards.    Meanwhile, the Chiefs, as mentioned, struggled in the red zone, but "

   "comment":"Bell and Antonio Brown, who, even though Jones was inaccurate, were aided by him tossing the ball farther than 5 yards down the field and keeping the defense somewhat honest. Pittsburgh's final push ended in a field goal that brought them within 3. but it wasn't enough, as Alex Smith led his team down the field, finishing off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Conley.    Smith was in game-manager mode for most of the afternoon, as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 251 yard, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. And those zero interceptions were the key, especially with Landry Jones turning the ball over 3 times. The picks weren't all his fault, but they happened, and the final play of the game was a Tamba Hali strip-sack, which sealed the deal.    With Jeremy Maclin out, Travis Kelce, Albert Wilson, Chris Conley and West all had from 5 to 7 targets, as Smith spread the ball around. Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Bell suffering a second-quarter injury was brutal. Pittsburgh couldn't move the ball whatsoever after that, costing me 2 units. Blegh.    Ben Roethlisberger returned from his MCL sprain and 4 weeks on the sideline to lead the Steelers down the field on their opening drive, completing 4-of-5 passes for 80 yards and a 1-yard pass touchdown to Antonio Brown, but that was the highlight of his return.    After that initial drive, this game was a defensive struggle, with interceptions and field goals dominating until the 4.h quarter. Andy Dalton had his worst game of the season, completing 23-of-38 passes (60.5 percent) for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. He had only thrown 2 interceptions all season, so his 2 on Sunday tied his season total. This game was also only the second this season where he didn't throw for 2 or more touchdowns. If you were to promise these numbers from him, in Pittsburgh, against the Steelers' leaky defense, with Ben Roethlisberger back, 99 out of 100 people would agree this would be a Steelers win, but not this time.    The only real connection Dalton was on target with all game was A.J. Green, which is a player you want to be working well with. On 17 targets, Green caught 11 for 118 yards and a touchdown, while no other Bengals player topped 39 yards receiving. In many ways, this game was held together offensively by Green.    The biggest blow to the Steelers' offense was losing stud running back Le'Veon Bell with 9:14 remaining in the second half. After catching a pass, he was tackled by Vontae Burfict near the sideline and had his lower leg/knee rolled up under Burfict's full weight. Bell was then carried to the sideline, carted to the locker room and then transported to the hospital. There is some indication that it might not be a season-ending injury, but we have to wait to see at this point.    After Bell went down, "

And yes, those 12 points weren't 4 field goals; they were 2 touchdowns and 2 missed 2.point conversions. Mike Tomlin's proclivity for the 2.point conversion came back to bite him this week, as the Steelers scored 4 touchdowns on the day and failed all 4 of their conversions. With just 12 seconds left in the first quarter, down 12-3, Dak Prescott hit Ezekiel Elliott on a screen pass that Elliott took 83 yards for his first touchdown of the day. He had blockers helping him down the sideline, but his long speed was evident as he blew by the Steelers' defense. The second quarter and much of the third quarter slowed down a bit, as the 2 teams traded 2 field goals each to give the Steelers an 18-16 lead with a couple of minutes left in the third quarter. That's when Dak Prescott made 1 of the best plays of his career so far, as he eluded a heavy pass rush and hit Dez Bryant for a 50-yard touchdown. Prescott started off slowly in this 1. He missed a few throws and lost an early fumble, but he never lost his poise and came on strong, leading his team on 7 scoring drives. He completed 22-of-32 passes for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns, and has firmly taken control of the starting quarterback job over Tony Romo. Roethlisberger and the Steelers came back after the Bryant touchdown and retook the lead with a 1.yard rushing touchdown for Le'Veon Bell with 7:51 left in the game. Bell hadn't scored a touchdown this season, but he managed 2 in this game, plus totaled 134 yards on 17 carries and 9 receptions. He looked unstoppable at times as he stood at the line just waiting for a crease, which he would then explode through. He is fun to watch. That Bell touchdown put the Steelers up 24-23, as they missed yet another 2.point conversion. It was again time for the Cowboys with 7:51 left in the game, and they methodically drove down the field with their mammoth offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott navigating behind it. With 2 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys were 14 yards from a touchdown and could easily milk more clock, but the Steelers smartly backed off a bit and let Elliott coast in untouched for a 14-yard touchdown. This fact could be debated, as the Cowboys' offensive line can make any team look like they are giving up, but it was the best play for the Steelers, and it looked like they let him score. That touchdown gave Dallas a 29-24 lead and allowed the Steelers a minute and 55 seconds to move back down the field for the win, which they did, but too quickly. Roethlisberger and company had no trouble moving the ball down field, and then Roethlisberger pulled a Dan Marino and faked a clock-killing spike only to toss a beautiful 15-yard touchdown to "

   "comment":"Bell didn't fumble and the Steelers didn't allow a garbage-time touchdown.    Both of these teams came into this tilt with playoff aspirations, and despite this not being a division game, the Steelers needed to stay on pace with the Baltimore Ravens. Meanwihle, the Giants needed to win to have any chance of catching the Cowboys. The Giants entered having won 6 straight, but their offense has had trouble clicking, even against subpar defenses like the Cleveland Browns last week. Those 6 wins also came against teams with a combined 20-46-1 record. This Steelers team was a step above New York's previous competition, and it showed. The Steelers have grown more conservative in order to keep Ben Roethlisberger healthy. Short passes and runs to Le'Veon Bell are the motor to this offense right now, and with his ability, the Steelers are still able to move the ball without much trouble as evidenced by Bell's 182 total yards on a massive 35 touches. Bell has now rushed for 118 or more yards in each of his last 3 games and is averaging 175 total yards over those games. His workload is a little concerning, but his ability to avoid big hits does help him a little, plus many of his touches come through the air, with 7 receptions per game this season. Receptions usually end in less-smashed-up body parts than rushing up the middle. In this game, Bell appeared to be a magician at times, popping out of places that most backs would be planted into the ground, and the Giants' defense has been good and even showed that in this game.    The trouble for the Giants was their offense. "

He once again displayed his trademark great patience, and Kansas City's struggling run defense had no answer for him.    Pittsburgh's Killer Bees all performed well, and tha trio might now be a quartet in the wake of "

The Steelers had no chance with 1 of their 3 Killer Bs. Bell is arguably the top running back in the NFL, and he's a major part of the passing game. His absence completely ruined Pittsburgh's offensive game plan, and the team struggled to move the chains as a consequence. Bill Belichick is the master of erasing 1 aspect of a team's offense, and so with Bell out, he only had to focus on "

   "comment":"Bell was out of synch Week 1 in Cleveland, and this week, he was corralled by a strong Vikings defense. Bell might still be a little behind the 8.ball, but he looked like his elusive self on many runs, but the Vikings' front line played him well by not overcommitting and taking away screens. Bell ended up with a huge workload of 27 carries and 4 receptions, but only totaled 91 yards and no touchdowns. It's coming.    The Vikings kept this game close throughout, but close for a team with a good quarterback, as it was, Keenum never felt like a threat to bring his team from behind, even after Minnesota scored to bring it within 8 points with 10 minutes left in the third quarter. Keenum ended up averaging just 3.7 yards per pass attempt. The Vikings' defense, without the mistakes, is a force to be reckoned with. But the team very much needs Bradford to get back and healthy if it wants to contend against the upper echelon of the league. Minnesota has the personnel, but Bradford is the key.    The Steelers' offense is not hitting on all cylinders, but they have been good enough to win their first 2 games against short-handed or inferior competition. Pittsburgh will need to get it going at some point, and there have been enough flashes to believe it will come around eventually.    The Steelers travel to Chicago next week and should be set up to start the season 3-0 after "

   "comment":"Bell. Bell was misused against the Jaguars last week and was rightfully questioning his role in that game, but this week, there was no doubt who the Steelers were going to ride all day long. Bell showed his usual patience as he ripped off large chunks of yardage, finishing the day with 32 carries for 179 yards and a touchdown, with an additional 3-of-6 receptions for 12 yards. With so many top players going down with injuries, it was a treat to watch Bell show what an elite NFL back can do when at the top of his game.    Kansas City got off to an extremely slow start to this game. That slow start lasted into the third quarter, as the home team had just 25 total yards of offense with 4 minutes remaining in the third quarter! The Steelers have been playing good pass defense, but they also hadn't faced the caliber of competition "

   "comment":"Bell on your team, you have a built-in offense, and the Steelers have leaned on him for much of this season. But this week, at least in the first half, the Steelers' offense was clicking on all cylinders, as Ben Roethlisberger led his team down the field on the first possession, capping it with a 7.yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown. That quick score didn't go unanswered, and early on we had a game, as Andy Dalton threw 2 touchdowns in the first half to keep pace with the 2 touchdowns Roethlisberger threw. Dalton answered Antonio Brown's touchdown with a 6-yard strike to Brandon LaFell as time ran down in the first quarter. And then after Roethlisberger hit a wide-open JuJu Smith-Schuster for a 31-yard touchdown, Dalton answered with a 12-play drive, ending in a 1-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Kroft. But there, tied at 14-14, was the last time Bengals fans had much to cheer about. After halftime, Andy Dalton and the Bengals had the ball, but were stymied by the Steelers' defense. The Bengals had quick 3.and-out to start, and then on their next possession, Dalton was picked off. Then on the possession after that, Dalton was picked off again. The Bengals then produced 2 more 3.and-outs before committing a turnover on downs. Cincinnati ended up with 1 first down the entire second half! The Steelers stopped scoring touchdowns, but continued moving the ball and getting turnovers, which set Chris Boswell up for 5 field goals, of which he made all 5. With the game still somewhat in doubt in the 4.h quarter, the Steelers set up a beautiful fake punt, with a great pass from strong safety Robert Golden to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 44-yard gain to help seal the victory.    Roethlisberger and the passing game didn't do much in the second half, instead relying on Bell, who once again showed he is the best back in the NFL, as he totaled 192 yards on 39 touches. He now has an amazing 73 touches in his last 2 games for 383 yards and a touchdown. If you have Bell in fantasy, you really should get "
