   "comment":"Starks' bogus hold wiped out a nice Rashard Mendenhall scamper later on. General ineptness: When Smith scored the decisive touchdown, there was also a pass interference penalty. Coleman apparently thought the Ravens would wipe the score off the board because he announced: Pass interference on the defense. The ball will be placed on the spot of the foul. Because that game-winning score wasn't exciting enough.   "
