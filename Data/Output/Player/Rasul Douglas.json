   "comment":"Rasul Douglas nearly had a pick-six on the opening drive. Osweiler's only interception in meaningful action occurred when he locked in on his receiver and didn't seem to care that there was a defender to make the play. This turnover set up the Eagles with an early touchdown. The Broncos had some good times with Osweiler back in 2015, but it's clear that he's not the answer.
