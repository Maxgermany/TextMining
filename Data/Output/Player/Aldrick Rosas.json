   "comment":"Aldrick Rosas drilled the 23-yard field goal for the win.    Smith was 27-of-40 for 230 yards with 2 interceptions. Hunt ran for 73 yards on 18 carries.    Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving with 8 catches for 109 yards. Surprisingly against Kelce, the Giants' defense ended their streak of 10 straight games of giving up a touchdown to a tight end.    "
