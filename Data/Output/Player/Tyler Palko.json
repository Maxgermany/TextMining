Perhaps teams need to rethink this strategy, since we're about a year removed from that infamous Gus Johnson call on the David Garrard-Mike Thomas Hail Mary. It's only fitting that Kansas City would finally score this way. Despite the addition of Kyle Orton, Todd Haley stubbornly named Palko the starter, but benched him early on. Orton's first pass was an underthrown flea flicker, and he injured his finger when he banged it on a Chicago Bear player's helmet. Palko would finish a nondescript 17-of-30 for 157 yards and that score.    Of course, the big injury was to "
