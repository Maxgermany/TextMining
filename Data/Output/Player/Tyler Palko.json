   "comment":"Tyler Palko into 3 turnovers (2 interceptions, 1 fumble) in the first half. Yet they managed only 13 points in a really poor showing. This should have been a 20-point blowout. Pittsburgh continuously shot itself in the foot with dumb mistakes, which was strange considering it was coming off a bye. Good teams are usually sharp following a week off. It started early when "

The first 9 times on the money down, he threw complete short of the chains 4 times, was sacked 3 times, 1 intercepted and 1 incompletion, all for obviously no conversions. Palko finally converted with a pass to ",
