This allowed Eli Manning to operate in short-yardage situations to avoid Detroit pass-rushers Ziggy Ansah and Kerry Hyder, who had great matchups versus a pair of weak New York offensive tackles. So what happened? Well, the return of stud guard Justin Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive. That happened to clinch the spread victory; Manning took advantage of Slay's absence by connecting to "

   "comment":"Perkins and Rashad Jennings split the workload almost evenly, with the former having the edge in carries, 21-18. However, Perkins outgained Jennings by a wide margin, 102-52. Jennings scored a touchdown, but the Giants need to consider making Perkins their primary ball-carrier going forward.    One last thing: This game really ended at 13-10, but the Redskins' attempt at a Stanford Band-type play ended with the Giants scooping and scoring to make this result 19-10. Everyone left the field, but the officials called everyone back to attempt an extra point for some reason. I have no idea why this stupid rule exists. The Giants scoffed at it, opting to kneel down instead of kicking the extra point.   "

Perkins has talent, but the Giants could use a better back and superior blocking. I have them addressing 1 area in my .    I haven't made fun of any of the announcers yet in these recaps, so I'll leave you with this gem from Troy Aikman. I don't dislike Aikman, but this 1 was a bit of a head-scratcher: The Giants dominated 58 minutes of the first half. Wow, that's some long first half! <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "
