   "comment":"Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Coleman coughed up the football in the red zone when it appeared as though Atlanta was going to tie the game. Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a 4.h turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers are misleading because of the 2 lost fumbles and the red-zone miscues, but Ryan didn't have a bad outing. He was betrayed by his supporting cast; he suffered through several drops and was sacked on 5 occasions, thrice by Cameron Jordan.    The big story prior to the game was whether or not Julio Jones would play. Jones took the field and didn't appear to be limited. He caught 6 passes for 93 yards. Ryan didn't have enough time in the pocket to find Jones as much as he wanted to. Because of this, Ryan frequently tossed checkdowns to Devonta Freeman, who once again had a great game. He caught 8 passes for 56 receiving yards and a touchdown to go along with some fantastic rushing numbers (13 carries, 100 rushing yards, TD). Freeman had a drop late, but it was his only blemish during the evening. Freeman was also helped by Coleman's aforementioned lost fumble. Not that Freeman was going to lose his job to Coleman, or anything, but Coleman (4-40) didn't have a single touch following intermission.    Jones' fantasy owners had to be upset when they saw that "

   "comment":"Coleman fumbled at the end of a 46-yard run in the first quarter. Later during the opening half, Terron Ward was foolishly flagged for kicking a defender in the throat. Matt Ryan followed that up by throwing an interception behind a receiver. Following intermission, Coleman scored a touchdown, but a clipping penalty wiped it out. Ryan then tossed an interception late across his body in the end zone. He capped off the game with a lost fumble.    Give the Vikings credit for taking advantage of these mistakes. "

   "comment":"Coleman, but the ball popped into the air. It landed right into Justin Hardy's arms. This put the Falcons up for good, saving their season in the process.    Aside from the interception, Ryan had a great game. He went 26-of-34 for 396 yards, 3 touchdowns and the pick. Ryan didn't see much pressure, as the Raiders once again failed to hurry the quarterback. Khalil Mack has been a ghost thus far, failing to log a sack through 2 games, and Oakland's secondary continued to be pitiful. Sean Smith struggled once again, while linebacker Malcolm Smith was woeful as well, missing a tackle on Tamme's touchdown.    Tamme had a big game (5-75, TD), as did Julio Jones, who caught all 5 of his targets for 106 yards and a touchdown of his own. However, there might be some worry with Jones, as he wasn't able to finish the game. The Falcons said that Jones only jammed his leg, so perhaps he'll be fine for Week 3.    As for Ryan's other targets, Austin Hooper bounced back from last week's dreadful performance with 3 catches for 84 yards. Mohamed Sanu (3-19) barely did anything, which was hardly a surprise.    The Falcons once again had Devonta Freeman and Telvin Coleman share touches. Freeman outgained Coleman, 93-46, on slightly more carries (17-12). However, Coleman found the end zone, while Freeman was held scoreless.    The Raiders had chance to win this game despite their woeful defense, as they were robbed of a long "

   "comment":"Coleman (8-64) exploding down the field for a 30-yard touchdown. Right after a Brooks Reed sack, Vic Beasley strip-sacked Rivers. Adrian Clayborn scooped up the ball and rolled into the end zone to give the Falcons a 27-10 lead. Rivers came right back to hit Tyrell Williams for 38 yards in busted coverage. A 21-yard pass to Travis Benjamin (4-54) got San Diego in the red zone at the 2-minute warning. A bullet to Hunter Henry (1-16) moved the ball to the 3-yard line, and Gordon ran in the touchdown to cut the Falcons' lead to 27-17 at the half. Midway through the third quarter, Rivers led a field goal drive to cut the point deficit to 7. Atlanta responded with runs from Devonta Freeman of 15, 14, and 8 yards to set up another Bryant field goal. San Diego then marched down the field as Rivers picked apart the Falcons' defense. He used Gordon as a receiver on a number of plays, including a 5.yard touchdown toss. That cut the Falcons' lead to 30-27 with 6 minutes remaining. San Diego's defense came through as Denzel Perryman picked off Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. "

   "comment":"Coleman. The Falcons added to their lead when Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff demonstrated poor field vision, throwing a pass right to Deion Jones for an interception. Goff stared down his primary read on the play, and Jones undercut the route to return the pick 33 yards for a touchdown. It was Goff's second interception of the half, but the first 1 was not his fault as it came on a deflected pass that Kenny Britt (7-82) dropped. Atlanta was up 21-0 by halftime, while Goff was only 8-for-18 for 75 yards and 2 interceptions. Early in the third quarter, Ryan found Taylor Gabriel wide open downfield in busted coverage for a 64-yard touchdown. The Falcons' Courtney Upshaw soon stripped Malcolm Brown (4-14) of the football and recovered the loose ball. Coleman had a 6-yard touchdown run a few plays later. On the Rams' next possession, Goff held onto the ball too long before getting strip-sacked by "

   "comment":"Coleman were big factors as receivers as well. Freeman hauled in 4 balls for 80 yards, while Coleman snatched 3 passes for 22 yards and a touchdown. Speaking of Freeman and Coleman, they ran well versus the Seahawks, which was surprising. Freeman (14-45, TD) and Coleman (11-57) combined to eclipse the century mark.    Atlanta moves on to the NFC Championship. It'll either host the Packers or travel to Dallas. If the Cowboys beat Green Bay, this will have been the final game in the Georgia Dome.    As for the Seahwks, they were hot offensively early on, as they engineered a 14-play touchdown drive to start the game. The possession lasted 8:34. There were some great runs, while Russell Wilson was precise. However, bad luck ensued; the Ifedi injury, the aforementioned penalty on the Hester return, and Wilson falling down all hurt. Then, Atlanta held the ball forever, and Seattle's offensive chances were limited as a result. The Seahawks' decision to punt on 1 occasion on a 4.h-and-1 from around their own 40-yard line also hurt. They pinned the Falcons down at the 1-yard line, but Ryan put together a 99-yard touchdown drive. Wilson went 17-of-30 for 225 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of interceptions in garbage time, 1 of which should've been called a reception down by contact. Wilson played well, but once again had issues on the offensive line. He constantly had to run out of the pocket, and many of his incompletions were thrown away.    If there's a silver lining for the Seahawks, it's that they may have found something in "

   "comment":"Coleman, the most incompetent official in the NFL, summoned a replay review. The call was close, but the replay showed that Tate was barely short of the goal line when he was touched down. Coleman, who has a long history of not overturning calls when they should be, actually changed the ruling for once. Making matters worse for Detroit, he announced that because the Lions had no timeouts, they would be charged with a 10-second run-off, ending the game. It was the correct call, which in itself is remarkable because Coleman usually gets things wrong. It figures that the Lions, who have never had any great fortune throughout franchise history, would suffer as the result of this. The crowd went from chanting MVP for Stafford to showering the officials with a chorus of boos. The Lions were 3-0 for a minute, but dropped to 2-1 as a result of a horrendous rule. To not give the Lions a chance because the officials stopped the game is just awful. It's unclear if they could've gotten a snap off with 8 seconds remaining, but because everyone was close by, it may have been possible. In fact, the Lions' Twitter feed posted a video of the offense previously getting a snap off in 7 seconds, so it was definitely possible.    As for the victors, it was no Ryan Schraeder, no problem. The Falcons were missing their talented right tackle, but that didn't matter at all against the Lions. Atlanta's offense did whatever it wanted to in this contest, quickly jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the middle of the second quarter. Seemingly getting double-digit yards on every single play, Detroit had no answer for the Falcons without rookie middle linebacker "

   "comment":"Coleman. The third-year man out of Indiana had a strong performance for the team. He had some nice, tough runs that saw him hit the hole and use his strength to beat the Dallas front. Coleman finished the day with 83 yards on 20 carries and also got a touchdown. He probably has earned himself with a larger role in the backfield and could split carries with Freeman.    For the Cowboys, this was not a good look. Many expected that they would remain competitive without Elliott in the lineup. If Sunday is any indication, that won't be possible. With Elliott in the lineup, opponents had to respect the Cowboys' run game.
