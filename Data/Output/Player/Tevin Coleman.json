   "comment":"Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

Later in the second quarter, the backup center, who was in the game because of an injury to the starter, screwed up the snap, prompting yet another lost fumble in the red zone, thus negating a second chance to even the count. Atlanta had a 4.h turnover late - another Ryan fumble - but by then, it didn't matter.    Ryan, despite the mistakes, had a solid stat line. He went 30-of-44 for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns. The numbers are misleading because of the 2 lost fumbles and the red-zone miscues, but Ryan didn't have a bad outing.

   "comment":"Tevin Coleman (8-64) exploding down the field for a 30-yard touchdown. Right after a Brooks Reed sack, Vic Beasley strip-sacked Rivers. Adrian Clayborn scooped up the ball and rolled into the end zone to give the Falcons a 27-10 lead. Rivers came right back to hit Tyrell Williams for 38 yards in busted coverage. A 21-yard pass to Travis Benjamin (4-54) got San Diego in the red zone at the 2-minute warning. A bullet to Hunter Henry (1-16) moved the ball to the 3-yard line, and Gordon ran in the touchdown to cut the Falcons' lead to 27-17 at the half. Midway through the third quarter, Rivers led a field goal drive to cut the point deficit to 7. Atlanta responded with runs from Devonta Freeman of 15, 14, and 8 yards to set up another Bryant field goal. San Diego then marched down the field as Rivers picked apart the Falcons' defense. He used Gordon as a receiver on a number of plays, including a 5.yard touchdown toss. That cut the Falcons' lead to 30-27 with 6 minutes remaining. San Diego's defense came through as Denzel Perryman picked off Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. "

If Jones is forced to miss time, you can expect the team to utilize a run-heavy offense.    For the Chiefs, this was yet another huge win. After a late overtime victory against the Broncos, they came back to get a critical win over a tough team. Part of the reason for their success was the performance of "

Freeman was held to 68 yards on 9 attempts, while Coleman gained 32 yards and a touchdown on 9 tries. The 2 runners combined for just 18 yards on 6 carries in the second half. Miami was able to get excellent penetration with its front 4. which makes it puzzling as to why Ryan didn't attack their secondary.    "

He had some nice, tough runs that saw him hit the hole and use his strength to beat the Dallas front. Coleman finished the day with 83 yards on 20 carries and also got a touchdown. He probably has earned himself with a larger role in the backfield and could split carries with Freeman.    For the Cowboys, this was not a good look. Many expected that they would remain competitive without Elliott in the lineup. If Sunday is any indication, that won't be possible. With Elliott in the lineup, opponents had to respect the Cowboys' run game. Even though their offensive line was weaker than it was in the past, opposing defensive coordinators spent a lot of time trying to stop Elliott. Without him, the Falcons and Dan Quinn focused more on stopping "
