   "comment":"Irving, and both players were ejected. The Browns established a 3-0 lead, and they were later deep in Dallas territory, down 7-3, but then reality set in. The Browns missed a field goal, and then the Cowboys scored on almost every possession for the rest of the game. Before the Browns knew it, their potential 7-6 deficit turned into a 21-3 halftime score, and there was no way they were coming back from that against a red-hot opponent. How great was Dallas' offense? The Cowboys punted once until the very end of the game, and that punt came on a drive in which they were pinned at their own 1-yard line. Their dominant defensive line pushed around Cleveland's beleaguered front, and Dallas basically did whatever it wanted to. The Cowboys racked up 423 net yards, averaging 6 yards per play. They achieved 29 first downs, and yet those numbers don't even describe how 1.sided this affair was.    "

   "comment":"Irving caused major problems by flooding the backfield on seemingly every play. It began when Winston was picked off on an overthrow on third-and-long, which was caused by Irving smacking Winston's elbow upon his release. Winston then overthrew an open receiver near the end zone and missed Mike Evans on the penultimate offensive drive of the game. Winston was given 1 more chance, but was picked off in desperation time. Winston finished 17-of-35 for 247 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. I don't understand how Winston can be so inconsistent over the course of 60 minutes of action. He looked like 3 different quarterbacks in this game. It hurt that right tackle Demar Dotson was out, but there was very little excuse for some of his 4.h-quarter misses.    Winston's touchdowns went to "
