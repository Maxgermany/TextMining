There's really no comparison, as the Titans had no chance with Mettenberger, even against 1 of the worst teams in football.

   "comment":"Mettenberger has a future after he's done playing in the NFL. He can sell tapes to aspiring football players on how not to play the quarterback position. This performance was truly a masterpiece.    Houston maintained control of the AFC South with a win over Tennessee. The Texans look likely to win the AFC South because of their tough defense and star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Once again, the team rode that formula to get a victory as Houston's quarterback carousel continued with both Brandon Weeden and B.J. Daniels seeing action against Tennessee. The Texans hope that Brian Hoyer will return to the field in Week 17.    On the first drive of the game, Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson forced a fumble from Antonio Andrews and safety Quentin Demps returned the loose ball 32 yards for a touchdown. Shortly later, Alfred Blue forced a fumble from Harry Douglas on a punt return and Houston recovered at the Titans 11-yard line. That spotted the Texans a field goal, and the game was virtually over as Zach Mettenberger was incapable of challenging the Texans' defense. After some anemic drives, Houston starter Brandon Weeden hit DeAndre Hopkins for a gain of 44 yards. A few plays later, Weeden ran the ball into end zone from 7 yards out on a third-and-goal. That gave the Texans a 17-0 lead at halftime. To open the third quarter, Hopkins went to work on "

He went 5-of-13 for 38 yards and a pick-six, which occurred when his pass was tipped as he was pressured. It was apparent how bad Mettenberger was, given that he was passing against a secondary that lost Vontae Davis and Greg Toler to injury."
