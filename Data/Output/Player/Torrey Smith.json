   "comment":"Smith where he stared down his receiver. However, McCoy really had no help from his teammates. His offensive line couldn't block the Ravens whatsoever. When McCoy was able to get attempts off, his receivers often dropped passes. You might be able to blame the rain and windy conditions, but the fact remains that Cleveland's receivers absolutely suck.    The longest reception for McCoy actually went to Peyton Hillis, who leaked out of the backfield and caught a 52-yard bomb downfield. Hillis couldn't really find any running room, however, as he gained just 45 yards on 12 carries. Hillis, by the way, is hurt again. He wasn't in the locker room afterward, and head coach Pat Shurmur told the media that his star running back is dealing with some sort of injury.    On the contrary, Ray Rice had plenty of running lanes. He compiled a whopping 204 yards and a touchdown on 29 attempts. He missed out on a second score when he took a breather after a 67-yard scamper. Ricky Williams (16-76) vultured the touchdown.    Joe Flacco didn't have a very good outing amid the nasty weather conditions. He went just 10-of-23 for 158 yards.    Only 1 Raven had more than 2 receptions (Ed Dickson: 3-47). Anquan Boldin (2-32) and Torrey Smith (1-32) disappointed their fantasy owners.   "

   "comment":"Smith, who lost his younger brother to a motorcycle accident just hours earlier. Smith was outstanding despite the fact that it was unclear whether he'd play or not. He caught 6 balls for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns. This was such an intense game. There were so many fierce hits (despite all of the points) and the players constantly got into it with each other. The officials lost control of this contest by letting stuff go early, and it got really bad. They then overcompensated by calling everything - there were 24 combined accepted penalties - prompting both coaches to scream incoherently at the refs. The crowd continuously chanted bull-s*** for what seemed like 10 minutes, and after the Ravens seeminglynailed a game-winning field goal - I still don't know why they didn't review that (it is reviewable) - Belichick ran after 1 of the officials and grabbed his arm. I've never seen Belichick that animated. It just goes to show how much of an atrocity the officiating crew was in this game. It's become such a farce, but it doesn't matter because Roger Goodell has proven that he doesn't give a damn about player safety as long as players can't sue him for it.    It's a shame that the horrible refs are the major headline of a game that featured so much explosive offense. "

   "comment":"Smith had a hold on the Cowboys' penultimate drive that wiped out a big gain. - On 1 play, Kevin Ogletree dropped a touchdown and Felix Jones committed a chop block penalty. - Dez Bryant, who caught 13 balls for 95 yards and 2 touchdowns, dropped the game-tying 2.point conversion. - One of the aforementioned play-clock issues forced the Cowboys to call a timeout on their final drive. This forced a long, game-winning attempt for Dan Bailey, which sailed wide left. Game over. I'm sure I forgot to list some other pretty bad errors, but despite them, the Cowboys were still in position to come away with a win because they moved the ball at will against Baltimore's defense. They completely gashed the Ravens, as both DeMarco Murray (14-93) and Felix Jones (18-92, TD) ran right at Ray Lewis, who was terrible yet again when he was in the game (more on this later). Murray would've enjoyed a monstrous afternoon if he didn't leave with a foot sprain. It's just a reminder of how brittle Murray is.    Murray wasn't the only star player who got hurt. Haloti Ngata was banged up and limping around, while Lardarius Webb suffered a torn ACL. Oh, and then there was Lewis, who tore his triceps. Lewis could be out for the year.    As for the Ravens, they had success throwing the ball against Dallas' struggling secondary. Joe Flacco went 17-of-26 for 234 yards and a touchdown. His score went to Torrey Smith (2-24), but Anquan Boldin was the bigger factor."

   "comment":"Smith back in Week 3. A couple of years ago, the Bengals had a very spirted performance for defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, who lost his wife. There are many other examples of this, including Brett Favre's memorable victory on Monday Night Football after his dad died. As for the Raiders? They can't even say they gave any sort of effort. It was pathetic. Oakland allowed the offensively challenged Ravens' scoring attack to do whatever it wanted. Baltimore picked up 419 yards of offense. Meanwhile, the Raiders once again killed themselves with stupid mistakes. They committed 10 penalties. On 1 instance, they were guilty of an offensive pass interference in the end zone, which was kind of bogus, but it didn't matter because Carson Palmer overthrew an open Brandon Myers by a mile. Earlier, Palmer tripped over his lineman's feet while going for it on a 4th-and-1 at midfield on the opening drive. The Raiders had no answer for Joe Flacco and Baltimore's downfield passing attack. Flacco went 21-of-33 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns and a fluky interception that was deflected and popped into the air. Oakland failed to sack him a single time, and because of this, Flacco was able to locate his receivers deep down the field on numerous occasions. He completed 5 passes of 26-plus yards.    One such long reception went to Torrey Smith for a 47-yard touchdown. Smith also had another touchdown from 20 yards out - and those were his only receptions of the afternoon.    Flacco's other score went to "

Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.    Wayne naturally was Luck's top target, snagging 9 balls for 114 yards. TY Hilton also had a decent performance, catching 8 passes for 66 yards, though he dropped a key reception.    The Colts ran on the Ravens successfully, as most teams have this year. Vick Ballard tallied 91 yards on 22 carries.    The officiating was terrible in this contest. There were 4 blown calls in the first quarter alone. Mike Carey's crew whistled the Colts for a terrible pass interference, then incorrectly ruled who recovered the ball on Rice's first fumble. The ensuing drive saw 2 missed face mask penalties. Later on, Carey failed to blow a play dead when Baltimore had 12 men on the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

They had just 2 sacks - including 1 by Barkevious Mingo that helped push the Ravens out of field goal position - but that's misleading because they were dominant in the trenches. Flacco, however, willed his team to victory with a very strong second half. His overall numbers weren't very impressive - 22-of-33, 211 yards and a touchdown - but he misfired on just 2 attempts after intermission; he was 10-of-12 for 102 yards and the score in the third and 4.h quarters.    The big news for Baltimore's offense was Ray Rice's hip flexor strain. He had just 36 yards on 13 carries prior to exiting with the injury. Fortunately, Rice should be OK; it's sounding like there's a chance he could be active next week. If not, the Ravens will be happy to roll with Bernard Pierce again.

They achieved 3 first downs in the opening half. - New York was outgained, 212-73, in the first half. The team mustered only 137 net yards at that aforementioned point in the final period. - Greg Salas was the only Jet receiver to finish with more than 1 catch. He logged 2 receptions for 48 yards. I listed Smith's numbers at that particular stage because he compiled some junk yardage in the final few minutes when the Ravens stopped caring. He ultimately finished 9-of-22 for 127 yards and 2 picks. He also caught a 13-yard pass on the second drive, as New York showed tons of Wildcat formations early on, with Joshua Cribbs taking plenty of snaps. Cribbs went 1-of-2 for 13 yards and also had 20 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. Smith could be benched next week, by the way. Rex Ryan was non-committal on whether Smith would get the nod versus the Dolphins.    The Jets didn't run the ball well. Both "

   "comment":"Smith, but he was off the mark for the most part. It didn't help him that the offensive line couldn't pass protect or run block, or do anything correctly, but Flacco looked like 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for most of this contest. Flacco ended up 35-of-62 for 345 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That stat line is misleading, though Flacco did get into a rhythm in the second half. However, he screwed up on numerous occasions and took unnecessary sacks. A sack actually ended the game, but the play that most sticks out occurred just prior to intermission. With limited time remaining on the clock, Flacco scrambled to avoid pressure. The coaches yelled at him to throw the ball away, but he ran around like an idiot instead. Time ultimately ran out, as Baltimore screwed up a chance to kick a field goal.    Flacco's sole score went to Steve Smith, who found the end zone on an 80-yard touchdown where he muscled defenders away. Smith finished with 7 grabs for 118 yards, though those numbers are bogus because most of them came on 1 play. Smith was highly inefficient for most of the afternoon.    "

   "comment":"Smith inside the 5-yard line. Darrius Heyward-Bey - yes, he's still in the league - then held on a big gain on an end-round by Markus Wheaton. Roethlisberger followed that up by throwing way behind Justin Brown on a third down, which would've been a big play because Brown was wide open. The Steelers had multiple chances to get back into the game in the second half, but committed way too many personal foul penalties. One was bogus, but the infractions allowed the Ravens to register touchdowns, allowing them to put this contest away. The scores were to Owen Daniels, who was wide open on both occasions, thanks to blown coverages. You'd think Pittsburgh would've learned the second time, but its defense is so anemic that it can't really do anything correctly. The nail in the coffin was a Heath Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated. Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with "

   "comment":"Smith drawn pass interference, the clutch Justin Tucker delivered a game-winning field goal for Baltimore. The Browns and Ravens played pretty evenly, as the latter won the yardage battle by only 2. Baltimore had no answer for the pass, while Cleveland struggled with defending the run. The Raven backs combined for 154 yards on 29 carries despite Bernard Pierce's absence. Cleveland did have a big defensive stand where they stopped both Baltimore runners, but it ultimately did not matter because the visitor prevailed.    Brian Hoyer played well in this loss. He misfired just 6 times, going 19-of-25 for 290 yards and a touchdown. He had a stupid moment where he threw what briefly looked like a second score, but was flagged for an illegal forward pass because he was 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Hoyer had another pass that was wiped out by penalty when he hit Johnny Manziel - on a trick play in which Manziel pretended to go to the sideline to talk to Kyle Shanahan - for a big gain. However, the play was nullified by an illegal shift.    Hoyer's sole score went to Miles Austin (6-51), but his main target was Andrew Hawkins, who reeled in 7 of 10 targets for 87 yards. This was despite Jordan Cameron's return to the lineup. Cameron had just 1 catch for 23 yards, but made it count, as it came on a second-and-20 that resulted in a scoring drive. Cameron also drew a pass interference in the end zone on that very same possession.    The Browns had their 2 backs split carries. Terrance West (12-36) started, but was outgained by Isaiah Crowell (11-55). Both scored touchdowns.    As mentioned, the Ravens had so much success on the ground. Justin Forsett was expected to start with Pierce missing in action, but he received just 11 carries compared to 18 that went to Lorenzo Taliaferro. Both looked good, with Taliaferro outgaining Forsett, 91-63. The former found the end zone.    Joe Flacco had a devastating afternoon; not that he played poorly or anything, but because he lost 1 of his favorite targets, Dennis Pitta, who was carted off when his leg gave out on him. He wasn't contacted; he just collapsed. Pitta was later diagonsed with a dislocated hip - the same 1 that caused him to miss most of 2013. Pitta might be done for the season. Flacco still managed to persevere, finishing 19-of-31 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. It must be noted that he converted on just 8 of 16 attempts following intermission when he didn't have Pitta at his disposal. However, he made that clutch completion to Steve Smith at the very end, which allowed Tucker to ice this game.    Steve Smith was once again Baltimore's leading receiver. He caught 5 passes for 101 yards. "

Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker Emmanuel Lamur. The second was a weird 1. as Torrey Smith appeared to have suffered a concussion and screwed up on the play. Flacco had some other near-picks, including 1 where a Cincinnati defender bobbled 1 of his passes in the first half. Having said that, this loss wasn't all on Flacco. Smith, as mentioned, suffered a concussion. He also lost 2 starting offensive linemen - "

   "comment":"Smith out, Brown wreaked havoc on the opposition, accumulating a whopping 11 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown. He also drew a pass interference flag. Brown's score was a thing of beauty, as he got into space and made several Ravens miss.    The Steelers did not run the ball very well. LeGarrette Blount and Le'Veon Bell each had 10 carries for 23 and 20 yards, respectively. Bell made up for it with 5 catches for 38 receiving yards and a touchdown. Blount, meanwhile, had an eventful evening. He had a minimal gain on a short carry in the third quarter when Terrell Suggs made a horribly dirty hit, going for the back of the big back's knees. A fight ensued, and Suggs was whistled for a personal foul. Blount later drew another flag of the same sort of Elvis Dumervil, prompting the official to stop the game and threaten both coaches that they would eject players. This calmed everyone down until Raven tight end Crockett Gilmore spiked the ball after a touchdown that made the game 36-23 with 3 minutes remaining, prompting the crowd to chant Ravens suck! Ravens suck! And as if there wasn't enough bad blood, Pittsburgh ran up the score when Roethlisberger went play-action and hit Matt Spaeth for a touchdown, up 13 with just 2 minutes remaining. This incited yet another skirmish that resulted in more personal-foul flags. It was a classic Baltimore-Pittsburgh battle.    While Pittsburgh's offensive has made great leaps recently, the defense looked improved in this contest. The unit was able to put great pressure on Joe Flacco. It sacked him 4 times, but that number easily could've been twice as much. James Harrison, who was retired slightly more than a month ago, was a monster Sunday evening, registering 2 sacks. Unfortunately, the Steelers lost Ryan Shazier and Troy Polamalu to injuries. Flacco was able to compile some junk yardage to make his numbers look better - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but he struggled to complete half of his passes during meaningful action. In fact, he was just 9-of-17 going into halftime. Flacco simply had no time to throw; his pick came when he was under pressure. He heaved up a desperate pass that was picked off, and the Steelers capitalized with 1 of Roethlisberger's aerial scores.    With the pressure he was facing, Flacco had to constantly dump the ball off to Justin Forsett, who led the team with 67 receiving yards off 5 catches. Torrey Smith was next (4-63), and he snared 1 of Flacco's touchdowns. He also drew a pass interference. Meanwhile, "

A big reason why the Ravens struggled to move the chains was Justin Forsett's ineptitude. Gaining just 48 yards on 16 carries, Forsett had many poor runs after looking so brilliant last week. He's playing injured though, so perhaps that was a part of the reason why he hurt his fantasy owners.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, both Smiths failed to produce. "

With the 49ers up 13-3, Flacco was picked off by forcing a pass to a covered receiver. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite cut in front of the ball, and that gave the 49ers another field goal. The Ravens answered with a field goal drive of their own. The 49ers took a 16-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Flacco threw an awful pass. It was late down the middle of the field, off his back foot, and up for grabs like a punt, and dropped in to San Francisco cornerback Kenneth Acker. A pop pass to Anquan Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal. Acker found that Flacco giveth and taketh away, as Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but "

However, Kaepernick did have some issues on deep throws earlier in the game. He had a 10.ency to overthrow his receivers if they were closely covered. It was likely a result of him trying to avoid making mistakes. Still, he needs to improve on this moving forward. Kaepernick was unsurprisingly at his best on the ground. He ran the ball 8 times for 66 yards and used his mobility to his advantage. In the third quarter, when the 49ers were trying to get back into the game, Kaepernick helped to lead a drive and picked up a couple of first downs using his legs. So long as running is not his first option, he could end up being a decent starting quarterback. During the contest, Kaepernick threw mostly to 3 receivers. All of them actually received 7 targets apiece. Torrey Smith (3-76-1) and "

   "comment":"Smith had the ball pop out of his hands on the opening play of the third quarter. He was welcomed to the field by a chorus of boos, but those quickly transformed to oohs and ahhs, as Kaepernick was able to make some dazzling plays to help the 49ers move the chains consistently. Most of his great plays came on the ground, as Kaepernick accumulated 113 rushing yards on 10 scampers.    Kaepernick's touchdowns went to Hyde, Smith and Celek. However, his leading target, "

   "comment":"Smith dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which occurred in the end zone. Darren Sproles then fumbled a punt return, setting up a field goal for the Chiefs. Speaking of field goals, Jake Elliott missed a 30-yard kick. The worst mistake came late, when Carson Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a "

Wentz did a good job of moving around in the pocket and buying time to set up deep throws. Unlike some game-managers in the NFL, Wentz doesn't settle for short passes on third-and-long opportunities. He pushes the issue, and is often successful in doing so.    Wentz's 4 scores went to Nelson Agholor (4-93), Smith (3-70), Zach Ertz (6-61) and Trey Burton (2-16)."

This injury kept him out of the Denver game in Week 9, but it was shocking that he didn't heal up during the bye.    Jay Ajayi broke free for a 70-yard run in the second half, and he would've scored a touchdown had the Cowboys not chased him down just shy of the goal line. Ajayi finished with 91 yards on 7 attempts. LeGarrette Blount (13-57) ran well, too. Corey Clement (6-50) found the end zone.    As great was Wentz was in the second half, Philadelphia's defense was even more dominant. The Eagles pitched a shutout after halftime, as they limited Dallas to just 110 net yards in the second half, which includes some garbage-time yardage. They put tons of pressure on Dak Prescott, as it was once again apparent how much Dallas missed Tyron Smith. The Cowboys gave their left tackle some help this time, but not nearly enough.
