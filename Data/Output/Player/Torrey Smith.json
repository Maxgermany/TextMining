   "comment":"Torrey Smith (1-32) disappointed their fantasy owners.   Smith where he stared down his receiver. However, McCoy really had no help from his teammates. His offensive line couldn't block the Ravens whatsoever. When McCoy was able to get attempts off, his receivers often dropped passes. You might be able to blame the rain and windy conditions, but the fact remains that Cleveland's receivers absolutely suck.    The longest reception for McCoy actually went to Peyton Hillis, who leaked out of the backfield and caught a 52-yard bomb downfield. Hillis couldn't really find any running room, however, as he gained just 45 yards on 12 carries. Hillis, by the way, is hurt again. He wasn't in the locker room afterward, and head coach Pat Shurmur told the media that his star running back is dealing with some sort of injury.    On the contrary, Ray Rice had plenty of running lanes. He compiled a whopping 204 yards and a touchdown on 29 attempts. He missed out on a second score when he took a breather after a 67-yard scamper. Ricky Williams (16-76) vultured the touchdown.    Joe Flacco didn't have a very good outing amid the nasty weather conditions. He went just 10-of-23 for 158 yards.    Only 1 Raven had more than 2 receptions (Ed Dickson: 3-47). Anquan Boldin (2-32) and Torrey Smith (1-32) disappointed their fantasy owners.   "

The officials lost control of this contest by letting stuff go early, and it got really bad. They then overcompensated by calling everything - there were 24 combined accepted penalties - prompting both coaches to scream incoherently at the refs.

I've never seen Belichick that animated. It just goes to show how much of an atrocity the officiating crew was in this game. It's become such a farce, but it doesn't matter because Roger Goodell has proven that he doesn't give a damn about player safety as long as players can't sue him for it.

   "comment":"Torrey Smith (2-24), but Anquan Boldin was the bigger factor.Smith had a hold on the Cowboys' penultimate drive that wiped out a big gain. - On 1 play, Kevin Ogletree dropped a touchdown and Felix Jones committed a chop block penalty. - Dez Bryant, who caught 13 balls for 95 yards and 2 touchdowns, dropped the game-tying 2.point conversion. - One of the aforementioned play-clock issues forced the Cowboys to call a timeout on their final drive. This forced a long, game-winning attempt for Dan Bailey, which sailed wide left. Game over. I'm sure I forgot to list some other pretty bad errors, but despite them, the Cowboys were still in position to come away with a win because they moved the ball at will against Baltimore's defense. They completely gashed the Ravens, as both DeMarco Murray (14-93) and Felix Jones (18-92, TD) ran right at Ray Lewis, who was terrible yet again when he was in the game (more on this later). Murray would've enjoyed a monstrous afternoon if he didn't leave with a foot sprain. It's just a reminder of how brittle Murray is.    Murray wasn't the only star player who got hurt. Haloti Ngata was banged up and limping around, while Lardarius Webb suffered a torn ACL. Oh, and then there was Lewis, who tore his triceps. Lewis could be out for the year.    As for the Ravens, they had success throwing the ball against Dallas' struggling secondary. Joe Flacco went 17-of-26 for 234 yards and a touchdown. His score went to Torrey Smith (2-24), but Anquan Boldin was the bigger factor."

   "comment":"Torrey Smith back in Week 3. A couple of years ago, the Bengals had a very spirted performance for defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, who lost his wife. There are many other examples of this, including Brett Favre's memorable victory on Monday Night Football after his dad died. As for the Raiders? They can't even say they gave any sort of effort. It was pathetic. Oakland allowed the offensively challenged Ravens' scoring attack to do whatever it wanted. Baltimore picked up 419 yards of offense. Meanwhile, the Raiders once again killed themselves with stupid mistakes. They committed 10 penalties. On 1 instance, they were guilty of an offensive pass interference in the end zone, which was kind of bogus, but it didn't matter because Carson Palmer overthrew an open Brandon Myers by a mile. Earlier, Palmer tripped over his lineman's feet while going for it on a 4th-and-1 at midfield on the opening drive. The Raiders had no answer for Joe Flacco and Baltimore's downfield passing attack. Flacco went 21-of-33 for 341 yards, 3 touchdowns and a fluky interception that was deflected and popped into the air. Oakland failed to sack him a single time, and because of this, Flacco was able to locate his receivers deep down the field on numerous occasions. He completed 5 passes of 26-plus yards.    One such long reception went to Torrey Smith for a 47-yard touchdown. Smith also had another touchdown from 20 yards out - and those were his only receptions of the afternoon.

Joe Flacco had a major headache dealing with Cleveland's pass rush; the Browns swarmed the backfield all afternoon. They had just 2 sacks - including 1 by Barkevious Mingo that helped push the Ravens out of field goal position - but that's misleading because they were dominant in the trenches. Flacco, however, willed his team to victory with a very strong second half. His overall numbers weren't very impressive - 22-of-33, 211 yards and a touchdown - but he misfired on just 2 attempts after intermission; he was 10-of-12 for 102 yards and the score in the third and 4.h quarters.    The big news for Baltimore's offense was Ray Rice's hip flexor strain. He had just 36 yards on 13 carries prior to exiting with the injury. Fortunately, Rice should be OK; it's sounding like there's a chance he could be active next week. If not, the Ravens will be happy to roll with Bernard Pierce again. The second-year back mustered 57 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries.

Roethlisberger had 1 of his trademark plays in the third quarter after Terrell Suggs had missed a tackle on a potential sack and Roethlisberger took off on a 19 yard run. Suggs came back to get a sack a few plays later, but a Elvis Dumervil face mask took away a Haloti Ngata sack on a third down. That drive ended in a Pittsburgh field goal.

   "comment":"Torrey Smith (2-74; 1 drop) to torch the struggling Antonio Cromartie.Smith was 4-of-15 for 42 yards and an interception. It seems like he hits a new low each week. - The Jets, at that point in the game, were just 1-of-12 on third downs. They achieved 3 first downs in the opening half. - New York was outgained, 212-73, in the first half. The team mustered only 137 net yards at that aforementioned point in the final period. - Greg Salas was the only Jet receiver to finish with more than 1 catch. He logged 2 receptions for 48 yards. I listed Smith's numbers at that particular stage because he compiled some junk yardage in the final few minutes when the Ravens stopped caring. He ultimately finished 9-of-22 for 127 yards and 2 picks. He also caught a 13-yard pass on the second drive, as New York showed tons of Wildcat formations early on, with Joshua Cribbs taking plenty of snaps. Cribbs went 1-of-2 for 13 yards and also had 20 rushing yards on 5 scrambles. Smith could be benched next week, by the way. Rex Ryan was non-committal on whether Smith would get the nod versus the Dolphins.    The Jets didn't run the ball well. Both "

   "comment":"Torrey Smith was a mild disappointment, snagging 3 balls for 50 yards. Smith, but he was off the mark for the most part. It didn't help him that the offensive line couldn't pass protect or run block, or do anything correctly, but Flacco looked like 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for most of this contest. Flacco ended up 35-of-62 for 345 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That stat line is misleading, though Flacco did get into a rhythm in the second half. However, he screwed up on numerous occasions and took unnecessary sacks. A sack actually ended the game, but the play that most sticks out occurred just prior to intermission. With limited time remaining on the clock, Flacco scrambled to avoid pressure. The coaches yelled at him to throw the ball away, but he ran around like an idiot instead. Time ultimately ran out, as Baltimore screwed up a chance to kick a field goal.    Flacco's sole score went to Steve Smith, who found the end zone on an 80-yard touchdown where he muscled defenders away. Smith finished with 7 grabs for 118 yards, though those numbers are bogus because most of them came on 1 play. Smith was highly inefficient for most of the afternoon.    "

   "comment":"Torrey Smith was targeted 8 times, but had another dud outing (2-25).    Flacco's sole score went to Smith drawn pass interference, the clutch Justin Tucker delivered a game-winning field goal for Baltimore. The Browns and Ravens played pretty evenly, as the latter won the yardage battle by only 2. Baltimore had no answer for the pass, while Cleveland struggled with defending the run. The Raven backs combined for 154 yards on 29 carries despite Bernard Pierce's absence. Cleveland did have a big defensive stand where they stopped both Baltimore runners, but it ultimately did not matter because the visitor prevailed.    Brian Hoyer played well in this loss. He misfired just 6 times, going 19-of-25 for 290 yards and a touchdown. He had a stupid moment where he threw what briefly looked like a second score, but was flagged for an illegal forward pass because he was 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Hoyer had another pass that was wiped out by penalty when he hit Johnny Manziel - on a trick play in which Manziel pretended to go to the sideline to talk to Kyle Shanahan - for a big gain. However, the play was nullified by an illegal shift.    Hoyer's sole score went to Miles Austin (6-51), but his main target was Andrew Hawkins, who reeled in 7 of 10 targets for 87 yards. This was despite Jordan Cameron's return to the lineup. Cameron had just 1 catch for 23 yards, but made it count, as it came on a second-and-20 that resulted in a scoring drive. Cameron also drew a pass interference in the end zone on that very same possession.    The Browns had their 2 backs split carries. Terrance West (12-36) started, but was outgained by Isaiah Crowell (11-55). Both scored touchdowns.    As mentioned, the Ravens had so much success on the ground. Justin Forsett was expected to start with Pierce missing in action, but he received just 11 carries compared to 18 that went to Lorenzo Taliaferro. Both looked good, with Taliaferro outgaining Forsett, 91-63. The former found the end zone.    Joe Flacco had a devastating afternoon; not that he played poorly or anything, but because he lost 1 of his favorite targets, Dennis Pitta, who was carted off when his leg gave out on him. He wasn't contacted; he just collapsed. Pitta was later diagonsed with a dislocated hip - the same 1 that caused him to miss most of 2013. Pitta might be done for the season. Flacco still managed to persevere, finishing 19-of-31 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. It must be noted that he converted on just 8 of 16 attempts following intermission when he didn't have Pitta at his disposal. However, he made that clutch completion to Steve Smith at the very end, which allowed Tucker to ice this game.    Steve Smith was once again Baltimore's leading receiver. He caught 5 passes for 101 yards. "

Jacoby Jones then muffed a punt. Flacco took a sack on a 4.h-and-1 on the Indianapolis 5-yard line and then fired an interception because he didn't see Vontae Davis. Flacco, who had no time to throw, went 22-of-38 for 235 yards and the pick. Only 4 of his teammates saw more than 2 targets go their way: Justin Forsett (7 catches, 55 yards), Torrey Smith (3-38), Steve Smith (5-54) and Owen Daniels (5-70)."

Flacco had some other near-picks, including 1 where a Cincinnati defender bobbled 1 of his passes in the first half. Having said that, this loss wasn't all on Flacco. Smith, as mentioned, suffered a concussion. He also lost 2 starting offensive linemen - Eugene Monroe and Marshal Yanda; 2 of his best - to injuries. Some of Flacco's receivers dropped passes as well. This includes Kamar Aiken, who let the ball fall through his hands on 4.h-and-goal during the opening half. Despite this ineptitude, it appeared as though Flacco won this game when he fired a deep bomb to Steve Smith, who caught the pass and ran into the end zone. However, the officials called offensive pass interference and negated the play. Smith did appear to push off a bit, but the CBS color analyst was skeptical, calling safety George Iloka a flopper. Tony Dungy agreed later Sunday evening.    Smith's nullified touchdown ruined his fantasy day. He saw 9 targets, but snared only 3 of them for 35 yards. Only Lorenzo Taliaferro (2 catches, 42 yards) and Michael Campanaro (3-40) had more yardage. Torrey Smith didn't log a single reception before leaving the game with a concussion.    Bernard Pierce was a healthy scratch in this game. Taliaferro worked as the short-yardage back, scoring twice while tallying 27 yards on 7 carries. It's a shame for Smith hold.    Giovani Bernard didn't find much running room, but managed to score once. He gained 45 yards on 16 carries otherwise. Unfortunately, he left the game with a hip injury. Jeremy Hill had even less success, mustering just 25 yards on 10 attempts.    Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker Emmanuel Lamur. The second was a weird 1. as Torrey Smith appeared to have suffered a concussion and screwed up on the play.

   "comment":"Torrey Smith was next (4-63), and he snared 1 of Flacco's touchdowns. He also drew a pass interference. Meanwhile, Smith out, Brown wreaked havoc on the opposition, accumulating a whopping 11 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown. He also drew a pass interference flag. Brown's score was a thing of beauty, as he got into space and made several Ravens miss.    The Steelers did not run the ball very well. LeGarrette Blount and Le'Veon Bell each had 10 carries for 23 and 20 yards, respectively. Bell made up for it with 5 catches for 38 receiving yards and a touchdown. Blount, meanwhile, had an eventful evening. He had a minimal gain on a short carry in the third quarter when Terrell Suggs made a horribly dirty hit, going for the back of the big back's knees. A fight ensued, and Suggs was whistled for a personal foul. Blount later drew another flag of the same sort of Elvis Dumervil, prompting the official to stop the game and threaten both coaches that they would eject players. This calmed everyone down until Raven tight end Crockett Gilmore spiked the ball after a touchdown that made the game 36-23 with 3 minutes remaining, prompting the crowd to chant Ravens suck! Ravens suck! And as if there wasn't enough bad blood, Pittsburgh ran up the score when Roethlisberger went play-action and hit Matt Spaeth for a touchdown, up 13 with just 2 minutes remaining. This incited yet another skirmish that resulted in more personal-foul flags. It was a classic Baltimore-Pittsburgh battle.    While Pittsburgh's offensive has made great leaps recently, the defense looked improved in this contest. The unit was able to put great pressure on Joe Flacco. It sacked him 4 times, but that number easily could've been twice as much. James Harrison, who was retired slightly more than a month ago, was a monster Sunday evening, registering 2 sacks. Unfortunately, the Steelers lost Ryan Shazier and Troy Polamalu to injuries. Flacco was able to compile some junk yardage to make his numbers look better - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but he struggled to complete half of his passes during meaningful action. In fact, he was just 9-of-17 going into halftime. Flacco simply had no time to throw; his pick came when he was under pressure. He heaved up a desperate pass that was picked off, and the Steelers capitalized with 1 of Roethlisberger's aerial scores.    With the pressure he was facing, Flacco had to constantly dump the ball off to Justin Forsett, who led the team with 67 receiving yards off 5 catches. Torrey Smith was next (4-63), and he snared 1 of Flacco's touchdowns. He also drew a pass interference. Meanwhile, "

Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings.

Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65).

He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. Antonio Gates (7-83) was worked on early before the Ravens took him away from Will Hill. Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65).

His best catch came along the sideline when he impressively got both feet inbounds.    Joe Flacco was nearly perfect in terms of completion percentage, going 25-of-33 for 269 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and the aforementioned interception. He misfired just thrice following intermission, and 1 of the incompletions was a play that was initially ruled a lost fumble inside the red zone. The Ravens were able to maintain possession following a replay review, and Smith dropped a touchdown, which was followed by a Joe Flacco interception when he threw the ball up for grabs in Smith's direction. Baltimore picked things up after that, however. Smith went nuts, as he perhaps had some motivation for revenge, given that he used to go against "

Anquan Boldin remains Kaepernick's favorite target, as he threw it his way 10 times, of which he caught 6 of them for 60 yards and a touchdown, and also had an uncharacteristic drop near the end zone. Boldin will need similar game scripts to be a force in fantasy, but he will, at least, lead the 49ers in targets.

With the 49ers up 13-3, Flacco was picked off by forcing a pass to a covered receiver. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite cut in front of the ball, and that gave the 49ers another field goal. The Ravens answered with a field goal drive of their own. The 49ers took a 16-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Flacco threw an awful pass. It was late down the middle of the field, off his back foot, and up for grabs like a punt, and dropped in to San Francisco cornerback Kenneth Acker. A pop pass to Anquan Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal. Acker found that Flacco giveth and taketh away, as Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but Justin Tucker slipped on the field goal attempt and it hit off the upright no good. San Francisco took advantage again of the Ravens' weak secondary as Kaepernick laid out a pretty 51-yard bomb that Boldin made a superb catch to Baltimore's 25-yard line. A few plays later, Quinton Patton got wide open in the end zone after Shareece Wright fell down, and Kaepernick hit him for a 21-yard score. A missed 2.point attempt had the 49ers' lead at 25-13. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Ravens weren't quite done as they drove down the field. On 4.h-and-goal, Kamar Aiken made a leaping catch for a score. Baltimore got the ball back with a little over a minute remaining, and needing to go 80 yards, but the 49ers' defense came up with a stop led by Eric Reid breaking up a pass in the end zone on the final play of the game.    Kaepernick was 16-of-27 for 340 yards with 2 touchdowns. He threw the ball best when he scrambled out of the pocket. Don't expect similar performances going forward, as Baltimore's secondary has given up big outings to all quarterbacks.    Baltimore's run defense held Carlos Hyde to 55 yards on 21 carries. Hyde appeared to injure his ankle at 1 point, but remained in the game.    Anquan Boldin had 5 receptions for 102 yards. Torrey Smith (3-96) and Quinton Patton (2-38) caught Kaepernick's touchdowns. Most of Smith's production came on his score.    Smith burned new Raven Shareece Wright for a 76-yard touchdown. While he's struggled on some deep throws, Kaepernick threw that bomb perfectly.

   "comment":"Torrey Smith dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which occurred in the end zone. Darren Sproles then fumbled a punt return, setting up a field goal for the Chiefs. Speaking of field goals, Jake Elliott missed a 30-yard kick. The worst mistake came late, when Carson Wentz threw a weird interception that deflected off a helmet. This set up the Chiefs with a short field, and they were able to score a quick touchdown to ice the game.    Still, all the credit should go to the Chiefs, as they were able to produce 27 points against a fierce Philadelphia defense. The Eagles swarmed Alex Smith in the pocket, disrupting plenty of drives. However, Smith made the most of the opportunities he was given on occasion, going 21-of-28 for 251 yards and a touchdown. Smith's best play was when he inexplicably escaped a Vinny Curry sack to scramble for a first down. His 4 rushing attempts went for 21 yards.    Smith's sole score went to Travis Kelce, who hauled in 8 of his 10 targets for 103 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was amazing, seemingly hurdling every Philadelphia defender he could find throughout the afternoon. The numbers would've been surprising prior to the game, given that the Eagles defended tight ends so well last year and were able to shut down Jordan Reed in Week 1. However, the Eagles lost several defensive players throughout the afternoon, including Rodney McLeod. Elsewhere in Kansas City's receiving corps, Chris Conley and Tyreek Hill each caught 4 balls for 55 and 43 yards, respectively.    Kansas City's big star, aside from Kelce, was Kareem Hunt once again. Hunt couldn't get anything going in the opening half - 5 carries, 8 yards - but he finished with 81 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 13 attempts, thanks to a 53-yard burst. Hunt also snatched 3 receptions for 28 receiving yards.    The dark cloud over this victory is Mitch Morse's injury. Morse hurt his foot in the second half, but it's unclear how severe it is. Losing Morse would be enormous going forward, but perhaps he won't be out for long.    Going back to the Eagles, Wentz went 25-of-46 for 333 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned interception. Wentz played well for the most part, but Philadelphia's offense bogged down in Kansas City territory on numerous occasions. It didn't help Wentz that several of his passes were dropped, including 1 potential touchdown.    Wentz led the Eagles in rushing with 55 yards on 4 scrambles. Darren Sproles (10-48) was next, followed by Wendell Smallwood (3-4). If you're wondering where LeGarrette Blount was, he wasn't given a single carry. He touched the ball once, catching a pass for zero yards. Blount isn't a good running back, but he does 1 thing very well. It's unclear why the Eagles aren't giving him any chances in short yardage.    As with the Chiefs, Philadelphia's top gainer in the passing game was the tight end. Zach Ertz caught 5 balls for 97 yards, though 53 of those yards came on a very weird play in which the ball bounced out of Terrance Mitchell's hands. It didn't even look like Mitchell knew where the ball was. Elsewhere, Alshon Jeffery recorded 7 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. Torrey Smith overcame his early drops to catch 4 balls for 66 yards.   Smith dropped a couple of passes, 1 of which occurred in the end zone.

Jeffery had a nice afternoon, battling Janoris Jenkins and catching the crucial pass that set up the Elliott field goal. Jeffery will be an up-and-down fantasy performer, but is a high-end WR2 most weeks. Smith is a boom-or-bust play, but he did well to catch most of his targets on Sunday.

This injury kept him out of the Denver game in Week 9, but it was shocking that he didn't heal up during the bye.    Jay Ajayi broke free for a 70-yard run in the second half, and he would've scored a touchdown had the Cowboys not chased him down just shy of the goal line. Ajayi finished with 91 yards on 7 attempts. LeGarrette Blount (13-57) ran well, too. Corey Clement (6-50) found the end zone.    As great was Wentz was in the second half, Philadelphia's defense was even more dominant. The Eagles pitched a shutout after halftime, as they limited Dallas to just 110 net yards in the second half, which includes some garbage-time yardage. They put tons of pressure on Dak Prescott, as it was once again apparent how much Dallas missed Tyron Smith. The Cowboys gave their left tackle some help this time, but not nearly enough.
