   "comment":"Tomlinson scored the opening touchdown of the game, which established a 10-0 lead for the Chargers, he sat down on the bench, looked at his teammates and said, That was easy. That's exactly how I felt with picking the Chargers to cover the 9. The Raiders were so pathetic, this game was more comical than anything else.    Oakland has many problems, but the prominent ones are lack of discipline and the tendency to make stupid mistakes. That was extremely evident on many occasions in this contest. Let's discuss the team's 3 worst errors on Thursday night: 1. On what would have been a third-and-long deep in San Diego territory, Raiders defensive tackle Tommy Kelly committed a senseless personal foul, giving the Chargers a first down. San Diego went on to score a touchdown. It's a good thing the Raiders didn't spend too much money on Kelly! 2. On the subsequent drive, the Raiders were moving the football efficiently. However, once they ventured into San Diego territory, Kwame Harris, who signed a $16 million deal this offseason, false started. This put JaMarcus Russell into a long-yardage situation. He subsequently threw a pick on second-and-long. As of Nov. 20, Harris led the league with 9 false starts. 3. On another promising drive, the Raiders had a first-and-10 on San Diego's 23. Unfortunately, Darren McFadden committed a personal foul. On the next play, Harris was whistled for a face mask. Oakland was stuck with a second-and-35 on San Diego's 48. Oh, and by the way, McFadden didn't even put his arms up for a pass on a fourth down because he didn't want to get hit. Good thing the Raiders don't have a lot invested in him either!    Oakland's offense was shut out in this game. The team's only touchdown came on a kickoff return by Justin Miller. The Raiders still have only 1 offensive first-half touchdown this season, and it doesn't look like they'll score another 1. That's because JaMarcus Russell, who was 9-of-13, 68 yards, 2 picks and a fumble, left the game in the second quarter with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, but his status is still unclear. Andrew Walter picked up where Russell left off, and finished 8-of-17, 61 yards and an interception.    Once again, the only target of note for Oakland was Zach Miller, who had 8 grabs for 64 yards.    Justin Fargas rushed for 50 yards on 12 carries. Darren McFadden had 8 total yards of offense on 1 rush attempt and 2 receptions.    LaDainian Tomlinson didn't manage 100 rushing yards against the Raiders again, but he tallied 91 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.    San Diego moved the chains primarily through the air with long passes to "

   "comment":"Tomlinson's demise have clearly been exaggerated. Tomlinson somehow gained 96 yards and 2 touchdowns on 24 carries. This really came out of nowhere, and it was shocking because the Eagles came into this contest ranked second against the run. It's amazing what can happen when you actually have quality blocking, eh? Congratulations to Tomlinson, by the way, who passed Marcus Allen for third all-time in career touchdowns with 146. Tomlinson is only behind Jerry Rice (208) and our pal Emmitt Smith (175).    I promised I'd get to Boger, and I'm keeping my word. Though Boger called shady holding penalties throughout the contest, he didn't catch my attention until the final drive. Boger thrice let extra seconds tick off the clock. One example: DeSean Jackson caught a pass along the sidelines with 21 seconds remaining. As the play ended, the clock ticked away to 20 and 19 seconds. I was hoping Boger would see this and ask for the time to be reset to 20 or 21 seconds. Instead, Boger asked for the game clock to be reset to 18 seconds! Again, this happened 3 times! Boger's children better receive some great Christmas gifts because their father clearly made tons of money on this game. For thoughts on Patriots-Colts and Ravens-Browns, check out my updated   "

He had a nice 10-yard run from his own goal line, but was otherwise ineffective outside of the red zone. He just doesn't have the blocking, and Dallas' defense was geared up to stop the rush in this contest.    Unlike the Cowboys, the Chargers had some creative play-calling. On 1 play, they came out in a Wildcat formation with Tomlinson in the shotgun. They ran a double reverse, giving Rivers the ball. Rivers launched a deep throw downfield toward Jackson. The pass fell incomplete, but drew a 38-yard pass-interference flag.    Two last notes: First, the officials were terrible in this contest. They screwed up on multiple pass interference calls on both sides, including an obvious infraction where Floyd was blatantly tackled by Dallas defensive backs. The refs didn't see it, which really cost the Chargers because Rivers tossed a pick on the next play. And second, "

Sanchez was asked to roll out of the pocket quite a bit, and while it worked early, the Raiders adjusted and shut it down. It was really an uneven game for him even with the big passing numbers. Rookie Jeremy Kerley returned a punt 53 yards only to watch Sanchez give it away on an interception to Tyvon Branch. The second quarter was a scoring frenzy. To be honest, I had trouble keeping up after watching the defensive struggle earlier in the day. Tomlinson caught a touchdown pass to put the Jets on top 14-7. Raider fans used to seeing Tomlinson in a Chargers uniform saw another vintage performance from him as he piled up 154 yards on 11 touches. McFadden answered with a few tough runs for 17, 15 and 6 yards to get Oakland just close enough for "
