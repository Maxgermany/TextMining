Not only did the Dolphins blow a 24-3 lead, they also allowed a pick-six to lose the cover. But it gets worse... Miami somehow put together a drive to get down to the Saints 26.

  "comment":"Tracy Porter) all to injury by the middle of the third quarter. The Bears were up when these injuries began taking place, so I have to imagine that they may have won. Instead, the Giants have become quite possibly the worst 7-3 team of all time.    The Giants are 7-3, but came close to a let-down loss against Chicago. The Bears outplayed New York in the first half as the Giants were flat, but in the second half of the game, New York's defense pitched a shutout to keep the Giants in prime position for a wild-card slot. The Bears (2-8) are already out of the playoff race, so losing maintains their draft position.    The Bears struck first early in the first quarter as they moved down the field before ",
