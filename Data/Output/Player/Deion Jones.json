   "comment":"Deion Jones caught a deflected pass off the hands of Dexter McCluster, and Jones returned the interception 42 yards to the Chargers' 10-yard line to set up a second Bryant field goal. The Chargers responded with a field goal drive of their own. Ryan then lofted in a perfect 50-yard bomb to Jones, and on third-and-13, Ryan threw a frozen rope to Jacob Tamme for a 17-yard touchdown. Atlanta expanded its lead with Tevin Coleman (8-64) exploding down the field for a 30-yard touchdown. Right after a Brooks Reed sack, Vic Beasley strip-sacked Rivers. Adrian Clayborn scooped up the ball and rolled into the end zone to give the Falcons a 27-10 lead. Rivers came right back to hit Tyrell Williams for 38 yards in busted coverage. A 21-yard pass to Travis Benjamin (4-54) got San Diego in the red zone at the 2-minute warning. A bullet to Hunter Henry (1-16) moved the ball to the 3-yard line, and Gordon ran in the touchdown to cut the Falcons' lead to 27-17 at the half. Midway through the third quarter, Rivers led a field goal drive to cut the point deficit to 7. Atlanta responded with runs from Devonta Freeman of 15, 14, and 8 yards to set up another Bryant field goal. San Diego then marched down the field as Rivers picked apart the Falcons' defense. He used Gordon as a receiver on a number of plays, including a 5.yard touchdown toss. That cut the Falcons' lead to 30-27 with 6 minutes remaining. San Diego's defense came through as Denzel Perryman picked off Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Jones, but the drive was held to a Matt Bryant 42-yard field goal. Atlanta was quickly set up for more points as Deion Jones caught a deflected pass off the hands of Dexter McCluster, and Jones returned the interception 42 yards to the Chargers' 10-yard line to set up a second Bryant field goal."

   "comment":"Deion Jones had a pretty good game, and his athleticism was on display. He definitely has the ability to be a good player in coverage, and as his instincts improve, he should only get better. Pass-rushers Jones (3-29) was a disappointment. He hurt his knee at some point in the contest, and did not look comfortable out on the field. His injury will definitely be something to monitor in the future. While Jones had a tough game, Mohamed Sanu put together a really strong performance. Sanu saw 10 targets from Ryan and caught 9 of them. He turned those 9 balls into 84 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Sanu is worth consideration as a bench receiver, but he should only be started in favorable matchups. That said, if Jones is out, Sanu could end up being a WR3 due to the volume of targets he would see. Aside from Sanu, Gabriel (3-68, 1 TD) and "

It was Goff's second interception of the half, but the first 1 was not his fault as it came on a deflected pass that Jones, but it didn't matter as they dominated Los Angeles. Through 3 quarters, Atlanta was up 42-0, as the Rams' offense was horrible at not turning the ball over and the defense was incapable of stopping Matt Ryan. Atlanta maintained its positioning with Tampa Bay for the NFC South, while Los Angeles will have to win its final 3 in order to maintain Jeff Fisher's 7-9 standard. After losing their ninth game of the season, this marks the 10th straight year that the Rams will be under .500.    The blowout started on the opening kickoff, as the Rams muffed the catch and the ball rolled around before Paul Worrilow recovered it for the Falcons at the Rams' 3-yard line. The next play saw Ryan hit a back-shoulder throw to Justin Hardy for a touchdown. Atlanta then put another touchdown on the board as Ryan used 5 different weapons with completions to Aldrick Robinson (3-42), Levine Toiliolo (1-19) and a 6.yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. The Falcons added to their lead when Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff demonstrated poor field vision, throwing a pass right to Deion Jones for an interception. Goff stared down his primary read on the play, and Jones undercut the route to return the pick 33 yards for a touchdown. It was Goff's second interception of the half, but the first 1 was not his fault as it came on a deflected pass that "
