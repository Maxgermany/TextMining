His injury will definitely be something to monitor in the future. While Jones had a tough game, Mohamed Sanu put together a really strong performance. Sanu saw 10 targets from Ryan and caught 9 of them. He turned those 9 balls into 84 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Sanu is worth consideration as a bench receiver, but he should only be started in favorable matchups. That said, if Jones is out, Sanu could end up being a WR3 due to the volume of targets he would see. Aside from Sanu, Gabriel (3-68, 1 TD) and "

Atlanta maintained its positioning with Tampa Bay for the NFC South, while Los Angeles will have to win its final 3 in order to maintain Jeff Fisher's 7-9 standard. After losing their ninth game of the season, this marks the 10th straight year that the Rams will be under .500.    The blowout started on the opening kickoff, as the Rams muffed the catch and the ball rolled around before Paul Worrilow recovered it for the Falcons at the Rams' 3-yard line. The next play saw Ryan hit a back-shoulder throw to Justin Hardy for a touchdown. Atlanta then put another touchdown on the board as Ryan used 5 different weapons with completions to Aldrick Robinson (3-42), Levine Toiliolo (1-19) and a 6.yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. The Falcons added to their lead when Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff demonstrated poor field vision, throwing a pass right to Deion Jones for an interception. Goff stared down his primary read on the play, and Jones undercut the route to return the pick 33 yards for a touchdown. It was Goff's second interception of the half, but the first 1 was not his fault as it came on a deflected pass that "
