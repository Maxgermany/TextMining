   "comment":"Jonathan Goodwin hold on a 15-yard Kaepernick completion on a 3rd-and-10 situation.    The officials must be mentioned. They were terrible. Some of the calls were awful, and they robbed the Rams of about 10 seconds at the end of overtime by incorrectly spotting the ball. Oh, and then there's the minute or so that completely disappeared off the clock because the time kept running during a stoppage. It's almost like Roger Goodell invited the replacement refs back for this contest.   "

   "comment":"Jonathan Goodwin early in the contest and never looked the same. The Saints were up 13-0 when Goodwin left the contest and Graham got banged up, and they struggled to do much offensively afterward until overtime. The fact that they preserved under these conditions - it's extremely difficult for coaches to make in-game adjustments to key injured players - might be considered impressive. However, considering their opponent, they probably should've won big regardless.    "
