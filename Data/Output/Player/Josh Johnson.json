Unfortunately for Johnson (26-of-50, 240 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs), Tampa Bay was simply overmatched here. It should be noted how costly Johnson's 3 picks were. Two were thrown in the red zone. The other was deep in his own territory, which led to an Eagles touchdown.    Raheem Morris' brilliant plan to give "
