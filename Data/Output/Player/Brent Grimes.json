   "comment":"Grimes took 94 yards back for a score. Only 1 of the picks wasn't Dalton's fault - the third 1 was a drop by Mohamed Sanu that popped into the arms of a Miami defender. Sanu was dreadful - more on that later - but Dalton took a sack on what was the decisive safety when Cameron Wake (3 sacks) beat struggling guard Kevin Zeitler. Despite the loss, the Bengals are still in good shape, record-wise. They fell behind the Patriots and Colts, and are now the No. 4 seed in the AFC, but they still maintain a big lead in the division. Unfortunately, this game was quite costly in that Geno Atkins tore his ACL. Atkins is 1 of the top defensive players in the NFL, and he will sorely be missed going forward.    A.J. Green and Giovani Bernard carried Cincinnati's offense. Green caught 11 passes for 128 yards despite going up against Grimes. His only mistake was dropping a pass on third down that would've moved the chains. Bernard, meanwhile, rushed for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 9 carries to go along with 4 catches for 25 receiving yards. One of Bernard's scores, a 35-yarder, was unbelievable. If you didn't catch it on SportsCenter, make sure you do; Bernard broke out of 3 tackles, including 1 sure 1 by Grimes, and then reversed field. He then sprinted forward and juked several more Dolphins - including Grimes again - and somersaulted into the end zone. It was absolutely breathtaking. But staying with Bernard, I have an issue with how Cincinnati used him. It's inexcusable that Bernard received 9 carries when "

Davis (32-132) and Joe McKnight (6-64) were the difference-makers for the Kansas City offense. Former No. 1-overall pick Eric Fisher had some bad plays in pass protection, but he progressively did better in run blocking as the game wore on.    Tannehill was 21-of-43 for 205 yards with a touchdown. Lamar Miller ran well for the Dolphins with 108 yards on only 15 carries. Joe Philbin let his team down by not calling more running plays for Miller and letting Tannehill drop back to pass far too often behind his weak offensive line.    Dontari Poe was awesome for the Chiefs, recording 1.5 sacks, 4 tackles, batting a pass and drawing a holding penalty. Hali and Houston (1 sack each) were very good. Allen Bailey, Dee Ford and cornerback Chris Owens also stood out for Kansas City.    The Dolphins' front 7 did well in pass rushing, but struggled to defend the run. Jelani Jenkins was all over the field, as he had 14 tackles with 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble. Ben Grimes held Dwayne Bowe (3-32) in check."

   "comment":"Grimes was able to snare it with an amazing 1.handed catch. It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because DeAndre Levy dropped an easy interception in the end zone. - A field goal attempt by Detroit was blocked. Dion Jordan scooped up the ball and returned it to the Lions' 5-yard line. The Dolphins immediately converted with a Tannehill touchdown to Mike Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because "

   "comment":"Grimes, and a typical great catch by DeAndre Hopkins, who leapt over Peters for the score. The Chiefs responded with a field goal drive thanks to receptions by Kelce, Maclin, and a run by Knile Davis (6-16). On the next drive, Maclin got open for a 20-yard catch to set up another Kansas City field goal. Justin Houston then strip-sacked Hoyer with the ball recovered by the Chiefs. For the very next play, Smith threw a 7.yard touchdown pass to Charles. Before the half, the Texans tacked on a field goal to make it 27-9 at intermission, but the Houston defense had allowed 221 yards across the first 2 quarters. In the third quarter, Washington (6-105) beat Peters for a 32-yard reception, but the drive stalled at the 10-yard line when Dontari Poe blew up a 4.h-and-1 for no gain. Both offenses struggled in the second half until Mallett came in. Mallett quickly drove the ball down the field, firing some lasers to Hopkins, including a touchdown pass and 2.point conversion to his stud receiver. Mallett moved the ball for another field goal drive, but Maclin recovered an onside-kick attempt to clinch the win for Kansas City.    Smith completed 22-of-33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Charles had 57 yards rushing on 16 carries with 46 yards receiving and a touchdown on 5 receptions. Kelce (6-106) and Maclin (5-52) led the Chiefs through the air. The Texans had no answer for Kelce, and he looks poised for a huge year.    Hoyer was 18-of-34 for 236 yards with 1 score and a pick. He struggled to see the field and was inept overall. Mallett should definitely be the starter in Week 2 at Carolina. He was 8-of-13 for 98 yards with a score on 2 drives. Hopkins (9-98) was awesome and would have produced even more if the Texans had gone with Mallett earlier or all game. He'll continue to produce massive numbers each week because the Texan quarterbacks don't have anyone else to target.    Alfred Blue gained 42 yards, but was given just 9 carries. Brent Grimes was mixed in too much, making Blue an underwhelming fantasy option. Arian Foster will be back soon anyway.    The Chiefs' front 7 really played well. "

Despite Grimes leaving the game with an injury, Fitzpatrick had issues moving the chains aerially, but was able to pick up some first downs with his legs. On 1 play, he somehow got out of a sack and was able to rush for a gain of 12. "

He had a terrific outing, breaking free for a 48-yard touchdown burst early, thanks to some miserable tackling efforts by the Miami players. He finished 112 yards and a score on 16 attempts. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, "

   "comment":"Grimes dropped the ball, killing Tampa's chances of mounting a comeback because the Cardinals ended up scoring a touchdown on that drive, putting the game out of reach.    Speaking of Johnson, he didn't do much besides that long reception, managing just 45 yards on 12 carries. He was given just 2 attempts following halftime, as the Cardinals correctly decided to preserve him. Johnson also caught 3 balls for 98 receiving yards.    "
