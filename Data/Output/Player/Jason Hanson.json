   "comment":"Jason Hanson to kick a 41-yard field goal. Though the Seahawks carelessly fell into a 17-0 hole, they did a great job of sticking with their game plan and not panicking. Hasselbeck didn't toss another pick, finishing 39-of-51 for 329 yards and a touchdown. He easily shredded Detroit's secondary, and for the first time in weeks, he didn't have to worry about pressure because of the Lions' horrible defense. Hasselbeck was sacked only once. And by the way, congratulations to Hasselbeck, who became the all-time Seahawks leader in completions. Of course Dick Stockton was too senile at the time to talk about this; he probably thought Dave Krieg, the previous record-holder, was still under center.    Amazingly, 6 Seahawks had 5 receptions or more. Here's the list: "
