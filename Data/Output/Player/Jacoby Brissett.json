   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett stepped in and wasn't nearly as effective. He went 6-of-9 for 92 yards, but most of his plays featured screens and play-action fakes. The Dolphins were able to roar back, turning a 31-3 deficit into a 31-24 margin with 6 minutes remaining. It appeared as though they'd be able to tie the game, and all they'd have to do was stop the Patriots and their third-string quarterback just once and then score again versus a tired defense. The Dolphins, however, couldn't stop a New England offense featuring "

  "comment":"Jacoby Brissett put his team ahead early in the second frame, as rookie Artie Burns bit on a double move by Donte Moncrief, which helped Brissett connect for a 60-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead. Brissett continued to be inconsistent, but he also flashed big-play ability, as he did with his strike to Moncrief, and then again, this time in the third quarter, when he hit Chester Rogers on a 61-yard touchdown. The big plays are there, but he still makes too many mistakes to hold off better teams like the Steelers. For most of this game, the Colts looked like the better team. Ben Roethlisberger was errant on multiple deep passes; the Steelers were constantly backing up due to holding penatlies; and the Colts were taking away Roethlisberger's first reads. It wasn't until the reality of their impending loss took hold, that the Steelers fought back into this game. After Brissett's touchdown to Rogers, the Colts had a 17-3 lead midway through the third-quarter, and with the Steelers on the ropes, they finally punched back with a drive led by Le'Veon Bell and Roethlisberger to Juju Smith-Schuster, as they were the only 2 Steelers players to touch the ball on a 8 play, 78-yard drive, which ended in a 7.yard touchdown to Smith-Schuster. With Antonio Brown getting the bulk of the secondary's attention, it was Smith-Schuster's time to step up, which he did. On the day, Smith-Schuster caught 5-of-7 targets for 97 yards and a touchdown, leading the team. Smith-Schuster's touchdown should have brought the Steelers within 7 points, but Chris Boswell's extra point was blocked and returned just yards from the end zone and 2 points for the Colts. This was a close game, and the hustle by the Steelers to get him down was a huge play. The Colts managed to hold the Steelers scoreless on the next 2 possessions, as they held to a 17-9 lead in the 4.h quarter, but Jacoby Brissett's inconsistencies hurt him, as he tossed an interception deep in Indianapolis territory, which wasn't totally on him, but it was a ball he probably shouldn't have thrown.
