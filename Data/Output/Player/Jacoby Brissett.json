The Dolphins were able to roar back, turning a 31-3 deficit into a 31-24 margin with 6 minutes remaining. It appeared as though they'd be able to tie the game, and all they'd have to do was stop the Patriots and their third-string quarterback just once and then score again versus a tired defense. The Dolphins, however, couldn't stop a New England offense featuring "

   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett, who was making his first professional start. No 1 expected it, but the Patriots dominated this contest from start to finish. Bill Belichick and his staff created the perfect game plan, comprised of a dominant defense that kept the Texans from crossing midfield until the middle of the third quarter, and an offense that put the rookie quarterback in position to succeed. Combine both of those facets with some terrific special-teams play - the Patriots recovered 2 fumbles and constantly pinned the Texans inside their own 15 - and it turned out to be an easy, 27-0 victory for New England.    Brissett had a solid debut. He made some mistakes, namely a few overthrows on some deep shots and not recognizing when some players were open, but he did a good job overall, considering the circumstances. Brissett was battling a very tough defense with just 3 days to prepare, and yet he made enough quality plays to ensure the Patriots prevailed. Brissett went 11-of-19 for 103 yards, but did most of his damage on the ground. He scrambled 8 times for 48 rushing yards and a touchdown. Brissett's passing was inconsistent, but he made some key strikes on third down, including a 27-yarder to "

He's obviously not any sort of long-term plan for the Colts because Luck will return at some point, but perhaps that means Indianapolis can trade Brissett for something viable in the near future. That, or perhaps the Colts will hold on to Brissett, just in case Luck continues to suffer injuries. Brissett finished 17-of-24 for 259 yards and a passing touchdown. He also had 2 rushing scores. Brissett was precise for the most part and averaged more than 10 yards per attempt, which is just amazing, considering that he hasn't been on the roster for very long. Brissett made just 1 glaring mistake, as he was nearly intercepted in the end zone prior to gaining his first touchdown. Brissett bounced back, however, and only misfired on just 2 other occasions in the opening half. Granted, Cleveland's abomination of a secondary made things easy for him - "

   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett was sacked a whopping 10 times. The Bengals had also just lost badly to division rival Pittsburgh on the road, so back at home against a weak opponent was what the doctor ordered, that is, until the order got there and the Colts got a big helping of horse hoof in their guts. Thankfully for the Bengals, a last-minute transplant of the ball from the Colts' possession to the Bengals, gave them a much-needed win. This game started well for the Bengals, with 2 sacks of Brissett, forcing the punt, which set up a day of bad offensive line play from both teams. This includes special teams, as the Bengals blocked a punt to set up their first field goal and the Colts blocked a field goal a couple drives later. Brissett ended up getting sacked 4 times, while Dalton was sacked 3 times, but pressured more often than a poor Indianapolis pass rush should be able to accomplish.    The Colts' passing offense was dink and dunking their way all day, but effectively, as tight end Jack Doyle caught 12-of-14 targets for 121 yards and 1 touchdown. His second-most targeted receiver, "

The Texans missed a field goal to spoil a drive, and that turned out to be a huge play in the game as the Texans had to go for a touchdown late in the 4.h quarter rather than a game-tying field goal.

   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett put his team ahead early in the second frame, as rookie Artie Burns bit on a double move by Donte Moncrief, which helped Brissett connect for a 60-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead. Brissett continued to be inconsistent, but he also flashed big-play ability, as he did with his strike to Moncrief, and then again, this time in the third quarter, when he hit Chester Rogers on a 61-yard touchdown. The big plays are there, but he still makes too many mistakes to hold off better teams like the Steelers. For most of this game, the Colts looked like the better team. Ben Roethlisberger was errant on multiple deep passes; the Steelers were constantly backing up due to holding penatlies; and the Colts were taking away Roethlisberger's first reads. It wasn't until the reality of their impending loss took hold, that the Steelers fought back into this game. After Brissett's touchdown to Rogers, the Colts had a 17-3 lead midway through the third-quarter, and with the Steelers on the ropes, they finally punched back with a drive led by Le'Veon Bell and Roethlisberger to Juju Smith-Schuster, as they were the only 2 Steelers players to touch the ball on a 8 play, 78-yard drive, which ended in a 7.yard touchdown to Smith-Schuster. With Antonio Brown getting the bulk of the secondary's attention, it was Smith-Schuster's time to step up, which he did. On the day, Smith-Schuster caught 5-of-7 targets for 97 yards and a touchdown, leading the team. Smith-Schuster's touchdown should have brought the Steelers within 7 points, but Chris Boswell's extra point was blocked and returned just yards from the end zone and 2 points for the Colts. This was a close game, and the hustle by the Steelers to get him down was a huge play. The Colts managed to hold the Steelers scoreless on the next 2 possessions, as they held to a 17-9 lead in the 4.h quarter, but Jacoby Brissett's inconsistencies hurt him, as he tossed an interception deep in Indianapolis territory, which wasn't totally on him, but it was a ball he probably shouldn't have thrown.
