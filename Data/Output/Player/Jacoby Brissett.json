   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett, who was making his first professional start. No 1 expected it, but the Patriots dominated this contest from start to finish. Bill Belichick and his staff created the perfect game plan, comprised of a dominant defense that kept the Texans from crossing midfield until the middle of the third quarter, and an offense that put the rookie quarterback in position to succeed. Combine both of those facets with some terrific special-teams play - the Patriots recovered 2 fumbles and constantly pinned the Texans inside their own 15 - and it turned out to be an easy, 27-0 victory for New England.    Brissett had a solid debut. He made some mistakes, namely a few overthrows on some deep shots and not recognizing when some players were open, but he did a good job overall, considering the circumstances. Brissett was battling a very tough defense with just 3 days to prepare, and yet he made enough quality plays to ensure the Patriots prevailed. Brissett went 11-of-19 for 103 yards, but did most of his damage on the ground. He scrambled 8 times for 48 rushing yards and a touchdown.

   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett strip-six - but it was the offense that proved to be unstoppable. The Seahawks were limited to just 140 net yards in the opening half, and they generated 337 yards following intermission. Brissett strip-six - but it was the offense that proved to be unstoppable. The Seahawks were limited to just 140 net yards in the opening half, and they generated 337 yards following intermission. Russell Wilson caught fire, while the offensive line blasted open big running lanes for the running backs. Tony Dungy described it as an avalanche, and that's exactly what it felt like.    Wilson misfired on just 5 occasions, going 21-of-26 for 295 yards, 2 passing touchdowns and a pair of interceptions to go along with 4 scrambles for 38 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Wilson had major issues with pressure in the opening half, and this resulted in an early safety. This wasn't as much of an issue in the second half, as the Colts' front 7 seemingly ran out of gas. Neither of the interceptions were really fully Wilson's fault, by the way. The first was just an amazing play by safety Matthias Farley, who tipped the ball into the air to himself. The second occurred because the ball bounced off Jimmy Graham's hands. Malik Hooker snatched the ball and returned it deep into Seattle territory. All the Colts could do was kick a field goal to tie the game at 18. Their inability to do more with that really felt like that was when the game turned.    Graham didn't post the best numbers, catching only 4 balls for 61 yards. The same could be said for Doug Baldwin (3-35). Tyler Lockett (4-67) and Paul Richardson (3-65) sat atop the box score.    Wilson's scores went to Luke Willson and J.D. McKissic. The latter, a former receiver, scored twice, though he handled the ball just 5 times. Playing for C.J. Prosise, McKissic rushed for 38 yards on 4 carries and caught a 27-yard touchdown, scoring twice in the process. He vultured the touchdown from Chris Carson (12-42), who suffered a nasty injury in the 4.h quarter. Carson was carted into the locker room. By the way his teammates were acting, it looked pretty brutal. Carson was 1 of several Seahawks who suffered injuries. Jeremy Lane and Cliff Avril got hurt in the first quarter with hip and neck maladies.    The Colts lost a key player themselves, seeing second-string center Deyshawn Bond suffer an injury that knocked him out of the game in the opening quarter. The third-string center had his issues, committing multiple false starts. He also didn't know when to snap the ball, so the left guard had to tell him when to do so. It was a mess, though Brissett played well otherwise. Brissett went 16-of-29 for 157 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 turnovers. Brissett moved the chains well in the first half, but the 2 turnovers were killers. I wouldn't blame him for the fumble, but he stared down his receiver on the pick-six. Brissett was also guilty of holding the ball too long in the pocket on numerous occasions. His protection didn't hold up, preventing him from hitting open receivers.    "

   "comment":"Jacoby Brissett put his team ahead early in the second frame, as rookie Artie Burns bit on a double move by Donte Moncrief, which helped Brissett connect for a 60-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead. Brissett continued to be inconsistent, but he also flashed big-play ability, as he did with his strike to Moncrief, and then again, this time in the third quarter, when he hit Chester Rogers on a 61-yard touchdown. The big plays are there, but he still makes too many mistakes to hold off better teams like the Steelers. For most of this game, the Colts looked like the better team. Ben Roethlisberger was errant on multiple deep passes; the Steelers were constantly backing up due to holding penatlies; and the Colts were taking away Roethlisberger's first reads. It wasn't until the reality of their impending loss took hold, that the Steelers fought back into this game. After Brissett's touchdown to Rogers, the Colts had a 17-3 lead midway through the third-quarter, and with the Steelers on the ropes, they finally punched back with a drive led by Le'Veon Bell and Roethlisberger to Juju Smith-Schuster, as they were the only 2 Steelers players to touch the ball on a 8 play, 78-yard drive, which ended in a 7.yard touchdown to Smith-Schuster. With Antonio Brown getting the bulk of the secondary's attention, it was Smith-Schuster's time to step up, which he did. On the day, Smith-Schuster caught 5-of-7 targets for 97 yards and a touchdown, leading the team. Smith-Schuster's touchdown should have brought the Steelers within 7 points, but Chris Boswell's extra point was blocked and returned just yards from the end zone and 2 points for the Colts. This was a close game, and the hustle by the Steelers to get him down was a huge play. The Colts managed to hold the Steelers scoreless on the next 2 possessions, as they held to a 17-9 lead in the 4.h quarter, but Jacoby Brissett's inconsistencies hurt him, as he tossed an interception deep in Indianapolis territory, which wasn't totally on him, but it was a ball he probably shouldn't have thrown. Brissett put his team ahead early in the second frame, as rookie Artie Burns bit on a double move by Donte Moncrief, which helped Brissett connect for a 60-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead.
