   "comment":"Julio Jones bungled his team's chances by fumbling in the red zone. This did not look like it was going to be Atlanta's day. And then Matt Ryan's second half happened. Ryan was 20-of-27 after intermission for a whopping 263 yards and 2 touchdowns. His overall numbers were also excellent (31-of-43, 448 yards, 3 TDs), as his yardage was the most in Atlanta history for a single game (and 6.h-most by anyone on opening weekend). He did a phenomenal job leading his team to a pair of field goal drives at the end of regulation and in overtime, though he was helped greatly by a Marques Colston fumble in the extra session. What's really impressive about Ryan's performance is that he did it against what was supposed to be a stellar defense (though they had about a billion missed tackles), all while being without first-round rookie left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the contest. Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. "

   "comment":"Julio Jones for exactly that many yards. Devin Hester ran a 20-yard reverse into the end zone on the very next play to make it 28-0 on the first snap of the second quarter. Game, set, match.    Hester made history in this game, as he later ran in a punt return touchdown. That was his 19th return score of his career, surpassing Deion Sanders' record of 18 in the Hall of Famer's old stomping grounds. The officials tried to spoil the moment by throwing a flag for taunting while Hester was high-stepping in an attempt to mimic Sanders, but it turned out to be inconsequential. Hester and Sanders embraced after the contest was over.    The poor Buccaneers had everything go wrong for them. Bobby Rainey dropped a pass early on during a third down. Mark Barron recovered a fumble during an Atlanta drive, but he also lost the ball when Hester knocked it out. Josh McCown was pick-sixed on a telegraphed throw. Rainey lost a fumble on what appeared to secure the team's initial first down. Tampa recovered an Antone Smith fumble at its own 1-yard line, but following a 3.and-out, Hester did this thing and expanded the lead to 35-0. All the Tampa players could do was sit on the sidelines, staring vacantly into the distance.    Ryan finished 21-of-24 for 286 yards and 3 yards. He was pulled in the third quarter because the game was so out of hand. It was nice to see him so locked in after last week's loss. Sure, the Buccaneers were missing some very key personnel in Gerald McCoy, Michael Johnson and Mason Foster, but Ryan didn't have Roddy White's services. He also lost Harry Douglas (2 catches, 14 yards, TD) to an injury in the second quarter. Douglas walked to the locker room with a limp. With White out, Julio Jones was more productive than usual, catching 9 balls for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Not bad for 2.and-a-half quarters of work. Jones was the recipient of that third-and-17 heave that helped put this game away, but his best reception was a remarkable over-the-shoulder catch in the third quarter that turned out to be 40-yard score.    Aside from Hester's rushing touchdown, the Falcons scored twice on the ground with "

   "comment":"Julio Jones allowed the Lions to operate with 1:50 on the clock instead. Sure enough, Matthew Stafford drove the team into field goal range, thanks in part to a great, 1.handed catch by Theo Riddick. The Lions strangely opted to run the time out, settling for a 43-yard field goal despite their horrible kicking issues this year. They naturally missed the kick, but their own delay-of-game penalty negated the whiff. Matt Prater got another chance from 48 yards and improbably connected. The Lions prevailed, but their issues are still prevalent. They barely try some weeks, and regardless of whether they do or not, they commit dumb errors like having a delay of game during a game-winning kicking try. Their offensive line sucked. In addition to allowing Atlanta's anemic pass rush to apply pressure, they were guilty of holds and blindside blocks to nullify big gains.    Matthew Stafford was especially terrible, at least prior to the game-winning drive. He went 24-of-47 for 325 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that he forced into triple coverage. The completion percentage is an indicator of what sort of day it was. He was horribly inaccurate, throwing behind and way past his receivers on numerous occasions. Granted, he didn't have Calvin Johnson, Reggie Bush or any of his tight ends at his disposal, but that shouldn't have affected his accuracy. He nearly had 2 other picks. One occurred when Osi Umenyiora pressured him on a third-and-long. The other was nearly snatched out of the air by Tyson Jackson. Stafford's scores went to Riddick and Golden Tate, both of whom had huge outings. Tate reeled in 7 of 15 targets for 151 yards and his touchdown, which was a 59-yard bomb on third-and-long, while Riddick had 8 grabs for 74 receiving yards. He didn't run very much - 3 carries, 5 rushing yards - but he did a good job of replacing Bush as the pass-catching back.    Detroit had a rough time running the ball despite battling a struggling Atlanta defense. Joique Bell managed just 39 yards on 14 carries. He also nearly lost a fumble when he didn't expect to get an attempt. Bell has been a huge disappointment, as Megatron's absence allowed the Falcons to put 8 men in the box.    Going into this affair, many wondered how the Falcons would protect Matt Ryan against Detroit's ferocious pass rush. They did so quite easily, apparently. The Lions had absolutely no pass rush without blitzing early on. When they brought extra defenders, Ryan did a great job of releasing the ball quickly. He was absolutely flawless in the first half, and it was apparent he would be so effective when he found Roddy White on a tough third-and-8 on the opening drive. This ultimately led to a passing score to Devonta Freeman. By halftime, he was 14-of-17 for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns. He heaved a pick-six toward Rashean Mathis, but the play was negated by defensive pass interference. Ryan, however, struggled following intermission. He was just 6-of-10 for 68 yards and an interception in the second half. The pick was terrible, as it sailed right to a Detroit defensive back with no Atlanta player in the area. Ryan finished 20-of-27 for 228 yards, 2 touchdowns and that interception. He saw much more pressure following the break. He also fumbled twice, but his linemen recovered both loose balls.    Roddy White also recovered a fumble, making fortunate Atlanta 3-of-3 on loose balls. White led the team with 5 grabs for 66 yards. Julio Jones (4-58) had a disappointing outing. His drop at the end of the game was an absolute killer.    The Lions strangely struggled against the run. "

   "comment":"Julio Jones versus Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half. Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Julio Jones versus Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. Ryan and Jones were the victors after they stuck with their game plan, while New York went away from Beckham in the second half. Once again, bad game management late in the contest helped give the Giants' opponents a shot to steal a win away. Neither defense had a real answer for the other's quarterback-receiver tandem, but it was Ryan and Jones who made the plays in crunch time to get Atlanta off to a 2-0 start under rookie head coach Dan Quinn.    On the Falcons' first scoring drive, Ryan moved the ball methodically for 86 yards on 13 plays. He used passes to Jones along with critical conversions to Jacob Tamme and Patrick DiMarco. Ryan hit Leonard Hankerson for a 12-yard gain to the 1-yard line, and Tevin Coleman ran the ball in on first-and-goal. The Giants answered with a field goal drive by using Beckham to move the ball down the field. Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman. Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas dropped an interception that would have taken critical points away from the Falcons. Manning and Beckham answered with a post route to the middle of the field as Beckham achieved separation from Robert Alford. The pass hit Beckham in stride, and he raced down the field for a 67-yard touchdown. Just before the half, the Giants took the lead on a quick field goal drive; the big play was Manning taking off on a 23-yard run - the longest carry of his career. Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown. Atlanta got the ball back, and Jones made a miraculous catch over a defensive back. Ryan kept coming with a rope to Hankerson, but a sack by Robert Ayers and a breakup by Brandon Meriweather got the Giants' defense off the field. Some terrible clock management by New York gave the Falcons another shot with 3 minutes remaining while down 20-17. Atlanta took advantage with a great catch by Hankerson, and since Landon Collins forgot to touch him down, Hankerson got up and added some more yards to the gain. Ryan made the Giants pay by lofting in a bomb to Jones for a 38-yard gain. Jones had beaten Prince Amukamara to get a step. Reviews put Jones down at the 1-yard line. Freeman then scored to pull the Falcons ahead 24-20. Atlanta's defense closed the door with some pass rush and passes thrown off the mark by Manning.    Matt Ryan finished completing 30-of-46 for 363 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. He had a fabulous game for Atlanta and did a superb job of executing Kyle Shanahan's offense. Ryan just missed out on a second touchdown when Jones was ruled down inches short of the goal line.    Julio Jones had 135 yards on 13 receptions. The Giants were incapable of covering him 1.on-one. Jones appeared to score a touchdown late in the game, but was ruled down inches short of the goal line after replay review. Jones will continue to be a top weekly option at receiver for DFS purposes as long as he and his quarterback remain healthy.    Leonard Hankerson caught 6 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. More importantly, he saw 11 targets, which was good for second on the team behind Jones. The Falcons spoke highly of him in the preseason, so he could continue to thrive. He's worth a flier on the waiver wire.    On the ground, Atlanta's duo of Tevin Coleman (9-32) and Devonta Freeman (12-25) didn't do much in terms of yardage, but they each ran for a score. Freeman also had 4 receptions for 34 yards. Coleman, who missed some time with a ribs injury, once again proved to be the better runner. However, Freeman is being used in the passing game, so he's not going anywhere. It's a situation to avoid for now.    Eli Manning completed 27-of-40 passes for 292 yards with 2 touchdowns. As long as Odell Beckham Jr. is healthy, Manning will continue to be a viable QB2 option.    Speaking of Beckham, he totaled 146 yards and 7 receptions. The Giants only were able to complete 1 pass to Beckham in the final 2 quarters, but he gave the Falcons major problems early on. Beckham will serve as a WR1 as long as he remains healthy.    Shane Vereen had 8 receptions for 76 yards with 6 carries for 19 yards. Andre Williams (6-43) and "

   "comment":"Julio Jones is having a monstrous 2015 campaign thus far, and it doesn't appear as though he can be contained. Seeing a ridiculous 20 targets, Jones snatched 12 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jones had just 3 grabs for 27 yards at intermission, so a bulk of his output came in the second half. Ryan targeted him relentlessly, and it paid off. The Cowboys simply had no answer for the elite play-maker.    Jones' great performance was expected. "

   "comment":"Julio Jones couldn't do anything as a result of his bum hamstring, but they still lost money because the teaser came through. I'll have more on this later, but the books are having such a bad year that some of the squarer shops may have to either take out huge loans or close down. </i>    The Redskins spent much of the day targeting Atlanta cornerback Robert Alford because they didn't want to mess with Desmond Trufant on the other side. That plan ended up biting the Redskins when it mattered most. Alford intercepted a Kirk Cousins pass on the first drive of overtime and returned it for a game-winning touchdown. The pass was intended for Ryan Grant, who slipped on the play. The win wasn't particularly impressive for the Falcons, but it pushed their record to 5-0. The Falcons are 5-0 for only the second time in franchise history. They started 8-0 in 2012. However, this victory wasn't easy for Atlanta. The Falcons trailed for much of the game as quarterback Matt Ryan uncharacteristically struggled at home for much of the day. But Ryan got hot at the end to put the Falcons ahead with less than a minute left in regulation. The Redskins (2-3) forced overtime when Dustin Hopkins hit a 52-yard field goal as time expired.    Ryan threw 2 horrible interceptions earlier in the game and wasn't as accurate as usual. He completed 24-of-42 passes for 254 yards with no touchdowns on a day when Washington did a good job of keeping Julio Jones and Roddy White quiet."

Converting would've moved the chains and put the Falcons close to midfield to potentially win the game, but Ryan simply sailed the ball wide of his stud receiver. Ryan finished 25-of-46 for 280 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The trio of scores helped his few fantasy owners, but don't let those fool you into thinking that Ryan had a decent performance. He was awful by his standards, and it's not like this is a 1.game abberation. Ryan has been struggling all season, and I have to wonder if he's playing through an undisclosed injury.    Another reason the Falcons fell to the Colts was "

Until the 4.h quarter, Carolina's offense was inept, but by then, Atlanta already had a huge lead. The Panthers' defense was completely incapable of stopping Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, as the latter set a franchise record for receiving yards in a game while the former totaled nearly 2 games of production versus Carolina. The Panthers' offseason decisions to let Josh Norman leave and not improve their offensive tackles came back to bite them against Atlanta.

   "comment":"Julio Jones going off like that with Norman on the other side.    This was a huge win for the Falcons as they improved to 3-1 and now have a 2.game lead on the 1-3 defending NFC Champion Carolina Panthers. This game wasn't as close as the score indicates. Until the 4.h quarter, Carolina's offense was inept, but by then, Atlanta already had a huge lead. The Panthers' defense was completely incapable of stopping Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, as the latter set a franchise record for receiving yards in a game while the former totaled nearly 2 games of production versus Carolina. The Panthers' offseason decisions to let Josh Norman leave and not improve their offensive tackles came back to bite them against Atlanta. They had no defensive back who could contain Jones, while offensive tackle "

He hauled in 7 passes for the team on 9 targets, totaling 139 yards and another touchdown pass. His excellent athleticism was on display, and if he stays healthy, he should lead the league in receiving yards.

   "comment":"Julio Jones, but the drive was held to a Matt Bryant 42-yard field goal. Atlanta was quickly set up for more points as Deion Jones caught a deflected pass off the hands of Dexter McCluster, and Jones returned the interception 42 yards to the Chargers' 10-yard line to set up a second Bryant field goal. The Chargers responded with a field goal drive of their own. Ryan then lofted in a perfect 50-yard bomb to Jones, and on third-and-13, Ryan threw a frozen rope to Jacob Tamme for a 17-yard touchdown. Atlanta expanded its lead with Tevin Coleman (8-64) exploding down the field for a 30-yard touchdown. Right after a Brooks Reed sack, Vic Beasley strip-sacked Rivers. Adrian Clayborn scooped up the ball and rolled into the end zone to give the Falcons a 27-10 lead. Rivers came right back to hit Tyrell Williams for 38 yards in busted coverage. A 21-yard pass to Travis Benjamin (4-54) got San Diego in the red zone at the 2-minute warning. A bullet to Hunter Henry (1-16) moved the ball to the 3-yard line, and Gordon ran in the touchdown to cut the Falcons' lead to 27-17 at the half. Midway through the third quarter, Rivers led a field goal drive to cut the point deficit to 7. Atlanta responded with runs from Devonta Freeman of 15, 14, and 8 yards to set up another Bryant field goal. San Diego then marched down the field as Rivers picked apart the Falcons' defense. He used Gordon as a receiver on a number of plays, including a 5.yard touchdown toss. That cut the Falcons' lead to 30-27 with 6 minutes remaining. San Diego's defense came through as Denzel Perryman picked off Matt Ryan to get the ball back. Close to midfield on a 4.h-and-2, Rivers hit Antonio Gates (5-38) to move the chains. Gordon had a great run on a third-and-1 where he was stuffed by Deion Jones but bounced off the tackle to turn the other way for a run of more than 10 yards. Atlanta got a stop, but Josh Lambo tied the game with a short field goal. The Falcons got the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with 1 second remaining, but Bryant's 58-yard field goal was no good. On the first possession of overtime, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn made a crushing decision. It was obvious that Atlanta should punt and force the Chargers to drive the field, but Quinn showed no confidence in his defense as he went for a 4.h-and-1 at his own 45-yard line. That didn't work out, as Perryman fired into the backfield to notch a tackle for a loss. The Chargers moved the chains with Gates and Gordon to set up Lambo to hit a 42-yard field goal for the win.    Philip Rivers was 27-of-44 for 371 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. Tyrell Williams led the Chargers with 7 catches for 140 yards.    Melvin Gordon ran for 68 yards on 2 scores with 22 carries and caught 6 passes for 53 yard with a touchdown. Gordon is turning into a difference-maker for San Diego.    Matt Ryan was 22-of-34 for 273 yards with 1 touchdown and an interception. The Falcons' offense played well, but settling for field goals ended up hurting them.    Julio Jones was phenomenal as usual. He had 9 receptions for 174 yards. Devonta Freeman ran for 58 yards on 15 carries and had 5 receptions for 42 yards. Tevin Coleman left the game with a hamstring injury.    The Chargers' defense struggled to slow down Jones, but they came up with some critical stops and held the Falcons to field goals. "

Sanu saw 10 targets from Ryan and caught 9 of them. He turned those 9 balls into 84 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Sanu is worth consideration as a bench receiver, but he should only be started in favorable matchups. That said, if Jones is out, Sanu could end up being a WR3 due to the volume of targets he would see. Aside from Sanu, Gabriel (3-68, 1 TD) and "

   "comment":"Julio Jones dropped a pass on a crucial third-and-12 in the 4.h quarter. Austin Hooper dropped a ball as well. Matt Ryan couldn't connect with Jones on a 4.h down at the end of the afternoon and also threw an interception. The Falcons appeared to be close in this game, but just couldn't quite get there. Despite Atlanta's blunders, the Eagles allowed them to hang around for most of the afternoon because they kept making mistakes of their own. Carson Wentz was strip-sacked by Vic Beasley past midfield at the end of the first half. Darren Sproles appeared to fumble, but the play was ruled incomplete. Jordan Matthews, Wendell Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed. Special-teamer Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and Zach Ertz (6-55). Matthews was blown up on 1 play that was an obvious helmet-to-helmet call. Keanu Neal, however, wasn't flagged for it, and the Eagles whiffed on a long field goal as a result. It was inexplicable that no flag was thrown, and I imagine Neal will receive a fine.    Moving on to the Falcons, Ryan didn't have his best performance. The numbers are fine - 18-of-33 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception - but a big chunk of his yardage, as well as his score, came on a 76-yard bomb to Taylor Gabriel in which the Eagles blew a coverage. Gabriel was wide open, so the pass wasn't anything special. Ryan had trouble with Philadelphia's pass rush and couldn't get into a rhythm as a result. His pick was a forced throw at the end of the game.    As mentioned, Julio Jones was guilty of a crucial drop. He played well outside of that blunder, however, as he logged 10 catches for 135 yards. Outside of Jones and Gabriel, "

   "comment":"Julio Jones bobbled that popped up into the air, but Ryan should've been picked on a couple of other occasions, as referenced earlier. Perhaps his best play was the aforementioned 11-yard scramble on third-and-10 that helped seal the victory.    Gabriel happened to be Atlanta's leading receiver. He caught 4 balls for 75 yards and 2 touchdowns, which came on a combined 60 receiving yards. Gabriel also had a 27-yard rush. It's baffling that the Browns let him go for nothing; Gabriel isn't reliable enough to be a fantasy option, but he's a dynamic weapon to have in an offense, and he'll serve the Falcons well going forward.    Jones, meanwhile, couldn't get much going against Peterson. Arizona's stud corner was unjustly flagged for interference on some occasions, but he managed to limit Jones to 4 grabs for 35 yards. Peterson missed a few plays with an injury and looked somewhat gimpy upon his return, but Jones couldn't take advantage. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Julio Jones for a 54-yard reception on a deep post. Atlanta settled for another field goal on that drive. Anderson would set up the Jets to get those 3 points back after a fantastic 32-yard catch, but Catanzaro missed the 48-yard attempt. The Falcons took advantage with "

   "comment":"Julio Jones running free downfield. Ryan would've hit Jones if this were 2016, but he overshot the star receiver by just a bit. The second play came with 8 minutes remaining in regulation. Ryan once again had Jones open in the end zone. He launched a pass toward Jones, and this time, it was perfect. Jones, however, returned the favor from earlier by dropping the ball. A catch there may have won the game for the Falcons, who scored a touchdown later in the 4.h quarter to draw to within 20-17 rather than to take a 24-20 lead. The Panthers, meanwhile, look to be the team to challenge the Saints for the NFC South crown. There were some questions about how they would move the chains in the wake of the Kelvin Benjamin trade, but they did a good job of doing so in this contest, generating 330 yards of offense. A 20-point output may not seem like much, but the Panthers would've had better success on the scoreboard if it weren't for 2 turnovers in Atlanta territory.    "

   "comment":"Julio Jones (6-57) and Hooper (6-49, 1 TD). Jones was able to beat the Dallas defensive backs easily and made some nice grabs throughout the day. Ryan did spread the ball around a lot though, which limited Jones' upside. Still, he is a WR1 most weeks, and at the worst, he is a very high-end WR2. Hooper continued to have an up-and-down season in this contest. He was able to find space over the middle of the field with Sean Lee out, and that's where he generated a lot of his yardage. It's hard to trust Hooper as a TE1, but he can be streamed depending on the matchup. Elsewhere in the passing game, "
