   "comment":"Lewis.    Kyle Orton had a decent fantasy day, going 21-of-33 for 295 yards, 1 score and a pick. There was 1 play though that really bothered me. Late in the 4.h quarter, the Broncos were in the red zone. Orton scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to pick up the first down. Instead, Orton slid well short of the marker, which brought up a 3rd-and-4 instead of a potential 1st-and-goal (or at the very worst, 3rd-and-inches). The Broncos failed to convert after going for it on 4.h down. This really looked like poor effort on Orton's part.    Brandon Lloyd caught 5 passes for 117 yards. Make sure you pick him up in fantasy; Orton really loves throwing to him. Meanwhile, Eddie Royal had 8 grabs for 98 yards, and Jabar Gaffney caught 3 balls for 34 yards and a score. I'm not too confident in Royal yet; he's worth picking up, but he could easily catch 1 pass next week.    Knowshon Moreno had 60 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. More importantly, he didn't fumble like Correll Buckhalter (6-15).    Maurice Jones-Drew, meanwhile, totaled 98 yards on 23 carries, but couldn't find the end zone. David Garrard hogged all the scores, tossing 3 touchdowns to go along with his 16-of-21 passing.    Garrard's favorite target against the Broncos was Mike Thomas, who hauled in 6 catches for 89 yards. I liked Thomas as a late-round sleeper going into the season, and he's definitely living up to my expectations. He's worth a pick-up.    Mike Sims-Walker didn't catch a single pass in the season opener. Don't worry though; David Garrard had no reason to throw against Champ Bailey.    Marcedes Lewis caught 2 of David Garrard's touchdowns. Those were his only receptions, so don't rush to add him to your fantasy roster. Lewis has been inconsistent his entire career.    Here's a question: If a coach makes a stupid mistake, but no 1.s there to see it, did he really do something dumb? There was barely anyone in the stands in Jacksonville's season opener - it was much worse than usual - so no 1 witnessed Jack Del Rio's enormous blunder. Del Rio inexplicably went for it on a 4th-and-1 on his own 39-yard line in the second half despite the fact that he was up by 7 points. Perhaps he wanted the game to end quickly so he could go down to the beach.    The fans may not have showed up, but Jacksonville's pass rush sure did. The Jaguars totaled 3 sacks, namely 1.5 from "

   "comment":"Lewis had 2 grabs for 42 yards. - Maurice Jones-Drew, tallying 103 yards on 14 carries, suffered a hamstring injury in the 4.h quarter. He told the NFL Network crew that he'd be ready for Buffalo in Week 15, but that could've been just standard player arrogance. - Ace Sanders threw a 21-yard touchdown to Jordan Todman, who also went down in the final period. He hurt his leg. - Cecil Shorts had just 2 catches for 13 yards, but he scored a touchdown. He also drew a long pass-interference flag and just missed out on a 50-yard touchdown because Henne overthrew him by a few inches.    I've made fun of Brad Nessler countless times. He has called Greg Little Mr. Dependable, Jay Feely Jim Feely and Koa Misi Koa Misa. He also said that the a punter in the Redskins-Vikings kicked the ball into the night sky even though they were playing in a dome. As for this week, I'll let e-mailer Joe B. handle it: I know you love pointing out Brad Nessler's idiotic statements. Here's this week's edition in case you missed it: These 2 teams played 2 weeks ago, so you know they'll remember each other's names. Maybe Nessler needs to announce a game between the same 2 teams that he announced 2 weeks ago, since he has all kinds of problems knowing the players' names. I wonder who this Marcellus Lewis fellow is... Indeed. He referred to Marcedes Lewis as Marcellus Lewis when the tight end caught his first-quarter touchdown. It's amazing how much money Nessler is stealing from the NFL Network, because he's absolutely mailing it in.   "

Only 2 Jaguars had more than 22 receiving yards. Those were Cecil Shorts (6-76) and Allen Hurns (6-70). Lewis (2-22) disappointed again, and he won't be on the roster much longer.    "

Bortles' final numbers were 20-of-31 for 244 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also a drew deep pass interference on a shot to Lee, so his numbers could've been even better.
