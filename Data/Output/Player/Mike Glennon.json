   "comment":"Mike Glennon was intercepted by Peterson on a poorly thrown pass as Peterson had Vincent Jackson (2-27) perfectly covered. Peterson's return set up the Cardinals at the Bucs' 13-yard line. The next play saw Carson Palmer throw a strike to Larry Fitzgerald (6-68) for a touchdown. He beat Darrelle Revis to get open in the end zone. That tied the game at 10 with 3 minutes remaining. Glennon was soon sacked by Dontay Moch at the 1-yard line and a punt set up Arizona at the Tampa Bay 38. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for 19 yards and a Dashon Goldson unnecessary roughness penalty set up an easy game-winning field goal for Jay Feely. Peterson iced the game with his second interception at midfield.    The Bucs benched Josh Freeman because of turnover and accuracy problems, but got the exact same thing from Mike Glennon. Nobody should be surprised because Glennon was inaccurate and threw a lot of picks at N. C. State. The rookie completed 24-of-43 passes for 193 yards with 2 interceptions and a touchdown to "

   "comment":"Mike Glennon's playing well enough to make me change my mind. Stay tuned for the next update on Tuesday.    Once again, Detroit choked a game away. The Lions had a trap contest playing the Buccaneers 4 days before Detroit's battle against Green Bay on Thanksgiving. The Lions gave this 1 away because of a plethora of mistakes. They allowed 5 turnovers and a blocked punt to lose a game they should have won. Detroit started well when Jeremy Ross had a 44-yard punt return, but the drive ended when a deflected ball was intercepted by Lavonte David. Tampa Bay's drive was aided by a bogus hitting the quarterback low on Nick Fairley that gave the Bucs a first down after a third-down stop. Mike Glennon hit Tim Wright (8-75) for some chunk plays to move the ball into a short field goal."

   "comment":"Mike Glennon put together a great drive to march his team into the red zone. However, thanks to a Jordan Howard drop, Brooks Reed was able to record a game-ending sack to give the Falcons their first victory of the season. It was discouraging to see the Falcons post just 23 points against a Chicago defense missing its top cornerback. That said, Atlanta began its 2016 campaign sluggishly as well, losing to Tampa Bay at home. The Falcons at least won this contest, though they needed some late-game fortune to do so.    Matt Ryan finished 21-of-30 for 321 yards and a touchdown, though the numbers are a bit deceiving because his score, an 88-yarder, was a deep shot to Austin Hooper, who was wide open on a busted coverage. Ryan, who was 20-of-29 for 233 yards otherwise, didn't get the sort of pass protection he was used to receiving last year. Akiem Hicks, who signed a new contract Saturday, dominated the trenches. Plus, it didn't help that Atlanta players slipped on numerous occasions. The field was a mess, which is inexcusable for an NFL season opener.    The Bears' front 7 made sure the Falcons wouldn't run the ball very well. They did their job, limiting Devonta Freeman to just 37 yards on 12 carries, though he scored once. Tevin Coleman (8-16) didn't fare much better. As a result of this, Ryan was constantly in third-and-long situations.    Thanks to 2 long receptions of 88 and 40 yards, Hooper led the Falcons with 128 receiving yards with a touchdown. He nearly doubled up Julio Jones, who made 4 grabs for 66 yards. It was extremely disappointing to see Jones fail to take advantage of an extremely favorable matchup. Mohamed Sanu (6-47) continued to post mediocre numbers.    The Bears may have lost this game, but a silver lining is that a new star may have been a born. Tarik Cohen, whom I praised in my preseason recaps for his dazzling jukes and running ability, made some terrific plays in his professional debut. He didn't see as many carries as Jordan Howard (13-52, TD), but he outgained him, dashing for 66 yards on 5 tries, featuring a 46-yard, field-reserving run. Cohen also caught 8 of his 12 (TWELVE!!!) targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. He ran circles around Atlanta defenders, who had issues tackling him. He also made a crazy, 1.handed diving reception in the second half. Cohen is a freak, and the Bears will almost certainly find ways to get him involved on offense. Cohen isn't built to be an every-down ball-carrier - he's only 5-6, 179 - but he'll be a big-time fantasy producer, especially in PPR formats.    Cohen, with his 47 receiving yards, led the Bears in that category. Zach Miller (4-39) was next, then Kendall Wright (3-34). If you're looking for Kevin White, he was dead last with 2 grabs for 6 yards. At 1 point, the FOX color analyst said something along the lines of, Now is the time for Mike Glennon to go to Kevin White. I shook my head, as such a time should never exist. Alas, White suffered a fractured collarbone and will be out for the year.    Mike Glennon went 26-of-40 for 213 yards and a touchdown. It wasn't a very impressive debut, but Glennon neither had adequate protection nor viable threats downfield. Plus, he should've thrown a second score at the very end, but Howard dropped the ball. It would probably be best for the Bears to move on to Mitchell Trubisky, though I wouldn't blame Glennon for this defeat. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Mike Glennon had in this game, I can't believe John Fox didn't insert Mitchell Trubisky in the lineup. No, wait, I can believe it, because Fox is stubborn and doesn't want to play rookies. In fact, he had Mark Sanchez ahead of Trubisky until recently, so I don't have any faith in Fox using Glennon anytime soon.    Much was made of this being Mike Glennon's return to Tampa Bay. The former Buccaneers quarterback was never given an opportunity to start for long because of the presence of "

   "comment":"Mike Glennon at the helm, so the Steelers came into Chicago with a 7.point Vegas advantage and supposedly a team advantage. Neither turned out to be prescient. This game was crazy, with a showboating fumble at the 1-yard line before halftime and a walk-off touchdown run to win the game in overtime. The Chicago Bears committed both of those, with the latter being the most important.    The Steelers, again, had trouble moving the ball with consistency this week, as Ben Roethlisberger was not on target, completing just 22-of-39 passes for 235 yards and a touchdown. He continues to not turn the ball over, with 5 passing touchdowns to 1 interception, but he's been hit and miss as a field general. The Bears' defense is notoriously bend, but don't break, which was about where they were in this game. Add that to Roethlisberger's road woes, and there was no doubt this game was going to go down to the wire.    On the other side of the field, leading the way was Mike Glennon. I call lots of quarterbacks the Checkdown King, but this week, Glennon was the emperor, as he completed 15-of-22 passes for 101 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. How does a team win when its quarterback throws for 101 yards? The answer was clear in this 1. it was the running game. Through 2 games, Chicago's star running back, "
