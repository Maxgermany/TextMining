He made some nice passes, but was guilty of 1 too many overthrows (can we call those Josh Freemans?) He was also very fortunate that Carolina dropped 3 potential interceptions, though all of those instances came in the second half when Glennon was trying to mount a comeback. All in all, Glennon played OK, but I'm still not convinced that he can be a solid NFL starter. Perhaps I'll change my mind as the season progresses. Glennon's late touchdown went to rookie tight end "

The Lions had a trap contest playing the Buccaneers 4 days before Detroit's battle against Green Bay on Thanksgiving. The Lions gave this 1 away because of a plethora of mistakes. They allowed 5 turnovers and a blocked punt to lose a game they should have won. Detroit started well when Jeremy Ross had a 44-yard punt return, but the drive ended when a deflected ball was intercepted by Lavonte David. Tampa Bay's drive was aided by a bogus hitting the quarterback low on Nick Fairley that gave the Bucs a first down after a third-down stop. Mike Glennon hit Tim Wright (8-75) for some chunk plays to move the ball into a short field goal."

Ten seconds into the game, Bobby Rainey (21-125) got through a stacked box to break down the sideline for an 80-yard touchdown. That was all the scoring the Bucs would need. Manuel led a field goal drive via completions to Stevie Johnson and Scott Chandler (2-24). A Lavonte David sack forced that field goal. Glennon then hit Vincent Jackson for a 38-yard touchdown as Jackson (3-70) was too big for Nickell Robey to cover downfield."

Alec Ogletree stripped the ball away from Rainey on the next drive. Following the sudden change, St. Louis dialed up an awesome double-reverse to Stedman Bailey (3-44), who bolted down the field for a 27-yard touchdown run. The Rams should have scored more often, but had ball-security issues. On a third-and-goal, Kellen Clemens fumbled the ball away on a quarterback draw. St. Louis got the ball in Tampa Bay territory again, but Stacy fumbled the ball away after a hit from Dekoda Watson. The Rams had a 14-10 lead at the half. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Glennon fumbled the ball away on a sack from James Laurinaitis and Alec Ogletree."

The drive ended with Brees firing a bullet to Graham for 6. On New Orleans' next possession, Brees and Robert Meachum burned Darrelle Revis for a 41-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay scored again with a short touchdown toss to Tim Wright (5-58). Brees came right back to hit Kenny Stills for a 76-yard touchdown. Revis was in coverage and seemed to think he had deep help from Dashon Goldson - but he didn't. The Bucs moved the ball to the Saints' 25-yard line, but on 4.h-and-10, the Buccaneers tried a weird, obviously fake, punt pass with Michael Koenen. It was a broken play from the start and a terrible call by the Tampa Bay coaching staff. In the third quarter, Glennon led a field goal drive, but Brees continued to move the ball at ease and Pierre Thomas (7-20) ran the ball in from 7 yards out."

After a Bucs' 3.and-out, Flacco scored again with a 17-yard strike to Kamar Aiken. The Ravens quickly got the ball back again. With a second left in the first quarter, Flacco threw his 4.h touchdown with a 19-yard toss to Michael Campanaro. The first minute of the second quarter was more of the same, as Flacco laid out a bomb to Steve Smith (5-110) for a 56-yard touchdown after he got away with a push-off on Bucs' corner Alterraun Verner. It was garbage time after that. In the third quarter, Mike Evans (4-55) caught a 17-yard touchdown from Glennon. The Ravens answered with a drive that set up a "

   "comment":"Glennon found Austin Seferian-Jenkins for a short reception in overtime, but linebacker Anthony Barr stripped the ball away, recovered it and scored the game-winning touchdown to help the Vikings improve to 3-5. While Barr helped his team triumph with 8 tackles, 1 sack and the strip-fumble for a touchdown, Bridgewater didn't have as good of a game. He spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, struggling to convert first downs as a consequence. The Vikings were just 6-of-15 on third down, mostly because Bridgewater constantly tossed passes short of the first-down marker. Having said that, Bridgewater's game-tying drive at the end of regulation was a thing of beauty. He found Greg Jennings for a couple of decent gains and moved his team well into field-goal range. He could have kept the possession going, but simply ran out of time. Part of the reason for this is because the officals screwed up on 1 play, ruling that Jennings didn't go out of bounds when he clearly did. His forward progress wasn't stopped or anything, so the refs blew it by allowing 30 or so seconds to run off the clock. Bridgewater even had to hurry as a result, and he nearly threw a pick, as his pass was dropped by a defender. Bridgewater finished 24-of-42 for 241 yards and a touchdown to Jennings (3-38). He scrambled just once for 3 rushing yards. Bridgewater isn't a running quarterback, but he can move around and do stuff with his legs, as we all saw in the Atlanta victory, so he should use more of his mobility going forward if he's too worried about taking chances downfield. Otherwise, he's just Matt Leinart.    It was nice to see Cordarrelle Patterson bounce back. Patterson tied for the team lead in receptions with Chase Ford. They both caught 6. with Patterson accmulated 86 receiving yards.    Jerick McKinnon got almost all of the carries once again, tallying 83 yards on 16 carries. Matt Asiata caught 4 passes for 26 receiving yards, but did nothing with his quartet of rushing attempts, gaining only 1 yard in the process.    The Vikings weren't great on third downs, but the Buccaneers were far worse, converting just 1 of 12 tries. Tampa couldn't get anything going offensively until the end when Glennon pulled out what appeared to be a game-winning drive out of nowhere. Glennon was awful otherwise. He went 19-of-28 for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception on a deep shot, but those numbers aren't indicative of how poorly he played. Glennon constantly panicked in the pocket and stopped looking downfield. Barr and "

   "comment":"Glennon put together a great drive to march his team into the red zone. However, thanks to a Jordan Howard drop, Brooks Reed was able to record a game-ending sack to give the Falcons their first victory of the season. It was discouraging to see the Falcons post just 23 points against a Chicago defense missing its top cornerback. That said, Atlanta began its 2016 campaign sluggishly as well, losing to Tampa Bay at home. The Falcons at least won this contest, though they needed some late-game fortune to do so.    Matt Ryan finished 21-of-30 for 321 yards and a touchdown, though the numbers are a bit deceiving because his score, an 88-yarder, was a deep shot to Austin Hooper, who was wide open on a busted coverage. Ryan, who was 20-of-29 for 233 yards otherwise, didn't get the sort of pass protection he was used to receiving last year. Akiem Hicks, who signed a new contract Saturday, dominated the trenches. Plus, it didn't help that Atlanta players slipped on numerous occasions. The field was a mess, which is inexcusable for an NFL season opener.    The Bears' front 7 made sure the Falcons wouldn't run the ball very well. They did their job, limiting Devonta Freeman to just 37 yards on 12 carries, though he scored once. Tevin Coleman (8-16) didn't fare much better. As a result of this, Ryan was constantly in third-and-long situations.    Thanks to 2 long receptions of 88 and 40 yards, Hooper led the Falcons with 128 receiving yards with a touchdown. He nearly doubled up Julio Jones, who made 4 grabs for 66 yards. It was extremely disappointing to see Jones fail to take advantage of an extremely favorable matchup. Mohamed Sanu (6-47) continued to post mediocre numbers.    The Bears may have lost this game, but a silver lining is that a new star may have been a born. Tarik Cohen, whom I praised in my preseason recaps for his dazzling jukes and running ability, made some terrific plays in his professional debut. He didn't see as many carries as Jordan Howard (13-52, TD), but he outgained him, dashing for 66 yards on 5 tries, featuring a 46-yard, field-reserving run. Cohen also caught 8 of his 12 (TWELVE!!!) targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. He ran circles around Atlanta defenders, who had issues tackling him. He also made a crazy, 1.handed diving reception in the second half. Cohen is a freak, and the Bears will almost certainly find ways to get him involved on offense. Cohen isn't built to be an every-down ball-carrier - he's only 5-6, 179 - but he'll be a big-time fantasy producer, especially in PPR formats.    Cohen, with his 47 receiving yards, led the Bears in that category. Zach Miller (4-39) was next, then Kendall Wright (3-34). If you're looking for Kevin White, he was dead last with 2 grabs for 6 yards. At 1 point, the FOX color analyst said something along the lines of, Now is the time for Mike Glennon to go to Kevin White. I shook my head, as such a time should never exist. Alas, White suffered a fractured collarbone and will be out for the year.    Mike Glennon went 26-of-40 for 213 yards and a touchdown. It wasn't a very impressive debut, but Glennon neither had adequate protection nor viable threats downfield. Plus, he should've thrown a second score at the very end, but Howard dropped the ball. It would probably be best for the Bears to move on to Mitchell Trubisky, though I wouldn't blame Glennon for this defeat. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Glennon at the helm, so the Steelers came into Chicago with a 7.point Vegas advantage and supposedly a team advantage. Neither turned out to be prescient. This game was crazy, with a showboating fumble at the 1-yard line before halftime and a walk-off touchdown run to win the game in overtime. The Chicago Bears committed both of those, with the latter being the most important.    The Steelers, again, had trouble moving the ball with consistency this week, as Ben Roethlisberger was not on target, completing just 22-of-39 passes for 235 yards and a touchdown. He continues to not turn the ball over, with 5 passing touchdowns to 1 interception, but he's been hit and miss as a field general. The Bears' defense is notoriously bend, but don't break, which was about where they were in this game. Add that to Roethlisberger's road woes, and there was no doubt this game was going to go down to the wire.    On the other side of the field, leading the way was Mike Glennon. I call lots of quarterbacks the Checkdown King, but this week, Glennon was the emperor, as he completed 15-of-22 passes for 101 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. How does a team win when its quarterback throws for 101 yards? The answer was clear in this 1. it was the running game. Through 2 games, Chicago's star running back, "

   "comment":"Glennon imploded, so despite the Packers generating just 260 yards, being outgained by the Bears in the process, they still posted 35 points in an easy blowout victory. Aaron Rodgers simply didn't have to do much, outside of making a few clutch throws to keep possessions alive. The Packers had just 2 lengthy drives that resulted in touchdowns, and 1 came via some impressive Ty Montgomery runs. Yet, Rodgers still was able to fire 4 scores thanks to a trio of Glennon turnovers. Rodgers' final numbers were 18-of-26 for 179 yards and the 4 touchdowns. The tackles impacted a couple of drives in the first half, but Chicago's pass rush as a whole was very underwhelming.    Montgomery, meanwhile, looked like he was going to have a huge game. He rushed for 28 yards on just 5 carries, as he was given the ball on 5 of Green Bay's initial 7 plays. Unfortunately, Montgomery was knocked out of the contest with a rib injury. Montgomery was 1 of several Packer players who left the game. "
