   "comment":"Quincy Enunwa accumulated 126 and 92 yards, respectively. Decker had a big gain nullified by a penalty, while Marshall dropped a long pass, though he did draw an interference flag on Darby. As for Enunwa, I listed him as an add in fantasy heading into Week 2, and I obviously stand by that after his performance at Buffalo. Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    "
