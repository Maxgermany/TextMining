Speaking of Quincy Enunwa, he put together a terrific performance on Sunday. The third-year receiver was able to catch all 5 of his targets for 109 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.

He had a nice deep catch at 1 point and was almost able to outrun some of Buffalo's defenders for a touchdown. He should be the No. 3 option for the Jets next year, provided that Marshall and Eric Decker both return healthy. As for Anderson, he had a mixed outing. He has game-breaking speed, but he was guilty of a terrible drop. Anderson should be a depth guy for the team next year, as his straight-line speed makes him a great situational weapon.
