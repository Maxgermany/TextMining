As for Enunwa, I listed him as an add in fantasy heading into Week 2, and I obviously stand by that after his performance at Buffalo. Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    "

   "comment":"Enunwa. Fitzpatrick placed the ball in the back corner of the end zone where only his man could get it. It had just the right amount of air under it, and Enunwa brought it in for an amazing catch. If Fitzpatrick can build off of this performance, perhaps he will return to his 2015 form.    Speaking of Quincy Enunwa, he put together a terrific performance on Sunday. The third-year receiver was able to catch all 5 of his targets for 109 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. He looked sure-handed and really proved to be a solid player. If Fitzpatrick is playing well, Enunwa can definitely be used as a WR2 or WR3, as he is the No. 2 option in the Jets' passing attack. "

He had a nice deep catch at 1 point and was almost able to outrun some of Buffalo's defenders for a touchdown. He should be the No. 3 option for the Jets next year, provided that Marshall and Eric Decker both return healthy. As for Anderson, he had a mixed outing. He has game-breaking speed, but he was guilty of a terrible drop. Anderson should be a depth guy for the team next year, as his straight-line speed makes him a great situational weapon.
