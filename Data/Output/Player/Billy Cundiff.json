   "comment":"Billy Cundiff made a game-winning field goal, especially after missing 3. If I could have, I would've bet my entire mortgage on Cundiff missing that kick. Good thing that option wasn't available to me. </i>    Robert Griffin got some revenge for a bunch of fired former Buccaneer staffers who now work with the Redskins. Former head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Bruce Allen were treated to a last-second win over Tampa Bay.    It was a game of halves as the first portion was all Washington and the final 2 quarters were all Tampa Bay. The Bucs' offense and defense were lost in the early going, but came alive to lead a furious comeback.    The Skins got moving with a nice ground game led by Alfred Morris. He ran for 113 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Morris' day was highlighted by a 39-yard touchdown run. Griffin moved the ball with precision passes and good decision-making. He spread the ball around to Fred Davis (4-70), Josh Morgan (4-62), Leonard Hankerson (7-57) and Darrel Young (2-40). Griffin basically ran for 2 touchdowns. The first 1 was ruled a Griffin fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Pierre Garcon.    Tampa Bay helped out with penalties. The Bucs had 2 critical offsides, 1 on a 4.h-and-1 and 1 on a third-and-1. Ronde Barber was also flagged for a long pass-interference penalty.    Tampa Bay's offense couldn't move the ball in the first half. Josh Freeman was horribly inaccurate in the first 2 quarters. He threw an interception to DeAngelo Hall on a pass poorly thrown toward Vincent Jackson. Freeman missed open receivers and threw many far off the mark. The Redskins had a nice pass rush going led by Ryan Kerrigan, who beat Demar Dotson for a sack and a number of pressures. After 6 ugly quarters dating back to last week, Freeman finally got going just after halftime with a 66-yard pass to Mike Williams. He beat Josh Wilson on a go route down the sideline. The drive ended with a short touchdown throw to Vincent Jackson. Freeman and Jackson connected on the next possession for a 54-yard bomb. That helped set up a touchdown run for LeGarrette Blount (6-17). Doug Martin (8-33) was held in check by Washington. Freeman moved the ball into field goal range later in the game, and the Bucs took the lead with a 47-yarder from Connor Barth. Freeman got away with a pass that should've been intercepted by Josh Wilson, but the signal-caller really played well in the second half against the Redskins. He completed 24-of-39 passes for 299 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Jackson (6-100) and Williams (4-115) played well for Tampa Bay.    The Redskins did a trick play on a critical third down at the end of the third quarter with a handoff followed by a lateral back to Griffin and a pass downfield to Niles Paul for a gain of 30 yards. That play worked out, but was wasted after Billy Cundiff missed a 31-yarder.    After Tampa Bay took the lead, Griffin had 102 seconds to work with. He threw the ball downfield and ran for a good gain. That set up Cundiff to nail a 41-yard field goal to win the game for Washington. Griffin was 26-of-35 for 323 yards through the air and ran for 43 yards on 7 carries.    If the Redskins lost, it would've been Cundiff's fault. He missed 3 field goals including a 41-yarder and a 31-yarder. Washington should scout out available kickers and have a replacement in mind in case the team needs to cut Cundiff.    An odd event happened before the game. Redskins safety Brandon Meriweather and Aldrick Robinson collided in pre-game warmups and knocked each other out. Both were made inactive.   Cundiff made a game-winning field goal, especially after missing 3. If I could have, I would've bet my entire mortgage on Cundiff missing that kick.

   "comment":"Billy Cundiff's attempt. Perhaps LeBron James returning to his hometown has changed everything. Or maybe the Browns are just getting their fans' hopes up in an attempt to crush everyone's spirit down the road.    The Saints have dug themselves a real hole in the NFC South with an 0-2 start and Carolina winning its first 2 games. New Orleans should have beaten Cleveland, but the Saints' defense had some critical busts while Sean Payton waited far too long to get Jimmy Graham involved. Payton and Rob Ryan did some shouting on the sideline, so you have to wonder if New Orleans will remain together to turn its season around. Cleveland showed some real fight, and Mike Pettine's squad earned an impressive win over a playoff team. Pettine deserves congratulations on his first win as a head coach, while Brian Hoyer is showing that he knows how to win in the NFL.    The Browns got on the board first when the Saints punted from their own end zone to set up Cleveland in a short field. Led by running back Terrence West, the Browns moved the ball inside the 5-yard line before Hoyer threw a short touchdown pass to Miles Austin (6-44) after he beat Patrick Robinson on a slant. Robinson kept hurting his team when he lined up offsides as the Browns missed a field goal. That gave Cleveland a first down and a shorter field goal for Billy Cundiff. The Browns opened up a lead of 13 when a bad pass from Brees floated to Cundiff's attempt. Perhaps LeBron James returning to his hometown has changed everything. Or maybe the Browns are just getting their fans' hopes up in an attempt to crush everyone's spirit down the road.    The Saints have dug themselves a real hole in the NFC South with an 0-2 start and Carolina winning its first 2 games. New Orleans should have beaten Cleveland, but the Saints' defense had some critical busts while Sean Payton waited far too long to get Jimmy Graham involved. Payton and Rob Ryan did some shouting on the sideline, so you have to wonder if New Orleans will remain together to turn its season around. Cleveland showed some real fight, and Mike Pettine's squad earned an impressive win over a playoff team.
