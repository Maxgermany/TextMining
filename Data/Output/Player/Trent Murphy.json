   "comment":"Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. Ryan Clark added a 15-yard penalty on the play with his helmet-to-helmet hit. That moved ball inside the Redskins' 20-yard line. A pass to Boldin (9-137) moved it to the 4-yard line before Hyde (7-16) darted into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. The Redskins got 2 more possessions, but the 49ers' defense slammed the door as Lynch came up with a clutch sack on the first possession and Justin Smith beat Morgan Moses for a strip-sack that was recovered by Ahmad Brooks to end the game.    Kaepernick finished completing 20-of-29 passes for 256 yards. The 49ers were unable to run on the Redskins and couldn't really string drives together.    Trent Williams was out with an injury, and on the second play of the game, Aldon Smith beat Morgan Moses for a coverage sack. That set the tone for the day, as Washington's offensive line was dominated by San Francisco. Smith later beat Moses for another sack. The Redskins' offensive line was abysmal, and it killed the team's passing attack as all of the linemen were beaten. Griffin completed only 11-of-19 passes for 106 yards.    Washington's defense played well with turnovers and pressure on the quarterback. Ryan Kerrigan beat Jonathan Martin for a sack, and Jason Hatcher got by Mike Iupati for 1 as well. Rookie Trent Murphy and linebacker Keenan Robinson also played well for the Redskins."

   "comment":"Murphy sack led to Arizona missing a 53-yard field goal. However, Calais Campbell strip-sacked Cousins and Markus Golden returned the fumble to the Redskins' 10-yard line. Carson Palmer then fired a fastball to Michael Floyd (3-18-1) for the score and a 17-13 lead. Cousins struck back with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder (3-42-1), who beat Tony Jefferson to get wide open. Arizona responded by ripping the ball down the field quickly and scored with a 25-yard pass to Johnson. The Redskins countered with a field goal to make it 24-23 Arizona midway through the 4.h quarter. The Cardinals went for a 4.h-and-1 at their own 34-yard line and Johnson ripped off an 18-yard run. Palmer then hit J.J. Nelson (1-42) for a 42-yard touchdown strike just after the 2-minute warning a few plays later. With forty seconds remaining, D.J. Swearinger blitzed to force a pass off the mark, and it was picked off by Patrick Peterson to clinch the Cardinals' win.    Palmer played very well, completing 30-of-46 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Fitzgerald continues to rewrite the record books as he totaled 9 catches for 91 yards.    David Johnson was the big star for the Arizona offense with 18 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Through the air, he had 9 receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Cousins was 21-of-37 for 271 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He added a rushing touchdown. Garcon led the Redskins in receiving with 78 yards on 7 receptions.    Rob Kelley totaled 63 yards on 14 carries.    Calais Campbell had an excellent game for the Cardinals with a big-time presence at the point of attack. Trent Murphy and Ryan Kerrigan played well for the Redskins."
