   "comment":"Wright came after a Kyle Orton interception when he didn't see Jamie Collins dropping into coverage. Two fumbles followed the pick, as Orton was strip-sacked and then C.J. Spiller lost a fumble near midfield with 10 seconds remaining prior to intermission. The Patriots, who sputtered in the red zone early on, settled for a pair of Stephen Gostkowski field goals. Buffalo's defense, which limited the Patriots to just 101 net yards in the first half, completely wilted following the break, surrendering 295 net yards. Bill Belichick adjusted by rolling Tom Brady out to negate pressure, and the Bills simply had no answer for it. Brady caught fire as a consequence, misfiring just twice after halftime. He finished 27-of-37 for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady had some brilliant moments. His second touchdown was a great heave into triple coverage to someone named Brian Tyms. Brady then marched down the field, up just 8 points, beginning from his own 7-yard line. He moved the chains and ultimately threw a score, thanks to a third-and-16 conversion to Rob Gronkowski. If the Bills had a legitimate stop unit, they wouldn't have allowed that; instead, they had Preston Brown trying to cover the monstrous tight end. That's just not going to work.    I mentioned that Brady threw touchdowns to Wright (1-1) and Tyms (1-43). Brady's other scores went to "
