The quarterback didn't have much fortune in the second half, as 2 touchdowns were wiped out because of a drop and an illegal shift. Luck's sole score went to Thomas (8-30).    Despite this strong showing by Miami's offense, there is a big concern, which is pass protection. Tannehill took 5 sacks and was stripped twice. The Colts don't even have a good pass rush, so what's going to happen when the Dolphins battle a team that has a strong front 7 (the Browns don't count because they can't score, so the strength of their defense doesn't matter)?    The Colts also have pass-protection issues. In fact, owner Jim Irsay took to Twitter and demanded for better blocking from his offensive line. Luck was sacked 3 times, but that doesn't tell the story of how much pressure Luck saw throughout the afternoon. Making matters worse, Indianapolis lost starting guard Donald Thomas for the season with a torn quad.    Luck went 25-of-43 for 321 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.
