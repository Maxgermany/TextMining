   "comment":"Davone Bess (5-38) was next on the stat sheet for Cleveland.    More bad coaching for the Browns: They went for it 4th-and-4 on Baltimore's 36 at the beginning of the 4.h quarter. They gained 3 yards, so they turned it over on downs. On top of that, Chudzinski opted to challenge the spot, a strategy that almost never works. He lost the review. So, in addition to making a poor decision - the Ravens weren't moving the ball, so pinning them inside the 10 would've been the better move - he compounded it by wasting a precious second-half timeout.    I thought it was amusing that the Baltimore crowd booed former kicker "

   "comment":"Davone Bess have been highly criticized all year. Little has had trouble hanging on to the ball and running correct routes. Bess, meanwhile, has been even worse in terms of drops. He also muffed a punt last week that cost Cleveland a victory last week at Kansas City. However, both were inexplicably outstanding in this upset victory over the old Browns' franchise. Little opened up with a difficult 32-yard reception on the second drive, which ultimately culminated with a touchdown that Bess caught as he was falling down. It was the same thing in the second quarter, as Little made another tough catch, but was whistled for taunting. Bess once again would find the end zone a bit later, as he broke "
