He tossed 2 interceptions, both of which were forced into tight coverage. He was also completely inept in the 2.minute drill once again. One of the FOX announcers praised Brees for being so good in these situations, but both he and Sean Payton have been dreadful this year. For whatever reason, Brees refuses to spike the ball or use any of his timeouts. He simply goes to the line of scrimmage and allows the clock to tick, and he makes bad decisions because he has to hurry as a consequence. One of his 2 picks came as a result of Brees rushing to get a play off. It's almost like Brees and Payton had a private bet on how few stoppages they'd have to utilize in the 2.minute drills this year. Their incompetence in such situations is staggering. Payton was also to blame for another reason. He was so conservative in this game, as he foolishly punted on 4.h-and-short near midfield on numerous occasions. Not converting could obviously backfire, but Payton has 1 of the best quarterbacks in the NFL at his disposal. It's insanely stupid to be so cautious. Choosing to punt the ball away on the first drive of overtime cost Payton the game.    Two of Brees' touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Hyde that let the Redskins took over at their own 40, but they did nothing with the possession. Washington finally got a nice drive going thanks to passes to Andre Roberts and Pierre Garcon (3-34). Morris (21-125) charged hard with 11 yards to the 1.yard line. He then finished the drive with a plunge into the end zone. Just before the half, the 49ers moved the ball with a tremendous 25-yard catch by Michael Crabtree (5-58) to set up a 41-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Kaepernick threw a ball up for grabs in the third quarter that was picked off by Greg Ducre. The Redskins didn't get anything out of that possession, but on the next drive, they moved the ball with an 11-yard run by Morris and a 31-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (2-39). Aaron Lynch sacked Griffin, but a helmet-to-helmet penalty moved Washington inside the San Francisco's 20-yard line. The Redskins tied it at 10 with a short field goal. Early in the 4.h quarter, Trent Murphy punched the ball out of Frank Gore's (13-36) hands and safety Philip Thomas recovered the ball to set up the Redskins at the 49ers' 36-yard line. That led to a 46-yard field goal for Kai Forbath. The 49ers answered with a 29-yard pass to Boldin. Ryan Clark added a 15-yard penalty on the play with his helmet-to-helmet hit. That moved ball inside the Redskins' 20-yard line. A pass to Boldin (9-137) moved it to the 4-yard line before Hyde (7-16) darted into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. The Redskins got 2 more possessions, but the 49ers' defense slammed the door as Lynch came up with a clutch sack on the first possession and Justin Smith beat "

Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock. To start the second half, Hyde rumbled for 32 yards, and Gabbert threw a beautiful pass to Celek for 29 yards. The 49ers settled for a short field goal, but that was all the offense they could muster in the final 2 quarters. Dallas got going when Elliott ripped off a 23-yard run. Prescott connected on a couple of passes, and then Elliott plunged into the end zone for the game-winning score. Early in the 4.h quarter, Gabbert threw a poorly placed pass, and it was intercepted by "

I don't know if that says more about Gabbert's incompetence or the lack of talent in San Francisco's receiving corps, but it's a sad state of affairs. As for Kerley and Hyde, the former caught 8 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. Given how much Gabbert loves throwing to him, Kerley should be owned in all formats. Hyde, meanwhile, gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He also caught all 6 of his targets for 36 receiving yards.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how horrible Phil Simms was tonight. He called Jeremy Kerley Jeremy Colored - kind of racist, eh? - and then said, This game's going to come down to who can make the less mistakes. <i>The less mistakes?</i> You mean fewer mistakes? What kind of English is that? Simms' logic was poor, too. They should run more option! he exclaimed of the 49ers. So, they ran the option, prompting Simms to say, All these teams have seen it so much, they know how to defend it. Contradictory, much? I wasn't the only 1 to notice Simms' woeful announcing.

   "comment":"Hyde carried the ball 13 times and only totaled a measly 14 yards. He was stopped behind the line on many tackles, and he did not look agile. The Cardinals' defense was able to really clog the lanes though, so perhaps that was part of his problem. Hyde also is coming off of an injury, so he might be shaking off some rust. Regardless, he will continue to be the primary back while "

Had Miami surrendered 477 net yards instead of 475, this game would've gone to overtime.    Kaepernick finished 29-of-46 for 296 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault; Torrey Smith had the ball pop out of his hands on the opening play of the third quarter. He was welcomed to the field by a chorus of boos, but those quickly transformed to oohs and ahhs, as Kaepernick was able to make some dazzling plays to help the 49ers move the chains consistently. Most of his great plays came on the ground, as Kaepernick accumulated 113 rushing yards on 10 scampers.    Kaepernick's touchdowns went to Hyde, Smith and Celek. However, his leading target, "

   "comment":"Hyde touchdown. The rest of the first half was pretty much the same, as the 49ers outgained the Jets by intermission, 279-118. They were averaging 9.3 yards per play compared to the Jets' 3.7. It seemed like this was going to be a blowout. And then, the second half happened. The 49ers suddenly couldn't sustain any drives, thanks to Colin Kaepernick's incompetence. Kaepernick had a solid first half, but was just 4-of-11 for 17 yards following intermission. The 49ers tallied just 85 net yards in the second half and overtime as a result. Bryce Petty, meanwhile, came through in the clutch. Petty looked completely incapable of throwing for first downs throughout the opening half, as he held on to the ball too long and took countless sacks, but he made some solid throws toward the end of the game. Then again, he was lucky on some instances, like when he launched a third-and-18 pass to Robby Anderson, which resembled a punt. Petty continued to fire in Anderson's direction, as he couldn't rely on Brandon Marshall, who was hobbled with an injury. Petty finished 23-of-35 for 257 yards and the early interception. He was horrible in the first half, but his performance toward the end of the afternoon should give the Jets some hope that he can be their future No. 2 quarterback. I'd like to see what he can do against tougher defenses, however.    As mentioned, Marshall was hurt. He tweaked his ankle when he was hit late out of bounds, which would explain why he had just 3 catches for 33 yards. Anderson, Petty's favorite receiver, caught 6 balls for 99 yards. He was the only Jet who logged more than 35 receiving yards.    Bilal Powell scored the game-winning touchdown. In fact, Powell handled the majority of the workload because Matt Forte was knocked out early with a knee injury. Forte managed just 3 carries for 8 yards before leaving, allowing Powell to gash the NFL's worst run defense. Powell gained 145 yards and 2 scores on 29 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 34 receiving yards.    The 49ers also ran the ball well, with Carlos Hyde gashing al lethargic Jet defense for 193 yards on 17 carries. It makes me wonder why Hyde had 10 attempts in the second half and overtime. Chip Kelly once again proved himself to be uttery incompetent.    Speaking of Kelly's follies, he looked stupid again by starting Kaepernick. As mentioned, Kaepernick struggled, going 15-of-26 for only 133 yards and a touchdown. He ran just thrice for some reason, picking up 23 rushing yards in the process. Christian Ponder is the best quarterback on San Francisco's roster.    Only 2 49ers caught multiple passes: "

   "comment":"Hyde run, but missed on the 2.point conversion, as the receiver Hoyer threw to ran a bad route. The 49ers still had a chance after that because they recovered an onside kick. However, Aaron Donald closed out the game, sacking Hoyer on 4.h down.    Gurley was an absolute monster for the Rams. He rushed for 113 yards on 28 carries, and he was once again a big-time factor in the passing game, catching 5 of his 7 targets for 36 receiving yards. He scored thrice, but would've had 5 touchdowns had he not been stuffed on the goal line on 2 separate drives. A major reason for this was center John Sullivan getting knocked out with an injury. Backup Austin Blythe couldn't get as much of a push. It'll be important for the Rams to have Sullivan in next week's game against the Cowboys.    Goff continued to improve, as he misfired on just 6 occasions. Granted, this was against San Francisco's inept defense, but he looked so much better than last year, going 22-of-28 for 292 yards and 3 touchdowns. Goff still holds on to the ball too long, and as Cris Collinsworth mentioned, he drifts back in the pocket too often. That said, he works hard, so he should be able to improve in these facets. Until he does, however, he'll be in trouble when battling tough defenses. The 49ers simply couldn't get to the quarterback very often, but some other teams - like the Redskins last week - will be able to.    Two of Goff's touchdowns went to Sammy Watkins (6-106), who finally had a big game. He and Robert Woods (6-108) weren't met with much resistance, as safety Eric Reid was inactive. The only Ram who disappointed was Cooper Kupp, who snatched just 2 balls for 17 yards.    Going back to the 49ers, Hoyer shook off his initial pick to have a solid outing otherwise. He went 23-of-37 for 322 yards and 2 touchdowns. As a reminder, the Rams lost a couple of star players, but Hoyer did a good job of bouncing back from a horrible throw to start the game. He could've melted down quite easily, but didn't.    Hoyer was locked in on Garcon, which wasn't surprising at all. Garcon snared 7 of his 10 targets for 142 yards. Goodwin (2-62) hauled in a 50-yard grab, while fifth-round rookie Trent Taylor (3-32) secured a touchdown after suffering what appeared to be a possible concussion.    Hyde found the end zone twice, gaining 84 yards on 25 tries. For a while, it looked like Hyde fantasy owners were going to be extremely upset, as their running back was barely on the field in the first quarter because of some sort of injury. However, Hyde was able to return, and he had some impressive short-yardage runs on 4.h down to score both of his touchdowns. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Late in the first half, Hoyer threw a pass up for grabs like a punt, and Antoine Bethea picked it off to set up the Cardinals at the 49ers' 30-yard line. Arizona tied it at 6-6 entering halftime. Early in the third quarter, the 49ers put up another field goal drive. Arizona drove into San Francisco territory before DeForest Buckner had a clutch sack to force the Cardinals into settling for a field goal. The 49ers answered again with a Robbie Gould field goal. Arizona repeated the trend, tying the game at 12 midway through the 4.h quarter. Palmer used Ellington and Chris Johnson as receivers before the 49ers' pass rush stepped up to keep the Cardinals to 3 points. Arizona's defense was able to get a stop with the 49ers backed up deep in their own territory, so that set up the Cardinals with good field position at their own 45-yard line with just under 4 minutes remaining. However, Ray Ray Armstrong notched a sack and Elvis Dumervil recorded the 100th sack of his career to get the ball for the 49ers' offense. Hoyer couldn't do anything with it, forcing the 49ers to punt again. Dumervil added another sack, and that basically forced overtime. A pass interference on Patrick Peterson in overtime helped get San Francisco on the move. The 49ers advanced the ball with an 11-yard pass to Pierre Garcon (4-36), a third-down conversion with an 8.yard run by Kyle Juszcyk, and a pass to Hyde for 9 yards to get inside the 10-yard line. The drive stalled, and Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. Because it was the opening possession of overtime, Arizona got a chance to score. Palmer hit Jaron Brown for receptions of 17 and 25 yards. A holding on "

   "comment":"Hyde's running, but then Demarcus Lawrence burned Joe Staley for a strip-sack that the Cowboys recovered to maintain their 17-point lead going into halftime. Dallas blew the game open in the third quarter when Elliott caught a screen pass and exploded down the field for a 72-yard touchdown. The Cowboys added another drive with Prescott scrambling ahead for a short touchdown run. At the end of the third quarter, Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith came on a blitz to strip-sack Beathard, and Dallas recovered the loose ball. Shortly later, Dez Bryant made a leaping touchdown catch in the back of the end zone. That score tied Bob Hayes for the most touchdown receptions in Dallas Cowboys history.    Prescott was 16-of-25 for 234 yards with 3 touchdown through the air. He ran for 26 yards on 4 carries with a score. Bryant (7-63-1) and Witten (4-54-1) led Dallas through the air.    Elliott had his best game of the season, running for 147 yards on 26 carries with 2 touchdowns. He also added that 72-yard touchdown reception.    Beathard was 22-of-38 for 235 yards in his first NFL start. Hyde ran for 68 yards on 14 carries with 4 catches for 20 yards.    Defensively, Dallas defensive ends "

Beathard followed that up with an interception on a deflection, and he then tossed a pick-six late in the first half on what looked like a miscommunication. Beathard finished 17-of-36 for 167 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The good news is that he was able to scramble 6 times for 40 rushing yards. The bad news is that Beathard looks completely overwhelmed. He does not appear as though he can be a viable NFL starter because of his atrocious accuracy, so perhaps the 49ers will be able to acquire "
