   "comment":"Carlos Hyde (4-36) vultured another touchdown.    As for the Saints, Brees threw for 292 yards (28-of-47) and 3 touchdowns, but he had a poor outing. He tossed 2 interceptions, both of which were forced into tight coverage. He was also completely inept in the 2.minute drill once again. One of the FOX announcers praised Brees for being so good in these situations, but both he and Sean Payton have been dreadful this year. For whatever reason, Brees refuses to spike the ball or use any of his timeouts. He simply goes to the line of scrimmage and allows the clock to tick, and he makes bad decisions because he has to hurry as a consequence. One of his 2 picks came as a result of Brees rushing to get a play off. It's almost like Brees and Payton had a private bet on how few stoppages they'd have to utilize in the 2.minute drills this year. Their incompetence in such situations is staggering. Payton was also to blame for another reason. He was so conservative in this game, as he foolishly punted on 4.h-and-short near midfield on numerous occasions. Not converting could obviously backfire, but Payton has 1 of the best quarterbacks in the NFL at his disposal. It's insanely stupid to be so cautious. Choosing to punt the ball away on the first drive of overtime cost Payton the game.    Two of Brees' touchdowns went to "

Hyde had just 24 yards on 9 attempts at the half, and both of his scores came at the very end when the Seahawks stopped trying because they were up 37-3.    Only 3 49ers had more than 20 receiving yards: "

   "comment":"Carlos Hyde. The Cowboys answered with a drive that was aided by the officials as they made a terrible roughing call on Jaquiski Tartt. Dallas took advantage with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams (4-44-1). Before halftime, Prescott led a 2-minute drill that ended with a short touchdown pass to Brice Butler (5-41-1) with only a dozen seconds left on the clock. To start the second half, Hyde rumbled for 32 yards, and Gabbert threw a beautiful pass to Celek for 29 yards. The 49ers settled for a short field goal, but that was all the offense they could muster in the final 2 quarters. Dallas got going when Elliott ripped off a 23-yard run. Prescott connected on a couple of passes, and then Elliott plunged into the end zone for the game-winning score. Early in the 4.h quarter, Gabbert threw a poorly placed pass, and it was intercepted by Morris Claiborne. Elliott continued to run wild as Dallas added on a field goal. The Cowboys' defense shut the door with Claiborne making a tackle on Torrey Smith on a 4.h down to end the game.    The star of the game offensively was Elliott. He ran for 138 yards on 23 carries with a touchdown and had 1 reception for 19 yards. Dallas was without Tyron Smith and La'el Collins, yet still controlled the line of scrimmage.    Dak Prescott was 23-of-32 for 245 yards with 2 touchdowns. Dez Bryant was out, and Cole Beasley totaled 66 yards on 3 receptions. Jason Witten (7-47) chipped in some clutch catches to move the chains.    Blaine Gabbert was 16-of-23 for 196 yards with 1 score and 1 interception. Jeremy Kerley led the 49ers in receiving with 6 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 74 yards on 15 carries with a touchdown.    Defensively, "

   "comment":"Carlos Hyde, no 49er caught passes until there were 2 minutes remaining in the third quarter. I don't know if that says more about Gabbert's incompetence or the lack of talent in San Francisco's receiving corps, but it's a sad state of affairs. As for Kerley and Hyde, the former caught 8 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. Given how much Gabbert loves throwing to him, Kerley should be owned in all formats. Hyde, meanwhile, gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. He also caught all 6 of his targets for 36 receiving yards.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how horrible Phil Simms was tonight. He called Jeremy Kerley Jeremy Colored - kind of racist, eh? - and then said, This game's going to come down to who can make the less mistakes. <i>The less mistakes?</i> You mean fewer mistakes? What kind of English is that? Simms' logic was poor, too. They should run more option! he exclaimed of the 49ers. So, they ran the option, prompting Simms to say, All these teams have seen it so much, they know how to defend it. Contradictory, much? I wasn't the only 1 to notice Simms' woeful announcing. This was the best tweet I found:   "

   "comment":"Carlos Hyde. New England quickly tacked on another touchdown as LeGarrette Blount took off on a 42-yard run before a screen pass to James White (6-63-1) found the end zone from 9 yards out. The 49ers closed the lead to 3 after Colin Kaepernick took off on a 17-yard run, Hyde ran for 11 yards, and Kaepernick hit Garrett Celek (3-41) for 19 yards. Kaepernick then connected with Vance McDonald for an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots took a 13-10 lead into the locker room at the half. In the middle stretch of the game, the Patriots' offensive line was struggling as New England couldn't establish a consistent rushing attack and was allowing heat on Brady. However midway through the second half, New England put a drive together built mainly on a series of passes - 21 yards to Malcolm Mitchell, 14 yards to White, 14 yards to Martelllus Bennett (1-14), 13 yards to Edelman - before a 5.yard pass to Amendola for a touchdown. The Patriots put the game away a few minutes later when Brady made a great play scrambling forward before lofting in a strike to lead Mitchell (4-98-1) down the field for a 56-yard touchdown. New England tacked on a field-goal drive midway through the 4.h quarter as well. In garbage time, Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Draughn.    Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards and 4 touchdowns. Edelman led the Patriots in receiving with 8 catches for 77 yards and a score.    LeGarrette Blount totaled 124 yards on 19 carries to lead New England on the ground.    Kaepernick was 16-of-30 for 206 yards with 2 scores. He ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Vance McDonald caught 3 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown.    Carlos Hyde ran for 86 yards on 19 carries with 3 receptions for 24 yards.

   "comment":"Carlos Hyde touchdown. The rest of the first half was pretty much the same, as the 49ers outgained the Jets by intermission, 279-118. They were averaging 9.3 yards per play compared to the Jets' 3.7. It seemed like this was going to be a blowout. And then, the second half happened. The 49ers suddenly couldn't sustain any drives, thanks to Colin Kaepernick's incompetence. Kaepernick had a solid first half, but was just 4-of-11 for 17 yards following intermission. The 49ers tallied just 85 net yards in the second half and overtime as a result. Bryce Petty, meanwhile, came through in the clutch. Petty looked completely incapable of throwing for first downs throughout the opening half, as he held on to the ball too long and took countless sacks, but he made some solid throws toward the end of the game. Then again, he was lucky on some instances, like when he launched a third-and-18 pass to Robby Anderson, which resembled a punt. Petty continued to fire in Anderson's direction, as he couldn't rely on Brandon Marshall, who was hobbled with an injury. Petty finished 23-of-35 for 257 yards and the early interception. He was horrible in the first half, but his performance toward the end of the afternoon should give the Jets some hope that he can be their future No. 2 quarterback. I'd like to see what he can do against tougher defenses, however.    As mentioned, Marshall was hurt. He tweaked his ankle when he was hit late out of bounds, which would explain why he had just 3 catches for 33 yards. Anderson, Petty's favorite receiver, caught 6 balls for 99 yards. He was the only Jet who logged more than 35 receiving yards.    Bilal Powell scored the game-winning touchdown. In fact, Powell handled the majority of the workload because Matt Forte was knocked out early with a knee injury. Forte managed just 3 carries for 8 yards before leaving, allowing Powell to gash the NFL's worst run defense. Powell gained 145 yards and 2 scores on 29 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 34 receiving yards.    The 49ers also ran the ball well, with Carlos Hyde gashing al lethargic Jet defense for 193 yards on 17 carries. It makes me wonder why Hyde had 10 attempts in the second half and overtime. Chip Kelly once again proved himself to be uttery incompetent.    Speaking of Kelly's follies, he looked stupid again by starting Kaepernick. As mentioned, Kaepernick struggled, going 15-of-26 for only 133 yards and a touchdown. He ran just thrice for some reason, picking up 23 rushing yards in the process. Christian Ponder is the best quarterback on San Francisco's roster.    Only 2 49ers caught multiple passes: "

   "comment":"Carlos Hyde on a third down during the opening drive. He then had Hyde open in the flat, but threw so poorly that Hyde had to twist his body oddly, resulting in a drop. Beathard followed that up with an interception on a deflection, and he then tossed a pick-six late in the first half on what looked like a miscommunication. Beathard finished 17-of-36 for 167 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The good news is that he was able to scramble 6 times for 40 rushing yards. The bad news is that Beathard looks completely overwhelmed. He does not appear as though he can be a viable NFL starter because of his atrocious accuracy, so perhaps the 49ers will be able to acquire Kirk Cousins next offseason.    Beathard led the 49ers in rushing, as Carlos Hyde (12-25) didn't have any room to run because massive right tackle Trent Brown was out. Making matters worse, left tackle "
