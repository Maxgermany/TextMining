   "comment":"Chester Taylor combined for. Frerotte was pretty economical, going 16-of-28 for 204 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Peterson, meanwhile, gained 77 yards on 17 carries.    The Panthers seemed unprepared for the noise in the Homer Dome. They committed 6 false starts and a delay of game. A blocked field goal of their defense's was also negated because John Fox used a timeout.    Carolina couldn't run the ball - "

  "comment":"Chester Taylor broke off a 34-yard run and Larry Fitzgerald caught the first touchdown pass ever thrown by Bartel. By the way, Fitzgerald went over 9,000 yards receiving in this game. At 23-7, technically, this was still a game. Arizona got the ball back with 4:58 to play and scratched their way to the red zone before San Francisco decided enough was enough. From the 16-yard line, Bartel missed on 3 straight passes, and when he finally connected with Doucet, it was well short of the first down, and that was that. The 49ers drained the final 3:27 with Dixon running and Smith kneeling. It was a great win because Gore was able to rest a little bit, but Smith (20-of-38 for 267 yards 2 TDs, 1 INT) did not play very well. If not for the defense being dominant and the running game (164 yards) working, this might have been a much different story. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",
