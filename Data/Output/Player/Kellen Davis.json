However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage. The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His 6.h boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by Darrius Heyward-Bey, but Lechler delivered a franchise record 80-yard punt that sent an amazed Hester running backwards as the ball went into the end zone. Chicago's offense had some fight left with Hanie finding Knox on a pickup of 19 yards then going right back to him on an identical play for 16 more to put them in scoring range. Hanie scrambled for 7 yards and Gould connected from 53 yards out to trim the lead to 18-13. It looked like Oakland's next drive put a finish to any comeback bid. Carson Palmer (21-for-37 301 yards 1 INT) connected with Schilens to convert 1 third down and hit Louis Murphy for 47 yards on another to finally wound a Bears defense that answered the bell time after time, despite not getting help from their offense. Bush took the ball and ran right through the line for a 3-yard score to make it 25-13 and seemingly seal it. Hanie was not done, however, finding Knox on a bomb that the late Al Davis would certainly appreciate from the great beyond. It went 81 yards and led to a 9-yard touchdown pass to Davis. At 25-20, the Bears went to the onside kick and almost recovered it. The ball glanced off "
