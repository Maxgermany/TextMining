Wentz ended up going 18-of-32 for 211 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. He struggled early, overshooting Alshon Jeffery for a touchdown in the opening quarter. His pick was also poor, as his turnover led to San Francisco's only touchdown. However, Wentz also made some great plays at times, leading the Eagles to their 7.h victory of the season.    Wentz's touchdowns went to Zach Ertz and Jeffery, which was very fortunate for Jeffery's fantasy owners because the wideout converted only 2 of his 6 targets otherwise. The touchdown was impressive, as he caught the ball with 1 hand over a San Francisco defender. Ertz, meanwhile, snatched 4 balls for 34 yards.    Corey Clement led the Eagles in rushing, gaining 54 yards on 10 carries. Don't read too much into this, however, as most of this came late in the game during garbage time. LeGarrette Blount handled most of the significant workload, churning out 48 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Curiously, Wendell Smallwood (1 carry, 5 yards) didn't do anything.    Moving on to the 49ers, it was another rough afternoon for C.J. Beathard. The rookie looked shaky right away, firing behind Carlos Hyde on a third down during the opening drive. He then had Hyde open in the flat, but threw so poorly that Hyde had to twist his body oddly, resulting in a drop. Beathard followed that up with an interception on a deflection, and he then tossed a pick-six late in the first half on what looked like a miscommunication. Beathard finished 17-of-36 for 167 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The good news is that he was able to scramble 6 times for 40 rushing yards. The bad news is that Beathard looks completely overwhelmed. He does not appear as though he can be a viable NFL starter because of his atrocious accuracy, so perhaps the 49ers will be able to acquire Kirk Cousins next offseason.    Beathard led the 49ers in rushing, as Carlos Hyde (12-25) didn't have any room to run because massive right tackle Trent Brown was out. Making matters worse, left tackle "

   "comment":"Duane Brown. Browns, as they hold Houston's first- and second-round picks in the 2018 NFL Draft. With the Ravens and Jaguars getting wins, the Texans' loss to the Colts puts their postseason hopes on life support. As expected, the season-ending injury to Deshaun Watson was a death blow to Houston after losing J.J. Watt and Whitney Mercilus, but that was given further evidence as backup quarterback Tom Savage was awful for 3 quarters. The Texans look poised to produce some high picks for Cleveland after sustaining those injuries. The Colts were finally able to finish off a game, and got a close win, their third of the season. However, Indianapolis has no playoff hopes with Andrew Luck out for the year, so each victory just hurts the team's draft position.    The Colts struck first, as T.Y. Hilton got wide open in busted coverage for a 45-yard touchdown with a well-thrown pass from Jacoby Brissett. In the second quarter, another completion to Hilton set up a field goal and a 10-0 lead for Indianapolis. The Texans missed a field goal to spoil a drive, and that turned out to be a huge play in the game as the Texans had to go for a touchdown late in the 4.h quarter rather than a game-tying field goal. Brissett was rocked on a blitz by Eddie Pleasant during the 2-minute drill at the end of the first half, forcing a fumble. Lamarr Houston scooped up the loose ball and returned it 34 yards for a Houston touchdown. The Colts took a 10-7 lead into the locker room. Hilton got loose again in the third quarter, as Brissett hit him on the run. After breaking free downfield, Hilton leapt over Kareem Jackson. Hilton got up and ran another 30 yards for a touchdown, and the officials ruled that Jackson didn't touch him, so Hilton scored on an 80-yard touchdown. Down 20-17, the Texans finally got moving on a drive that ended with a 34-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. Houston's defense got Savage 1 more chance, and he moved the ball down the field inside the Colts' 10-yard line with completions to Bruce Ellington, Stephen Anderson and Hopkins. In the final seconds, the Colts put together a goal-line stand that ended with Jabaal Sheard's second strip-sack of the game to clinch the win for Indianapolis.    Brissett completed 20-of-30 passes for 308 yards with 2 touchdowns. Hilton had 5 receptions for 175 yards and 2 scores.    Frank Gore ran for 51 yards on 17 carries with 3 receptions for 26 yards.    Savage completed 19-of-44 passes for 219 yards with a score. Hopkins had 6 reception for 86 yards and a score. Will Fuller (2-32) was limited without Watson at quarterback.    Lamar Miller had 57 yards on 10 carries with 3 receptions for 34 yards.    Defensively, Jabaal Sheard had 2 sacks, with each resulting in a fumble. He had his way with Julie'n Davenport and Chris Clark, the Texans' replacements for Duane Brown. "

   "comment":"Duane Brown was supposed to help solidify the unit, but the other pieces are still big weaknesses. The Seahawks have to look into getting Wilson offensive line help in the offseason if they want to be competitive. Despite the pressure that Wilson saw on every play, he was able to find space and make plays. He showcased his scrambling ability quite a lot, and he finished the day with 77 yards on 10 carries. Wilson really did well to know when to get out of the pocket. A less-mobile quarterback would have been sacked 10 or more times. In terms of passing, Wilson did everything he could to help his team. He had a couple of overthrows on deep balls, but again that was due to issues that his offensive line had in protection. But for the most part, Wilson was able to find his receivers when they were open. He had a few mistakes, and none were worse than the interception he threw when he didn't see Will Compton in underneath coverage. Overall, Wilson went 24-of-45 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The stat line isn't quite indicative of how he played. He was better than the numbers show, and his offensive line is to blame for some of his performance.    Wilson's top receivers in this contest were Brown. Brown was the best performer on the field for either side. Excelling against the run and spying on Wilson late in the game, Brown racked up 11 tackles and a sack, and was able to hit the quarterback multiple times. Brown was all over the field, and his energy rubbed off on the rest of the defense, which did well to limit the strong Seattle offense.    On the offensive side, the Redskins can thank "

   "comment":"Duane Brown in the third quarter. Brown in the third quarter. Russell Wilson got a bit banged up and missed a play. Kam Chancellor also went into the 10. for some undisclosed reason. The worst injury, however, was to Richard Sherman when he grabbed his Achilles. The NBC announcing crew noted that Sherman didn't trust his Achilles entering this contest, and it turned out that his decision to play would end up costing him the season. Sherman was seen telling his teammates that he tore his Achilles on the sideline. For more, check out my . If there was any proof needed that Thursday night games should be abolished, this game was it. The Seahawks-Cardinals clash was a sloppy struggle with way too many injuries, and had Sherman been playing on proper rest, he almost certainly wouldn't have gotten hurt.    Wilson, as mentioned, missed only 1 snap, and he proved that he was healthy with 1 of the most spectacular plays of the season. Wilson was under duress by 2 defenders in the pocket. He spun around twice, avoiding them for 8 seconds. He then launched a ball downfield, and Doug Baldwin caught it and ran toward the end zone for a 54-yard gain. The Seahawks scored a touchdown on the next play. Wilson finished 22-of-32 for 238 yards and 2 touchdowns. Wilson was under pressure more than he anticipated because of Brown's injury. Brown was supposed to provide some stability up front for the Seahawks, but once he left the game, the Seahawks reverted to their previous state where Wilson is constantly hounded and needs to make some amazing plays to give his team a chance to win.    Both of Wilson's touchdowns went to "
