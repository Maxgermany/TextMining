One hilarious sequence from this game: The Buccaneers had a first-and-goal at the 6-yard line following a Bradford fumble. An offensive pass interference, holding and sack later, Tampa had a second-and-goal at the 35! They ended up settling for a field goal. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Unfortunately, left tackle Bradford interception negated by a penalty. In the end though, San Francisco won and kept itself alive in the NFC West race. Unfortunately, left tackle Joe Staley fractured his fibula and could be out 4-6 weeks.    The encouraging thing for the 49ers is that Troy Smith looked pretty damn good. Smith displayed a great arm and hit his receivers downfield for 4 passes of 30 yards or more. Smith went 17-of-28 for 356 yards and a touchdown. Pick him up in your fantasy league if he's available.    Four of Smith's receivers had 4 catches: Delanie Walker (80 yards), Vernon Davis (79) and Michael Crabtree (61, TD).    While Smith was brilliant, Frank Gore was the best 49er offensive player on the field. He had 87 yards on 22 carries, and 3 catches for 67 receiving yards.    The Rams still can't get over the road hump; they've been undefeated in the Edward Jones Dome since the opener, but they can't win away from home yet. It'll happen eventually, and they certainly had a chance at San Francisco; they couldn't do anything with the opening possession in overtime, and then lost on what was 1 of the worst pass interference calls I've ever seen (as far as an uncatchable ball is concerned).    Oh, and Bradford really needs better weapons. He went 30-of-42 for 251 yards and a touchdown despite the fact that his top receivers were "

   "comment":"Sam Bradford tossed a weird shovel pass directly to a Falcons defender inside the 5-yard line. It was odd because there was no Rams receiver in the vicinity.    Oh, and you'd have to say that Bradford tossed a weird shovel pass directly to a Falcons defender inside the 5-yard line. It was odd because there was no Rams receiver in the vicinity.    Oh, and you'd have to say that Matt Ryan's brilliance played a factor in Atlanta's victory. Ryan was in complete control of this game, going 26-of-39 for 253 yards and 2 touchdowns. Watching him dissect the Rams was a thing of beauty. I'd love to elevate him to elite quarterback status, but I'd like to see him have several great performances in outdoor games.    St. Louis had no answer for Roddy White, who caught 9 balls for 83 yards. Unfortunately, he didn't catch a touchdown because Ryan found his lesser targets (Brian Finneran, Justin Peelle) in the end zone.    The Rams contained Michael Turner throughout, but surrendered a 39-yard touchdown at the very end. Turner gained 131 yards on 28 attempts.    I mentioned Bradford's foolish shovel pass interception, but he played well otherwise. He went 27-of-42 for 233 yards, 2 scores and the aforementioned pick despite the lack of talent around him.    "

   "comment":"Sam Bradford took a sack from Sam Acho (2 sacks, forced fumble). Much earlier, Bradford was strip-sacked inside the Cardinal 15-yard line. And then there was the run defense. I can't believe how bad it was. Chris Wells has been running on fumes the past 6 or so weeks after suffering a knee injury, and he was able to muster only 20 rushing yards on 10 carries against this St. Louis squad back in Week 9. But Wells trampled the Rams this Sunday, compiling 228 yards and a touchdown on 27 attempts.    Despite Wells going off, John Skelton couldn't really capitalize. He was dreadful once again, going 12-of-23 for 114 yards and 2 interceptions. Most of his attempts were incredibly inaccurate. On 1 of those throws, I commented on the forum, Great pass by Skelton to the cheerleaders.    Larry Fitzgerald was the only Cardinal who had more than 2 receptions. He notched 3 for 55 yards.    Brandon Lloyd had a better fantasy day, catching 5 balls for 74 yards and a touchdown. Despite Sam Bradford's struggles, Lloyd continues to produce.    Speaking of Bradford, St. Louis' coaching staff clearly didn't show any confidence in him, opening up the game with 5 consecutive runs, including 1 on a 3rd-and-9. Bradford once again wasn't very good but didn't have much of a chance behind his miserable offensive line, going 17-of-31 for 203 yards and the score to Lloyd.

He took a whopping 6 sacks behind an offensive line ravaged by injuries. Bradford was able to successfully dink and dunk against a poor Washington defense last week, but that doesn't work versus elite units like Chicago's. It's worth noting though that he was betrayed by his pedestrian receivers, who dropped several passes.    The Rams couldn't move the chains whatsoever. In a pathetic effort, they had just 20 yards of total offense just prior to the 2.minute warning of the first half. In addition to being unable to advance the ball aerially, they also struggled on the ground. "

   "comment":"Sam Bradford neither has the physical talent nor the players around him to mount a double-digit comeback against a competent defense. But more importantly, Minnesota would be able to pound Peterson all afternoon. The fluky score really got this game going for Minnesota. The Rams were doing a great job of dominating the line of scrimmage on the opening possession. They had Christian Ponder dead to rights in the backfield. However, Ponder somehow escaped a St. Louis defender who had his arms wrapped around him and then scampered into the end zone. What wasn't fluky was what Peterson did afterward. He broke free with an 82-yard score at the beginning of the second quarter. Peterson proceeded to trample St. Louis' defense the rest of the afternoon, ultimately finishing with 212 yards and that touchdown on 24 carries. He's now 294 yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards.    With Peterson running wild, Christian Ponder didn't need to do much. He went just 17-of-24 for 131 yards and the aforementioned rushing score. As a result, no Viking had more than 27 receiving yards. Kyle Rudolph (3-22) disappointed his fantasy owners.    As for the Rams, I made note of Bradford's contract situation in my recently updated : The Rams will probably know what they have in Sam Bradford following the 2013 season. Bradford will be due $14 million in 2014, so St. Louis will either have to give him a new contract or pull the plug. Well, Bradford didn't do anything today to give the front office any sort of confidence in him. His final numbers look great - 35-of-55 for 377 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception - but most of that came in garbage time. He was just 14-of-23 for 148 yards a score and the pick at halftime. His interception was returned for 6. as he didn't see lineman "

Freeman made a terrible decision throwing off his back foot to a well-covered receiver.  - Just before halftime, Freeman threw another bad interception into a group of defenders.

   "comment":"Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line."

   "comment":"Sam Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line. In the second quarter, Philadelphia put a field goal drive together, with the big play being a 22-yard run by Ryan Mathews. Caleb Sturgis was good on the 52-yard field goal. The Panthers answered as Ted Ginn took an end around for 43 yards to the Philadelphia's 8-yard line. Olsen hit another nice block on that play. A few snaps later, Newton ran into the scrum but stretched the ball over the goal line for a touchdown. Malcolm Jenkins then made a tremendous diving interception to set up Philadelphia in Carolina territory, but the Panthers' defense broke up a few passes in the end zone to force the Eagles into a field goal. Carolina took a 14-6 lead into the half. The Panthers came out of the locker room and moved the ball down the field on the Eagles thanks to passes to Ginn and Olsen. To finish the drive, Newton threw a short touchdown pass to Tolbert. The power back went through about 5 tackles in the flat to power into the end zone. The Eagles quickly cut the Panthers lead to 21-13 as Mathews took off on a 63-yard touchdown run. He used his speed to break into the open field and pull away from a diving Luke Kuechly. Newton threw his third interception when he had an open receiver, but fired a fastball that was unnecessary. It bounced off the hands of Devin Funchess, and Byron Maxwell made a diving catch. Starting at the Carolina 18-yard line, the Panthers' defense came through by limiting Philadelphia to a field goal as Kuechly broke up a touchdown pass to Josh Huff. Once again, the Eagles drove into Carolina territory, but Sturgis missed a 50-yard field goal. Carolina started moving again with Newton taking off on a draw for 16 yards to set up an easy field goal. The Panthers' defense shut down the Eagles to clinch the win for Carolina.    Cam Newton completed 14-of-24 passes for 197 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. He ran for 20 yards on 4 carries and a score. It was an ugly game for Newton, but good enough to keep his team undefeated.    Jonathan Stewart ran for 125 yards on 24 carries. He churned out a lot of tough yards for Carolina. Like last year, Stewart is getting hot off a bye.    Greg Olsen had 3 receptions for 65 yards. Tedd Ginn (5-59) and Philly Brown (3-38) chipped in for Carolina.    Sam Bradford was 26-of-46 for 205 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Philadelphia's passing attack never got into a groove and was severely hurt by losing Bradford threw a pass into traffic, which was intercepted by safety Colin Jones off a deflection. However, the Eagles' defense bailed out Bradford as Nolan Carroll stripped Ted Ginn of the ball and controlled it for an interception at the Eagles' 6-yard line."

It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Jermaine Gresham (2-33) snared Palmer's touchdown. The play featured a misplay by Harrison Smith, who thought he had an interception, and a missed tackle from Smith as well. Michael Floyd (2-21) didn't do much, while neither John Brown (4 targets) and J.J. Nelson (5 targets) managed a single receiving yard.

He was able to escape pressure to scramble for a first down on a third-and-15. He then ripped a pass to Anquan Boldin for a gain of 29 yards while taking a bit hit on a third-and-18. This improbable conversion set up the tying field goal after Minnesota linebacker Eric Kendricks was able to temporary stop the bleeding with a terrific tackle on third down. The Kendricks stop seemed to be absolutely huge, especially after the Vikings moved the chains on the ensuing drive, but Cordarrelle Patterson negated that conversion by lining up incorrectly. The play immediately following the penalty was Bradford's pick, snatched by Darius Slay."

   "comment":"Sam Bradford interception by Anthony Hitchens.Bradford interception by Anthony Hitchens. And all of this was just in the opening half! The mistakes continued for Dallas following intermission. Dak Prescott lost a fumble on a Brian Robison strip-sack, setting up a Minnesota field goal. Prescott then fumbled again while trying to run out the clock, but Elliott was able to recover the ball. With all of these mistakes, the Vikings hung around and even led 9-7. They forced a punt and would retain possession with a 2.point advantage early in the 4.h quarter. However, the tide turned when Adam Thielen muffed a punt. The Cowboys recovered, and 1 play later, Prescott found Dez Bryant for what would turn out to be the game-winning touchdown. Minnesota would reach the end zone to cover the spread with 25 seconds remaining, but missed on the 2.point conversion because right tackle Jeremiah Sirles was guilty of a false start. On the actual play, the officials missed an obvious blow to the head on Bradford.    It's a shame for the Vikings that they lost because they had a great defensive game plan against the Cowboys. Elliott was limited to 90 rushing yards for the first time since Week 2. Elliott gained 86 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, but 30 of his yards came on 1 attempt. He otherwise was limited to 56 yards on 19 tries. He also had a fumble overturned by replay, as mentioned. Granted, Elliott had a long burst negated by penalty, but Minnesota did a great job tackling him for minimal gains.    The Vikings also restricted Prescott to a season-low passing yardage total. Prescott went just 12-of-18 for 139 yards and a touchdown to go along with 37 rushing yards on 6 scrambles. He was guilty of 2 fumbles, 1 of which was lost. He still made some great plays - a 14-yard run of his on a third-and-13 set up the first touchdown - but he definitely didn't look like himself because of Minnesota's terrific defense.    Elliott's sole score went to Bryant, who caught 4 passes for 84 yards and the decisive touchdown. Bryant was just 1 of 4 Dallas players to catch passes. The others were "
