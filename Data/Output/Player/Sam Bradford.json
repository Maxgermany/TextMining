   "comment":"Bradford interception negated by a penalty. In the end though, San Francisco won and kept itself alive in the NFC West race. Unfortunately, left tackle Joe Staley fractured his fibula and could be out 4-6 weeks.    The encouraging thing for the 49ers is that Troy Smith looked pretty damn good. Smith displayed a great arm and hit his receivers downfield for 4 passes of 30 yards or more. Smith went 17-of-28 for 356 yards and a touchdown. Pick him up in your fantasy league if he's available.    Four of Smith's receivers had 4 catches: Delanie Walker (80 yards), Vernon Davis (79) and Michael Crabtree (61, TD).    While Smith was brilliant, Frank Gore was the best 49er offensive player on the field. He had 87 yards on 22 carries, and 3 catches for 67 receiving yards.    The Rams still can't get over the road hump; they've been undefeated in the Edward Jones Dome since the opener, but they can't win away from home yet. It'll happen eventually, and they certainly had a chance at San Francisco; they couldn't do anything with the opening possession in overtime, and then lost on what was 1 of the worst pass interference calls I've ever seen (as far as an uncatchable ball is concerned).    Oh, and Bradford really needs better weapons. He went 30-of-42 for 251 yards and a touchdown despite the fact that his top receivers were "

   "comment":"Bradford tossed a weird shovel pass directly to a Falcons defender inside the 5-yard line. It was odd because there was no Rams receiver in the vicinity.    Oh, and you'd have to say that Matt Ryan's brilliance played a factor in Atlanta's victory. Ryan was in complete control of this game, going 26-of-39 for 253 yards and 2 touchdowns. Watching him dissect the Rams was a thing of beauty. I'd love to elevate him to elite quarterback status, but I'd like to see him have several great performances in outdoor games.    St. Louis had no answer for Roddy White, who caught 9 balls for 83 yards. Unfortunately, he didn't catch a touchdown because Ryan found his lesser targets (Brian Finneran, Justin Peelle) in the end zone.    The Rams contained Michael Turner throughout, but surrendered a 39-yard touchdown at the very end. Turner gained 131 yards on 28 attempts.    I mentioned Bradford's foolish shovel pass interception, but he played well otherwise. He went 27-of-42 for 233 yards, 2 scores and the aforementioned pick despite the lack of talent around him.    "

That came much earlier, when Steven Jackson fumbled in the first quarter. At that point, the Saints were up 7-0. The Rams were driving, but Jackson (16-96) coughed it up at midfield. Minutes later, Drew Brees scored another touchdown to put his team up 14-0. At that point, Bradford had no chance. It's very difficult for any young quarterback to play in the raucous Superdome, let alone 1 who has a 14-0 deficit. Bradford really struggled from that point on, finishing 18-of-32 for 231 yards and 2 interceptions. He also missed a wide-open receiver for a potential touchdown in the third quarter.    One play that you won't see on SportsCenter was Bradford's effort on another Jackson fumble. Jackson coughed up the ball in the 4.h quarter, and Bradford impressively ran down safety "

The Rams are fearful that Bradford may have suffered nerve damage, and Steve Spagnuolo went on to say, I'll be praying all night.    As far as the Rams beating themselves, the score of this game isn't nearly as indicative of how these 2 teams played. St. Louis easily could have held the lead going into the 4.h quarter, but continuously shot itself in the foot with mistakes: - The Eagles scored their second touchdown on a fumble return. Late in the first quarter, Bradford stumbled trying to get the ball to his running back. He lost control of the ball, which was returned 56 yards by Juqua Thomas-Parker. - Rookie tight end "

He took a whopping 6 sacks behind an offensive line ravaged by injuries. Bradford was able to successfully dink and dunk against a poor Washington defense last week, but that doesn't work versus elite units like Chicago's. It's worth noting though that he was betrayed by his pedestrian receivers, who dropped several passes.    The Rams couldn't move the chains whatsoever. In a pathetic effort, they had just 20 yards of total offense just prior to the 2.minute warning of the first half. In addition to being unable to advance the ball aerially, they also struggled on the ground. "

   "comment":"Bradford just doesn't have a quality target to throw to deep in opposing territory. It also doesn't help that his offensive line is in shambles. St. Louis has at least been successful kicking field goals, as rookie Greg Zuerlein hadn't missed on a single occasion entering this contest. That's no longer the case, as Zuerlein whiffed 3 times. Thanks to a strong wind, Zuerlein missed from 52, 37 and 66. Yes, 66. After Bradford took a sack near midfield with less than half a minute remaining in regulation, Jeff Fisher let the clock run down before calling a timeout. He had Zuerlein attempt a kick from 66 yards out, which would have set the record for the longest field goal in NFL history had the attempt gone through the uprights. It was wide left, unfortunately, though it had the distance.    The silver lining in this loss for St. Louis is that Bradford performed well despite the absence of Danny Amendola. Bradford went 26-of-39 for 315 yards (and 34 rushing yards), as he looked toward "

   "comment":"Bradford neither has the physical talent nor the players around him to mount a double-digit comeback against a competent defense. But more importantly, Minnesota would be able to pound Peterson all afternoon. The fluky score really got this game going for Minnesota. The Rams were doing a great job of dominating the line of scrimmage on the opening possession. They had Christian Ponder dead to rights in the backfield. However, Ponder somehow escaped a St. Louis defender who had his arms wrapped around him and then scampered into the end zone. What wasn't fluky was what Peterson did afterward. He broke free with an 82-yard score at the beginning of the second quarter. Peterson proceeded to trample St. Louis' defense the rest of the afternoon, ultimately finishing with 212 yards and that touchdown on 24 carries. He's now 294 yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards.    With Peterson running wild, Christian Ponder didn't need to do much. He went just 17-of-24 for 131 yards and the aforementioned rushing score. As a result, no Viking had more than 27 receiving yards. Kyle Rudolph (3-22) disappointed his fantasy owners.    As for the Rams, I made note of Bradford's contract situation in my recently updated 2014 NFL Mock Draft: The Rams will probably know what they have in Sam Bradford following the 2013 season. Bradford will be due $14 million in 2014, so St. Louis will either have to give him a new contract or pull the plug. Well, Bradford didn't do anything today to give the front office any sort of confidence in him. His final numbers look great - 35-of-55 for 377 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception - but most of that came in garbage time. He was just 14-of-23 for 148 yards a score and the pick at halftime. His interception was returned for 6. as he didn't see lineman "

   "comment":"Bradford threw an interception in the end zone to Danny Gorrer, Freeman gave it right back when he was picked off by Janoris Jenkins. The rookie corner returned the ball 41 yards for a touchdown. Freeman made a terrible decision throwing off his back foot to a well-covered receiver.  - Just before halftime, Freeman threw another bad interception into a group of defenders. Linebacker James Laurinaitis came down with the ball. That set up a nice drive by Bradford that ended with a Steven Jackson (19-81) touchdown run."

Bradford was victimized by some drops and miscommunications, but he made numerous mistakes of his own and looked very skittish throughout the afternoon, almost as if he was scared to step into his throws. He made several inaccurate passes, including an early third down that saw him get nearly intercepted. He was then picked off in the end zone, staring down a covered "

Bradford finished 15-of-28 for 270 yards and 3 touchdowns, with the bulk of his stats coming in the second half (10-of-18, 196 yards, 3 TDs).

Bradford made some nice throws throughout the evening, but came up short in the second half, as he simply was too overmatched to compete in a shootout with Arizona's explosive offense. Bradford went 28-of-41 for 361 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions at the end. The first was a pick-six, which happened to be a miscommunication with "

   "comment":"Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Jermaine Gresham (2-33) snared Palmer's touchdown. The play featured a misplay by Harrison Smith, who thought he had an interception, and a missed tackle from Smith as well. Michael Floyd (2-21) didn't do much, while neither John Brown (4 targets) and J.J. Nelson (5 targets) managed a single receiving yard.    As for Minnesota's offense, it wasn't pretty, but the Vikings did enough to get the job done. Sam Bradford finished 20-of-28 for 169 yards and a touchdown. It has to be noted that "

   "comment":"Bradford interception, Prater sealed the victory with yet another clutch kick. The Lions, as a result, have established sole possession of first place of the NFC North with a 7-4 record. Stafford was amazing in this game. His 4.h-quarter effort was absolutely brilliant. He was able to escape pressure to scramble for a first down on a third-and-15. He then ripped a pass to Anquan Boldin for a gain of 29 yards while taking a bit hit on a third-and-18. This improbable conversion set up the tying field goal after Minnesota linebacker Eric Kendricks was able to temporary stop the bleeding with a terrific tackle on third down. The Kendricks stop seemed to be absolutely huge, especially after the Vikings moved the chains on the ensuing drive, but Cordarrelle Patterson negated that conversion by lining up incorrectly. The play immediately following the penalty was Bradford's pick, snatched by Darius Slay."

   "comment":"Bradford interception by Anthony Hitchens. And all of this was just in the opening half! The mistakes continued for Dallas following intermission. Dak Prescott lost a fumble on a Brian Robison strip-sack, setting up a Minnesota field goal. Prescott then fumbled again while trying to run out the clock, but Elliott was able to recover the ball. With all of these mistakes, the Vikings hung around and even led 9-7. They forced a punt and would retain possession with a 2.point advantage early in the 4.h quarter. However, the tide turned when Adam Thielen muffed a punt. The Cowboys recovered, and 1 play later, Prescott found Dez Bryant for what would turn out to be the game-winning touchdown. Minnesota would reach the end zone to cover the spread with 25 seconds remaining, but missed on the 2.point conversion because right tackle Jeremiah Sirles was guilty of a false start. On the actual play, the officials missed an obvious blow to the head on Bradford.    It's a shame for the Vikings that they lost because they had a great defensive game plan against the Cowboys. Elliott was limited to 90 rushing yards for the first time since Week 2. Elliott gained 86 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, but 30 of his yards came on 1 attempt. He otherwise was limited to 56 yards on 19 tries. He also had a fumble overturned by replay, as mentioned. Granted, Elliott had a long burst negated by penalty, but Minnesota did a great job tackling him for minimal gains.    The Vikings also restricted Prescott to a season-low passing yardage total. Prescott went just 12-of-18 for 139 yards and a touchdown to go along with 37 rushing yards on 6 scrambles. He was guilty of 2 fumbles, 1 of which was lost. He still made some great plays - a 14-yard run of his on a third-and-13 set up the first touchdown - but he definitely didn't look like himself because of Minnesota's terrific defense.    Elliott's sole score went to Bryant, who caught 4 passes for 84 yards and the decisive touchdown. Bryant was just 1 of 4 Dallas players to catch passes. The others were "
