Luck had other numerous amazing passes that will undoubtedly be shown on the Dilfer's Dimes feature. The Colts, however, were inconsistent offensively because they couldn't pass protect. Luck's numbers may look pretty - 28-of-39, 322 yards, 2 touchdowns - but several drives stalled because Luck took sacks that he had no chance of getting out of. He was brought down 4 times in the first 2.and-a-half quarters; 5 occasions overall, as Willie Young logged a trio of sacks. Luck took 6 sacks the week before by the Jaguars, who put no pressure on quarterbacks, so this is obviously an issue. Ryan Grigson discussed not being able to build a championship defense because of Luck's contract... so what about the offensive line?    Luck's 2 touchdowns went to T.Y. Hilton (10-171) and Dwayne Allen (6-50). They were the only Indianapolis players to eclipse the 30-yard mark. This includes Dorsett, who was once again disappointing. He caught 2 balls for 26 yards, only seeing 3 targets. He was expected to be a greater factor with Donte Moncrief out with an injury, but that hasn't been the case.    The Colts didn't run the ball very much, but when they did, they had success doing so. "

Moving on to the Vikings, Peterson finished the game with 22 yards on 6 carries, as he handled the ball on the ground just twice following halftime. He also caught a 1-yard pass. It was nice that he was able to get involved, but this loss effectively puts Minnesota out of any sort of playoff contention.    Dorsett (1 catch, 50 yards) and someone named Eric Swoope.
