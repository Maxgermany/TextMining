This was a feel-bad game for Anderson's owners, as Anderson wasn't rewarded with his big performance versus Dallas for some reason. However, Charles showed that he still has some explosion, and it wouldn't surprise me if this is close to a 50-50 time share in the near future.    As for the Bills, they are now 2-1 despite all the talent they unloaded in the preseason. "
