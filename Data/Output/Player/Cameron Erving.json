Kessler finished 26-of-41 for 336 yards and 2 touchdowns, but a lot of that occurred in garbage time. I wouldn't say Kessler played poorly or anything, however. He simply didn't have adequate protection from a fierce Tennessee pass rush.    "

   "comment":"Erving ripped the helmet off of David Irving, and both players were ejected. The Browns established a 3-0 lead, and they were later deep in Dallas territory, down 7-3, but then reality set in. The Browns missed a field goal, and then the Cowboys scored on almost every possession for the rest of the game. Before the Browns knew it, their potential 7-6 deficit turned into a 21-3 halftime score, and there was no way they were coming back from that against a red-hot opponent. How great was Dallas' offense? The Cowboys punted once until the very end of the game, and that punt came on a drive in which they were pinned at their own 1-yard line. Their dominant defensive line pushed around Cleveland's beleaguered front, and Dallas basically did whatever it wanted to. The Cowboys racked up 423 net yards, averaging 6 yards per play. They achieved 29 first downs, and yet those numbers don't even describe how 1-sided this affair was.    Dak Prescott was nearly flawless, as he misfired on just 6 occasions. He finished 21-of-27 for 247 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was great, but Cleveland's secondary and linebacking corps have to shoulder much of the blame. For instance, on a Prescott touchdown to Jason Witten, newcomer Jamie Collins blew a coverage, as it didn't appear as though he knew what to do just yet. Later, rookie corner Xavien Howard whiffed on a tackle after Witten caught a short reception, allowing the future Hall of Famer to rumble for 27 yards. Numerous offside penalties allowed the Cowboys to keep drives alive as well. Speaking of Witten, he had a huge performance. He caught 8 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown - a disappointing stat line, considering that the Browns traded for Collins to join the talented Christian Kirksey. Prescott's other scores went to Cole Beasley (6-56), who was wide open on his score, and Gavin Escobar. Dez Bryant, meanwhile, did nothing positive outside of catch a 19-yard pass. He dropped 2 balls, 1 of which would've been a touchdown.    The Browns had trouble tackling Ezekiel Elliott. The star rookie didn't gain 100 yards, but only because he carried the ball just 18 times, surrendering work to Alfred Morris (17-56) late in this contest because it was such a blowout. Elliott tallied 92 yards and also scored twice.    Before moving on to Cleveland's offense, it's worth noting that the Cowboys lost guard Ronald Leary late in the game to a concussion.    Cleveland welcomed back both Cody Kessler and Corey Coleman, but it didn't make much of a difference, even with Morris Claiborne and Barry Church out for Dallas. The Erving ejection did matter though, as the Browns scored just once in his absence. Dallas was able to rack up 4 sacks. When Cody Kessler had time in the pocket, he did an OK job. Kessler went 19-of-27 for 203 yards and a touchdown. He nearly threw a pick on an overthrow. These stats were actually not a byproduct of garbage time; Kessler was just 5-of-7 for 36 yards following intermission. He didn't get much of a chance to do anything because the Cowboys were able to grind the game out and control the clock. Dallas won the time-of-possession battle by a whopping 19 minutes, and Cleveland ran just 14 offensive plays in the second half!    As for Coleman, he wasn't much of a factor, catching 3 balls for 41 yards. "
