Britt torched Jenkins on that 52-yard reception and also drew 2 pass-interference flags on the opening drive, and probably should have gotten a third later on.    Chris Johnson finally had a great fantasy performance; he ran for 131 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 19 carries. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
