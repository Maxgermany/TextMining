   "comment":"Boyle, but Chicago's defense held strong to force a field goal and maintain a 17-13 lead. Baltimore got the ball back when Ladarius Webb blindsided Trubisky to force a fumble that the Ravens recovered near midfield. The Ravens moved well into Chicago territory before Flacco threw to a well-covered receiver. Kyle Fuller tipped the pass away, and Adrian Amos caught the deflection, returning the ball 90 yards for a touchdown. That gave the Bears a 24-13 lead with only 5 minutes remaining. The Ravens produced a field-goal drive to make it 24-16. Just after the 2-minute warning, Baltimore's Michael Campanaro returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown, and Flacco found Boyle wide open in the flat for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 24 and force overtime. It was a terrible move by Bears punter "
