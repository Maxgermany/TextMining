   "comment":"Washington, making his 2013 debut, also had a pick in the red zone.    It was not a surprise in the slightest that the Panthers struggled to run the ball. DeAngelo Williams gained just 39 yards on 12 carries.    Before I move on to Arizona, it must be noted that Carolina destroyed itself with penalties. The team was whistled for 9 infractions, most of which came at crucial moments. Once again, the Panthers were expected to play better coming off a bye. The fact that they struggled like this is an indication that they're poorly coached.    Carson Palmer outplayed Newton, but only by default. Whereas Newton was guilty of 4 turnovers, Palmer gave the ball away just 3 times. He similarly threw a pick at the goal line, coincidentally on the drive following Newton's aforementioned first interception. Another pick happened because Palmer didn't see Luke Kuechly. Palmer saw a good amount of pressure in his face all afternoon - though not as much as Newton - which would explain his meager statistics: 19-of-28, 175 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions. Palmer struggled to get the ball to Larry Fitzgerald, who registered just 3 receptions for 43 yards.    The Cardinals need to get the ball more to Andre Ellington. The sixth-round rookie is seeing more touches go his way - he handled the ball 11 times - but he needs even more opportunities. Ellington, who is very quick, rushed for 52 yards on just 7 attempts and also caught 4 balls for 31 receiving yards. Rashard Mendenhall, meanwhile, plodded his way for 43 yards on 17 carries with no attempt longer than 7 yards. He did save his few remaining fantasy owners, however, with a touchdown.    Cleaning up other stuff: Karlos Dansby (2 sacks, 1 INT), Washington (2 sacks, 1 INT) and Calais Campbell (2 sacks, 1 forced fumble) all had huge games."
