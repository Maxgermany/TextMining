Jason Witten had 5 grabs for 51 yards. Dez Bryant only had 2 receptions for 52 yards - seriously, why is Williams getting more playing time than him? - but also had a punt return for a touchdown.    Witten suffered a concussion in this game, but was lucid enough to beg the coaching staff to let him back into the game. Wade Phillips has more class than Andy Reid, so he did not allow this to happen.    Like the Lions, the Cowboys had major issues moving the ball on the ground versus Chicago's defense. "

   "comment":"Williams fumble that ended the game (why is he still on the field?), 2 dropped passes from Miles Austin-Jones and a David Buehler missed 44-yard field goal. Dallas also had 4 more penalties than the Bears committed.    Romo's top receiver naturally was Austin-Jones, who had another big game with 10 catches for 142 yards. Jason Witten had 5 grabs for 51 yards. Dez Bryant only had 2 receptions for 52 yards - seriously, why is Williams getting more playing time than him? - but also had a punt return for a touchdown.    Witten suffered a concussion in this game, but was lucid enough to beg the coaching staff to let him back into the game. Wade Phillips has more class than Andy Reid, so he did not allow this to happen.    Like the Lions, the Cowboys had major issues moving the ball on the ground versus Chicago's defense. "

Bush didn't seem ready for live game action. On his first play, the football hit him right on the helmet on an attempted throw. Bush later dropped an easy pass on third down that would have set the Saints up on a first-and-goal. Afterward, Bush fumbled a punt return, setting up the Cowboys with a short field and a subsequent touchdown. Williams, meanwhile, dropped a pass, but was ultimately responsible for the loss. He took a long completion deep into New Orleans territory, but fumbled the ball away. The Saints scored the winning touchdown on the next possession. One has to wonder why Williams continues to see so many snaps.    "

He failed to chip Clay Matthews, which resulted in McCown tossing the ball right into the Pro Bowl linebacker's gut. McCown would be guilty of a worse interception later on an overthrow, but was otherwise pretty solid. He was accurate and even showed off surprising scrambling ability. He gained 38 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles to complement his quality passing numbers (19-28, 242 yards, TD, 2 INTs). All in all, McCown looked like the second coming of John Elway compared to the brutal Caleb Hanie. It makes you wonder why Lovie Smith didn't turn to him earlier.    McCown's leading receiver was Roy Williams, who had 8 grabs for 81 yards. Williams, however, didn't seem like he put forth much effort most of the time; on 1 occasion, a McCown pass skipped to Williams because he was too lethargic to come back to the ball. Why is he still in the league?    McCown had a chance for a backdoor cover at the end of the game, but the Bears opted to kick a field goal on a 4th-and-6 inside the red zone with a minute remaining, putting them 1 stinking point short of the spread.
