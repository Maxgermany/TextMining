Who would have thought that Chicago's aerial attack would look much more impressive than Detroit's? And that's an understatement; "

A big problem was the season-ending injury to right tackle Marc Colombo, though 1 of Romo's sack-turnovers was the result of his failure to read a corner blitz by the Packers.    Romo finished 24-of-39 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 pick and 2 fumbles. Romo was victimized by some drops, but he was pretty much ineffective for most of the game. A good amount of his yardage came in junk time.    Roy Williams actually caught 5 balls for 105 yards and a touchdown, though he had the aforementioned fumble. "

   "comment":"Roy Williams and Marion Barber had terrible dropped passes. Barber's was tipped into the air and intercepted by Jackson. On the next play, Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman was intercepted by Bears rookie safety Chris Conte. The Bears were at their own 1-yard line. On the next play, Chicago handed the ball off to Matt Forte and he was stuffed in the end zone by Ronde Barber for a safety. Williams made a big play in the second quarter. At the line of scrimmage, he shed a jam from cornerback E.J. Biggers and came open running down the field. Jay Cutler lofted the ball to Williams and he coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. Freeman had a hard time getting into a groove in the first half. The Tampa Bay offensive line struggled to give him time to throw the ball, and the Buccaneers receivers were taking too long to come open. In the third quarter, the Bears opened up a 21-5 lead with a short touchdown run from Barber. Freeman promptly threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Lance Briggs. It was returned to the 1-yard line, but a penalty for a block in the back put the ball at midfield. Later, Freeman was intercepted again, this time inside the Bears 20 by Brian Urlacher. Cutler gave the ball right back on an interception by Buccaneers safety Corey Lynch. Tampa Bay was able to move the ball and score on a short touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow. The 2.point conversion attempt was dropped by wide receiver Mike Williams. Freeman kept the comeback going with a 24-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe. The Bears answered with Cutler and Forte moving the ball down the field together. A 36-yard screen was called at the right time, and Forte got the ball into the Buccaneers' 5-yard line. Tampa Bay put together a goal-line stand that was about to force a field goal. An idiotic unsportsmanlike penalty on Aqib Talib gave the Bears a first down, but the Buccaneers' defense again stopped Chicago to force a field goal and a 24-18 lead. Freeman had 1 more chance to make a comeback and started to move the ball down the field. The Bears sealed the win with Freeman throwing his 4.h interception of the game to defensive back D.J. Moore. Freeman finished the game 29-of-51 for 264 yards with 2 touchdowns and 4 picks. The Buccaneers' offense was without running back LeGarrette Blount and Earnest Graham blew his knee out early in the game. Safety Tanard Jackson and middle linebacker Mason Foster also left the game early with injuries. The Bears got another excellent game out of Forte. He ran for 145 yards on 25 carries with a touchdown. Forte also caught 2 passes for 48 yards. Roy Williams led Chicago in receiving with 4 receptions for 59 yards and a score. Cutler was 17-of-32 for 226 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
