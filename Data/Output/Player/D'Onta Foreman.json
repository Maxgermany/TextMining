   "comment":"D'Onta Foreman for a 31-yard reception. Watson was brilliant considering the circumstances, and this game made it clear that he has the potential to be a star in the NFL. He still needs to work on his ball placement, but he could conceivably lead the Texans into the playoffs this year. If there's a rematch against the Patriots in January, I'll be looking for to it.    Only 4 Texans caught multiple passes, and the leading receiver was Foreman for a 31-yard reception.

It turned out to be a torn Achilles, so Foreman is out for the rest of the season, unfortunately. There's a chance Foreman won't be ready for training camp.    As for the Cardinals, Blaine Gabbert did some nice things, especially in the opening half. He was 11-of-14 for 120 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission. To be fair, Gabbert was set up on a couple of short fields because of Savage's turnovers. Gabbert didn't have as much success following the break; he was 11-of-20 for 137 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks in the second half. Gabbert's final numbers were 22-of-34 for 257 yards, 3 scores and a pair of interceptions.    "
