   "comment":"Aldrick Robinson on a deep pass when the Redskins busted in coverage. It was a good find by the rookie, and his quick decision-making was on display. With more time on the field. Beathard should get better. Overall, he went 19-of-36 for 245 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 pick in his debut. The interception came on the final play of the contest, so it doesn't even really count. It was certainly a promising performance, and he nearly led the team to a comeback on the final drive. He will be the starter moving forward, given the struggles that Hoyer has had so far.    The top targets for the 49ers on Sunday were Pierre Garcon (5-55) and George Kittle (4-46). Garcon saw a team-high 12 targets, but was covered well by Bashaud Breeland for most of the day. Garcon had a lot of production on the final drive, which helped him boost his stats. If Beathard continues to improve, Garcon will become more relevant in fantasy. For now, he is a WR3 in good matchups. Meanwhile, Kittle looked good running routes for the team, but he had a couple of bad drops. The rookie should look to improve that, but he is still a TE2 and a solid streaming option most weeks. Elsewhere, Aldrick Robinson (2-66) led the team in receiving yards and caught the touchdown. Most of his production came on the 1 play, so he can be ignored in fantasy formats.    When Beathard entered the contest, the 49ers' run game picked up a bit.
