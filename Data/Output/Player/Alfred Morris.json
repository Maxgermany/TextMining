   "comment":"Morris twice, which resulted in a loss of 3 yards. Two possessions later, the Redskins ran a trick play on 3rd-and-4 where Josh Morgan attempted a pass downfield to Griffin, who strangely was whistled for offensive pass interference. Why Washington didn't run a basic play with its stud quarterback is beyond me, but the result was zero points on 2 of the first 3 drives. The Steelers, meanwhile, scored on nearly all of their chances to establish a 20-6 halftime lead.    I mentioned Griffin's poor numbers; the Steelers took away his scrambling ability and forced him to throw exclusively. He was plagued by 10 drops - that's T-E-N drops - affecting his completion percentage. In fact, Leonard Hankerson and Dezmon Briscoe each had the ball sail through their hands in the end zone. Santana Moss had a couple of drops as well. Griffin was also pressured frequently, though his elusiveness limited Pittsburgh's defense to just 1 sack.    Griffin's lone touchdown went to Moss (4-21), who was 1 of only 3 Washington players to catch more than 1 pass. The others were Morgan (5-46) and Logan Paulsen (4-43). Chris Cooley was targeted only once and failed to snag the ball.    Pittsburgh's early advantage forced the Redskins to abandon the ground attack, which was big because Alfred Morris was able to find plenty of running room with his limited opportunities. Morris rushed for 59 yards on 13 attempts.    Meanwhile, the Steelers, as mentioned, couldn't be stopped. Ben Roethlisberger was a machine, particularly on third down, converting nearly all of his attempts in the first half. He also led the team into the end zone on fourth-and-inches at the goal line of the opening drive. Big Ben went 24-of-33 for 222 yards and 3 touchdowns. That completion percentage is especially impressive considering that he endured at least 3 drops, including 1 by "

   "comment":"Morris (17-93) was running well in the first half including a run of 27 yards to get Washington out of being backed up. Griffin had a big third-down conversion on a pass to Roy Helu (5-11 rushing, 1-14 receiving). Santana Moss dropped a touchdown on a third down, but on the field goal set-up, Denver had 12 men on the field. That gave the Redskins a first down at the 7-yard line. The next play Griffin threw a bullet to Leonard Hankerson (1-7) for 6. Early in the third quarter, Ryan Kerrigan came around the edge to hit Manning's arm and force a fumble. Brian Orakpo recovered the fumble at the Denver 19-yard line. Morris ran the ball in on a few plays to give Washington a touchdown lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Manning get pick-sixed by Hall. "

Morris tallied 85 yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 carries, while Helu gained 25 yards on 8 attempts before leaving the game with a knee injury.    As for the Jaguars, the front office should strongly consider firing Gus Bradley. It's mind-boggling how unprepared Jacksonville was for this contest. Bradley also made dumb mistakes like calling a timeout prior to halftime when Washington still had the ball near midfield. Bradley's timeout allowed the Redskins to attempt a Hail Mary when the clock would've expired instead. Nothing happened, but Bradley could've cost his team big time. Bradley's worst offense is not going with Blake Bortles. Continuing to start "

The Redskins started to respond as they had a drive going well until Smith caused a fumble on a nice gain by Roy Helu and Tampa Bay recovered. With a minute remaining before halftime, the Redskins finally finished a drive. Some dump-offs to Alfred Morris moved the ball into Tampa Bay territory. The Bucs sent a blitz, but the Redskins had the perfect play called with a screen to Helu (6-57) that resulted in a 30-yard touchdown. The Bucs took a 13-7 lead into the half. In the third quarter, "

   "comment":"Morris' helmet off his head (seriously). Washington was stuck on just 10 points beginning in the second quarter though, thanks to a missed field goal and some mistakes of its own, which I'll get to later. Miami made its own blunders on offense. Ryan Tannehill was just awful early; he missed Dion Sims on a late throw, forcing the tight end to dive to the turf. Sims sustained a concussion on the play as a result. Tannehill then tossed a checkdown on a third-and-4 in the red zone that would've been pointless had Miami not attempted a fourth-down try. Unfortunately for the Dolphins, they gave the ball to Damien Williams on a slow-developing play, which allowed Ryan Kerrigan to blow it up. Tannehill took bad sacks and missed receivers throughout the afternoon. One of the sacks resulted in a fumble that pinballed around and went backward about 30 yards. Tannehill also had a wide-open Kenny Stills at 1 point, but fired the ball out of bounds. He then was guilty of a crucial delay-of-game penalty on what was a promising drive. It was just painful to watch. Fortunately for the Dolphins, Jarvis Landry bailed the team out with a punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter, allowing them to escape with a win that they didn't exactly deserve.    Tannehill finished 22-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he made numerous mistakes that even prompted picking podcast co-host Matvei to text me, I hope for Miami's sake that Tannehill signed his contract extension in pencil. He was a bit better in the second half, but he still had a very disappointing showing.    The hero of the game, Landry caught 8 out of 12 targets thrown to him for 53 yards to go along with that return touchdown. He finished only behind Jordan Cameron on the receiving chart; Cameron logged 4 receptions for 73 yards, and he also happened to draw pass interference in the red zone. Cameron made 1 of the top catches of the week, diving for a 27-yarder. He looks like he'll be a low-end TE1.    Lamar Miller didn't run as well as anticipated. He managed 53 yards on 13 carries, but a big chunk of that came on an 17-yarder. Miller was stuffed on a third-and-1 on Miami's opening drive, perhaps influencing the Dolphins to try Williams on that aforementioned short-yardage failure. Don't get too discouraged, though. Though the Redskins can't stop the pass, they had 1 of the tougher run defenses in the NFL last year.    As for the Redskins' offense, Kirk Cousins looked good at times in the first half, but he melted down following intermission. That said, he wasn't flawless early, as he made a couple crucial mistakes. He took a sack deep in Miami territory on the opening possession and then tossed a pick on a late throw that was telegraphed. Cousins later had a second interception, which was an amazing play by Brice McCain, who made a 1-armed grab and somehow pinned it to the side of his body. Cousins' final attempt was an inaccurate heave under pressure that fell way incomplete. Cousins completed 21-of-31 passes, but managed just 196 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. That resulted in a pedestrian YPA of 6.32. It's clear that Cousins isn't the long-term answer, but at least he studies film, unlike Robert Griffin.    To be somewhat fair to Cousins, he didn't have DeSean Jackson for most of the afternoon. Jackson grabbed his hamstring after stretching for an overthrow deep downfield and checked out of the game permanently. Jackson, who logged no receptions, is very injury-prone, so it's not surprising to see him get hurt. The Redskins won't be able to count on him being on the field very much.    With Jackson out, Pierre Garcon took advantage, accumulating 6 catches for 74 yards, and he'll continue to produce similarly under Jackson returns. The star for them, however, was Jordan Reed, who snatched 7 balls for 63 yards and a touchdown. Safety Rashad Jones fell down on the score, allowing Reed to come up with the pass in the end zone. Reed was 1 of my top fantasy sleepers this season, so I support him as an every-week starter.    Morris, who recovered from yet another ridiculous Suh stomp, eclipsed the 100-yard barrier, gaining 121 yards on 25 carries. "

Morris, meanwhile, managed just 59 yards on his 18 attempts, and most of that (35 yards) came on 1 play. If you're a Morris owner, you need to begin looking for other starting options because you may not be able to use him much longer. Jones is the better talent, and the current regime has no ties to Morris.    "

   "comment":"Morris had been trampling over their first 2 opponents. It looked like they'd have success doing that early on, as they opened up with 2 nice rushes, but then left guard Shawn Lauvao was carted into the locker room. Lauvao may not be a big name, but he and Trent Williams are the team's best run blockers by a wide margin. Washington tends to pound the ball left most of the time, so not having Lauvao on the field really hurt. Jones led the team with 38 rushing yards on 11 carries. He struggled to run without Lauvao, but he broke free in the fourth quarter for a touchdown - except that he fumbled the ball prior to reaching the end zone. That really hurt his fantasy owners, but it's nothing compared to what those who started Alfred Morris went through. Morris was barely a part of the game plan, getting just 6 carries for 19 yards. I wrote last week that Morris owners need to look for new options to start, and that was obvious tonight. Jones is the more-talented player, so Morris is being faded out of the offense. If you can trade Morris for anything, do it now.    "

   "comment":"Morris touchdown run. The Redskins could not strike back at the end of the game, as a Hail Mary sailed out of the end zone to finish the game.    For the Redskins, this game continued to raise questions about the ability of Kirk Cousins. Cousins' numbers do not look too bad. He went 28-of-46 on the day for 364 yards and a touchdown. However, he was guilty of many errors. Aside from the aforementioned interception he threw, Cousins was off on many passes. On 2 different occasions, he completely missed wide-open receivers for what would have been easy touchdowns. Both "

   "comment":"Morris (17-56) late in this contest because it was such a blowout. Elliott tallied 92 yards and also scored twice.    Before moving on to Cleveland's offense, it's worth noting that the Cowboys lost guard Ronald Leary late in the game to a concussion.    Cleveland welcomed back both Cody Kessler and Corey Coleman, but it didn't make much of a difference, even with Morris Claiborne and Barry Church out for Dallas. The Erving ejection did matter though, as the Browns scored just once in his absence. Dallas was able to rack up 4 sacks. When Cody Kessler had time in the pocket, he did an OK job. Kessler went 19-of-27 for 203 yards and a touchdown. He nearly threw a pick on an overthrow. These stats were actually not a byproduct of garbage time; Kessler was just 5-of-7 for 36 yards following intermission. He didn't get much of a chance to do anything because the Cowboys were able to grind the game out and control the clock. Dallas won the time-of-possession battle by a whopping 19 minutes, and Cleveland ran just 14 offensive plays in the second half!    As for Coleman, he wasn't much of a factor, catching 3 balls for 41 yards. "

Dez Bryant left this game with an ankle injury, but said afterward that he was just sore and bruised. We'll see where he is next week against Atlanta, but for now, it looks like he could be ready.    Terrance Williams did more than just bring in that 51-yard pass to set up Prescott's rushing touchdown; he ended up catching all 9 of his targets for 141 yards, the most in his career and the most since Week 1, when he gained 68 yards. Unfortunately, he did hurt his knee late in the game, but there isn't much info just yet.    Kansas City will get a bye next week and then face the crumbling Giants on the road, while Dallas takes on Atlanta on the road, in what will be an important NFC matchup for both teams.   "

   "comment":"Morris seemingly gained 8 or 9 yards on every first-down try, giving Dak Prescott plenty of short-yardage opportunities. This was crucial for Dallas at the beginning of the second half. Prescott injured his thumb in the second quarter and even had X-rays taken. Prescott didn't miss a snap, but it wasn't clear if he was healthy. Some of his initial throws were off the mark, but he looked like his normal self by the final frame. When Prescott found Dez Bryant in the end zone, it was clear that he was just fine. This put the Cowboys up 24-7, and the game was over.    Prescott finished 11-of-22 for 102 yards and 2 touchdowns. The fantasy performance overall wasn't bad because of the 2 scores, but the completion percentage was a byproduct of the thumb injury and some jitters early in the evening. Prescott missed some early plays, but the Redskins failed to capitaize for reasons I'll discuss later.    Prescott's touchdowns went to Dez Bryant (5-61) and Jason Witten (1-8). Bryant became the franchise's all-time touchdown leader with the score. He spent some time yelling at no 1 in particular after getting the touchdown. Bryant also drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Bashaud Breeland simply couldn't cover Bryant, and the question needs to be asked why the hell the Redskins didn't use Josh Norman to shadow Dallas' only viable receiver.    Morris, as mentioned, couldn't be stopped in the second half. It was tough sledding in the early going, as he gained just 38 yards on 12 carries, but his final stat line illustrated how much he dominated after intermission. Morris finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 27 attempts. Dallas' offensive line simply dominated as the game progressed, and the exhausted Redskins had no answers for Morris.    Washington's problems stopping the run was just 1 of many reasons the team suffered its season-ending loss. The team made what seemed like countless errors throughout the opening half to put itself in a 17-0 hole that it couldn't crawl out of. There were 4 crucial mistakes that crushed the Redskins. The first was an interception by Kirk Cousins that was on Jamison Crowder; the receiver had the ball bounce off his hands and into safety "
