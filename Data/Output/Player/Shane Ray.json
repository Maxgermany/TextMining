   "comment":"Ray, playing for DeMarcus Ware, was carted into the locker room during the opening half.    Going now to McCown, he went 20-of-39 for 213 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. One of the picks was also taken back for 6. as McCown stared down his receiver, telegraphing the pass. "

   "comment":"Ray picked up the ball and ran in for 6. It was actually a dumb play on Ray's part, as falling on the ball would've completely ended the game - the Colts were out of timeouts - but I can't completely blame Ray because it was the heat of the moment, and a defensive score will help his case when he's pining for a big contract when he hits free agency. While Denver's defense nearly matched its offense's production, that doesn't mean that Siemian played poorly either. Siemian had a solid showing, going 22-of-33 for 266 yards. However, he did throw a careless interception that should've been returned for 6. but cornerback "
