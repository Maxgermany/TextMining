That was Kendall Wright, who converted 4 of 7 targets thrown to him. Walker was next (3-37) even though he missed a complete half of action.    As mentioned, Sankey was way more effective than Greene. He tallied 58 yards on 17 carries, and he also caught 3 balls for 19 receiving yards. Greene (3-5) was not seen following his fumble.   "

Wright exploded down the field with the ball for a 52-yard touchdown. Winston's first throw as a pro, on the other hand, was a disaster and the complete opposite. He threw a floater to the flat that was undercut by Coty Sensabaugh and returned for a 26-yard touchdown. Mariota drove down the field again on his next possession and capped it with a rollout pass to Sankey that he ran in for a 12-yard touchdown. Winston answered with a drive where he used tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins. They hooked up for a 21-yard reception that was a dropped interception tipped to Seferian-Jenkins. Winston then took advantage with a 5.yard scoring pass to his tight end. The Titans kept moving on the anemic Tampa Bay defense, with Sankey ripping off a nice run and a 22-yard pass to Wright (4-101) where the speedy wideout had a great run after the catch. On third-and goal, Mariota threw a dart to Harry Douglas (2-24), who beat Alterraun Verner for a score. Winston set up Tennessee for more when he had a screen pass picked off by rookie outside linebacker Deiontrez Mount. A nifty play by Mariota resulted in an 18-yard pass to Anthony Fasano (1-18) to the 2-yard line, and Mariota hit Walker (3-43) on third-and-goal for his 4.h touchdown pass of the first half. Tennessee added to its lead in the third quarter with a Sankey touchdown plunge. In garbage time, Winston hit Seferian-Jenkins in the middle of the field, and the big tight end broke 2 tackles to score from 41-yards out.    Mariota's game ended after 3 quarters, and Zach Mettenberger took over to start the 4.h. Mariota finished completing 13-of-16 passes for 209 yards with 4 scores. Sankey was vastly improved over his rookie year. He had 12 carries for 74 yards with a score and 2 receptions for 12 yards and a touchdown. Wright and Walker were excellent and looked as if they had played with Mariota for years. Both Sankey and Wright can probably be started most weeks, while Walker suffered a hand injury and could be out next week.    Winston was 16-of-33 for 210 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Doug Martin (11-52) and Vincent Jackson (4-51) were kept from making any big plays. Martin looked good, however, so you can buy-low from a clueless fantasy owner who didn't watch the game.    Defensively, the Titans got an excellent game from Derrick Morgan (5 tackles, 2 sacks) and Jurrell Casey (3 tackles, 1 sack). Bucs defensive tackle Gerald McCoy (3 tackles, 1 sack) was the only defender who really stood out positively for Tampa Bay. Cornerback Alterraun Verner really struggled against his former team.    The Titans suffered a painful loss with Delanie Walker looking like he broke his right hand on a third-quarter reception with Tennessee up by a huge margin. That injury could be a huge loss to the Titan offense if he misses significant time.   Walker for 22 yards.

The ball popped into the air, and Dwight Lowery snatched it and returned it for 6. Mariota's second interception was more legitimate, as he fired a pass into tight coverage, but it was 1 of the few blemishes on his otherwise brilliant afternoon. It needs to be noted that Mariota sliced and diced a poor defense that didn't seem to understand how to defend Kendall Wright slant passes. However, the fact that Mariota is able to routinely put together strong performances like this makes him a viable weekly fantasy option.    Speaking of Wright, he logged 7 receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He was my top fantasy sleeper heading into this season, so I don't think these types of showings are fluky. Wright, who was catching slant passes all afternoon, will continue to be a borderline WR2-WR3.    Only 2 Titans saw more than 3 targets. Wright was 1. and Walker happened to be the other. Walker was responsible for Mariota's pick-six, but he played well otherwise, hauling in 7 balls for 68 yards. "

   "comment":"Delanie Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to Chris Hogan, who beat Coty Sensabaugh to get inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal, Taylor went back to Hogan on a sprint out for a touchdown and a 14-13 lead. The Bills' defense came up with 2 stops to clinch the victory. On the second 1. Mariota was pressured by Marcell Dareus into throwing a deep ball up for grabs that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore to end the game for Buffalo.    Taylor completed 10-of-17 passes for 109 yards with a touchdown. He ran for 76 yards and 8 carries and a score. He'll continue to be a solid starting option in fantasy because of his rushing ability.    The Bills' offense was without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins. Their top running back was Dan Herron (9-28), while Chris Hogan (3-52) led them through the air.    Marcus Mariota was 21-of-32 for 187 yards with an interception. He ran for 47 yards on 5 carries. He didn't play poorly, and the Bills' defense did a good job of bending but not breaking.    The Titans' ground game was shutdown by Buffalo as Dexter McCluster (8-20) and Bishop Sankey (7-20 rushing, 3-23 receiving) were unable to get in any groove.    Antonio Andrews led the Titans through the air (3-45). Mariota spread the ball around to Kendall Wright (3-29), Justin Hunter (3-38), Delanie Walker (4-36) and Harry Douglas (2-17), but all were limited by the Bills. Walker and Wright suffered injuries late in the game that are worth monitoring.    Titans defensive lineman Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line.

In fact, no Titan receiver caught a pass in the second half until the final drive. It's safe to say that Kendall Wright was missed.    A quick word on Phil Simms: He was awful once again. He did that we talked about this thing repeatedly, but I thought he was at his worst when Jim Nantz pointed out the pool and the golf course at the stadium. The exchange went something like this: <b> Jim Nantz: </b> You never thought you'd see a pool or a lifeguard at a stadium, did you? <b> Phil Simms: </b> Yeah, we talked about it, Jim. They're trying to get fans to the stadium. But there's only 1 real way to do that... ... ... ... <i> Me (thinking during his 10-second pause): Please don't say the generic win football games. Please don't do it. If you have any respect for yourself, please don't say it. </i> ... ... ... <b> Phil Simms: </b> You gotta win football games, Jim! <i> Me (Thinking): F*** you, Phil Simms!

Speaking of disappointing numbers, Murray couldn't muster much on the ground, as Tennessee's offensive line didn't block as well as usual. Murray mustered only 70 yards on 21 carries, though he helped his fantasy owners with the receiving touchdown.    Moving on to the Colts, Luck had that clutch conversion at the end of regulation, but struggled for most of the second half. He was brilliant early, going 12-of-16 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission, but his second-half numbers were just 3-of-12 for 76 yards and an interception on an underthrown pass, thanks to some very shaky pass protection. The Colts were holding on for dear life, as Tennessee's defense finally woke up, but it was too late for the Titans.    Luck's touchdowns went to the usual suspects: Hilton (5-97) and "

Ramsey would eventually get his turnover when he snatched a Cassel pick-six.    The Titans couldn't move the chains because the tough Jacksonville run defense prevented DeMarco Murray (14-42) and Derrick Henry (4-13) from doing anything. Mariota didn't scramble much either, running just twice for 3 yards.    Thanks to the struggles of Mariota and Cassel, no Titans player had more than 50 receiving yards. Harry Douglas (5-48) and Tajae Sharpe (3-48) led the way, while Matthews (3-31) and Walker (3-23) caught touchdowns.    Moving on to the victors, teams typically rally around a new coach, and that's exactly what the Jaguars did with Doug Marrone replacing the utterly incompetent Gus Bradley. The Jaguars played with a tremendous amount of effort, while the Titans, fresh off emotional, difficult victories versus the Broncos and Chiefs, appeared to be sleepwalking, taking this game for granted. As a result, Jacksonville had its best performance of the season, finally displaying the potential the Jaguar truthers have been clamoring about all of these years.    "

   "comment":"Delanie Walker lost a fumble in his own territory, setting up a Cleveland field goal. Marcus Mariota missed Walker for a touchdown. The Titans then passed up a crucial field goal, opting to go for it on a 4.h down at the goal line. Derrick Henry was stuffed in the backfield, as Danny Shelton blew up pedestrian center Ben Jones. A bit later, Tennessee actually tried a kick, but Ryan Succop missed. That made it a very curious decision for the Titans to settle for a 47-yard Succop field goal in overtime, rather than getting closer for their kicker. Succop actually missed, but the whistle blew the play dead because it was the 2-minute warning. Proving that icing the kicker is a waste, Succop hit the decisive field goal following the return from commercial break.    Mariota, still not 100 percent, went 21-of-34 for 203 yards. He moved the chains on a third down with an 8-yard scramble, but that was the only run we saw from him all afternoon. He'll need to get healthy soon if the Titans want to beat real opponents (i.e. not the Colts or Browns.) Fortunately for the Titans, they have a bye next week, so perhaps Mariota will be 100 percent by Week 9.    Because overtime could've been avoided - I'm still unsure why the Titans passed on the field goal - Mike Mularkey is at least partly responsible for Delanie Walker's injury. Walker, who led the Titans with 7 catches for 63 yards, hurt his ankle in the extra session. Walker heavily out-produced Walker lost a fumble in his own territory, setting up a Cleveland field goal. Marcus Mariota missed Walker for a touchdown. The Titans then passed up a crucial field goal, opting to go for it on a 4.h down at the goal line. "

Following a 17-yard DeMarco Murray reception, Mariota escaped some pressure to find a wide-open Eric Decker in the end zone. Mariota finished 19-of-28 for 218 yards, 2 touchdowns and a careless interception in the 4.h quarter. He threw well for the most part, but still didn't show that he has recovered from his hamstring. He scrambled just 2 times for 7 yards.    Speaking of formerly injured Titans, Walker and rookie receiver Corey Davis made their return to the field."
