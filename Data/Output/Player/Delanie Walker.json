   "comment":"Walker, meanwhile, fumbled in the red zone when the score was just 7-3. The Eagles took over and went 94 yards for a touchdown, giving them a sizable lead that they would never relinquish.    Though he tossed 2 interceptions, Donovan McNabb otherwise played pretty well, going 21-of-36 for 306 yards and a touchdown. He hit 3 plays of 39 yards or more. Two of McNabb's big gainers (39, 59) went to DeSean Jackson, who finished with 6 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown. The other was to Brent Celek (43), who notched 4 catches for 73 yards.    Leonard Weaver led the team with 17 carries for 52 yards. LeSean McCoy rushed the ball just 9 times, but gained 48 yards and a score.    Frank Gore, meanwhile, led all backs in rushing with 107 yards on just 16 attempts. It's a shame the 49ers fell behind early; otherwise, Gore would have had more opportunities.    Strangely, neither Vernon Davis (3-43) nor Michael Crabtree (4-26) led the 49ers in receiving. Josh Morgan did that, snagging 7 balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Davis received a verbal lashing from Mike Singletary for not making an attempt to break up Alex Smith's first interception.    I thought this could be a potential stink bomb game from Andy Reid. The Eagles won, but Big Red still made a huge error. On 4th-and-inches in the first quarter, Reid decided to go for it on his own 29! Philadelphia wasn't able to convert, giving the 49ers a short field. Fortunately for them, Walker had that aforementioned fumble.    Another humorous event in this contest: The Eagles moved deep into 49ers territory at the end of the first half. Time was running out, so they needed to clock it for 1 last attempt to get the ball into the end zone. However, they weren't able to do so because Weaver started jawing with a 49er defender. The time kept ticking down, but Weaver was killing the Eagles because he wasn't paying attention. "

At this point, I fully expected Stafford to find a groove with 1:51 to play and San Francisco playing soft. Instead, he followed a short 5-yard pass to Pettigrew with incompletions intended for Young, Pettigrew and Burleson to turn the ball over on downs. Notice none of those went to Johnson, who was doubled up. Does that really matter though given his physical ability? San Francisco ran Gore 3 times for 6 yards forcing Detroit to run through their timeouts. Another Akers field goal made it 25-19. Still, Stafford would pull something out right? Wrong, he was sacked by "

The officials could've called offensive pass interference, but kept all yellow flags in their pockets.    It's remarkable San Diego lost this contest considering that Philip Rivers misfired on just 4 attempts. He went 20-of-24 for 184 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had a second score nullified by offensive pass interference. Rivers couldn't really look downfield in the second half because 2 of his starting linemen - "

Mettenberger finished 16-of-27 for 179 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception in desperation time. He also took a bad sack at the goal line that should have been ruled a safety. Mettenberger needs to stop holding on to the ball too long in the pocket. He took 5 sacks as a consequence. Mettenberger's leading receiver had just 53 yards. That was Kendall Wright, who converted 4 of 7 targets thrown to him. Walker was next (3-37) even though he missed a complete half of action.    As mentioned, Sankey was way more effective than Greene. He tallied 58 yards on 17 carries, and he also caught 3 balls for 19 receiving yards. Greene (3-5) was not seen following his fumble.   "

   "comment":"Walker fantasy owners witnessed Leon Washington vulture an early touchdown. And those tuning into this game for casual purposes had to endure a dreadful matchup. Everything changed, however, right before halftime. With the Titans up 10-0 and outgaining Jacksonville by a wide margin (179-16), the Jaguars were able to put together a solid drive, thanks to some tough running by Toby Gerhart. They eventually found their way into the end zone and were able to accomplish the same thing in the third quarter. They established a 4.point lead and never looked back.    Bortles had a very mixed game. He was dreadful in the early going, as he was just 9-of-15 for only 52 yards and a touchdown in the first half. He checked it down on an early third-and-7 without even bothering to look downfield. He was then strip-sacked, but was fortunate to have his teammate recover. He also missed some routine throws, but was able to get into a rhythm. Bortles finished 13-of-26 for 115 yards and a touchdown. He still had some poor throws following intermission, including an awful misfire toward Cecil Shorts in the red zone, but he picked up some big gains on the ground, including a first-down scamper on third-and-long. Bortles compiled 50 rushing yards on 5 scrambles.    Gerhart missed some time in this game with a rib contusion, which is why he had just 12 carries. He ran well after getting stuffed early, finishing with 53 yards and a touchdown. He was outgained by Jordan Todman (5-71, TD), though almost all of that came on a 62-yard burst in the 4.h quarter that sealed this victory by Jacksonville.    Only 1 Jaguar had more than 26 receiving yards. Marqise Lee (4-65) was that player. Marcedes Lewis hauled in Bortles' sole touchdown, though he had just 2 catches for 6 yards.    The player who gained the most in this victory was Sen'Derrick Marks. The star Jacksonville defensive tackle needed half a sack to trigger a $600,000 bonus. He managed to sack Charlie Whitehurst on the final play of the game. Not only did he claim more than half-a-million bucks against his former team; he stopped a Tennessee drive right in its tracks to give Jacksnville its third victory of the season.    As for the Titans, I'm surprised by how well Whitehurst played. It appeared as though he was going to ruin Tennessee's chances of landing either Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston, as he opened the game with a 6-of-6, 71-yard, touchdown-drive. Whitehurst continued to shred Jacksonville's secondary throughout the evening, finishing 24-of-35 for 287 yards and the score to Washington, but he couldn't get his team into the end zone again. Simple mistakes disrupted drives all evening, though Whitehurst was responsible for throwing short on a crucial 4.h down in the middle of the final quarter. His receiver had to come back from the ball and was consequently tackled short of the marker.    Washington who was playing in his home town, was second on the team in receiving, as he caught all 7 of his targets for 62 yards and the touchdown. Kendall Wright (4-73) paced the team in receiving yardage, but got banged up on a 39-yard reception in the 4.h quarter. Walker (4-54) disappointed his fantasy owners.    "

   "comment":"Walker for 22 yards. On the very next play, Mariota made a great play fake to Bishop Sankey and then fired a dart to Kendall Wright on the run. Wright exploded down the field with the ball for a 52-yard touchdown. Winston's first throw as a pro, on the other hand, was a disaster and the complete opposite. He threw a floater to the flat that was undercut by Coty Sensabaugh and returned for a 26-yard touchdown. Mariota drove down the field again on his next possession and capped it with a rollout pass to Sankey that he ran in for a 12-yard touchdown. Winston answered with a drive where he used tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins. They hooked up for a 21-yard reception that was a dropped interception tipped to Seferian-Jenkins. Winston then took advantage with a 5.yard scoring pass to his tight end. The Titans kept moving on the anemic Tampa Bay defense, with Sankey ripping off a nice run and a 22-yard pass to Wright (4-101) where the speedy wideout had a great run after the catch. On third-and goal, Mariota threw a dart to Harry Douglas (2-24), who beat Alterraun Verner for a score. Winston set up Tennessee for more when he had a screen pass picked off by rookie outside linebacker Deiontrez Mount. A nifty play by Mariota resulted in an 18-yard pass to Anthony Fasano (1-18) to the 2-yard line, and Mariota hit Walker (3-43) on third-and-goal for his 4.h touchdown pass of the first half. Tennessee added to its lead in the third quarter with a Sankey touchdown plunge. In garbage time, Winston hit Seferian-Jenkins in the middle of the field, and the big tight end broke 2 tackles to score from 41-yards out.    Mariota's game ended after 3 quarters, and "

   "comment":"Walker had the ball in his hand for a second, but a big Josh Thomas hit dislodged it. The ball popped into the air, and Dwight Lowery snatched it and returned it for 6. Mariota's second interception was more legitimate, as he fired a pass into tight coverage, but it was 1 of the few blemishes on his otherwise brilliant afternoon. It needs to be noted that Mariota sliced and diced a poor defense that didn't seem to understand how to defend Kendall Wright slant passes. However, the fact that Mariota is able to routinely put together strong performances like this makes him a viable weekly fantasy option.    Speaking of Wright, he logged 7 receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He was my top fantasy sleeper heading into this season, so I don't think these types of showings are fluky. Wright, who was catching slant passes all afternoon, will continue to be a borderline WR2-WR3.    Only 2 Titans saw more than 3 targets. Wright was 1. and Walker happened to be the other. Walker was responsible for Mariota's pick-six, but he played well otherwise, hauling in 7 balls for 68 yards. "

   "comment":"Walker to get the Titans at the 1?yard line. Antonio Andrews plunged into the end zone to give Tennessee a 10-0 lead. The Bills' offense was putrid for the majority of 3 quarters as the Titans' defense suffocated Buffalo. The Bills finally did something when Tyrod Taylor ad libbed and took off on a run of 26 yards to get into Tennessee territory for the first time. A few plays later, Taylor took a quarterback draw into the end zone from 22 yards out. Mariota answered with clutch conversion to Hunter and then took off on a 23-yard run on a zone read. That led to the Titans to expand their lead to 13-7 midway through 4.h quarter. Taylor continued to hurt the Titans with his legs, taking off on a 25-yard run to convert a third-and-23. Then, Taylor laid out a beautiful deep ball for a 46-yard gain to Chris Hogan, who beat Coty Sensabaugh to get inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-goal, Taylor went back to Hogan on a sprint out for a touchdown and a 14-13 lead. The Bills' defense came up with 2 stops to clinch the victory. On the second 1. Mariota was pressured by Marcell Dareus into throwing a deep ball up for grabs that was picked off by Stephon Gilmore to end the game for Buffalo.    Taylor completed 10-of-17 passes for 109 yards with a touchdown. He ran for 76 yards and 8 carries and a score. He'll continue to be a solid starting option in fantasy because of his rushing ability.    The Bills' offense was without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins. Their top running back was Dan Herron (9-28), while Chris Hogan (3-52) led them through the air.    Marcus Mariota was 21-of-32 for 187 yards with an interception. He ran for 47 yards on 5 carries. He didn't play poorly, and the Bills' defense did a good job of bending but not breaking.    The Titans' ground game was shutdown by Buffalo as Dexter McCluster (8-20) and Bishop Sankey (7-20 rushing, 3-23 receiving) were unable to get in any groove.    Antonio Andrews led the Titans through the air (3-45). Mariota spread the ball around to Kendall Wright (3-29), Justin Hunter (3-38), Delanie Walker (4-36) and Harry Douglas (2-17), but all were limited by the Bills. Walker and Wright suffered injuries late in the game that are worth monitoring.    Titans defensive lineman "

   "comment":"Walker downfield. I also think he should have ran more. His best trait are his legs. He's holding himself back by not utilizing them enough.    I thought Tennessee's offensive game plan sucked. The team ran the ball way too much on first down, resulting in predictable play-calling. Tennessee didn't get anything on the ground from its backs, save for 2 long carries, so Mariota was constantly in second-and-long situations, which was a tough task behind a weak offensive line. Antonio Andrews gained 78 yards on 15 carries, but most of that came on a 26-yard burst.    Walker had a big game. He had more than double the receiving yardage compared to any other Titan, catching 8 balls for 109 yards. Green-Beckham (3-40) was next. In fact, no Titan receiver caught a pass in the second half until the final drive. It's safe to say that Kendall Wright was missed.    A quick word on Phil Simms: He was awful once again. He did that we talked about this thing repeatedly, but I thought he was at his worst when Jim Nantz pointed out the pool and the golf course at the stadium. The exchange went something like this: <b> Jim Nantz: </b> You never thought you'd see a pool or a lifeguard at a stadium, did you? <b> Phil Simms: </b> Yeah, we talked about it, Jim. They're trying to get fans to the stadium. But there's only 1 real way to do that... ... ... ... <i> Me (thinking during his 10-second pause): Please don't say the generic win football games. Please don't do it. If you have any respect for yourself, please don't say it. </i> ... ... ... <b> Phil Simms: </b> You gotta win football games, Jim! <i> Me (Thinking): F*** you, Phil Simms! F*** you! </i> <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Walker or another receiver open down the field. It was a solid game overall for the second-year pro, and it looks like Mariota may have put his early-season struggles behind him.    Though the Titans were efficient in the passing game, their performance in terms of their ground attack was absolutely phenomenal. They totaled a whopping 225 yards on the day, while the Dolphins only recorded 51 yards. Mariota's impact was already mentioned, but the team's top 2 running backs really had a big impact. DeMarco Murray is continuing to have the best season of his career, and he got another 27 carries during Sunday's game. On those carries, he totaled 121 yards and really led the offense for the team. He ripped off numerous 8-to-9-yard chunks plays, and that allowed the team to move the ball efficiently. When Murray was not carrying the ball, rookie Derrick Henry toted the rock. He received 7 carries during the contest and turned them into 54 yards. He had 1 particularly nice burst where he scampered for 22 yards and moved the Titans toward the red zone. Henry is not a real factor in fantasy yet, but if he get more carries, he could become a high-upside flex play.    The Titans were happy to get Delanie Walker healthy. Walker led the team in targets, catches and yards, finishing the day with 5 catches for 66 yards and a touchdown. On the score, Walker caught a bullet pass from Mariota over the middle of the field. Walker dragged a defender the last 3 yards before lunging in for the score. "

   "comment":"Walker. Tennessee is now 5-5 and is a serious contender to win the AFC South this season. Conversely, this is the first time Green Bay is under .500 after 9 games since 2008 when Aaron Rodgers was in his first year as a starter. However, the NFC North is wide open with the Vikings continuing their losing streak, so the Packers still have a shot to get to the postseason.    The first half of the game felt like you were watching the Big XII, as both defenses couldn't contain the quarterbacks, each of whom threw for more than 200 yards. On the Titans' first offensive play from scrimmage, DeMarco Murray ran untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. Mariota converted a third-and-14 to Tajae Sharpe (3-68-1) and then hit Delanie Walker for 41 yards after he beat Kentrell Brice to get open and shed the tackle."

   "comment":"Walker, meanwhile, was a major disappointment. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards despite the fact that many tight ends have abused Indianapolis' defense throughout the year.    Speaking of disappointing numbers, Murray couldn't muster much on the ground, as Tennessee's offensive line didn't block as well as usual. Murray mustered only 70 yards on 21 carries, though he helped his fantasy owners with the receiving touchdown.    Moving on to the Colts, Luck had that clutch conversion at the end of regulation, but struggled for most of the second half. He was brilliant early, going 12-of-16 for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns prior to intermission, but his second-half numbers were just 3-of-12 for 76 yards and an interception on an underthrown pass, thanks to some very shaky pass protection. The Colts were holding on for dear life, as Tennessee's defense finally woke up, but it was too late for the Titans.    Luck's touchdowns went to the usual suspects: Hilton (5-97) and "

Ramsey would eventually get his turnover when he snatched a Cassel pick-six.    The Titans couldn't move the chains because the tough Jacksonville run defense prevented DeMarco Murray (14-42) and Derrick Henry (4-13) from doing anything. Mariota didn't scramble much either, running just twice for 3 yards.    Thanks to the struggles of Mariota and Cassel, no Titans player had more than 50 receiving yards. Harry Douglas (5-48) and Tajae Sharpe (3-48) led the way, while Matthews (3-31) and Walker (3-23) caught touchdowns.    Moving on to the victors, teams typically rally around a new coach, and that's exactly what the Jaguars did with Doug Marrone replacing the utterly incompetent Gus Bradley. The Jaguars played with a tremendous amount of effort, while the Titans, fresh off emotional, difficult victories versus the Broncos and Chiefs, appeared to be sleepwalking, taking this game for granted. As a result, Jacksonville had its best performance of the season, finally displaying the potential the Jaguar truthers have been clamoring about all of these years.    "

   "comment":"Walker (4-31) had a decent day. Both are capable of more, but since Mariota likes to spread the ball around, their productions can fluctuate.    For the Seahawks, their offense actually looked very good during the contest. They were led by a strong passing attack that saw Russell Wilson post his best stat line of the season. Wilson ended up going 29-of-49 for 373 yards and a whopping 4 touchdowns. The stat line is a bit deceiving, as some of his yardage came with his team down by multiple scores late. But still, it was significantly better than the initial 2 starts for Wilson. Wilson finally had decent protection from his offensive line and wasn't forced to throw the ball away too much. He was sacked once during the contest, and that was a major improvement for Seattle. Throughout the game, when Wilson had time, he was able to find the open receiver wherever they were on the field. Wilson's accuracy and ball placement were superb, and he definitely is not the 1 to blame for the team's loss.    Wilson's top receivers on Sunday were "

Watson threw a frozen rope to Hopkins a couple plays later for a short touchdown run and a 14-0 lead. Houston quickly got the ball back with Watson making clutch first-down completions. On the first play of the second quarter, he threw a bullet to Fuller for a 15-yard touchdown.

   "comment":"Walker dropped a touchdown, while a field goal was blocked by T.J. Watt earlier in the evening. Marcus Mariota began pressing, and this led to a pair of late interceptions, 1 of which led to a score. Mariota finished 22-of-33 for 306 yards, 1 touchdown and 4 interceptions. He also scrambled for a score. Two of the picks weren't really his fault, as he was trying to make something happen late in the game. However, his initial pair of interceptions were terrible. The first occurred on Tennessee's opening scoring drive, which was a pass that was floated way too high. The second took place because Mariota stared down his receiver, allowing the defender to jump the route. Both picks set up Pittsburgh field goals.    The Titans wasted a ton of downs running the ball with DeMarco Murray. The veteran back was very sluggish, mustering just 10 yards on 8 carries. He also dropped a pass. Derrick Henry was more effective, gaining 32 yards on 7 attempts. The Titans need to move forward with Henry as their starting running back, though Murray should still be involved as a receiver out of the backfield.    Two Titans had more than 40 receiving yards. Rishard Matthews caught 5 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown, which was a 75-yard reception on the opening play of the second half. Meanwhile, Walker (6-92) had a solid outing except for his dropped score. Elsewhere, "
