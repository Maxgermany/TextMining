   "comment":"Matthew Stafford threw an interception in the end zone. Safety Stafford threw an interception in the end zone. Safety James Butler caught the ball, ran it out of the end zone and foolishly went back in, where he was tackled. Detroit was awarded with a safety. - The Rams attempted a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. Instead of kicking it, they ran a fake. Josh Brown tossed a 36-yard touchdown to Daniel Fells. The Lions were simply unprepared for it. Shocker. - Detroit had about 10 drops in this game. Ten freaking drops. - The Lions had the ball with 4 minutes remaining in the contest with the score tied at 10. Instead of trying to put together a game-winning drive, Detroit ran the ball twice, putting Stafford into a third-and-long situation. Stafford was predictably sacked. The Lions punted the ball away and the Rams scored a touchdown on the following drive. - The man responsible for this idiotic play-calling was Scott Linehan. I liked the Lions -3.5 because of Linehan's knowledge of St. Louis' schemes and personnel. Apparently, Linehan knows absolutely nothing and obviously not paying attention to anything while coaching the Rams.    Without Calvin Johnson, Stafford struggled statistically, going 14-of-33 for 168 yards and the aforementioned pick. But as I noted, Stafford suffered through close to 10 drops in this contest.

It's still too early to tell, but it appears as though Stafford will be out anywhere between 4-6 weeks. Believe me, I'll definitely have more on this later in the week. But let me say this - I can't believe how irresponsible the Lions are for letting a scrub like Backus protect their franchise quarterback, especially in a division with Peppers, "

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford threw an interception to Cowboys safety Gerald Sensabaugh.Stafford threw an interception to Cowboys safety Gerald Sensabaugh. Stafford threw behind Calvin Johnson and the ball flew directly into the stomach of Sensabaugh. Early on, Stafford was struggling and was feeling consistent pressure from the Cowboys front. The normally accurate Stafford was throwing a lot of passes short and heaved a number of passes away rather than pushing the ball downfield. In the first half, the Lions offense produced only 3 points. Stafford was 9-of-23 for 88 yards and an interception. Javhid Best had 21 yards on only 3 carries in the first half.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford. After that, linebacker Stafford. After that, linebacker Sean Weatherspoon blitzed and got his own sack. A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference. Two innocuous penalties on Detroit later, Ryan snuck in the ball for a 10-3 lead. It was an exchange they were never able to overcome. The rest of the game was pretty mundane, actually. The Lions immediately answered with a field goal drive, getting the aforementioned long run from Keiland Williams (18 yards) for the pivotal play. An exchange of punts later, with time running out in the first half, the Falcons had a drive getting all their playmakers involved with big plays. Gonzalez, who moved to second on the NFL's all-time receptions list, picked up a 30-yard gain. Turner had a 19-yard run, and Roddy White finished it off with an 18-yard touchdown catch. It was a powerful march that really had the the Lions' defense on its heels and left Atlanta in command, up 17-6 at halftime. Detroit's defense played well in the third quarter and thought they caught a break when Ryan had his ankle stepped on by left tackle Will Svitek to put him out of the game. The Falcons punted and the Lions got a field goal drive together, again as a result of a long run, this time from Morris (31 yards), but clearly had no spark as an offense. Then Atlanta immediately answered in incredible fashion after backup Chris Redman threw incomplete. Ryan, barely out of the locker room, ran onto the field for 3rd-and-5. He hit Harry Douglas for a 49-yard rip down the field. Even though the drive stalled, Matt Bryant hit a field goal to extend the lead to 20-9. With their back against the wall, the pilot light was finally lit up for Detroit in the form of Calvin Johnson catching a 57-yard touchdown on a laser from Stafford. Suddenly, it was a 20-16 game at the end of the third quarter. It got better when "

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford exploiting broken coverage. There was a miscommunication as Stafford exploiting broken coverage. There was a miscommunication as Titus Young was wide open in the end zone with no Bronco player within 30 yards of him. The 41-yard touchdown pass was Young's first score of his career. Things got tough for Tebow in the second quarter. Lions defensive end Cliff Avril notched a sack-fumble after beating right tackle Orlando Franklin to nail Tebow from his blind side. The Denver signal-caller made a nice 16-yard pass to Decker as he stepped up and delivered a throw on the money, while also taking a hit. After that, Tebow was sacked again, this time by Stephen Tulloch, and started Tebowing right above the second-year quarterback. Tebow then had a string of incompletions. Some passes were off the mark, but his receivers also had issues. On some good throws from their quarterback, the Broncos wideouts were dropping passes, and in the case of Demaryius Thomas, a pass was simply slapped out of the hands. The Bronco receivers were seeing man coverage but weren't getting separation. In the first half, Tebow was sacked 3 times and under steady pressure, making only 4-of-13 passes for 37 yards. He also had carried the ball 4 times for 15 yards. FOX analyst John Lynch was very critical of the Broncos' play calling for not setting up some easy completions. When it was Detroit's turn, Stafford threw a jump ball and Tony Scheffler made a juggling 29-yard catch to set up the Lions at the Broncos' 2-yard line."

As mentioned, Carolina had a 24-7 lead in this game, so how did they blow both the straight-up victory and the cover? Well, they were the only 1. making dumb mistakes in the second half. All they did after intermission was drop passes, take sacks, throw picks and miss tackles. It was amazing how much of a 180 this game took.    Newton was just dreadful after the break. He had a nice, game-tying touchdown drive with 5 minutes remaining, but his 3 picks were a killer. He finished 22-of-38, 280 yards, 1 touchdown and 4 interceptions to go along with 2 rushing scores.    Newton's top receiver was a running back; Jonathan Stewart made 6 grabs for 87 yards.

Detroit then recovered an onside kick, and Hill launched a Hail Mary that was answered when a crowd of players tipped the ball to Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), "

Ser Stafford finished 30-of-51 for 319 yards. As mentioned, drops wiped out a touchdown and an interception. It's worth noting that he was able to get a 56-yard pass-interference flag on an attempt to Johnson.    Megatron totaled just 5 catches for 54 yards, but had that long pass-interference flag, as just mentioned. He also nearly caught a touchdown, but Harrison Smith dislodged the ball with a great hit.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford completed just 7 of his first 21 passes. The Eagles, meanwhile, hit some big plays, particularly deep throws. QB Dog Killer sailed a 70-yard bomb to Stafford completed just 7 of his first 21 passes. The Eagles, meanwhile, hit some big plays, particularly deep throws. QB Dog Killer sailed a 70-yard bomb to Jeremy Maclin in the final period, thanks in part to a completely busted coverage by Detroit's secondary. QBDK had a very mixed game, going 28-of-46 for 311 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. He did some great things, like complete that long pass to Maclin (6-130, TD) and others, including a 30-yarder to DeSean Jackson (5-74). He also showed no hesitation when scrambling, rushing for 59 yards on 9 carries. He was screwed over in some instances as well. For example, a touchdown to Brent Celek was nullified because of a very shaky offensive pass interference. There were some drops as well, including 1 by Celek that would have moved the chains on a 3rd-and-7. It also has to be noted that the offensive line continued to function like a turnstile. Detroit's defensive line flooded the backfield, including twice on consecutive occasions in overtime. Nick Fairley, who had 1 of those sacks, was a monster. QBDK took many fierce hits in this contest. I was shocked that he somehow survived the afternoon, as he was slow to get up sometimes. However, there was plenty of bad QBDK. Despite carrying a ball around with him all week, he was guilty of a fumble (his ninth of the year), though he recovered it. Meanwhile, his interceptions were terrible. He overthrew the first 1 and walked off the field to a chorus of boos. The second 1 was badly underthrown.    QBDK can't really be blamed for this loss though, as Philadelphia's defense was pathetic in the 4.h quarter and overtime. Of course, the fact that the Lions stopped making dumb mistakes, including offsides, false-start, personal-foul and helmet-to-helmet hits penalties, contributed to the comeback victory.    Stafford was unstoppable in the final quarter plus, finishing 22-of-45 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and a poor interception forced to Calvin Johnson into double coverage."

Wilson dissected the Lions, though that is hardly a surprise, given how many injuries Detroit had in its back 7 entering the contest. Cornerbacks Bullet Bill Bentley and Jacob Lacey, safety Amari Spievey and linebacker DeAndre Levy were all inactive. Making matters worse, stud safety Louis Delmas sustained a knee injury. Jim Schwartz said that Delmas will be evaluated Monday, but it's just ridiculous how snake-bitten he is. You have to wonder if he'll ever be healthy, a la Bob Sanders.    Wilson's scores went to Rice (6-55) and Zach Miller (2-22). The leading receiver was Golden Tate, who had 7 grabs for 64 yards, though his longest reception (18 yards) came on an attempted hook-and-lateral on the last play of the game. Unfortunately for Tate, he did not have the replacement officials aiding his effort this time.    Because of Wilson's success, you can't totally criticize the fact that Marshawn Lynch carried the ball just 12 times. He turned those attempts into 105 yards and a touchdown (77 yards), but he still should have been given more opportunities to gash Detroit's depleted defense.    Detroit's starting running back actually received fewer carries than Lynch. Mikel Leshoure rushed only 10 times for 46 yards. It wasn't poor play-calling that kept the ball out of his hands, however; Leshoure suffered some sort of injury in the third quarter and walked off with a limp. Joique Bell took over as the primary ball-carrier, gaining 25 yards on 7 carries. Kevin Smith was given the ball just once for some reason on a failed goal-line attempt.

Even more laughable was his Hail Mary attempt at the end of the first half; throwing from midfield, Gabbert's weak lob sailed only 30 yards and was nearly intercepted at the Detroit 20-yard line. Gabbert would end up finishing 27-of-38 for 220 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks, 1 of which was a pathetic pass that just seemed to die in mid-air. Don't be fooled by the final numbers; his stats came in complete garbage time where the Lions were just playing prevent. It's clear by now that he's not the long-term solution at the quarterback position. They can't possibly sell their fans on him for another season.    Gabbert's meaningless scores went to Michael Spurlock (5-35) and Justin Blackmon (5-32). Blackmon's touchdown was the first of his professional career.    If there is a silver lining for Gabbert's performance, it's that he spread the ball around. Six Jaguars caught at least 3 passes. In addition to Spurlock and Blackmon, they were Laurent Robinson (6-41), Marcedes Lewis (4-41), Cecil Shorts (3-56) and Rashad Jennings (3-7).    The best play of the day for the Jaguars came on special teams. Third-round rookie Bryan Anger blasted a 73-yard punt. As this happened, I posted: <i> Bryan Anger with a 73-yard punt! The highlight of the Jaguars' 2012 season! </i> Sad, but true.    As for Stafford, he didn't have to throw at all once the team established a 24-0 lead. He finished 22-of-33 for 285 yards.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford late on third-and-long. The Lions would have punted the ball away, but they were awarded a free first down. Later on the possession, Stafford late on third-and-long. The Lions would have punted the ball away, but they were awarded a free first down. Later on the possession, Xavier Rhodes was whistled for pass interference downfield. This eventually led to a Detroit touchdown. The game was a 27-24 affair at that point, so the 2 penalties helped the Lions pull away.    Detroit, of course, made some mistakes itself. Reggie Bush dropped a pass in the red zone on the opening drive. A field goal attempt was aborted because of a bobbled hold. Calvin Johnson let the ball hit the ground on a potential touchdown. A chop block nullified a pick-six. Brandon Pettigrew lost a fumble. The team burned a timeout in the beginning of the third quarter. Basically another day at the office for this team. The Lions look great at times, but these errors will cost them games down the road. They're just fortunate that the Vikings made similar mental mistakes.    It really helped the Lions that Ponder was so inept. He went 18-of-28 for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and a fumble. He didn't even attempt a pass in the first quarter, as the coaching staff clearly doesn't trust him. Plus, there's always Adrian Peterson, who opened the contest with a 78-yard score. Peterson did nothing after that, however, mustering just 15 yards the rest of the way. His final numbers were 93 yards and 3 total touchdowns on 18 attempts.    The only Viking receiver with more than 35 yards was Jerome Simpson (7-140), who should be ignored in all fantasy leagues. Greg Jennings predictably did nothing, mustering just 3 receptions for 33 yards. It sucks that Jennings threw away his NFL career for slightly more money.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, Megatron snagged just 4 balls for 37 yards. It's a shame because he just missed out on a huge day. He couldn't hold on to the ball in the first quarter - it was 1 of those process of the catch things that screwed him in Week 1 a few seasons ago - and he later couldn't get a second foot inbounds when hauling in a potential touchdown.    Bush also lost 2 touchdowns. Both missed opportunities came on reviews. He was otherwise brilliant, collecting 90 rushing yards (21 carries) and 101 receiving yards (4 catches). He did manage to score once. Bush dislocated his thumb in this game, but said that he's fine.    Save for an interception on a tipped pass, Stafford was outstanding. He went 28-of-43 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He distributed the ball evenly, with 6 Lions catching at least 3 balls. Stafford's scores went to Bush and undrafted rookie tight end "

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford was throwing late and inaccurately. Stafford was throwing late and inaccurately. Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

However, outside of a scramble on 4.h-and-10 to move the chains, Brees just couldn't get anything going. He also wasted too much time, trying to run plays instead of spiking the ball. Granted, he was battling 1 of the NFL's top defenses, but Brees was just so uncharacteristically sloppy in the final few minutes of regulation. Brees finished 28-of-45 for 342 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He hit some impressive throws, but also missed some routine 1.. He was just 3-of-14 and the pick in the 4.h quarter.

Brees probably would've done better if Jimmy Graham had actually contributed instead of served as a mere decoy. Graham saw action - he was even on the field during the first drive - but he didn't log a single reception. He was targeted twice.    Brees' big receivers were Marques Colston (6-111), who finally produced after doing nothing this season, and Kenny Stills (5-103, TD). Brandin Cooks had a disappointing outing, catching just 2 passes for 23 yards.    The Saints didn't run the ball very well. The Lions have a monstrous ground defense, so that's part of the reason. The other is that Mark Ingram did nothing outside of a 14-yard burst, gaining just 16 yards on 10 attempts. Khiry Robinson (3-26) lost a fumble near midfield and barely did anything after that.    Before moving on to the Lions, I need to mention that the Saints sustained numerous injuries. Pierre Thomas (6-13) left the game with a shoulder. Center Jonathan Goodwin was gone with a leg issue. Brodrick Bunkley was knocked out with a concussion. Glenn Foster exited with a knee.    As for Detroit, Stafford had to once again perform without his top weapon. He had some issues early on when he telegraphed an interception, which led to a New Orleans touchdown. Stafford threw a second pick later, but that was a pass that popped out of his receiver's hands. Stafford missed some other passes that he should have converted, but ultimately led his team into the end zone with a game-winning score to "

The Lions prevailed, but their issues are still prevalent. They barely try some weeks, and regardless of whether they do or not, they commit dumb errors like having a delay of game during a game-winning kicking try. Their offensive line sucked.

It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because DeAndre Levy dropped an easy interception in the end zone. - A field goal attempt by Detroit was blocked. Dion Jordan scooped up the ball and returned it to the Lions' 5-yard line. The Dolphins immediately converted with a Tannehill touchdown to Mike Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining."

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford use up some of these turnovers in the Monday night game? Seriously, how in the world did this miserable Detroit squad not commit any turnovers prior to the Calvin Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable. </i>    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to Tim Wright. Detroit's second possession saw Ameer Abdullah fumble the ball away courtesy of a strip from Tony Jefferson. Arizona couldn't do anything with the turnovers, and Stafford burned Jarraud Powers with a 50-yard pass to Corey Fuller (2-56) to the 6-yard line. The next play saw Stafford throw a touchdown pass to Theo Riddick (10-53-1). From there though, it was all Cardinals. Arizona's offense responded with a drive down the field. Carson Palmer hit Darren Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford use up some of these turnovers in the Monday night game? Seriously, how in the world did this miserable Detroit squad not commit any turnovers prior to the Calvin Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable. </i>    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to Tim Wright. Detroit's second possession saw Ameer Abdullah fumble the ball away courtesy of a strip from Tony Jefferson. Arizona couldn't do anything with the turnovers, and Stafford burned Jarraud Powers with a 50-yard pass to Corey Fuller (2-56) to the 6-yard line. The next play saw Stafford throw a touchdown pass to Theo Riddick (10-53-1). From there though, it was all Cardinals. Arizona's offense responded with a drive down the field. Carson Palmer hit Darren Fells for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7. The Lions quickly set up Arizona for another touchdown as Cory Redding tipped a screen pass to himself and rumbled down the field before being tackled by Stafford at the 4. On the next play, David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Golden Tate was stripped by Tony Jefferson, and Rashad Johnson recovered the ball for Arizona. A few plays later, Palmer hit John Brown for an 18-yard touchdown. The game was, effectively, over by halftime. The third quarter was more of the same as Stafford and Calvin Johnson weren't on the same page. A pass flew right to Arizona's Patrick Peterson, who he returned it 40 yards. Promptly, Palmer threw a perfect pass to Larry Fitzgerald for 26 yards. Then a slant to Fitzgerald hit pay dirt for the Cardinals. After that interception, Stafford was benched for Dan Orlovsky. In 4.h-quarter garbage time, Andre Ellington took off on a 63-yard touchdown run to pad the Cardinals' lead.    Carson Palmer was 11-of-14 for 161 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for him, and it's a shame for his fantasy owners that he couldn't play late in the game to pad his stats.    Chris Johnson led the Cardinals on the ground with 11 carries for 103 yards. Ellington had 3 carries for 63 yards, while David Johnson was given 3 carries, which he turned into 6 yards and 2 scores.    Larry Fitzgerald (5-58-1), John Brown (4-73-1), Darren Fells (2-25) and Michael Floyd (1-15) made easy work of Detroit's secondary. As with Palmer, they could've posted better numbers if the Lions were more competitive.    Matthew Stafford was 20-of-32 for 188 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. Dan Orlovsky was 21-of-38 for 191 yards with a score and an interception. Jim Caldwell told reporters that Stafford will remain the starter.

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson. To finish the drive, Stafford went to Johnson on a short fade pass on the side of the end zone in front of Xavier Rhodes for the touchdown. Minnesota responded with Bridgewater using Diggs, Mike Wallace, and handoffs to Adrian Peterson to put up a 3.point drive. Stafford came back to find Eric Ebron wide open for a gain of 55 yards. Ameer Abdullah had a nice run of 13 to the Vikings 7-yard line, and then Stafford hit Ebron for a touchdown. Bridgewater led another field goal drive for Minnesota, but on his next possession, he fumbled the exchange to Peterson, and Detroit's Stephen Tulloch fell on the loose ball. That led to a Lions field goal and a 17-6 lead. Minnesota answered with a 49-yard pass to fullback Zach Line as he was left completely uncovered along the sideline. On a third-and-goal, Bridgewater found Kyle Rudolph wide open for a short touchdown catch. Bridgewater tacked on a field goal drive with Blair Walsh hitting a 51-yarder in the final seconds before half. The Lions took a 17-15 lead into halftime. Early in the third quarter, Bridgewater laid out a bomb for Diggs, who made a superb diving catch for a 36-yard touchdown. On the Vikings next possession, Peterson broke off a 75-yard run to Detroit's 3-yard line. Caraun Reid came up with a sack on third-and-goal, leaving Minnesota with just a field goal. Bridgewater went on to set up another chip-shot field goal with a 30-yard pass to Adam Thielen. The Vikings suffocated the Lions' defense until garbage time late in the 4.h quarter. A 31-yard pass to Theo Riddick, a nice gain to Eric Ebron, and Calvin Johnson caught a deflected pass at the 1.yard line. However, the Vikings put together a goal-line stand and took over after Stafford was incomplete on 4.h down.    Teddy Bridgewater completed 25-of-35 for 316 yards with 2 touchdowns. He was very efficient for Minnesota, taking what the defense gave him and picking apart Detroit's weak secondary.    Adrian Peterson ran for 98 yards on 19 carries. Aside from his long run, he didn't find much running holes against Detroit.    Fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs totaled 108 yards and a touchdown on 6 receptions. He showed his speed once again as the Lions' corners were incapable of keeping Diggs from separating.    Matthew Stafford completed 18-of-26 passes for 256 yards with 2 touchdowns. It was an underwhelming game, but Stafford had no chance with his pathetic offensive line. He was consistently getting planted into the turf. Stafford had no chance to sustain drives with the relentless Vikings pass rush. Minnesota remains in the playoff race, while Detroit maintains its status as a top competitor for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.    The Lions started the game well in the first quarter. They got going early with Stafford connecting downfield for 46 yards with Calvin Johnson."

   "comment":"Matthew Stafford had major problems connecting with Calvin Johnson, as the Rams had Trumaine Johnson blanket him.Stafford had major problems connecting with Calvin Johnson, as the Rams had Trumaine Johnson blanket him. This was unusual for Gregg Williams' defense, but it worked perfectly. Johnson, 1 of the top cornerbacks in the NFL, smothered Megatron. With poor protection and no top option at his disposal, Stafford struggled. His final numbers look good - he went 30-of-46 for 245 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but much of that came in garbage time. By halftime, Stafford was 12-of-17 for 99 yards and a pick-six, which was a telegraphed ball to Megatron that Johnson picked off.    Megatron, who couldn't get open whatsoever against Johnson, caught just 1 of the 5 targets thrown to him for 16 yards. He was guilty of a brutal drop as well. "

Calvin Johnson, who appeared to be playing on 1 leg a couple of Monday nights ago, completely dominated this contest. The Bears had no answer for him, as he secured 10 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown. Stafford and Johnson connected on a beautiful back-shoulder connection in the first half. Stafford, meanwhile, went 28-of-39 for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Bears couldn't do anything to stop him, especially during the latter stages of the second half. They need to improve their linebacking corps and pass rush this offseason. Adding another cornerback wouldn't hurt either.    With Megatron dominating all of the targets, no other Lion registered more than 49 receiving yards. Thus, it was a disappointing showing by "

One incompletion was a drop by Stafford did a great job of bouncing back from last week's embarrassing performance. He misfired on just 6 occasions, going 19-of-25 for 180 yards and 3 touchdowns. One incompletion was a drop by Andre Roberts in the red zone. Stafford also had a nifty 14-yard scramble in the opening half to help move the chains. His 1 real blemish on the afternoon was a lost fumble that set the Eagles up in scoring territory. Fortunately for Stafford, his defense was able to limit Philadelphia to just a field goal.    Two of Stafford's touchdowns were thrown to "

To start the first quarter, the Lions had a drive into Houston territory, but Stafford to keep the Texans in sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Detroit was dropped to .500, but still remains in the NFC wild-card race.    To start the first quarter, the Lions had a drive into Houston territory, but Matt Prater missed a 49-yard field goal. The Texans got moving after that with Oswieler hitting passes to DeAndre Hopkins and C.J. Fiedorowicz, plus converting a third-and-10 to Ryan Griffin for a first-and-goal. Osweiler hit Fiedorowicz for the score and a quick lead. The Lions went 3.and-out, and Osweiler continued to rip the ball through the Detroit secondary using his tight end and Hopkins making a beautiful 1.handed catch to move the ball to the 1-yard line. From there, Lamar Miller scored to give Houston a 14-0 lead. A Jadeveon Clowney sack led to a punt that set up the Texans in Lions territory with 80 seconds remaining in the half. However, Osweiler threw an interception to Johnson Bademosi. It was really the only bad play of the game for Osweiler and was a nice move by Bademosi. Stafford responded by moving the ball into the Texans' territory with a 33-yard pass to Eric Ebron, and this time, Prater was good on a 47-yarder to cut the lead to 14-3 at the half."

That all changed, as Stafford struggled to throw the ball versus the Bears. Stafford banged his hand on a Chicago player in the first quarter, and he had to wear a glove on his right hand the rest of the afternoon. The hand injury gave him major problems, especially in the second half. Stafford, however, came up big when it mattered most. Stafford's second half was a mess, as he went just 5-of-10 for 47 yards following intermission. His first interception was thrown into the end zone on a deflection, which wasn't really his fault, but his other pick was; he telegraphed the throw to "

On the plus side, they remained in the race for the No. 1 pick.    On Kizer's first play, he lofted in a pretty 38-yard pass to Sammie Coates (2-38) to set up a field goal for Cleveland. Shortly later, Stafford threw a pass into a crowd, and it was intercepted by Jamie Collins."
