Detroit was awarded with a safety. - The Rams attempted a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. Instead of kicking it, they ran a fake. Josh Brown tossed a 36-yard touchdown to Daniel Fells. The Lions were simply unprepared for it. Shocker. - Detroit had about 10 drops in this game. Ten freaking drops. - The Lions had the ball with 4 minutes remaining in the contest with the score tied at 10. Instead of trying to put together a game-winning drive, Detroit ran the ball twice, putting Stafford into a third-and-long situation. Stafford was predictably sacked. The Lions punted the ball away and the Rams scored a touchdown on the following drive. - The man responsible for this idiotic play-calling was Scott Linehan. I liked the Lions -3.5 because of Linehan's knowledge of St. Louis' schemes and personnel. Apparently, Linehan knows absolutely nothing and obviously not paying attention to anything while coaching the Rams.

   "comment":"Stafford, but fumbled the ball away on the return. With new life, the Lions were able to move down the field with the help of 2 Kansas City personal foul penalties. When the Chiefs had the ball, Jamaal Charles suffered a nasty-looking knee injury as he fell out of bounds. Charles tripped over the Lions mascot and had to be carted into the locker room. All reports indicate that Charles will be out for the year. Kansas City is now a leading candidate in the Suck for Luck sweepstakes.    With Charles done, Dexter McCluster has to be added. Thomas Jones (12-40) is the obvious guy, but Todd Haley has been using McCluster often thus far in the preseason and these 2 regular-season games. McCluster rushed for 51 yards on 8 carries to go along with 4 receptions.    Matt Cassel had yet another poor outing without Charlie Weis. He went 15-of-22 for 133 yards and 3 picks. That means he's 57-of-109, 437 yards, 1 touchdown and a whopping 9 interceptions in his last 4 games. Fortunately for Dwayne Bowe owners, he was able to salvage a solid day (5-101).    While the Chiefs struggled to get first downs, the Lions pretty much moved the ball at will. Matthew Stafford went 23-of-39 for 294 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. The disparity between the 2 quarterbacks was extremely evident, as Stafford completed a very similar pass that was a Cassel interception. The announcers ran with this, talking about windows for a good 10 minutes. I guess they can't be blamed because it was a blowout and they had nothing else to say.    Two of Stafford's scores went to "

   "comment":"Stafford took countless sacks. Right tackle Gosder Cherilus, in particular, was awful. He was benched, but Minnesota right end Brian Robison continued to abuse his replacement. Stafford couldn't get anything going. Even on the rare occasions when he wasn't pressured, he looked jittery in the pocket. The Lions had just 4 first downs in the opening half. Perhaps I should have listened for forum member Lukic, who at the time posted, Detroit is gonna win and cover. Calling it here. Vikings are gonna choke again. Minnesota did indeed choke the game away. Literally. "

   "comment":"Stafford. After that, linebacker Sean Weatherspoon blitzed and got his own sack. A short completion later, the Lions were settling for a 3-0 lead. It was a bad tone to set. A few drives later, special teams started to turn the tide for the visitors. First, Eric Weems put the offense in business, returning a punt 37 yards to the Detroit 26. The Lions tightened up defensively and forced a field goal, but following an Atlanta penalty on the ensuing kickoff, the re-kick resulted in a fumble by Stefan Logan. Then a key penalty really hurt them. It was 2nd-and-5 from the 10 for the Falcons. Ryan threw the ball well over the head of Tony Gonzalez, but linebacker Bobby Carpenter was flagged for pass interference. Two innocuous penalties on Detroit later, Ryan snuck in the ball for a 10-3 lead. It was an exchange they were never able to overcome. The rest of the game was pretty mundane, actually. The Lions immediately answered with a field goal drive, getting the aforementioned long run from Keiland Williams (18 yards) for the pivotal play. An exchange of punts later, with time running out in the first half, the Falcons had a drive getting all their playmakers involved with big plays. Gonzalez, who moved to second on the NFL's all-time receptions list, picked up a 30-yard gain. Turner had a 19-yard run, and Roddy White finished it off with an 18-yard touchdown catch. It was a powerful march that really had the the Lions' defense on its heels and left Atlanta in command, up 17-6 at halftime. Detroit's defense played well in the third quarter and thought they caught a break when Ryan had his ankle stepped on by left tackle Will Svitek to put him out of the game. The Falcons punted and the Lions got a field goal drive together, again as a result of a long run, this time from Morris (31 yards), but clearly had no spark as an offense. Then Atlanta immediately answered in incredible fashion after backup Chris Redman threw incomplete. Ryan, barely out of the locker room, ran onto the field for 3rd-and-5. He hit Harry Douglas for a 49-yard rip down the field. Even though the drive stalled, Matt Bryant hit a field goal to extend the lead to 20-9. With their back against the wall, the pilot light was finally lit up for Detroit in the form of Calvin Johnson catching a 57-yard touchdown on a laser from Stafford. Suddenly, it was a 20-16 game at the end of the third quarter. It got better when "

   "comment":"Stafford exploiting broken coverage. There was a miscommunication as Titus Young was wide open in the end zone with no Bronco player within 30 yards of him. The 41-yard touchdown pass was Young's first score of his career. Things got tough for Tebow in the second quarter. Lions defensive end Cliff Avril notched a sack-fumble after beating right tackle Orlando Franklin to nail Tebow from his blind side. The Denver signal-caller made a nice 16-yard pass to Decker as he stepped up and delivered a throw on the money, while also taking a hit. After that, Tebow was sacked again, this time by Stephen Tulloch, and started Tebowing right above the second-year quarterback. Tebow then had a string of incompletions. Some passes were off the mark, but his receivers also had issues. On some good throws from their quarterback, the Broncos wideouts were dropping passes, and in the case of Demaryius Thomas, a pass was simply slapped out of the hands. The Bronco receivers were seeing man coverage but weren't getting separation. In the first half, Tebow was sacked 3 times and under steady pressure, making only 4-of-13 passes for 37 yards. He also had carried the ball 4 times for 15 yards. FOX analyst John Lynch was very critical of the Broncos' play calling for not setting up some easy completions. When it was Detroit's turn, Stafford threw a jump ball and Tony Scheffler made a juggling 29-yard catch to set up the Lions at the Broncos' 2-yard line."

   "comment":"Stafford had 2 brilliant drives in the 4.h quarter to mount a great comeback. The young Lions really grew up in this contest.)    Both teams came in nursing playoff aspirations and for the most part played like it. A lot of the talk prior to the game was about penalties, and I set the imaginary over/under at 20. The flags were evenly spread between the Raiders (10 for 86 yards) and Lions (9 for 72 yards), but the total came in just under, and thankfully, penalties did not overshadow a great showdown between teams trying to save their respective seasons. The other story was 2 former No. 1 overall picks leading the way at quarterback. They did not disappoint with Matthew Stafford (29-of-52, 391 yards, 4 TDs) ultimately showing up Carson Palmer (32-of-40, 367 yards, TD)."

Detroit then recovered an onside kick, and Hill launched a Hail Mary that was answered when a crowd of players tipped the ball to Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), "

   "comment":"Stafford completed just 7 of his first 21 passes. The Eagles, meanwhile, hit some big plays, particularly deep throws. QB Dog Killer sailed a 70-yard bomb to Jeremy Maclin in the final period, thanks in part to a completely busted coverage by Detroit's secondary. QBDK had a very mixed game, going 28-of-46 for 311 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. He did some great things, like complete that long pass to Maclin (6-130, TD) and others, including a 30-yarder to DeSean Jackson (5-74). He also showed no hesitation when scrambling, rushing for 59 yards on 9 carries. He was screwed over in some instances as well. For example, a touchdown to Brent Celek was nullified because of a very shaky offensive pass interference. There were some drops as well, including 1 by Celek that would have moved the chains on a 3rd-and-7. It also has to be noted that the offensive line continued to function like a turnstile. Detroit's defensive line flooded the backfield, including twice on consecutive occasions in overtime. Nick Fairley, who had 1 of those sacks, was a monster. QBDK took many fierce hits in this contest. I was shocked that he somehow survived the afternoon, as he was slow to get up sometimes. However, there was plenty of bad QBDK. Despite carrying a ball around with him all week, he was guilty of a fumble (his ninth of the year), though he recovered it. Meanwhile, his interceptions were terrible. He overthrew the first 1 and walked off the field to a chorus of boos. The second 1 was badly underthrown.    QBDK can't really be blamed for this loss though, as Philadelphia's defense was pathetic in the 4.h quarter and overtime. Of course, the fact that the Lions stopped making dumb mistakes, including offsides, false-start, personal-foul and helmet-to-helmet hits penalties, contributed to the comeback victory.    Stafford was unstoppable in the final quarter plus, finishing 22-of-45 for 311 yards, 1 touchdown and a poor interception forced to Calvin Johnson into double coverage."

His numbers could've been even better had Sidney Rice not dropped a 40-yard bomb. Wilson dissected the Lions, though that is hardly a surprise, given how many injuries Detroit had in its back 7 entering the contest. Cornerbacks Bullet Bill Bentley and Jacob Lacey, safety Amari Spievey and linebacker DeAndre Levy were all inactive. Making matters worse, stud safety Louis Delmas sustained a knee injury. Jim Schwartz said that Delmas will be evaluated Monday, but it's just ridiculous how snake-bitten he is. You have to wonder if he'll ever be healthy, a la Bob Sanders.    Wilson's scores went to Rice (6-55) and Zach Miller (2-22). The leading receiver was Golden Tate, who had 7 grabs for 64 yards, though his longest reception (18 yards) came on an attempted hook-and-lateral on the last play of the game. Unfortunately for Tate, he did not have the replacement officials aiding his effort this time.    Because of Wilson's success, you can't totally criticize the fact that Marshawn Lynch carried the ball just 12 times. He turned those attempts into 105 yards and a touchdown (77 yards), but he still should have been given more opportunities to gash Detroit's depleted defense.    Detroit's starting running back actually received fewer carries than Lynch. Mikel Leshoure rushed only 10 times for 46 yards. It wasn't poor play-calling that kept the ball out of his hands, however; Leshoure suffered some sort of injury in the third quarter and walked off with a limp. Joique Bell took over as the primary ball-carrier, gaining 25 yards on 7 carries. Kevin Smith was given the ball just once for some reason on a failed goal-line attempt.    The Lions were still able to prevail because of Matthew Stafford, who started slowly but caught fire in the second half. Ser Stafford went 34-of-49 for 352 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception.

   "comment":"Stafford was 15-of-24 for 216 yards, while Blaine Gabbert was a pathetic 4-of-7 for 10 yards, with all 4 completions being checkdowns. Even more laughable was his Hail Mary attempt at the end of the first half; throwing from midfield, Gabbert's weak lob sailed only 30 yards and was nearly intercepted at the Detroit 20-yard line. Gabbert would end up finishing 27-of-38 for 220 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks, 1 of which was a pathetic pass that just seemed to die in mid-air. Don't be fooled by the final numbers; his stats came in complete garbage time where the Lions were just playing prevent. It's clear by now that he's not the long-term solution at the quarterback position. They can't possibly sell their fans on him for another season.    Gabbert's meaningless scores went to Michael Spurlock (5-35) and Justin Blackmon (5-32). Blackmon's touchdown was the first of his professional career.    If there is a silver lining for Gabbert's performance, it's that he spread the ball around. Six Jaguars caught at least 3 passes. In addition to Spurlock and Blackmon, they were Laurent Robinson (6-41), Marcedes Lewis (4-41), Cecil Shorts (3-56) and Rashad Jennings (3-7).    The best play of the day for the Jaguars came on special teams. Third-round rookie Bryan Anger blasted a 73-yard punt. As this happened, I posted: Bryan Anger with a 73-yard punt! The highlight of the Jaguars' 2012 season! Sad, but true.    As for Stafford, he didn't have to throw at all once the team established a 24-0 lead. He finished 22-of-33 for 285 yards. He once again couldn't find "

His best play occurred at the end of the first quarter when he showed tremendous elusiveness under pressure, evading the Detroit pass-rushers and finding Donald Driver for a first down. Rodgers was sacked 3 times, twice by Nick Fairley, who was completely dominant.    Rodgers' scores went to Cobb (9-74) and Jermichael Finley (3-66). Finley's touchdown was his first since Week 1. Meanwhile, it was disappointing to see Nelson (3-45) and James Jones (2-33) do nothing.    As for the Lions, Stafford had some issues of his own. He went 17-of-39 for 266 yards, 1 touchdowns, 2 picks and the aforementioned fumble. He had accuracy problems all afternoon, as he missed "

   "comment":"Stafford late on third-and-long. The Lions would have punted the ball away, but they were awarded a free first down. Later on the possession, Xavier Rhodes was whistled for pass interference downfield. This eventually led to a Detroit touchdown. The game was a 27-24 affair at that point, so the 2 penalties helped the Lions pull away.    Detroit, of course, made some mistakes itself. Reggie Bush dropped a pass in the red zone on the opening drive. A field goal attempt was aborted because of a bobbled hold. Calvin Johnson let the ball hit the ground on a potential touchdown. A chop block nullified a pick-six. Brandon Pettigrew lost a fumble. The team burned a timeout in the beginning of the third quarter. Basically another day at the office for this team. The Lions look great at times, but these errors will cost them games down the road. They're just fortunate that the Vikings made similar mental mistakes.    It really helped the Lions that Ponder was so inept. He went 18-of-28 for 236 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and a fumble. He didn't even attempt a pass in the first quarter, as the coaching staff clearly doesn't trust him. Plus, there's always Adrian Peterson, who opened the contest with a 78-yard score. Peterson did nothing after that, however, mustering just 15 yards the rest of the way. His final numbers were 93 yards and 3 total touchdowns on 18 attempts.    The only Viking receiver with more than 35 yards was Jerome Simpson (7-140), who should be ignored in all fantasy leagues. Greg Jennings predictably did nothing, mustering just 3 receptions for 33 yards. It sucks that Jennings threw away his NFL career for slightly more money.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, Megatron snagged just 4 balls for 37 yards. It's a shame because he just missed out on a huge day. He couldn't hold on to the ball in the first quarter - it was 1 of those process of the catch things that screwed him in Week 1 a few seasons ago - and he later couldn't get a second foot inbounds when hauling in a potential touchdown.    Bush also lost 2 touchdowns. Both missed opportunities came on reviews. He was otherwise brilliant, collecting 90 rushing yards (21 carries) and 101 receiving yards (4 catches). He did manage to score once. Bush dislocated his thumb in this game, but said that he's fine.    Save for an interception on a tipped pass, Stafford was outstanding. He went 28-of-43 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He distributed the ball evenly, with 6 Lions catching at least 3 balls. Stafford's scores went to Bush and undrafted rookie tight end "

   "comment":"Stafford was throwing late and inaccurately. Matt Forte broke a long touchdown run, and Chicago looked like it was in control. And then Jay Cutler happened. Cutler was brutal throughout this entire contest. He started things off by throwing an interception into double coverage, setting up the Lions in the red zone. He later floated a pass into double coverage that was easily picked by Glover Quin and taken down to the Chicago 2-yard line. Mixed in were several poor sacks in which Cutler took big losses. And all of this was just in the first half when the game was still up for grabs. Cutler wasn't any better after the break. He tossed a third interception right to Louis Delmas on a blatant overthrow. He then came back and was strip-sacked by Ndamukong Suh. The ball was picked up by Nick Fairley and taken into the end zone. This put the Lions up by 3 touchdowns. Game, set, match. Cutler finished 27-of-47 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 picks, but those numbers are obviously deceiving. As of halftime, he was just 8-of-15 for 101 yards, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble.    Cutler spread the ball out evenly to his 4 main targets: Alshon Jeffery (5-107, TD) led in receiving yardage, though he missed out on a second score because he couldn't stay inbounds on a deep completion. Martellus Bennett (8-90) had the most catches, but he dropped a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was somewhere in between (7-79), while Matt Forte caught his usual 5 passes for 22 yards. Forte also rushed for 95 yards and a score on 14 tries. Most of that came on a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter.    I don't want to take much away from the winning team, but as I mentioned earlier, Stafford was not at his best. Many of his passes were off the mark. He even threw an interception in the red zone because his pass was way behind Megatron. Stafford went 23-of-35 for 242 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a strip-sack by "

The dome-based Lions had major issues early on, as 1 might expect. In fact, their troubles started before kickoff when Reggie Bush slipped on the turf and aggravated his calf injury. They then had 5 fumbles in the first 16 minutes of the game, losing 2 of them. Once they started moving the ball, they opted to eschew a field-goal attempt on the 12-yard line. They even went for 2 after each touchdown. They tried just 1 kick in this contest, an extra-point try, and it was blocked and returned for what should have been 2 points if the NFL adopted the fun college rule. The Eagles also had issues in the heavy snow early on. Nick Foles fired his first interception of the season on an overthrow. LeSean McCoy, meanwhile, was guilty of running backward and taking huge losses on several occasions. They also had trouble moving around on special teams, surrendering 2 touchdowns to Jeremy Ross. However, being the cold-weather team, they were able to adjust. McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well. Nick Foles, meanwhile, was so much more effective after halftime. He was just 4-of-10 for 35 yards and the pick prior to intermission, but he went 7-of-12 for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) afterward. Foles, whose final numbers were 11-of-22 for 179 yards, fired his 1 aerial score to DeSean Jackson (4-59), while Riley Cooper (3-74) paced the team in receiving.    While the Eagles made great adjustments to the weather, the Lions were shell shocked throughout. The receivers continued to drop passes, while Stafford kept struggling with botched snaps. Stafford had an awful statistical outing, finishing 10-of-25 for 148 yards. He completed passes to just 4 players, 2 of whom were receivers. "

   "comment":"Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

   "comment":"Stafford threw an interception into double coverage while targeting Megatron in the second half. - Kelvin Benjamin made an impressive, 1.handed catch along the sideline during 1 of Carolina's scoring drives. However, it appeared as though his hand touched out of bounds before his knee hit down. Jim Caldwell was unable to challenge the play because he was taking a nap. - The Lions sacked Cam Newton as the Panthers were trying to run out the clock. However, Detroit was whistled for tripping, giving Carolina a first down. Detroit made more mistakes and nearly was guilty of several others, including 1 play where Donkey Kong Suh hit Newton after the whistle blew. It was a miracle Suh wasn't penalized. Suh was able to make some nice plays, like disrupting a Newton pass on a third down early on. However, Newton had the last laugh with a very impressive performance, going 22-of-34 for 281 yards and a touchdown. He suffered a bit of a scare in the second half when he landed awkwardly on the side of his knee when he fell short of the goal line. He limped around after the play, but seemed fine afterward.    Newton targeted Greg Olsen and Benjamin more than anyone, as the 2 saw 8 balls each. Olsen was great, logging 6 receptions for 72 yards. Benjamin hauled in just 2 passes for 46 yards, but had that aforementioned, awesome sideline snag. He almost caught a touchdown in the first half, but could only get 1 foot down inbounds. He dropped 3 passes as well, unfortunately.    DeAngelo Williams was out, so Jonathan Stewart started and got almost all of the workload. However, all he could muster was 37 yards on 15 carries, and most of his yardage came on just 1. powerful, 22-yard attempt. Stewart did score a touchdown to help his 5 fantasy owners out there.    As for Stafford, he went 27-of-48 for 291 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. Without Greg Hardy out of the lineup, Stafford had a clean pocket to start the game. However, the Panthers managed to get pressure on him as the afternoon progressed, ultimately notching 4 sacks. As you can imagine, Stafford targeted Calvin Johnson more than anyone, but Megatron managed just 6 grabs for 83 yards. Bell tied his reception lead and accumulated 61 yards. "

   "comment":"Stafford used a variety of weapons to score on New York, while the Lions' defensive had no problems showing that Geno Smith is just a backup-caliber quarterback. The score doesn't indicate how the Lions controlled this game and out-played New York decisively in every phase of the game. I'm sure New York considered benching Smith, but the team doesn't have a good alternative, as Michael Vick is declining athletically and looks completely checked out, happy to cash the checks for not playing.    The Jets actually got on the board first - via a field goal - as they went on a 14-play drive that was led by Chris Ivory posting 51 yards on 9 carries. Stafford responded with a 35-yard pass to Golden Tate to set up a 51-yard field goal from new kicker Alex Henery."

   "comment":"Stafford era, and this loss epitomized the team's struggles following either big or multiple victories. People are going to focus on the kicker, and rightfully so; if the Lions drilled most of their field goals, they probably would've prevailed. Instead, Alex Henery whiffed on all 3 of his tries. His first doinked off the upright, while the third, a potential game-winner, wasn't even close. I've constantly asked why the Lions haven't brought back Kickalicious, but there is a better option available now in the wake of Dennver inexplicably getting rid of Matt Prater. The Lions will be making a huge mistake if they don't sign him by Monday afternoon. Having said that, the Lions wouldn't have needed those field goals if they didn't commit their other unforced errors. For instance... - Matthew Stafford threw a terrible interception. The pass was way behind "

The Vikings were limited to double-digit net yardage until garbage time and averaged a pathetic 3.4 yards per play. They didn't offer any sort of challenge, allowing Detroit to coast to an easy victory. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this game was that the Lions still have kicking issues. Matt Prater was signed this week, but converted on just 1 of 3 attempts. One whiff was excusable, as it was no good from 50, but he also misfired from 44. On the bright side, he drilled a 52-yard try, and it should be noted that there were 17-mph winds gusting in Minnesota. Prater deserves another chance, though it has to be disheartening that Detroit kickers are now a combined 5-of-15 on the year. The Curse of Kickalicious?    Detroit was luckily able to find the end zone twice. Stafford, missing both Megatron and Reggie Bush, went 19-of-33 for 185 yards and a touchdown.

Brees finished 28-of-45 for 342 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He hit some impressive throws, but also missed some routine 1.. He was just 3-of-14 and the pick in the 4.h quarter. Brees probably would've done better if Jimmy Graham had actually contributed instead of served as a mere decoy. Graham saw action - he was even on the field during the first drive - but he didn't log a single reception. He was targeted twice.    Brees' big receivers were Marques Colston (6-111), who finally produced after doing nothing this season, and Kenny Stills (5-103, TD). Brandin Cooks had a disappointing outing, catching just 2 passes for 23 yards.    The Saints didn't run the ball very well. The Lions have a monstrous ground defense, so that's part of the reason. The other is that Mark Ingram did nothing outside of a 14-yard burst, gaining just 16 yards on 10 attempts. Khiry Robinson (3-26) lost a fumble near midfield and barely did anything after that.    Before moving on to the Lions, I need to mention that the Saints sustained numerous injuries. Pierre Thomas (6-13) left the game with a shoulder. Center Jonathan Goodwin was gone with a leg issue. Brodrick Bunkley was knocked out with a concussion. Glenn Foster exited with a knee.    As for Detroit, Stafford had to once again perform without his top weapon. He had some issues early on when he telegraphed an interception, which led to a New Orleans touchdown. Stafford threw a second pick later, but that was a pass that popped out of his receiver's hands. Stafford missed some other passes that he should have converted, but ultimately led his team into the end zone with a game-winning score to "

   "comment":"Stafford drove the team into field goal range, thanks in part to a great, 1.handed catch by Theo Riddick. The Lions strangely opted to run the time out, settling for a 43-yard field goal despite their horrible kicking issues this year. They naturally missed the kick, but their own delay-of-game penalty negated the whiff. Matt Prater got another chance from 48 yards and improbably connected. The Lions prevailed, but their issues are still prevalent. They barely try some weeks, and regardless of whether they do or not, they commit dumb errors like having a delay of game during a game-winning kicking try. Their offensive line sucked. In addition to allowing Atlanta's anemic pass rush to apply pressure, they were guilty of holds and blindside blocks to nullify big gains.    Matthew Stafford was especially terrible, at least prior to the game-winning drive. He went 24-of-47 for 325 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that he forced into triple coverage. The completion percentage is an indicator of what sort of day it was. He was horribly inaccurate, throwing behind and way past his receivers on numerous occasions. Granted, he didn't have Calvin Johnson, Reggie Bush or any of his tight ends at his disposal, but that shouldn't have affected his accuracy. He nearly had 2 other picks. One occurred when "

   "comment":"Stafford had a fantastic outing. He misfired on just 8 attempts, going 26-of-34 for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was great in the pocket; on 1 instance, he avoided a couple of sacks and completed a pass for a decent gain. And, as the completion percentage indicates, he was highly accurate, particularly on passes to Calvin Johnson, whom the Buccaneers inexplicably single-covered on some occasions. Stafford did get lucky on 1 of his scores though, as a pass of his doinked off a helmet. An aware "

   "comment":"Stafford fired a pass toward Brandon Pettigrew. The tight end was clearly interfered with by linebacker Anthony Hitchens, as the 2 announcers plus Mike Pereira pointed out. The flag was thrown, and official Pete Morelli announced that there was pass interference. At that moment, Dez Bryant ran onto the field without his helmet on, which was going to be a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. And then the crowd began cheering. That's because Morelli told the fans that there was no flag for pass interference. He didn't give an explanation to the crowd or Jim Caldwell. He simply picked up the flag after making the initial announcement. Pereira was so flabbergasted that he was speechless. There's never been anything like this in recent NFL history, and the poor Lions couldn't have done anything about it, as Morelli was likely signaled by the league office to disallow the call, given that the NFL wanted a matchup between Green Bay and Dallas next week for ratings purposes. Thus, it was no surprise that the Cowboys got all of the penalties from that point on. Following a 10-yard shank by the punter, Dallas drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown, with the assistance of 2 crucial defensive flags that kept the possession alive. I hope the league compensates the Lions in some way because they were epically screwed by some of the worst officiating in NFL history. Detroit should've had the ball on the Dallas 19-yard line with the potential to go up 2 scores; instead, all a teary-eyed Caldwell could do was mutter not good enough during the post-game press conference.    I suppose Romo deserves some credit for that game-winning drive. He got a ton of help from the officials and the league office, but he didn't choke for a change. The forces around him didn't allow him to gag, but he still played fairly well when he needed to. He finished 19-of-31 for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns despite the fact that he was sacked 6 times. Ndamukong Suh and Detroit's fierce pass rush had their way with Jerry Jones' heralded offensive line, disrupting plenty of drives. The Lions were so dominant in the trenches early on that they limited the Cowboys to just 6 first downs in the opening half. Both of Romo's touchdowns went to Terrance Williams. The initial score gave the Cowboys some life early on; they had 80 yards of offense in the first half otherwise. Williams benefited from Cassius Vaughn falling down and James Ihedigbo taking a bad angle. The second touchdown, which sealed the victory, came after Williams dropped a score. Williams wouldn't have needed that touchdown if Romo hadn't missed an open Gavin Escobar a play earlier. Romo missed some other targets throughout the afternoon, and he also was strip-sacked. Luckily for him, 1 of his teammates pounced on the ball.    If you're wondering about Dez Bryant, the Lions did a great job of smothering him. Bryant was limited to just 3 catches for 48 yards, and most of that came on a 43-yard reception, which happened because he was matched up on linebacker DeAndre Levy. Bryant fumbled early on when Rashean Mathis leveled him with a huge hit, but again, Dallas recovered the loose football.    The Lions had the top run defense in the NFL, so it's not a surprise that they limited DeMarco Murray to just 75 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. Murray did nothing early - 30 yards in the first half - but he finally broke free for an 18-yard burst when the Lions were up 20-10.    Detroit's offense, meanwhile, was hot early with 14 first-quarter points. The Lions were able to go up big early because of a 51-yard Golden Tate touchdown reception and a 99-yard drive comprised of a running-into-the-punter penalty, a Stafford scramble for a first down, and some nice runs by Joique Bell and Reggie Bush."

Seriously, how in the world did this miserable Detroit squad not commit any turnovers prior to the Calvin Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable.    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson."

   "comment":"Stafford use up some of these turnovers in the Monday night game? Seriously, how in the world did this miserable Detroit squad not commit any turnovers prior to the Calvin Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable.    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson."

His bomb to Megatron at the end for 57 yards was a thing of beauty, and he was effective moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite being pressured quite a bit. The offensive line was up to its usual tricks, even somehow surrenderng a sack on a third-and-1. However, the Lions still were able to rack up a whopping 547 net yards of offense.    Johnson came alive after struggling in the first 5 games. He caught 6 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown, highlighted by that 57-yard grab that set up the game-winning field goal. With some soft defenses on the horizon, Johnson should continue to be very productive.    Stafford's 4 scores all went to different players. Besides Johnson, those were "

   "comment":"Stafford had major problems connecting with Calvin Johnson, as the Rams had Trumaine Johnson blanket him. This was unusual for Gregg Williams' defense, but it worked perfectly. Johnson, 1 of the top cornerbacks in the NFL, smothered Megatron. With poor protection and no top option at his disposal, Stafford struggled. His final numbers look good - he went 30-of-46 for 245 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but much of that came in garbage time. By halftime, Stafford was 12-of-17 for 99 yards and a pick-six, which was a telegraphed ball to Megatron that Johnson picked off.    Megatron, who couldn't get open whatsoever against Johnson, caught just 1 of the 5 targets thrown to him for 16 yards. He was guilty of a brutal drop as well. "

The Bears had no answer for him, as he secured 10 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown. Stafford and Johnson connected on a beautiful back-shoulder connection in the first half. Stafford, meanwhile, went 28-of-39 for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Bears couldn't do anything to stop him, especially during the latter stages of the second half. They need to improve their linebacking corps and pass rush this offseason. Adding another cornerback wouldn't hurt either.    With Megatron dominating all of the targets, no other Lion registered more than 49 receiving yards. Thus, it was a disappointing showing by "

Eric Ebron, meanwhile, dropped a pass on third down, committed a false start, missed a block and appeared to give up on a play late in the game. He's been a colossal bust and will need to be replaced soon. Stafford struggled as a result of some of his horrible teammates, and the offensive line didn't help matters, surrendering a ton of pressure to a defense in shambles. Stafford finished 23-of-36 for 213 yards and 2 interceptions. His second pick occurred late in desperation time.    "

One incompletion was a drop by Andre Roberts in the red zone. Stafford also had a nifty 14-yard scramble in the opening half to help move the chains. His 1 real blemish on the afternoon was a lost fumble that set the Eagles up in scoring territory. Fortunately for Stafford, his defense was able to limit Philadelphia to just a field goal.

   "comment":"Stafford to keep the Texans in sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Detroit was dropped to .500, but still remains in the NFC wild-card race.    To start the first quarter, the Lions had a drive into Houston territory, but Matt Prater missed a 49-yard field goal. The Texans got moving after that with Oswieler hitting passes to DeAndre Hopkins and C.J. Fiedorowicz, plus converting a third-and-10 to Ryan Griffin for a first-and-goal. Osweiler hit Fiedorowicz for the score and a quick lead. The Lions went 3.and-out, and Osweiler continued to rip the ball through the Detroit secondary using his tight end and Hopkins making a beautiful 1.handed catch to move the ball to the 1-yard line. From there, Lamar Miller scored to give Houston a 14-0 lead. A Jadeveon Clowney sack led to a punt that set up the Texans in Lions territory with 80 seconds remaining in the half. However, Osweiler threw an interception to Johnson Bademosi. It was really the only bad play of the game for Osweiler and was a nice move by Bademosi. Stafford responded by moving the ball into the Texans' territory with a 33-yard pass to Eric Ebron, and this time, Prater was good on a 47-yarder to cut the lead to 14-3 at the half."

   "comment":"Stafford has been enjoying a terrific season and has even been worthy of MVP discussion. Going into this game, he hadn't thrown an interception since Week 9. That all changed, as Stafford struggled to throw the ball versus the Bears. Stafford banged his hand on a Chicago player in the first quarter, and he had to wear a glove on his right hand the rest of the afternoon. The hand injury gave him major problems, especially in the second half. Stafford, however, came up big when it mattered most. Stafford's second half was a mess, as he went just 5-of-10 for 47 yards following intermission. His first interception was thrown into the end zone on a deflection, which wasn't really his fault, but his other pick was; he telegraphed the throw to "

   "comment":"Stafford came into this game with a dislocated middle finger, but that was not the reason the Lions lost this game. There were numerous factors, including injuries to a pair of defensive backs, Darius Slay and Rafael Bush; a Zach Zenner lost fumble inside the New York 5-yard line; and a complete lack of a running game. The latter was not expected, but then again, it was pretty surprising that the Giants were able to rush it so well themselves. New York's ground attack has been dormant all year, and Detroit's run defense has held up well throughout 2016 for the most part, so it was so surprising that Rashad Jennings and Paul Perkins moved the ball so well throughout the afternoon. This allowed Eli Manning to operate in short-yardage situations to avoid Detroit pass-rushers Ziggy Ansah and Kerry Hyder, who had great matchups versus a pair of weak New York offensive tackles. So what happened? Well, the return of stud guard Justin Pugh certainly helped. Pugh has been out since leaving the game in Week 9, and his return was evident on the stat sheet; Paul Perkins gained 56 yards on 11 carries. Rashad Jennings didn't fare as well (18-38), but he had some minimal gains at the very end affecting that average. It seemed like the Giants were able to rip off 5 or 6 yards on every carry in the opening half. This allowed Eli Manning to complete all but 2 passes prior to halftime. Manning wasn't as effective following intermission, as the Giants put together just 1 positive drive. That happened to clinch the spread victory; Manning took advantage of Slay's absence by connecting to Odell Beckham Jr. on a third-and-10, moving the chains and ultimately setting up the covering touchdown with a 1.handed Beckham grab. Manning finished 20-of-28 for 201 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was just 6-of-12 for 74 yards and a score following intermission, but as mentioned, Manning was able to put together a successful drive to put the game out of reach. The improved protection and the absence of Slay proved to be the difference.    Beckham caught 6 of his 8 targets for 64 yards and a touchdown. His score was awesome, as it was a 1.handed extended grab. Slay had been matched up on Beckham on most plays when he was in the game, but that didn't end up lasting very long, as Slay hurt his hamstring. Sterling shepard (4-56) also caught a touchdown.    As for Stafford, I mentioned earlier that his finger wasn't that much of a factor. I only saw 1 poor throw affected by the finger, as he tossed the ball into the ground when he had "
