   "comment":"Dunlap scooped up the ball for the Bengals and ran it back for a touchdown. Cincinnati covered because of that score. It was bizarre. There was no reason for Garcon to do this. Had he just gone down, it would have been a 2nd-and-5 at his own 38 with about 2:10 remaining. Garcon just had a brain fart, and it cost Indianapolis bettors.    That play ruined a solid game for Garcon, who caught 8 balls for 52 yards. "

   "comment":"Dunlap) and forced him into 2 fumbles. The third San Diego gaffe was Norv Turner's unwillingness to go for it on 2 4.h-and-goal situations inside the 2-yard line. He was ultra conservative both times and settled for a pair of field goals. The Chargers had nothing to lose, so why not try to get into the end zone? A touchdown would have energized the team. At the very worst, a failed attempt would have pinned Cincinnati's offense near its own goal line. The 4.h mistake the Chargers made was their usual unforced errors. For instance, they had consecutive false starts on the final drive of the first half. They allowed the Bengals to convert an early 4th-and-9 because of a holding penalty.

   "comment":"Dunlap and Jaguars punter Bryan Anger had his second consecutive punt blocked, which Taylor Mays turned into a safety. Cincinnati could have broken the game open as Bortles had another interception dropped; this time by linebacker Emmanuel Lamur before the half. In the third quarter, Dalton went right back to Sanu for a 36-yard reception to the 11-yard line. Sanu (4-95) ran a great route and beat safety Josh Evans for the ball. Hill finished the drive with a short touchdown run. The Jaguars answered with Bortles throwing a 40-yard touchdown to Allen Hurns. Hurns had a step on Leon Hall, but the ball was underthrown, and Hurns had to adjust to make the reception in front of Hall. Dalton helped the Jaguars out with a poorly thrown ball that was picked off by Sherrod Martin. The Bengals' defense came up with a stop despite, once again, dropping an interception. That near-turnover was around Jacksonville's 20-yard line. Pacman Jones then returned a punt 31 yards to set up a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Green (3-44). Jacksonville fought back with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Hurns (7-112). He made a great adjustment to outfight Terrance Newman for the ball in the front of the end zone. In response, Dalton had a ball slip out of his hands, and linebacker J.T. Thomas III intercepted the ball after it ping-ponged off a helmet. A couple of plays later, Robinson (17-94) ran the ball into the end zone to close the lead to 3. Just seconds later though, Hill ripped off a 60-yard touchdown run. Hurns then bailed out Bortles with a great catch over Hall to move the ball into Cincinnati territory, but Bortles' poor decisions came back to bite the Jaguars, as he threw a pass into a crowd of defenders in the end zone for an interception by George Iloka. That clinched the game for Cincinnati.    Bortles completed 22-of-33 passes for 247 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He really should have thrown 3 or 4 interceptions and has to improve his decision-making.    Dalton completed 19-of-31 passes for 233 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also had bouts where he was careless with the football.    The real star of the game was Hill, as he ripped off 154 yards on 24 carries with 2 touchdowns in his first NFL start. With Hill running that well, Cincinnati may decide to hold out Gio Bernard (hip) again on Thursday night.    Defensively, Iloka played well for the Bengals. Dunlap got steady pressure on Bortles, while Margus Hunt beat Luke Joeckel for a sack on the final play of the game."

The Eagles finally got on the board as Zach Ertz was wide open in busted coverage for a short touchdown. Bennie Logan forced a fumble from Rex Burkhead, and Philadelphia recovered the ball. Wentz threw into a crowd of defenders, however, and after being juggled around, Shawn Williams corraled the ball for an interception. After a punt, Philadelphia had a 15-play drive that ended with a short touchdown run for Darren Sproles (7-14-1, 6-35). The Bengals got too cute after that, throwing a pass to tackle Jake Fisher, and he fumbled the ball away to Philadelphia. The Eagles were set up close to midfield down 15 with 6 minutes remaining. However, Burfict made a great play to intercept Wentz and slam the door for Cincinnati.    Dalton completed 23-of-31 passes for 332 yards with 2 touchdowns. LaFell led the Bengals in receiving with 5 receptions for 95 yards and a score.    Wentz was 36-of-60 for 308 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Ertz had 9 receptions for 79 yards and a score.    Burfict had a tremendous game with 15 tackles and 2 interceptions. The Bengals' defensive line dominated the Eagles' offensive front. Carlos Dunlap was constantly making his presence felt, while Geno Atkins embarrassed Brandon Brooks on some plays."

He made a fantastic play, deflecting a pass at the line of scrimmage - an ability he led in last season - and then making the interception before returned it for the game-winning touchdown. It was a play you watch football for. This was a hard-fought game by 2 not-great football teams, but an extremely enjoyable game, which you can't always say when 2 2.win teams meet.    The Colts will stay on the road and head to Houston, who just lost an extremely close game in Seattle. That game will take a monumental effort by the Indianaplis to come out on top.    The Bengals stay on the road and head to Jacksonville, which is a different and better team than the 1 they've beaten 4 times in a row.   "
