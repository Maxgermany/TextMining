   "comment":"Carlos Dunlap scooped up the ball for the Bengals and ran it back for a touchdown. Cincinnati covered because of that score. It was bizarre. There was no reason for Garcon to do this. Had he just gone down, it would have been a 2nd-and-5 at his own 38 with about 2:10 remaining. Garcon just had a brain fart, and it cost Indianapolis bettors.    That play ruined a solid game for Garcon, who caught 8 balls for 52 yards. "

  "comment":"Carlos Dunlap took it upon himself to win the game for Cincinnati. He made a fantastic play, deflecting a pass at the line of scrimmage - an ability he led in last season - and then making the interception before returned it for the game-winning touchdown. It was a play you watch football for. This was a hard-fought game by 2 not-great football teams, but an extremely enjoyable game, which you can't always say when 2 2.win teams meet.    The Colts will stay on the road and head to Houston, who just lost an extremely close game in Seattle. That game will take a monumental effort by the Indianaplis to come out on top.    The Bengals stay on the road and head to Jacksonville, which is a different and better team than the 1 they've beaten 4 times in a row.   ",
