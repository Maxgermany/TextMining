   "comment":"Carlos Dunlap scooped up the ball for the Bengals and ran it back for a touchdown. Cincinnati covered because of that score. It was bizarre. There was no reason for Garcon to do this. Had he just gone down, it would have been a 2nd-and-5 at his own 38 with about 2:10 remaining. Garcon just had a brain fart, and it cost Indianapolis bettors.    That play ruined a solid game for Garcon, who caught 8 balls for 52 yards. "

   "comment":"Carlos Dunlap) and forced him into 2 fumbles. The third San Diego gaffe was Norv Turner's unwillingness to go for it on 2 4.h-and-goal situations inside the 2-yard line. He was ultra conservative both times and settled for a pair of field goals. The Chargers had nothing to lose, so why not try to get into the end zone? A touchdown would have energized the team. At the very worst, a failed attempt would have pinned Cincinnati's offense near its own goal line. The 4.h mistake the Chargers made was their usual unforced errors. For instance, they had consecutive false starts on the final drive of the first half. They allowed the Bengals to convert an early 4th-and-9 because of a holding penalty. They gave Cincinnati a free first down because of a "

   "comment":"Carlos Dunlap, and the fluttering ball was intercepted by Vontaze Burfict. Dalton then used Tyler Boyd (4-66) to turn the give-away into 3 more points and a 29-0 lead. The Eagles finally got on the board as Zach Ertz was wide open in busted coverage for a short touchdown. Bennie Logan forced a fumble from Rex Burkhead, and Philadelphia recovered the ball. Wentz threw into a crowd of defenders, however, and after being juggled around, Shawn Williams corraled the ball for an interception. After a punt, Philadelphia had a 15-play drive that ended with a short touchdown run for Darren Sproles (7-14-1, 6-35). The Bengals got too cute after that, throwing a pass to tackle Jake Fisher, and he fumbled the ball away to Philadelphia. The Eagles were set up close to midfield down 15 with 6 minutes remaining. However, Burfict made a great play to intercept Wentz and slam the door for Cincinnati.    Dalton completed 23-of-31 passes for 332 yards with 2 touchdowns. LaFell led the Bengals in receiving with 5 receptions for 95 yards and a score.    Wentz was 36-of-60 for 308 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Ertz had 9 receptions for 79 yards and a score.    Burfict had a tremendous game with 15 tackles and 2 interceptions. The Bengals' defensive line dominated the Eagles' offensive front. Carlos Dunlap was constantly making his presence felt, while Geno Atkins embarrassed Brandon Brooks on some plays."

   "comment":"Carlos Dunlap took it upon himself to win the game for Cincinnati. He made a fantastic play, deflecting a pass at the line of scrimmage - an ability he led in last season - and then making the interception before returned it for the game-winning touchdown. It was a play you watch football for. This was a hard-fought game by 2 not-great football teams, but an extremely enjoyable game, which you can't always say when 2 2.win teams meet.    The Colts will stay on the road and head to Houston, who just lost an extremely close game in Seattle. That game will take a monumental effort by the Indianaplis to come out on top.    The Bengals stay on the road and head to Jacksonville, which is a different and better team than the 1 they've beaten 4 times in a row.   "
