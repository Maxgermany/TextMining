   "comment":"Laveranues Coles says. Coles caught 1 pass for 5 yards.    Speaking of Pennington, I have to laugh at everyone who took the Dolphins simply because Pennington knew the Jets' defense. Hey, you can teach a 12-year-old girl New York's offense, and she wouldn't be able to beat them.

Not a poor performance by any means, but a ton of short throws, which would explain his average 5.8 YPA. Pennington began the game 1-of-6 for minus-one yards.    It should be noted that Pennington had 2 scrambles for first downs called back by a pair of "
