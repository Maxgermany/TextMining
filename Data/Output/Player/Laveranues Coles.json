   "comment":"Laveranues Coles says. Coles caught 1 pass for 5 yards.    Speaking of Pennington, I have to laugh at everyone who took the Dolphins simply because Pennington knew the Jets' defense. Hey, you can teach a 12-year-old girl New York's offense, and she wouldn't be able to beat them.

Not a poor performance by any means, but a ton of short throws, which would explain his average 5.8 YPA. Pennington began the game 1-of-6 for minus-one yards.    It should be noted that Pennington had 2 scrambles for first downs called back by a pair of "

   "comment":"Laveranues Coles. Cincinnati also botched a field goal attempt on an errant snap.    Palmer was 21-of-33 for 247 yards and 2 picks (1 was on a Hail Mary). Those numbers aren't very impressive, but once again, Palmer suffered through 7 drops.    Cedric Benson, 1 of my fantasy sleepers, was 1 of the few Bengals who did not disappoint. Benson rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. He also had 4 receptions for 32 more yards.    Chad Ochocinco caught 5 balls for 89 yards, but Cincinnati's team-leader in receptions was Andre Caldwell, who had 6 grabs for 54 yards. Both Chris Henry and Laveranues Coles caught 1 pass each. Another few outings like this, and the Bengals should consider cutting Coles.   "
