   "comment":"Ben Watson lost the ball on an unforced fumble. On the next possession, center Dan Koppen snapped the ball before Matt Cassel was ready, resulting in a 20-yard loss. When the Patriots retained possession for the third time in the second half, Jabar Gaffney dropped an easy 20-yard catch on third down. And later on, Cassel overthrew a wide-open Randy Moss, who was streaking toward the end zone.    Despite that overthrow, Cassel had an incredible game. By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and 3 touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting 8 times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, "

Speaking of Watson, his ridiculous output came out of nowhere. Watson caught a whopping 10 balls for 127 yards and a touchdown. Yes, Ben Watson! It was amazing, as the Falcons didn't understand how to cover him. The Saints repeatedly beat the Falcons with the same crossing route. It's astonishing that Atlanta didn't know how to adjust to this.    The Saints' other pass-catchers disappointed their fantasy owners, but they didn't play poorly. "
