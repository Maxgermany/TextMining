   "comment":"Watson lost the ball on an unforced fumble. On the next possession, center Dan Koppen snapped the ball before Matt Cassel was ready, resulting in a 20-yard loss. When the Patriots retained possession for the third time in the second half, Jabar Gaffney dropped an easy 20-yard catch on third down. And later on, Cassel overthrew a wide-open Randy Moss, who was streaking toward the end zone.    Despite that overthrow, Cassel had an incredible game. By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and 3 touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting 8 times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, "

On the final drive of the game for Cleveland, McCoy got his act together and moved the ball down the field with Cleveland down 6 by dinking and dunking. He completed 9-of-13 passes on the drive. McCoy capped the possession off with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Massaquoi who beat Wilson. The score put Cleveland up by 1 with a minute remaining. For the game, McCoy was 19-of-39 for 210 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Montario Hardesty was the lead back as Peyton Hllis was out of the game due to illness. Hardesty ran hard and averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He totaled 67 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 19 yards. Watson led Cleveland in receiving with 5 receptions for 64 yards. Cribbs had 3 catches for 49 yards with a score. Massaquoi had 2 receptions for 26 yards and a score, but was covered well for most of the game by Vontae Davis.    Miami turned McCoy's first quarter interception into a touchdown on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Thomas. The Dolphins executed a screen pass well and Thomas coasted into the end zone.    "
