   "comment":"Greg Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route.Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1.handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1. 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

Nelson, completely aware of the rules when McCarthy inexplicably wasn't, quickly snatched the flag off the ground and stuffed it into his pants.

He couldn't hold on to the ball in the first quarter - it was 1 of those process of the catch things that screwed him in Week 1 a few seasons ago - and he later couldn't get a second foot inbounds when hauling in a potential touchdown.    Bush also lost 2 touchdowns. Both missed opportunities came on reviews. He was otherwise brilliant, collecting 90 rushing yards (21 carries) and 101 receiving yards (4 catches). He did manage to score once. Bush dislocated his thumb in this game, but said that he's fine.    Save for an interception on a tipped pass, Stafford was outstanding. He went 28-of-43 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He distributed the ball evenly, with 6 Lions catching at least 3 balls. Stafford's scores went to Bush and undrafted rookie tight end "

Bridgewater, who finished 15-of-26 for 157 yards, with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, managed to complete just 4 passes after halftime, however. Pass protection was a huge issue, as Matt Kalil was once again anemic. It looked like he just stopped blocking Buffalo linemen in some instances. He surrendered multiple sacks, which disrupted a couple of promising drives. He also negated a Bridgewater 15-yard completion to Chase Ford with an illegal-hands-to-the-face infraction, and he followed that up by surrendering a sack to Jerry Hughes. It's amazing how terrible Kalil has gotten. He needs to be benched.    Bridgewater's sole score, as mentioned, went to Patterson, who managed to catch just 2 passes for 9 yards.

   "comment":"Greg Jennings (6-76) was the only Viking with more receiving yardage than Ford. He should've picked up a defensive pass interference, but there was no call even though he was being tackled before the ball reached him.    Meanwhile, Patterson failed to do anything all afternoon, reeling in just 1 of his 7 targets for 9 yards. As mentioned, Patterson's struggles weren't really his fault (excluding a drop); Bridgewater just couldn't connect with him on some potential big plays downfield. Bridgewater will need to convert those passes if he wants to take the next step.    Before moving on to the Redskins, I have to say that I feel sorry for "

He mustered just 36 yards on 11 carries, though he did score a touchdown. He did something stupid on the final drive, flopping forward for a 9-yard gain instead of running out of bounds.

Most of his throws were accurate, and he showed nice velocity and touch on his passes. Bridgewater finished 17-of-25 for 209 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception.
