   "comment":"Jennings. Calvin Johnson. Ryan Grant. Jahvid Best... Yeah, not so much. The Lions were already missing their top 2 quarterbacks, while the Packers had to use backup, Matt Flynn, because Aaron Rodgers suffered a concussion in the second quarter when he was hit in the head while going to the ground. Rodgers finished the game 7-of-11 for 46 yards and an interception that wasn't his fault (Jennings dropped a perfect pass). This is a shame for all Rodgers owners whose fantasy season was ruined because of the injury.    The Packers had just 2 first downs in the opening half. Matt Flynn was half-decent at times, but made many poor throws. He finished 15-of-26 for 177 yards and an interception. Flynn will look better next Sunday with a full week's worth of first-team reps.    Green Bay could not run the ball whatsoever, which is disappointing because rookie back "

   "comment":"Jennings fumble. The second was a kickoff returned for a touchdown. And the third came in garbage time. As great as Aaron Rodgers was, the defense was a major part of why this was a massive blowout.    Matt Ryan had no chance. He was sacked 5 times and intercepted twice by Tramondous Williams (1 returned for a score). Ryan finished 20-of-29 for 186 yards, 1 touchdown, the 2 picks and a lost fumble. Atlanta's front office will need to add weapons around Ryan this offseason; aside from Roddy White, he has nothing. And that includes Tony Gonzalez. He's done. The 1 bad thing about watching Green Bay win was witnessing the end of Tony Gonzalez's career. Gonzalez, a complete shell of his former self, caught just 1 pass for 7 yards. Though he'll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Gonzalez has never won a playoff game.    The Falcons became the third No. 1 seed in the NFC to lose in the divisional round in the past 4 years. The previous 2 No. 1 seeds - 2007 Cowboys, 2008 Giants - failed to make the playoffs the following season.    As for the Packers, Rodgers was nearly perfect. He went 31-of-36 for 366 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 pass, 1 rush). Rodgers now has 12 touchdowns in his first 3 playoff starts - the most by any quarterback in such a span; the previous record-holder was Daryle Lamonica (10). Rodgers converted third downs all night, showcasing his trademark ability to elude pass-rushers in the pocket and extend plays. Troy Aikman said that Rodgers would be his first choice at quarterback if he were starting a franchise from scratch.    Three Packers had at least 6 receptions: Greg Jennings (8-101), Jordy Nelson (8-79, TD) and Donald Driver (6-76)."

   "comment":"Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1-handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1, 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

Jones' touchdown was interesting. He appeared to fumble at the goal line with Minnesota making a recovery. The replay, however, showed that he was down as he broke the plane. The play was going to be automatically reviewed because it was a turnover, but Mike McCarthy threw a red flag anyway. Nelson, completely aware of the rules when McCarthy inexplicably wasn't, quickly snatched the flag off the ground and stuffed it into his pants. This didn't get by official Mike Carey, who penalized Green Bay 15 yards for McCarthy's Jim Schwartz-like blunder. McCathy had a rough afternoon with challenges. In addition to that mistake, he lost an earlier review and then hesitated to throw a flag on a "

Mike McCarthy then opted to punt on the ensuing 4th-and-5 despite being at midfield, which I thought was a huge mistake because the Packers hadn't been close to Kaepernick all evening. Green Bay pinned the 49ers deep, but as expected, Kaepernick drove the team down 93 yards for the game-sealing score.    Both running backs looked good. Green Bay had to abandon the run because of its deficit, but DuJuan Harris managed 53 yards and a touchdown on only 11 carries. Frank Gore, meanwhile, was the beneficiary of the read-option, gaining 119 yards and a score on 23 attempts.    Gore was great, but San Francisco's top skill-position player was Michael Crabtree, who hauled in 9 receptions for 119 yards and 2 touchdowns. Meanwhile, Rodgers' 2 scores went to Greg Jennings (6-54) and James Jones (4-87)."

Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, Megatron snagged just 4 balls for 37 yards. It's a shame because he just missed out on a huge day. He couldn't hold on to the ball in the first quarter - it was 1 of those process of the catch things that screwed him in Week 1 a few seasons ago - and he later couldn't get a second foot inbounds when hauling in a potential touchdown.    Bush also lost 2 touchdowns. Both missed opportunities came on reviews. He was otherwise brilliant, collecting 90 rushing yards (21 carries) and 101 receiving yards (4 catches). He did manage to score once. Bush dislocated his thumb in this game, but said that he's fine.    Save for an interception on a tipped pass, Stafford was outstanding. He went 28-of-43 for 357 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He distributed the ball evenly, with 6 Lions catching at least 3 balls. Stafford's scores went to Bush and undrafted rookie tight end "

Pass protection was a huge issue, as Matt Kalil was once again anemic. It looked like he just stopped blocking Buffalo linemen in some instances. He surrendered multiple sacks, which disrupted a couple of promising drives. He also negated a Bridgewater 15-yard completion to Chase Ford with an illegal-hands-to-the-face infraction, and he followed that up by surrendering a sack to Jerry Hughes. It's amazing how terrible Kalil has gotten. He needs to be benched.    Bridgewater's sole score, as mentioned, went to Patterson, who managed to catch just 2 passes for 9 yards. Jennings was the team's leading receiver with 6 grabs for 77 yards.    "

   "comment":"Jennings for a couple of decent gains and moved his team well into field-goal range. He could have kept the possession going, but simply ran out of time. Part of the reason for this is because the officals screwed up on 1 play, ruling that Jennings didn't go out of bounds when he clearly did. His forward progress wasn't stopped or anything, so the refs blew it by allowing 30 or so seconds to run off the clock. Bridgewater even had to hurry as a result, and he nearly threw a pick, as his pass was dropped by a defender. Bridgewater finished 24-of-42 for 241 yards and a touchdown to Jennings (3-38). He scrambled just once for 3 rushing yards. Bridgewater isn't a running quarterback, but he can move around and do stuff with his legs, as we all saw in the Atlanta victory, so he should use more of his mobility going forward if he's too worried about taking chances downfield. Otherwise, he's just Matt Leinart.    It was nice to see "

He should've picked up a defensive pass interference, but there was no call even though he was being tackled before the ball reached him.    Meanwhile, Patterson failed to do anything all afternoon, reeling in just 1 of his 7 targets for 9 yards. As mentioned, Patterson's struggles weren't really his fault (excluding a drop); Bridgewater just couldn't connect with him on some potential big plays downfield. Bridgewater will need to convert those passes if he wants to take the next step.    Before moving on to the Redskins, I have to say that I feel sorry for "

   "comment":"Jennings dropped touchdown in the first half. Another was a near-interception returned for a touchdown by Kyle Fuller off a deflection that gave Chicago a field goal. A third was a big kickoff return that allowed Chicago to put 3 more points on the scoreboard. A fourth was an eschewed field goal at the end of the game that would've covered (or pushed) the spread. The Bears, otherwise, were outplayed by a large margin. Outside of a couple of poor passes - the aforementioned interception by Fuller and a near-pick on an attempted screen - Teddy Bridgewater had a quality performance. Most of his throws were accurate, and he showed nice velocity and touch on his passes. Bridgewater finished 17-of-25 for 209 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also picked up 14 yards on a scramble. He should've had a second score, a 35-yarder to Jennings, but the ball barely scraped the ground.    No Viking caught more than 3 passes. Jennings (3-45) was second in receiving, trailing only "
