The summary here is that New England got enough protection for Brady, thanks to the running of Ridley and Green-Ellis, who combined for 172 yards on 26 carries. Welker was the only receiver targeted, but it didn't matter because the defense couldn't stop him. As expected, Bill Belichick did not allow McFadden to beat him. He did total 123 yards on 18 touches, but 67 of that came on 2 plays and he failed to score. This is a good, not great Raider team ,and to no 1.s surprise, the Patriots were not excited about losing consecutive games.   "

The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His 6.h boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by "
