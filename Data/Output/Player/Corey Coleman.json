The Erving ejection did matter though, as the Browns scored just once in his absence. Dallas was able to rack up 4 sacks. When Cody Kessler had time in the pocket, he did an OK job. Kessler went 19-of-27 for 203 yards and a touchdown. He nearly threw a pick on an overthrow. These stats were actually not a byproduct of garbage time; Kessler was just 5-of-7 for 36 yards following intermission. He didn't get much of a chance to do anything because the Cowboys were able to grind the game out and control the clock. Dallas won the time-of-possession battle by a whopping 19 minutes, and Cleveland ran just 14 offensive plays in the second half!    As for Coleman, he wasn't much of a factor, catching 3 balls for 41 yards. "

   "comment":"Coleman, who took a big hit and held onto the ball. Thankfully for the Steelers, Antonio Brown plays for them, and his 38-yard reception on second-and-twelve from the Steelers' 18-yard-line pushed them over the top with a hard-fought win in Cleveland.    The Steelers move on to host Minnesota next week, where they will face a tougher defense and will need their running game hitting on all cylinders.    The Browns will head to Baltimore next week to take on yet another division rival and another tough defense. Kizer is going to get his trial by fire, and so far he seems up to the task.   "

   "comment":"Coleman, then heaved a poor screen pass. And if that wasn't enough, a dump-off attempt was also off the mark. The Browns are drafting a quarterback come April, and after Josh Rosen's performance against USC, it could easily be him. Check out the 2018 NFL Draft Quarterback Prospect Rankings for more.    Kizer, sadly, led the Browns in rushing with 5 scrambles for 22 yards. Isaiah Crowell found no running room versus Jacksonville's elite defense, as he was restricted to just 18 yards on 11 carries.    Coleman's return to the field was a successful 1. He caught 6 balls for 80 yards. He dropped a pass, but he would've posted a better stat line had Kizer not been guilty of the aforementioned overthrow. Duke Johnson (4-56) was the only other Cleveland player with more than 15 receiving yards.   "
