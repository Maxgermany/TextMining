Though Thigpen didn't convert, I liked the call. Why leave your fate to a coin toss and a miserable defense? Thigpen had the hot hand. And besides, it's not like Kansas City is going to the Doggone Playoff anyway. What did they have to lose?

Fortunately for the Giants, Atlanta's defense is even worse than theirs. Eli Manning easily shredded the Falcons in overtime.    Manning was great throughout this contest, going 25-of-39 for 384 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He heavily utilized Mario Manningham (6 catches, 126 yards), Steve Smith (4-79), Kevin Boss (5-76, 2 TDs) and Hakeem Nicks (5-65).    I was a bit surprised that the Giants couldn't run the ball effectively. Both Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw carried the ball 12 times, gaining 39 and 34 yards, respectively. Jacobs found the end zone in the third quarter.    Jason Snelling's production pretty much mimicked what Jacobs and Bradshaw did collectively. He compiled 76 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 carries.    As mentioned, Gonzalez (8 catches, 82 yards) caught 1 of Ryan's scores. "

Buffalo's offense couldn't do anything against Atlanta's pedestrian defense, compiling just 178 total net yards and converting only 2-of-10 third downs. Then again, the Bills were going with a practice-squad quarterback who had never attempted a single pass in the NFL, so no 1 should be surprised by this. Brian Set Up Us the Brohm was 17-of-29 for 146 yards and 2 interceptions. No wonder he was so thoughtlessly discarded by the Packers.    "

Gonzalez, a complete shell of his former self, caught just 1 pass for 7 yards. Though he'll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Gonzalez has never won a playoff game.    The Falcons became the third No. 1 seed in the NFC to lose in the divisional round in the past 4 years. The previous 2 No. 1 seeds - 2007 Cowboys, 2008 Giants - failed to make the playoffs the following season.    As for the Packers, Rodgers was nearly perfect. He went 31-of-36 for 366 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 pass, 1 rush). Rodgers now has 12 touchdowns in his first 3 playoff starts - the most by any quarterback in such a span; the previous record-holder was Daryle Lamonica (10). Rodgers converted third downs all night, showcasing his trademark ability to elude pass-rushers in the pocket and extend plays. Troy Aikman said that Rodgers would be his first choice at quarterback if he were starting a franchise from scratch.    Three Packers had at least 6 receptions: Greg Jennings (8-101), "

   "comment":"Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control. Up against it, Matt Ryan (29-of-52 351 yards 2 TD 1 INT) came out firing from the shotgun, connecting with Gonzalez (6 receptions for 71 yards) to start the drive picking up 18 yards and to finish it with a 20-yard score. New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6.point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line. Forced to third down, "

   "comment":"Gonzalez touchdown. Flynn was then pick-sixed by Sean Weatherspoon, who missed some action with a shoulder injury. The interception was a weird 1. as it bounced off linebacker Paul Worrilow's foot. Ryan, meanwhile, misfired on just 4 passes in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 85 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons were up 21-10 and appeared as though they'd cruise to victory, effectively eliminating Green Bay from playoff contention. Mike McCarthy and his coaching staff made some awesome adjustments at halftime, however, which is something I never thought I'd write. Flynn was simply unbelievable in the second half, going 10-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown. Of course, much of this can be attributed to the ineptitude of the Atlanta defense, but the important thing is that Flynn bought his team another week for Aaron Rodgers to return. With the Lions losing, Green Bay is just half a game out of the division lead. Rodgers could return next week, which would give the team a great chance to claim the NFC North.    Flynn ultimately finished 24-of-32 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. His score went to tight end Andrew Quarless, who finally came alive with 6 catches for 66 yards. Jordy Nelson (4-85) led the team in receiving, while James Jones (4-19) didn't do much.    Lacy was responsible for that aforementioned strip-sack, but he made up for it with a touchdown in the first half. However, he didn't run as well as expected, given the matchup. He managed just 65 yards on 20 carries to go along with 3 catches for 25 receiving yards. The issue was the Falcons, like the Lions, stacked the line of scrimmage and dared Flynn to throw. Flynn made them pay.    There are some new defensive concerns for the Packers. A couple of inside linebackers sustained injuries in this contest. As if things couldn't get any worse for Green Bay's stop unit.    As for Ryan, he struggled in the second half, going 11-of-22 for just 121 yards and a pick following the break, though that interception was a desperation heave at the end of the game. His supporting cast let him down (6 drops), including Tony Gonzalez (3-25, TD) who had a huge 4.h-down drop on the penultimate drive of the game. Ryan's scores went to Gonzalez and "
