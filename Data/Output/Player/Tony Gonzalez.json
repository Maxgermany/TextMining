   "comment":"Tony Gonzalez touchdown. Flynn was then pick-sixed by Sean Weatherspoon, who missed some action with a shoulder injury. The interception was a weird 1. as it bounced off linebacker Paul Worrilow's foot. Ryan, meanwhile, misfired on just 4 passes in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 85 yards and 2 scores. The Falcons were up 21-10 and appeared as though they'd cruise to victory, effectively eliminating Green Bay from playoff contention. Mike McCarthy and his coaching staff made some awesome adjustments at halftime, however, which is something I never thought I'd write. Flynn was simply unbelievable in the second half, going 10-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown. Of course, much of this can be attributed to the ineptitude of the Atlanta defense, but the important thing is that Flynn bought his team another week for Aaron Rodgers to return. With the Lions losing, Green Bay is just half a game out of the division lead. Rodgers could return next week, which would give the team a great chance to claim the NFC North.    Flynn ultimately finished 24-of-32 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick-six. His score went to tight end Andrew Quarless, who finally came alive with 6 catches for 66 yards. Jordy Nelson (4-85) led the team in receiving, while James Jones (4-19) didn't do much.    Lacy was responsible for that aforementioned strip-sack, but he made up for it with a touchdown in the first half. However, he didn't run as well as expected, given the matchup. He managed just 65 yards on 20 carries to go along with 3 catches for 25 receiving yards. The issue was the Falcons, like the Lions, stacked the line of scrimmage and dared Flynn to throw. Flynn made them pay.    There are some new defensive concerns for the Packers. A couple of inside linebackers sustained injuries in this contest. As if things couldn't get any worse for Green Bay's stop unit.    As for Ryan, he struggled in the second half, going 11-of-22 for just 121 yards and a pick following the break, though that interception was a desperation heave at the end of the game. His supporting cast let him down (6 drops), including Tony Gonzalez (3-25, TD) who had a huge 4.h-down drop on the penultimate drive of the game. Ryan's scores went to Gonzalez and "
