How could I miss that!?    The Bengals should consider cutting Perry. Seriously. Does he bring anything positive to the table? He can't run the ball (his rushing average is 2.6). He fumbles a lot (5 this year). He even drops passes (including what would have been a key first down in the Jets game).    Chad Ocho Cinco, meanwhile, was actually productive for once. He caught 5 passes for 57 yards - both numbers being season highs. "

I've lost a lot of respect for Reid for his antics today. He could have easily won this contest without utilizing QB Dog Killer. What Reid did was utterly classless, and I will vow to make fun of him more often than already do. One person on NFL.com's GameCenter stated: Hey look its the dogkiller. Only Pathetic Philadelphia Fans could support a criminal like that. Bravo.    The Falcons really had no chance here. They weren't very good with Matt Ryan at quarterback, so this was a predictable Eagles blowout. Philly led 27-0 before the starters left the game.    "

It is worth noting that 1 of those missed passes was a sweet 1.handed catch out of bounds. The offenses were moving the ball a bit in the first quarter, but the scoreboard didn't reflect it. The Rams answered by driving 58 yards with a blend of Clemens passing (33 yards), a little Jackson rushing and a personal foul penalty on Chris Crocker for roughing Dalton. The drive stalled when Jackson couldn't pick up a yard on 3rd-and-1 and was driven backwards. Josh Brown then missed a 45-yard field goal. Still, his defense picked him up. After another long gain to Green (6-115) helped put the Bengals in scoring position, Darian Stewart forced a Cedric Benson fumble which James Laurinaitis recovered to end the threat."

I listed his halftime numbers earlier; he finished 18-of-31 for 154 yards and the 2 scores. For those who don't have nifty Windows calculators, that's just 3-of-9 for 18 yards after intermission. He also had an interception nullified by a penalty.    "
