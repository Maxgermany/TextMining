How could I miss that!?    The Bengals should consider cutting Perry. Seriously. Does he bring anything positive to the table? He can't run the ball (his rushing average is 2.6). He fumbles a lot (5 this year). He even drops passes (including what would have been a key first down in the Jets game).    Chad Ocho Cinco, meanwhile, was actually productive for once. He caught 5 passes for 57 yards - both numbers being season highs. "

   "comment":"Benson, who rushed for 22 yards on 7 carries, left early with a strained hip flexor. The early prognosis looks good. Meanwhile, Troy Polamalu re-injured the left knee that he banged up in Week 1. He left in the first quarter and didn't return.    I had the Bengals at 10-6 in my season previews, but never did I imagine that they would sweep both the Ravens and Steelers. This marked the first time since 1998 that Cincinnati beat Pittsburgh twice in the same year. Amazingly, the Bengals were just 3-13 that season.    Cincinnati's defense is amazing. The Bengals... - Limited the Steelers to 226 yards. - Held Rashard Mendenhall to just 36 yards on 13 carries. - Forced Ben Roethlisberger into just 20-of-40 for 174 yards and a pick. - Sacked Roethlisberger 4 times. - Allowed no touchdowns and 4 field goals in 4 red-zone trips to the Steelers.    The Bengals like to eliminate No. 1 receivers with their bracket coverage. Santonio Holmes caught 7 balls for 88 yards (with a dropped touchdown), so it's clear that they were focusing more on Hines Ward, who had just 4 grabs for 24 yards. Heath Miller, meanwhile, had 4 catches for 26 yards.    Carson Palmer went 18-of-30 for 178 yards, but he's really lucky that he wasn't intercepted 3 times in this game, including twice on the opening drive. The Bengals came out firing - they threw on the first 5 plays - and it nearly cost them.    Chad Ochocinco didn't get a chance to pull any sort of mustard antics. Ochocinco was limited to just 2 grabs for 29 yards. Laveranues Coles led the squad with 5 receptions for 67 yards.    With Benson out, Bernard Scott got all of the work versus Pittsburgh's No."

I've lost a lot of respect for Reid for his antics today. He could have easily won this contest without utilizing QB Dog Killer. What Reid did was utterly classless, and I will vow to make fun of him more often than already do. One person on NFL.com's GameCenter stated: Hey look its the dogkiller. Only Pathetic Philadelphia Fans could support a criminal like that. Bravo.    The Falcons really had no chance here. They weren't very good with Matt Ryan at quarterback, so this was a predictable Eagles blowout. Philly led 27-0 before the starters left the game.    "

He rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, though those numbers are a bit inflated because he scored on a 39-yard scamper once he gained a first down as his team was running out the clock. The Browns quit and didn't show much interest in tackling Benson on that play.   "

It is worth noting that 1 of those missed passes was a sweet 1-handed catch out of bounds. The offenses were moving the ball a bit in the first quarter, but the scoreboard didn't reflect it. The Rams answered by driving 58 yards with a blend of Clemens passing (33 yards), a little Jackson rushing and a personal foul penalty on Chris Crocker for roughing Dalton. The drive stalled when Jackson couldn't pick up a yard on 3rd-and-1 and was driven backwards. Josh Brown then missed a 45-yard field goal. Still, his defense picked him up. After another long gain to Green (6-115) helped put the Bengals in scoring position, Darian Stewart forced a Cedric Benson fumble which James Laurinaitis recovered to end the threat."

One resulted in a touchdown, while the other led to that Doucet opportunity.    With a huge second-half lead, Dalton didn't have to do much. I listed his halftime numbers earlier; he finished 18-of-31 for 154 yards and the 2 scores. For those who don't have nifty Windows calculators, that's just 3-of-9 for 18 yards after intermission. He also had an interception nullified by a penalty.    "
