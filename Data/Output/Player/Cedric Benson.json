I've lost a lot of respect for Reid for his antics today. He could have easily won this contest without utilizing QB Dog Killer. What Reid did was utterly classless, and I will vow to make fun of him more often than already do. One person on NFL.com's GameCenter stated: Hey look its the dogkiller. Only Pathetic Philadelphia Fans could support a criminal like that. Bravo.    The Falcons really had no chance here. They weren't very good with Matt Ryan at quarterback, so this was a predictable Eagles blowout. Philly led 27-0 before the starters left the game.

The Rams answered by driving 58 yards with a blend of Clemens passing (33 yards), a little Jackson rushing and a personal foul penalty on Chris Crocker for roughing Dalton. The drive stalled when Jackson couldn't pick up a yard on 3rd-and-1 and was driven backwards. Josh Brown then missed a 45-yard field goal. Still, his defense picked him up.

   "comment":"Cedric Benson and Jermichael Finley to leg and shoulder maladies, respectively.Benson and Jermichael Finley to leg and shoulder maladies, respectively. That's why Green Bay scored just 6 second-half points after tallying 21 in the first half. The Packers led 21-3 at the break, and you have to wonder if they would've held on to that advantage if they didn't lose 3 key players to injuries.    Aaron Rodgers went 21-of-33 for 243 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception (with 57 rushing yards). It was mediocre early - he overthrew an open Jordy Nelson for a deep touchdown - and it was ugly late, as Rodgers clearly missed both Benson and Finley. The offensive line was also an issue; the Colts constantly swarmed the backfield and managed to bring down Rodgers 5 times. "
