   "comment":"Osweiler took over in mop-up duty in the final frame. It's really not fair. Manning is just way too good, and his supporting cast is far too talented. Vegas needs to start treating Denver as if it were the 2007 Patriots by posting 20-point spreads whenever the Broncos play average or worse competition.    Manning threw touchdowns to 2 players. Demaryius Thomas (8-81) and Wes Welker (7-76) each caught 2 scores. Eric Decker (5-88) and Julius Thomas (4-43) also contributed, but they'll have to wait at least 1 more week to find the end zone - though it's worth noting that Decker drew an interference flag there.    Knowshon Moreno handled most of the early workload. He gained 78 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries against a Philadelphia's poor-tackling defense that was pushed around by Denver's imposing front. Moreno's only blemish was a foolish unsportsmanlike penalty when he pushed an Eagle defender after the play was over. As for the other Denver backs, Ronnie Hillman (11-36) was the change-of-pace back, while Montee Ball didn't even see the field until there were 2 minutes remaining in the third quarter. The Broncos clearly don't trust him yet, as he pass protects poorly and 10.s to fumble the ball. Ball managed 24 yards on 8 carries, but most of that was when Osweiler was under center.    The Eagles moved the chains well in between the 20s in the first half, but sputtered in the red zone - a problem that has been prevalent for them throughout the season thus far. They settled for a pair of field goals early on, which is a recipe for disaster when Manning is scoring 7. for the opposition. Late in the first half, Philadelphia, in a 4.h-and-6, had a curious delay of game when a long field goal was possible. Kelly opted to punt the ball and did manage to pin the Broncos inside the 10. This was all for naught, however, as the Broncos were in Philadelphia territory after just 2 plays. That's the type of game this was.    QBDK went 14-of-27 for 248 yards before exiting the game in the 4.h quarter. He was solid in the first half, but the Broncos made great adjustments during the break; he was limited to just 4-of-11 passing for 78 yards after intermission. It also didn't help QBDK that "

Of course, Manning isn't nearly the same quarterback we've seen over the years, so I'm not proclaiming that Osweiler is going to be a Hall of Famer, or anything, but he at least gives the Broncos a chance to move the chains consistently. Better yet, Osweiler didn't commit any turnovers, which Manning has been guilty of throughout this season. Osweiler began the game with a scoring drive, as a 48-yard score of his was thrown to "

   "comment":"Osweiler took a sack from Alan Branch, who destroyed his center, but Denver was given new life on a defensive hold. It was more blatant than what happened to the Titans, as the New England defender actually touched Demaryius Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the 4.h horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a 4.h timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell.    Brady's 3 touchdowns were thrown to Gronkowski (6-88), Chandler (5-58), who needs to be added in all formats if Gronkowski misses time, and running back Brandon Bolden (4 catches, 84 receiving yards), who beat Danny Trevathan on a wheel route for a 63-yard score. LaFell saw 9 targets, but snatched only 4 of them for 36 yards.    The Patriots predictably struggled to run the ball against Denver's stout front. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for only 27 yards on 9 carries. There will be better days for Blount versus weaker defenses.    Brock Osweiler, meanwhile, led the Broncos to a second-consecutive victory, and he continued to look much better than Peyton Manning. Osweiler went 23-of-42 for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was batted at the line of scrimmage, but his numbers don't tell the entire story. First of all, Osweiler was hurt by countless drops. "

   "comment":"Osweiler, particularly in the second half. Khalil Mack was especially dominant. He beat both tackles on numerous occasions, notching a whopping 5 sacks and a forced fumble. He was unreal. One of the CBS announcers noted that Mack reminded him of the late Derrick Thomas. With Osweiler dealing with immense pressure, it's no surprise that he struggled. The numbers don't show it - he went 35-of-51 for 308 yards - but he did not have a good performance. He had a dropped interception early on and then missed a wide-open Virgil Green for a touchdown. After halftime, he was strip-sacked and then missed numerous targets because of the heavy pressure. The drops didn't help.    Thomas, as mentioned, struggled through a shoulder. He was fortunate early on when a tipped pass that popped high into the air landed into his arms for an inexplicable 16-yard gain. However, Thomas was ineffective after getting hurt. He finished with 10 catches for 95 yards, but dropped 3 balls and lost a fumble.    "

It was a dominant half, with the Broncos converting 8 third-down opportunities.    Former Steelers wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders must have gotten plenty of satisfaction as he scorched his old team on a 61-yard touchdown in the first quarter, and piled up yardage and receptions to finish the day with 10 receptions on 16 targets for 181 yards and that early touchdown.    The other Broncos receiver to eviscerate the Steelers secondary in the first half was Demaryius Thomas, who caught 2 touchdowns from Osweiler, to help his team out to an imposing 27-13 lead at halftime.

   "comment":"Osweiler screwed up after that, firing a careless interception in which he didn't see Jamie Collins. Following another fumbled kickoff return, the Patriots scored another quick touchdown, and just like that, it was over. Bill O'Brien, who wasted timeouts and had to be alerted by his punter to challenge a play, was outcoached by a mile in this game, and his team didn't seem ready for the big stage.    Osweiler went just 24-of-41 for 196 yards and an interception. He was hurt by some drops, but he was also bailed out with some spectacular catches by "

   "comment":"Osweiler had an extremely rough afternoon, as his passes were all over the place. He sailed balls over his receivers' heads, while other passes skipped into the turf. He had an easy pick-six that was dropped by Harrison Smith, and he also lucked out when a strip-sack was negated when Everson Griffen was whistled for being offside. Minnesota's defense has made every quarterback it has faced this season look absolutely abysmal, and Osweiler was no different. Osweiler was limited to 19-of-42 passing for 184 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. It could've been even worse for Osweiler had some Minnesota drops and penalties not negated turnovers. He had no chance versus Minnesota's defense, and sadly, his final stat line is a byproduct of garbage-time stats; midway through the third quarter, Osweiler was 11-of-28 for 93 yards and a pick.    "

His woeful numbers tell the tale, as Osweiler finished 14-of-27 for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's not a typo - in this day and age, when passing is easier than ever because bogus illegal-contact and defensive-holding penalties are called all the time, Osweiler accumulated just 99 yards. Osweiler was very underwhelming, as you might imagine. His completions were mostly dinks and dunks, and whenever he tried going deeper, he couldn't connect at all with "

On Houston's first possession of the game, Savage was drilled by Sean Spence for a strip-sack. The ball rolled into the end zone before DaQuan Jones recovered the fumble for a Titans touchdown. Midway through the first half, Savage converted a 4.h-and-1 on a quarterback sneak. The league's neurological monitors removed Savage from the game after that play, forcing him into the concussion protocol. Savage didn't act injured, but it brought Osweiler into the game for Houston. The Titans had a drive going into Houston territory before "

He spent most of the opening half throwing the ball at his receivers' feet. Following halftime, Osweiler telegraphed a pass to DeAndre Hopkins that was snatched by Devin McCourty."

He started the game poorly, throwing numerous inaccurate passes, including a terrible interception in the end zone. Osweiler threw the ball straight to Dre' Kirkpatrick, who would have run 102 yards into the end zone untouched had he not inexplicably dropped the ball just before the goal line. However, after the half, Osweiler's performance greatly improved. He still had trouble with downfield passes, often overthrowing his receivers due to a lack of touch on his passes, but his short and medium accuracy was there. Osweiler was able to keep the Broncos competitive thanks to his improved accuracy. In particular, Osweiler's touchdown pass to "
