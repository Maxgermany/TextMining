Of course, Manning isn't nearly the same quarterback we've seen over the years, so I'm not proclaiming that Osweiler is going to be a Hall of Famer, or anything, but he at least gives the Broncos a chance to move the chains consistently. Better yet, Osweiler didn't commit any turnovers, which Manning has been guilty of throughout this season. Osweiler began the game with a scoring drive, as a 48-yard score of his was thrown to "

   "comment":"Brock Osweiler took a sack from Alan Branch, who destroyed his center, but Denver was given new life on a defensive hold. It was more blatant than what happened to the Titans, as the New England defender actually touched Demaryius Thomas, but it was something that should've never been called. It was ridiculous. Official Tony Corrente, joining Walt Coleman, Jeff Triplette and Pete Morelli as the 4.h horseman of the Week 12 Officiating Apocalypse, then granted the Broncos a 4.h timeout because of an injury, yet failed to stop the clock when the Patriots were driving for a game-tying field goal. It ultimately didn't matter, as New England was able to send the game to overtime, but it was just yet another screw-up by the inept Corrente.    Brady finished 23-of-42 for 280 yards and 3 touchdowns. He didn't turn the ball over, but he nearly did when Aqib Talib dropped an interception on an overthrow to Scott Chandler. Brady played well overall, considering the heavy snowfall, corrupt officiating, struggling offensive line and depleted supporting cast. However, Brady doesn't really have anyone left. That could change if Amendola and Gronkowski return soon, but as of right now, Brady's top weapons include Chandler, Martin and Brandon LaFell.    Brady's 3 touchdowns were thrown to Gronkowski (6-88), Chandler (5-58), who needs to be added in all formats if Gronkowski misses time, and running back Brandon Bolden (4 catches, 84 receiving yards), who beat Danny Trevathan on a wheel route for a 63-yard score. LaFell saw 9 targets, but snatched only 4 of them for 36 yards.    The Patriots predictably struggled to run the ball against Denver's stout front. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for only 27 yards on 9 carries. There will be better days for Blount versus weaker defenses.    Brock Osweiler, meanwhile, led the Broncos to a second-consecutive victory, and he continued to look much better than Peyton Manning. Osweiler went 23-of-42 for 270 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was batted at the line of scrimmage, but his numbers don't tell the entire story. First of all, Osweiler was hurt by countless drops. "

   "comment":"Brock Osweiler improved to 3-0 as a starter. This win very much resembled the Broncos at the beginning of the season as their defense suffocated San Diego, while they got just enough offense to win.    To open the game, the Broncos marched down the field as Osweiler found Demaryius Thomas wide open in the end zone for a 3-yard score. That was really the only drive for Denver's offense, which totaled 293 yards on the day. Late in the first quarter, Philip Rivers was hit as he threw by Malik Jackson, and the ball floated to Danny Trevathan for an interception. Trevathan coasted into the end zone from 25 yards out. It was Rivers' 6.h pick-six of the season. Each team had a field goal drive before the half, and the Broncos took a 17-3 lead into the locker room. Early in the third quarter, Melvin Gordon had his fifth fumble of the season, which was recovered by the Broncos before they missed the field goal from 52 yards. San Diego wide receiver Malcom Floyd later fumbled the ball away after a hit from Josh Bush, and once again, Denver had great field position. Virgil Green burned Manti Te'o for 22 yards to get inside the 30 yards, but Osweiler threw a ball up for grabs in the end zone that Jason Verrett intercepted for San Diego. Both defenses shut the door, so there was no scoring in the second half.    Philip Rivers completed 18-of-35 passes for 202 yards and an interception. He was under heavy pressure from start to finish.    Melvin Gordon ran for 55 yards on 12 carries, but once again had ball-security issues. Adrian Peterson is the only back who has fumbled the ball more than Gordon than this season.    Antonio Gates led the Chargers' receivers with 6 catches for 50 yards. Both Stevie Johnson and Dontrelle Inman sustained injuries.    Brock Osweiler was 16-of-26 for 166 yards with a touchdown and 1 interception. He did a decent job of managing the game, but missed some opportunities to go vertical on San Diego.    "

In the early going, it looked like the Broncos were going to have to bench him. He started the game poorly, throwing numerous inaccurate passes, including a terrible interception in the end zone. Osweiler threw the ball straight to Dre' Kirkpatrick, who would have run 102 yards into the end zone untouched had he not inexplicably dropped the ball just before the goal line. However, after the half, Osweiler's performance greatly improved. He still had trouble with downfield passes, often overthrowing his receivers due to a lack of touch on his passes, but his short and medium accuracy was there. Osweiler was able to keep the Broncos competitive thanks to his improved accuracy. In particular, Osweiler's touchdown pass to "
