   "comment":"Marcel Reece (8-37), allowed the Raiders to re-take the lead and win their first game of the season.    Smith was very inconsistent. As mentioned, he was horrible early on. His throws were low and behind his targets, and Kansas City, as a result, averaged a hideous 3.3 yards per play during the first half. Smith, however, finished 20-of-36 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire during a portion of the second half, but his limitations were pretty prevalent on a failed final drive despite that the Raiders began celebrating early, allowing a big return and nearly getting whistled for being way offsides prior to the final play of the game.    Charles didn't have the big game everyone was expecting. He touched the ball only 23 times, which is simply unacceptable. He had 19 carries go for 80 rushing yards, but he at least scored a touchdown as a pass-catcher, logging 4 grabs for 42 receiving yards. Charles also should've drawn a pass interference in the end zone at 1 point during the second quarter, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag.    Yet another week, and yet another game in which no Kansas City wideouts scored a touchdown. "
