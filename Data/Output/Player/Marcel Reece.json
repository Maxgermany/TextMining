   "comment":"Reece was there for the recovery. Bush (19-96) picked up 14 yards on the next play to put the ball in the red zone. He also wrecked Brian Dawkins, but the grisly veteran would soon return to the game. The drive would stall from there, and Sebastian Janikowski hobbled on for a 48-yard field goal to make it 3-0. Left tackle Ryan Clady had a tough game, starting with wrecking Denver's next drive with a holding penalty leading to a quick punt. Oakland punted right back though, and Tebow really made his presence known even as the crowd chanted his name followed by a word that rhymes with ducks. He faked the handoff to McGahee, a regular play on the afternoon, and ran for 32 yards. Two plays later, he hit Eric Decker over the middle for a 27-yard touchdown and 7-3 lead. After trading punts, the Raiders got their offense in motion as the second quarter started thanks to the Broncos failing to get their punt off. Britton Colquitt wound up throwing incomplete after bumbling the snap. On third down, Palmer hit Bush who did the rest, leaping for his first career touchdown reception and the 10-7 advantage. After another Denver punt, Oakland started running Bush, 3 times in a row in fact, before a pass to Moore put them in plus territory. Then, they tested Champ Bailey and found out he is still an elite player. Bailey intercepted Palmer. In the first half, Oakland's defense was holding up and forced a quick punt. The offense showed some explosion on their next possession. Ford (5-105, TD) picked up 31 yards down the sideline at the 2.minute warning. Three plays later, Reece proved why he is the matchup nightmare, making a tough catch down the middle on a well thrown ball by Palmer for a 40-yard touchdown to give Oakland a 17-7 lead. Head coach John Fox made a regrettable call during the final drive of the half, taking points off the board when "

That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2.minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end Kellen Davis helped them reach the 6. However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage."

Rod Streater didn't find the end zone, but he led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 59 yards.    Reece predictably took a back seat with Rashad Jennings back."

His throws were low and behind his targets, and Kansas City, as a result, averaged a hideous 3.3 yards per play during the first half. Smith, however, finished 20-of-36 for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was on fire during a portion of the second half, but his limitations were pretty prevalent on a failed final drive despite that the Raiders began celebrating early, allowing a big return and nearly getting whistled for being way offsides prior to the final play of the game.    Charles didn't have the big game everyone was expecting. He touched the ball only 23 times, which is simply unacceptable. He had 19 carries go for 80 rushing yards, but he at least scored a touchdown as a pass-catcher, logging 4 grabs for 42 receiving yards. Charles also should've drawn a pass interference in the end zone at 1 point during the second quarter, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag.    Yet another week, and yet another game in which no Kansas City wideouts scored a touchdown. "
