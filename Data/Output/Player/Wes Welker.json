   "comment":"Wes Welker. But he recovered on the next drive after the Broncos drew to within 14-7, leading his team on an 8.play, 52 yard drive to give his team another 2.score advantage.    The Broncos had no answer for anything New England was doing. Bill Belichick had the genius idea to run the ball with Aaron Hernandez 5 times, and it worked as his tight end gained 61 rushing yards. Hernandez also caught 4 balls for 55 yards and a touchdown, but that paled in comparison to Rob Gronkowski's 10 receptions for 145 yards and 3 scores, which tied a postseason record. The Broncos doubled Gronkowski last time and really limited him, but they decided to play zone this time, which is a big no-no against Brady. But it's not like they could have done anything to stop New England, save for drugging Brady's offensive linemen.    The other Patriots to score touchdowns were Wes Welker (6-55) and Deion Branch (3-85)."

   "comment":"Wes Welker lost a fumble. Stephen Gostkowski missed 2 field goals - all in the first half. I was going to complain that the Patriots threw this game, but they still won, 52-28. It makes you wonder what the margin would have been if they didn't make all of those dumb mistakes early on. </i>    When New England was down 21-7 in the third quarter, it looked like a third loss in a row was possible for the Patriots, but then Tom Brady got hot and the Bills were completely dominated. Once again Brady and Belichick came away with a win when they had to have it. Buffalo jumped out a 21-7 lead after 2 Scott Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score. He beat corner Kyle Arrington and safety Patrick Chung took a bad angle. Brady answered by catching fire. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Woodhead. Brady then moved the ball with passes to Wes Welker, and the signal-caller ran the ball into end zone on a short scramble. Brady followed that by throwing a strike to Ron Gronkowski for a 28-yard score. New England ran in short touchdowns with "

   "comment":"Wes Welker, and he also caused an injury to Rob Gronkowski last year. Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots.    As for the Raven receivers, Boldin scored twice, as he finished with 5 receptions for 60 yards. He humorously stood over "

   "comment":"Wes Welker's arms. That was a chance for San Diego to get back into the game, down 14 at that point, but the Broncos maintained possession, bled the clock and pulled through with the spread-covering victory.    The Broncos were very lucky in this game, but they didn't need all of that great fortune to prevail. They were the better team on the field, outgaining San Diego by 119 net yards and averaging 1.2 more yards per play. The Chargers were competitive for a while, but Denver ultimately ran away with this victory in the second half. San Diego simply couldn't do anything about Peyton Manning. The NFL's career touchdown record-holder was an unstoppable force, going 25-of-35 for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had that 1 interception that should've stood, but was otherwise flawless. He simply took advantage of a secondary that was missing its top 2 cornerbacks. Brandon Flowers was out with a concussion, while "
