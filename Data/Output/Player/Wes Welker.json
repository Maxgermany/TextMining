   "comment":"Wes Welker 10 times for 107 yards. Randy Moss saw 5 passes come his way for 53 yards.    Surprisingly, the star for New England's offense was BenJarvus Green-Ellis. Green-Ellis, perhaps establishing himself as the team's franchise back in favor of the oft-injured Laurence Maroney, gained 105 yards on 26 carries against a stingy Buffalo rush defense.    The Bills had the dumbest 70-second sequence I've ever seen at the end of the first half. Down 10-3, they had a 4.h-and-three inside New England's 40. Instead of going for it, Buffalo punted the ball, but called a timeout first. The Bills pinned New England at the 3. but couldn't force a punt because they had just 2 timeouts. If they were going to punt, why did they call timeout? With 3 timeouts, they could have gotten the ball back with 35 seconds and good field position. Instead, time expired.    Buffalo's late second-quarter gaff wasn't the only mistake by the coaching staff. Down 10-0, the Bills reached the red zone for the first time. On third-and-four, Buffalo opted to run the ball with an ineffective Marshawn Lynch, who gained just 46 yards.    Speaking of ineffective, Trent Edwards was absolutely horrendous in this game. He was 13-of-23 for 120 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks, but those figures don't tell the whole story. Edwards missed wide-open receivers all afternoon, while his picks were very untimely; 1 led to a New England score, while the other was in Patriots territory.    With Edwards misfiring left and right, Lee Evans also struggled to put up stats, catching 2 balls for 22 yards. Roscoe Parrish led the squad with 4 receptions and 31 yards.    Parrish made a great play in this game. On third down, he caught a pass 5 yards away from the first-down marker. I don't know how many defenders he juked, but it seriously looked like he avoided 15 guys to barely pick up the first down.    <b> Officiating: </b> It's been widely publicized that the officiating has been abysmal this year. Well, that continued in this game. The refs didn't recognize a Buffalo challenge flag that was thrown on an obvious drop by Wes Welker. Reversing the call would have put the Patriots in a third-and-six on Buffalo's 38. Instead, Welker's 21-yard catch held up, eventually leading to a touchdown. Later, a recovered onsides kick by the Bills in the final 2 minutes of the game was unjustly given to New England, despite the fact that the Patriots clearly touched the ball first. The refs, who were calling the game as if they had money on the Patriots, gave the ball to New England and refused to look at the replay.   "

   "comment":"Wes Welker. But he recovered on the next drive after the Broncos drew to within 14-7, leading his team on an 8.play, 52 yard drive to give his team another 2.score advantage.    The Broncos had no answer for anything New England was doing. Bill Belichick had the genius idea to run the ball with Aaron Hernandez 5 times, and it worked as his tight end gained 61 rushing yards. Hernandez also caught 4 balls for 55 yards and a touchdown, but that paled in comparison to Rob Gronkowski's 10 receptions for 145 yards and 3 scores, which tied a postseason record. The Broncos doubled Gronkowski last time and really limited him, but they decided to play zone this time, which is a big no-no against Brady. But it's not like they could have done anything to stop New England, save for drugging Brady's offensive linemen.    The other Patriots to score touchdowns were Wes Welker (6-55) and Deion Branch (3-85)."

Of course, some credit needs to be awarded to the Cardinals, particularly the offensive line, which held up relatively well. "

   "comment":"Wes Welker lost a fumble. Stephen Gostkowski missed 2 field goals - all in the first half. I was going to complain that the Patriots threw this game, but they still won, 52-28. It makes you wonder what the margin would have been if they didn't make all of those dumb mistakes early on. </i>    When New England was down 21-7 in the third quarter, it looked like a third loss in a row was possible for the Patriots, but then Tom Brady got hot and the Bills were completely dominated. Once again Brady and Belichick came away with a win when they had to have it. Buffalo jumped out a 21-7 lead after 2 Scott Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score. He beat corner Kyle Arrington and safety Patrick Chung took a bad angle. Brady answered by catching fire. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Woodhead. Brady then moved the ball with passes to Wes Welker, and the signal-caller ran the ball into end zone on a short scramble. Brady followed that by throwing a strike to Ron Gronkowski for a 28-yard score. New England ran in short touchdowns with "

   "comment":"Wes Welker, and he also caused an injury to Rob Gronkowski last year. Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots.    As for the Raven receivers, Boldin scored twice, as he finished with 5 receptions for 60 yards. He humorously stood over "

With Manning releasing the ball as quickly as possible, it's not a complete surprise that Welker just had 1 of his better games. On the other end of the spectrum, Julius Thomas was active, but didn't play at all, royally screwing over any fantasy owners who started him this week in the wake of the news that he would be active.    The Broncos didn't run the ball as well this week. "
