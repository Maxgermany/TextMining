   "comment":"Welker 10 times for 107 yards. Randy Moss saw 5 passes come his way for 53 yards.    Surprisingly, the star for New England's offense was BenJarvus Green-Ellis. Green-Ellis, perhaps establishing himself as the team's franchise back in favor of the oft-injured Laurence Maroney, gained 105 yards on 26 carries against a stingy Buffalo rush defense.    The Bills had the dumbest 70-second sequence I've ever seen at the end of the first half. Down 10-3, they had a 4.h-and-three inside New England's 40. Instead of going for it, Buffalo punted the ball, but called a timeout first. The Bills pinned New England at the 3. but couldn't force a punt because they had just 2 timeouts. If they were going to punt, why did they call timeout? With 3 timeouts, they could have gotten the ball back with 35 seconds and good field position. Instead, time expired.    Buffalo's late second-quarter gaff wasn't the only mistake by the coaching staff. Down 10-0, the Bills reached the red zone for the first time. On third-and-four, Buffalo opted to run the ball with an ineffective Marshawn Lynch, who gained just 46 yards.    Speaking of ineffective, Trent Edwards was absolutely horrendous in this game. He was 13-of-23 for 120 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks, but those figures don't tell the whole story. Edwards missed wide-open receivers all afternoon, while his picks were very untimely; 1 led to a New England score, while the other was in Patriots territory.    With Edwards misfiring left and right, Lee Evans also struggled to put up stats, catching 2 balls for 22 yards. Roscoe Parrish led the squad with 4 receptions and 31 yards.    Parrish made a great play in this game. On third down, he caught a pass 5 yards away from the first-down marker. I don't know how many defenders he juked, but it seriously looked like he avoided 15 guys to barely pick up the first down.    <b> Officiating: </b> It's been widely publicized that the officiating has been abysmal this year. Well, that continued in this game. The refs didn't recognize a Buffalo challenge flag that was thrown on an obvious drop by Wes Welker. Reversing the call would have put the Patriots in a third-and-six on Buffalo's 38. Instead, Welker's 21-yard catch held up, eventually leading to a touchdown. Later, a recovered onsides kick by the Bills in the final 2 minutes of the game was unjustly given to New England, despite the fact that the Patriots clearly touched the ball first. The refs, who were calling the game as if they had money on the Patriots, gave the ball to New England and refused to look at the replay.   "

   "comment":"Welker caught his only pass in the first quarter and ran down the field. Untouched, he made a cut and had his knee buckle. He later covered his head with his towel to hide his tears, and then was carted off the field. Despite this, Bill Belichick left his starters in for most of the game. He oddly took out Tom Brady in the second quarter in favor of Brian Hoyer, but later sent Brady back into the lineup. On the final drive, Brady was once again pulled for Hoyer. I really didn't understand this strategy, considering Randy Moss and the other starters played the entire way. I'm not saying the other starters should have been pulled as well; a victory would have given the Patriots the No. 3 seed, which would have ensured a home game in the AFC Championship if Cincinnati would have made it as well.    Brady was 17-of-26 for 186 yards and an interception to Bernard Pollard of all people. Without Welker, Brady appeared to struggle at times. He tried to get "

   "comment":"Welker. In the 4.h quarter, each defense gave up more yards but caused timely turnovers to keep the offenses from scoring points. A touchdown pass from Grossman to Moss was called back on a push-off penalty by Moss. The veteran coughed up a pass that was intercepted by Jerod Mayo to seal the Patriots' win. Brady finished the game 22-of-37 for 357 yards and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. The interception by Josh Wilson came in the end zone and led to a huge shouting match on the sideline between Brady and coach Bill O'Brien. Welker (7-86) and Gronkowski (6-160) were too much for Washington's secondary to contain. Grossman was 19-of-32 for 252 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Helu (27-126), Stallworth (4-96), Moss (3-81) and Gaffney (6-92) all had good games against the New England defense. The Redskins' offensive line did well in run blocking, but their pass blocking needs to improve. Carter had another good game for New England. The Patriots' defense has to up their game down the stretch, or the team could make a quick postseason exit. The secondary stinks. When New England faces better teams in the playoffs, they could get killed through the air. If the Redskins' offense can roll up yards (463) and points, then the Patriots have to worry about taking on a balanced team like the Steelers, or if they somehow make it to the Super Bowl, a team like the Packers or the Saints.

The Broncos had no answer for anything New England was doing. Bill Belichick had the genius idea to run the ball with Aaron Hernandez 5 times, and it worked as his tight end gained 61 rushing yards. Hernandez also caught 4 balls for 55 yards and a touchdown, but that paled in comparison to Rob Gronkowski's 10 receptions for 145 yards and 3 scores, which tied a postseason record. The Broncos doubled Gronkowski last time and really limited him, but they decided to play zone this time, which is a big no-no against Brady. But it's not like they could have done anything to stop New England, save for drugging Brady's offensive linemen.    The other Patriots to score touchdowns were Wes Welker (6-55) and Deion Branch (3-85)."

It makes you wonder what the margin would have been if they didn't make all of those dumb mistakes early on. </i>    When New England was down 21-7 in the third quarter, it looked like a third loss in a row was possible for the Patriots, but then Tom Brady got hot and the Bills were completely dominated. Once again Brady and Belichick came away with a win when they had to have it. Buffalo jumped out a 21-7 lead after 2 Scott Chandler touchdown catches and Donald Jones taking a quick slant 68 yards for a score. He beat corner Kyle Arrington and safety Patrick Chung took a bad angle. Brady answered by catching fire. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Woodhead. Brady then moved the ball with passes to Wes Welker, and the signal-caller ran the ball into end zone on a short scramble. Brady followed that by throwing a strike to Ron Gronkowski for a 28-yard score. New England ran in short touchdowns with "

   "comment":"Welker, and he also caused an injury to Rob Gronkowski last year. Now, Ridley was victimized. He's a monster. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    The injuries were just 1 of the 2 main storylines. The second was the ineptness of Brady. He was just extremely off in this contest. He missed open receivers all evening, whether it was via overthrows or short hops in front of them. Brady was especially bad in the second half, going 15-of-30 for 181 yards and 2 interceptions. Brady's overall numbers weren't bad - 29-of-54, 320 yards, 1 touchdown and the picks - but he made several uncharacteristic mental mistakes outside of the poor throws. He squandered an opportunity to get into the end zone at the end of the first half when he was too hesitant to take a timeout as the clock was running out. There was finally a stoppage with 4 seconds remaining, so New England had to settle for a field goal. I also don't understand why Brady refused to run on a key 4.h down in the final quarter. All he had to do was outrun Haloti Ngata for 4 yards on a 4th-and-4, but he instead skipped a weak throw to no 1 in particular. It's almost as if he quit.    Brady didn't seem pleased with Brandon Lloyd in this contest. He gave the receiver dirty looks on 2 incompletions, though Lloyd still finished with 7 grabs for 70 yards, which included some impressive diving catches. Wes Welker (8-117, TD) and Aaron Hernandez (9-83) led the way for the Patriots."

The Giants trailed by just 1 point at that moment, so it appeared as though Denver would be the team that would screw itself out of a victory. And that's exactly when the Broncos took over. Peyton Manning was unstoppable in the second half. He was great overall - 30-of-43, 307 yards, 2 touchdowns - but his numbers after intermission were just outstanding. He went a near-perfect 12-of-14 for 107 yards and the pair of scores following the break. If the Broncos didn't commit mental errors in the first half, this would've been an even uglier blowout. The Giants' back 7 is atrocious, thanks to injuries and mismanagement, so they didn't stand a chance against Manning once Denver started playing clean football.    Peyton's 2 scores went to Julius Thomas (6-47) and Welker (3-39). "

Wilson was masterful at the end of the game, and he was pretty sharp throughout.

   "comment":"Welker was able to set the record for most career receptions for an undrafted player. He logged 7 balls for 58 yards.    As for the loser, the Cardinals saw Calais Campbell suffer a knee injury on a nasty chop block. He could be out for a month. Bruce Arians was irate after the game, calling it the dirtiest play he's seen, and it's easy to understand why; Campbell is arguably the NFL's top 3-4 defensive end not named J.J. Watt, and Arizona's defense looked lost once he was out of the game. Campbell wasn't the only prominent Cardinal to suffer an injury. Drew Stanton left the game with a concussion in the third quarter. He wasn't great or anything - his stat line of 11-of-26 for 118 yards is not a proper indication of how he played - but he was so much better than Logan Thomas, who didn't look like a functional NFL quarterback, as he completed only 1 pass out of his 8 attempts. His sole conversion was an 81-yarder to Andre Ellington, but it was a short throw that Ellington was able to take to the house with his game-breaking speed (and the help of Denver's poor awareness). Thomas seemed completely unprepared to handle the pass rush, as DeMarcus Ware caused major problems for him.    The Broncos also saw someone significant go down when Montee Ball injured his groin. This actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as Bell once again looked like a typical Big Ten plodder, mustering just 7 yards on 6 carries. Ronnie Hillman took over and was much more effective, tallying 64 yards on 15 attempts. He needs to be added in all fantasy formats.    Going back to Manning, he was 31-of-47 for 479 yards, the 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His first pick was thrown behind Welker, while the other was tossed right to Campbell on a screen, which ultimately led to an Ellington rushing score.    Manning's 4 scores went to the Thomases, as Demaryius and Julius (6-66) reeled in 2 each. The former nearly had a third touchdown, but it was wiped out by the latter's chop block on Campbell. "

Manning threw behind Julius Thomas in the end zone and then tripped over Orlando Franklin's leg and took a sack. However, on third down, Manning found Demaryius Thomas, who tapped both feet in before falling out of bounds. Thomas, for good measure, also reeled in 510, which was a 40-yard rainbow.

   "comment":"Welker's arms. That was a chance for San Diego to get back into the game, down 14 at that point, but the Broncos maintained possession, bled the clock and pulled through with the spread-covering victory.    The Broncos were very lucky in this game, but they didn't need all of that great fortune to prevail. They were the better team on the field, outgaining San Diego by 119 net yards and averaging 1.2 more yards per play. The Chargers were competitive for a while, but Denver ultimately ran away with this victory in the second half. San Diego simply couldn't do anything about Peyton Manning. The NFL's career touchdown record-holder was an unstoppable force, going 25-of-35 for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had that 1 interception that should've stood, but was otherwise flawless. He simply took advantage of a secondary that was missing its top 2 cornerbacks. Brandon Flowers was out with a concussion, while Jason Verrett was in the lineup to begin the contest, but didn't last the entire 60 minutes, as he aggravated his shoulder injury.    All 3 of Manning's scores went to Sanders, who reeled in all 9 of his targets for 120 yards. Demaryius Thomas also had a big game with 8 grabs for 105 yards, but he dropped a pass.    Two of Denver's prominent play-makers barely did anything. Julius Thomas snatched just 2 passes for 23 yards, while Welker (2 catches, 5 yards) made his sole positive contribution by recovering Sanders' fumble.    It was a rough night for "
