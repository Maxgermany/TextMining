   "comment":"T.J. Yeldon are flashing play-making potential. Conversely, Miami wasn't impressive in its win against the Redskins last week and followed it up by dropping a winnable game on a road. Ryan Tannehill didn't get a lot of help, and the Dolphins' defense was prone to allowing big plays downfield. Miami played with a serious lack of discipline as 13 penalties for 112 yards played a huge role in the Dolphins dropping this game. A huge loss for the Dolphins also came when left tackle Brandon Albert suffered an injury in the first half and did not return. His injury could have a huge impact on Miami's season.    The Jaguars took the opening kickoff and moved down the field on the Dolphins' defense. The big play was a 36-yard pass to Robinson, and the drive ended with Bortles throwing a 3-yard scoring strike to the emerging No. 1 wideout. The Dolphins answered when a tipped pass fell into Rishard Matthews, who raced down the field for a 48-yard gain. Tannehill was lucky it wasn't intercepted, but it set up a field goal for Miami. Robinson kept coming as he went up over a defensive back to haul in a 52-yard bomb from Bortles. That led to a field goal for the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Bortles took off on a 26-yard run to convert a third down. He finished the drive by finding Robinson, who was running wide open down the middle of the field, for a 46-yard touchdown. Robinson burned safety Walt Aikens on a double-move to get wide open. Miami answered with 19- and 26-yard completions to tight end Jordan Cameron. On third-and-goal, Tannehill scrambled before finding running back Damian Williams for a score. Just before the half, the Dolphins missed a 42-yard field goal, and the Jaguars completed a couple of passes before Jason Myers made a 58-yard field goal to give Jacksonville a 20-13 lead. To start the third quarter, Tannehill hit Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker "

   "comment":"T.J. Yeldon for 5 yards. Myers missed a 53-yard field goal, but the Colts had called a time out right before to ice him. On the second try, Myers whiffed again. In overtime, the teams traded punts before the Jaguars put together a drive that set up Myers for a 48-yard field goal, but he missed it again. The Colts took advantage with Hasselbeck hitting Fleener for 28 yards along the sideline. When the Colts were setting up a field goal, Gore broke off a 23-yard run inside the 10-yard line. Vinatieri then drilled a 32-yarder to win the game.    Matt Hasselbeck completed 30-of-47 passes for 282 yards with a touchdown. He managed the game just enough for the Colts to get a needed win. T.Y. Hilton had 7 receptions for 67 yards. Colby Fleener led the Colts in receiving with 9 catches for 83 yards and a score, thanks to Hasselbeck dinking and dunking. Donte Moncrief (6-75) also contributed and continued to play ahead of Andre Johnson.    Frank Gore ran for 53 yards on 17 carries. He caught 5 passes for 34 yards. He also had a key fumble to ruin a potential touchdown.    Blake Bortles completed 28-of-50 passes for 298 yards with a touchdown. Allen Hurns led the Jaguars with 11 receptions for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson (4-80) was limited by Vontae Davis.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 105 yards on 22 carries. He had a 36-yard burst in overtime, but the Jaguars failed to do anything with it.    The Jaguar safeties played well. That would be Johnathan Cyprien (14 tackles) and Josh Evans (1 forced fumble, 5 tackles).    Colts rookie defensive end "

   "comment":"T.J. Yeldon, Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns, as they produced 436 yards of offense compared to 290 for New York. But 3 4.h-quarter turnovers led to Jacksonville's loss.    After starting with good field position, Bortles converted 1 third down with his feet and another with a screen to Yeldon for 21 yards. That led to a field goal for Jacksonville. New York got an excellent kick return from Antonio Cromartie to midfield. A screen to Zac Stacy converted a third-and-long and a back-shoulder throw to Eric Decker went for about 25 yards. To finish the drive, Fitzpatrick found Decker wide open in the end zone to give New York a 7-3 lead. Promptly, Bortles had a deflected pass intercepted by Marcus Williams to set up the Jets at the 32-yard line. A 4.h-and-3 was converted by Fitzpatrick to Decker, and Chris Ivory scored on a third-and-1. The Jaguars moved the ball into Jets territory in the final seconds and Bortles made a beautiful throw to Allen Hurns for a 30-yard touchdown after beating Antonio Cromartie. The Jets took a 14-10 lead into the locker room. Bortles led a field goal drive in the third quarter before Fitzpatrick hit a wide-open Jeff Cumberland for a 44-yard gain. A screen to Ivory went for 16 yards to the Jaguars' 1-yard line, and he plunged into the end zone 2 plays later. In the 4.h quarter, Bortles got going by hitting Allen Robinson for a 44-yard pass after he beat Darrelle Revis to get open before catching the pass with Marcus Williams all over him. A 16-yard pass to Hurns set up a Jacksonville field goal. The Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, and Bortles threw a 27-yard pass to Marcedes Lewis, and Yeldon ripped off a 45-yard run to get into Jets territory. However, Bortles was strip-sacked by Calvin Pace, who recovered the fumble for New York. Jacksonville's defense forced a punt, but muffed the punt, and Kellen Davis recovered for New York at the Jaguars' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Brandon Marshall made a phenomenal, diving, 20-yard touchdown catch. Quickly, Bortles ripped the ball down the field before throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Walters. Marshall recovered the onside kick. Ivory fumbled a third-down run, but was extremely lucky that Marshall recovered that loose ball as well. With a minute remaining, the Jaguars got the ball back at their 10-yard line, but Bortles threw a pick to Marcus Williams to end the game.    Blake Bortles completed 24-of-40 passes for 381 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He also ran for 32 yards on 4 carries. Bortles played well with a lot of excellent reads and throws. He's vastly improved this season.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 64 yards on 14 carries with 3 receptions for 37 yards. His offensive line struggled to open holes.    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 121 yards, and Allen Hurns logged 5 catches for 122 yards and a score. Robinson and Hurns outplayed New York's veteran corner tandem of Revis and Cromartie. "

   "comment":"T.J. Yeldon. Another pass to Yeldon converted a third down for a gain of 15, and a pass to Allen Robinson for 25 yards set up a short field goal. The Jaguars' second possession got started with a 29-yard pass to Allen Hurns and ended by adding another field goal. On the final play of the first quarter, Rivers connected with Antonio Gates for a gain of 27 yards. A run by Melvin Gordon for 11 yards moved the ball inside the 10. On third-and-goal, Dontrelle Inman beat Dwayne Gratz for Rivers' first touchdown pass of the afternoon. The Jaguars answered with a 24-yard screen pass to Marcedes Lewis, but settled for a third field goal. Just before the half, Rivers ripped the ball down the field before hitting Gates for a short touchdown. Jacksonville tried to get more points, but Bortles had a poorly placed pass intercepted by Manti Te'o. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gates on a corner route for a 12-yard touchdown. The Chargers took a 21-9 lead into the half. In the third quarter, the Jaguars had good field position thanks to a Jared Odrick sack, and Bortles hit Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.    Neither team received a good game from its defense, but Chargers rookie linebacker "

Blake Bortles missing 2 linemen didn't appear to hurt as much as anticipated, as the Ravens didn't collect a sack until the 4.h quarter. However, they started putting lots of pressure on him then, and Bortles self-destructed. Bortles threw a crushing interception that I referenced earlier, and he was picked off again on the ensuing drive.

Bortles is 1 of the worst starting quarterbacks in the NFL, despite the pretty numbers he 10.s to post in garbage time. His mechanics have seemingly gotten worse recently, which goes to show what happens when a team fires its only quality coach (Greg Olson, in this case). I couldn't argue with anyone who wants to refer to Bortles as a sunk cost at this point. He just doesn't care enough about football to improve his game.    "
