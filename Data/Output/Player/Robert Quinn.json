   "comment":"Quinn beat left tackle Anthony Castonzo, with Chris Long scooping up the ball and taking it into the end zone. Tavon Austin then had a trio of touchdowns. The first was a 98-yard punt return in which the Colts seemed to think he called for a fair catch when he waved everyone off. Austin then burned Vontae Davis for a 57-yard touchdown. He had another long score - an 81-yarder - which was a short pass that came on a pick route. Indianapolis' man defense wasn't prepared for this style of attack, and the Colts simply didn't care enough about this game to make the proper adjustments. The Colts then had some opportunities to score at the end, but Andrew Luck launched an underthrown interception in the end zone. Luck was picked off again on an overthrow shortly afterward. He ultimately finished 29-of-47 for 353 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It's worth noting that 260 of his yards came after halftime when the Rams had already established a 28-0 lead, meaning that most of what he did in this contest was meaningless.    Aside from poor pass protection and a flawed game plan, Luck was hurt by the lack of a running attack. Luck actually led the team in rushing yards with 17. Trent Richardson carried the ball just 5 times, but gained only 2 yards in the process. Donald Brown didn't do any better on the ground (2 attempts, -1 yards), but he did catch 5 passes for 64 yards and a touchdown. Richardson also did most of his damage as a receiver, snatching 3 balls for 33 receiving yards.    Excluding Brown, the Colts' leader in receiving was T.Y. Hilton, who hauled in 7 balls for 130 yards. Hilton, like Luck, did most of his damage in the second half (4-105).    The lone bright spot for the Colts was Robert Mathis, who had 2 sacks to bring his seasonal total up to 13.5. Quinn also had a pair of sacks. He now has 12 on the year.    As for the team that actually tried, it's amazing that Austin had such a high yardage total (138) with his pair of touchdowns considering that he made just 2 catches on the afternoon. Austin, who became the 8. player in NFL history with 3 touchdowns of 50-plus yards in a single game, was 1 of 3 Rams to have more than 1 reception; "

   "comment":"Quinn was in beast mode, while Donald Penn looks like he is in firm state of decline. One has to wonder if the Rams would be in the wild-card race if Sam Bradford hadn't been injured.    In the first quarter, the Bucs had a nice drive as Mike Glennon moved the ball with 2 long passes to Vincent Jackson (5-98). Bobby Rainey (20-37) ran the ball into the end zone from a couple of yards out. St. Louis came back with a methodical drive that was aided by some Tampa Bay penalties. The Rams then tied the game at 7 when Zac Stacy (33-104) dove into the end zone from a yard out. Alec Ogletree stripped the ball away from Rainey on the next drive. Following the sudden change, St. Louis dialed up an awesome double-reverse to Stedman Bailey (3-44), who bolted down the field for a 27-yard touchdown run. The Rams should have scored more often, but had ball-security issues. On a third-and-goal, Kellen Clemens fumbled the ball away on a quarterback draw. St. Louis got the ball in Tampa Bay territory again, but Stacy fumbled the ball away after a hit from Dekoda Watson. The Rams had a 14-10 lead at the half. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter. In the 4.h quarter, Glennon fumbled the ball away on a sack from James Laurinaitis and Alec Ogletree. That set up another St. Louis field goal. To close out the game, Chris Long and Robert Quinn recorded sacks to finish off Tampa Bay.    Both quarterbacks completed 16 passes for 158 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Glennon was 16-of-26, while Clemens was 16-of-20.    The Rams' defense was suffocating. Qunn beat Penn for 2 of his 3 sacks. At 18 sacks this year, Quinn broke Kevin Carter's franchise record. "

   "comment":"Quinn's great pressure - but the Chiefs made the appropriate second-half adjustments. It also helped that the Rams displayed very poor tackling after halftime and couldn't maintain possession on offense because of their injury woes. Smith did a good job of spreading the ball around, as a quintet of Chiefs had 4 or more targets, yet none of them saw more than 6. "

   "comment":"Quinn took away a great 36-yard catch by Travis Benjamin, and once again, Cleveland punted away after starting a drive well. Foles threw a beautiful 41-yard pass to Kenny Britt to the Browns' 1-yard line. Gurley finished the drive with his first NFL touchdown. In the 4.h quarter, the Rams' defense struck again. T.J. McDonald dislodged the ball from Benjamin, while Nick Fairley recovered the ball. Hilariously, Fairley ran the wrong direction with the fumble for a loss of 5 yards on his return, but at least, he secured the turnover. The St. Louis offense moved the ball from midfield before Gurley charged through 3 tackles from 16 yards out for the final score of the game. The Rams' defense did the rest. William Hayes beat right tackle Mitchell Schwartz to strip McCown of the ball, and Eugene Sims recovered the fumble. After McCown was pummeled by St. Louis' defense, Johnny Manziel came in for the final drive and moved the Browns about 30 yards before Cleveland stalled out.    Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards on 19 carries with 2 touchdowns. His combination of power and speed is tremendous.    Nick Foles completed 15-of-23 passes for 163 yards, while Tavon Austin led the Rams' receivers with 43 yards on 4 receptions.    Josh McCown completed 26-of-32 pass for 270 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and 2 fumbles. He actually didn't play poorly, but his offensive line was destroyed by the Rams.    St. Louis' run defense has been vulnerable this year, but shut down the Cleveland ground attack. Robert Turbin had 30 yards on 5 carries.    Cleveland was led through the air by tight end Gary Barnidge. He had 6 receptions for 101 yards. Running back Duke Johnson (7-73) and Travis Benjamin (4-47) were the other top targets.    The Rams' defensive line was just tremendous. Aaron Donald embarrassed Joel Bitonio on number of plays. Robert Quinn, William Hayes, Janoris Jenkins and Mark Barron all had good games for St."

With the Rams up 31-20, the Buccaneers got back into Los Angeles territory with a 33-yard screen pass to Sims, and a few plays later, Winston threw an easy touchdown pass to Brate. The Bucs went for 2. but it was incomplete; that cut the Ramss' lead to 31-26. Los Angeles benefited from a huge holding call on Alterraun Verner to give the Rans a first down. They got Austin matched up on a safety, and that led to Austin getting a 43-yard touchdown after a missed tackle. That restored the Rams' lead back at 11 points. Winston and Sims led a drive that featured Evans making a leaping touchdown reception. Once again, the 2.point conversion failed. Tavon Austin made a huge mistake when he could have downed the kickoff in the end zone but took it out and was tackled at the 6.yard line. The Rams went backward before the 2-minute warning, and then a lightning delay stopped the game for over an hour. The Bucs got the ball back at their 44-yard line with 1:42 remaining down by 5. Completions to Vincent Jackson (3-37) and Sims moved the ball around the Rams' 20-yard line. A penalty on Barron gave the Bucs a critical first down, but they surprisingly didn't use their 2 timeouts after completions in the field. It was terrible clock management, and the Rams stopped Tampa as time expired.    Jameis Winston completed 36-of-58 passes for 405 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. The missed kicks from Aguayo cost Tampa Bay 4 points, and that made the difference in the Bucs needing a touchdown to win rather than a field goal.    Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving with 10 receptions for 132 yards and a touchdown. Charles Sims had a good game filling in for Doug Martin with 55 yards on 13 carries and a touchdown with 6 receptions for 69 yards.    Case Keenum was 14-of-26 for 190 yards and 2 scores with an interception. The Bucs' turnovers and the Rams' defensive touchdown really helped Keenum a lot.    Todd Gurley ran hard to pick up 85 yards on 27 carries with 2 touchdowns. Tavon Austin led the Rams in receiving with 5 catches for 82 yards and a score.    Defensively, Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David - 8 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble - were excellent for Tampa Bay. Los Angeles' Aaron Donald had his typical good performance. Robert Quinn abused Bucs left tackle Donovan Smith. Smith gave up the critical strip-sack, but also had a holding penalty that negated a first down.   "
