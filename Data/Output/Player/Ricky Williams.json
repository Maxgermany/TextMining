While the Buccaneers tried their best to beat themselves early on, the Dolphins attempted to do so late in the contest. When Miami was running the clock out, Chad Henne tossed a horrible interception to Quincy Black on a third down. You have to wonder what Henne was thinking because no Dolphins player was even in the vicinity. Henne redeemed himself by putting together a game-winning drive with 1:14 remaining on the clock. Henne was 17-of-31 for 175 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Ted Ginn Jr. started the game and was booed when he dropped a long touchdown. He finished with no catches. If he wasn't such an effective return man, he wouldn't be on the team anymore. Davone Bess led the squad with 4 receptions for 72 yards.    Ricky Williams had way more carries (20) than Ronnie Brown (12)."

   "comment":"Ricky Williams lined up in the Wildcat, faked the run and lofted a soft pass into triple coverage. The Bills came away with an interception. Had Miami scored there - and Buffalo's defense was offering no resistance at the time - the Dolphins would have held a 21-3 lead going into the 4.h quarter. And as good as Ryan Fitzpatrick was in this contest, I don't think he would have battled back from that deficit.    Fitzpatrick was very sharp, going 17-of-26 for 246 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The Harvard product connected on deep throws to Terrell Owens (51 yards) and Lee Evans (32). Fitzpatrick also scrambled 7 times for 50 yards, including a 31-yard touchdown. After that score, forum member ChicagoJay commented, Wow, Ryan Fitzpatrick just ran further than Trent Edwards will ever throw it.    Owens, who had the game-clinching touchdown, finished with 5 receptions for 96 yards. I guess Perry Fewell's genius plan of getting the ball into Owens' hands is working. Lee Evans, meanwhile, had just 2 grabs for 40 yards.    Fred Jackson was the star for the Bills. He rushed 15 times for 73 yards and 2 touchdowns, and also had 5 receptions for 43 more yards. Marshawn Lynch did nothing (3 carries, 6 yards). If only Dick Jauron realized that Jackson gave his team the better chance to win... One of the hundreds of reasons his firing was warranted.    Ricky Williams wasn't the only Dolphin throwing interceptions. "

   "comment":"Ricky Williams vultured a touchdown away from Rice in the 4.h quarter.   Williams), Houston was outgained by more than 100 yards. Matt Schaub did what he could. He went 21-of-37 for 220 yards and a touchdown. He played well considering that he was missing Johnson and going against Baltimore's vaunted defense on the road.    Schaub's score went to Jacoby Jones (4-76), who once again frustrated fantasy owners with his inconsistent production. Meanwhile, Arian Foster and Kevin Walter (both 6-52) tied for the team lead in receptions.    While Foster excelled in the aerial attack, he couldn't get anything going on the ground, save for a 16-yard scamper. He finished with 49 yards on 15 attempts.    I called Jacoby Jones inconsistent. That's nothing compared to Joe Flacco, who never ceases to amaze how he can look so great on 1 throw and so terrible on the next. Flacco had multiple beautiful bombs to Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. Then again, he had a few ugly lobs, including 1 interception in which he completely overthrew his target for what could have been a 25-yard gain. Flacco also lost a fumble and was mostly responsible for his team being 3-of-11 on third downs. Boldin (8-132) and Smith (3-84) both posted good fantasy numbers, as did Ray Rice, who totaled 101 rushing yards (23 carries) and 60 receiving yards. Unfortunately, Ricky Williams vultured a touchdown away from Rice in the 4.h quarter.   "
