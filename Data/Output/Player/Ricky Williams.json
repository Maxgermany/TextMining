Fortunately, John Carney missed an extra point, so a later field goal made it a 6-point game. With 3:23 remaining, my +6.5 5-unit play was still safe. Down 6. Henne drove the Dolphins to their 41. After a penalty and 2 incomplete passes (1 via a Ricky Williams drop), Henne tossed a desperation heave, allowing Tracy Porter to intercept it and returned the ball 54 yards for a pick-six."

   "comment":"Ricky Williams lined up in the Wildcat, faked the run and lofted a soft pass into triple coverage. The Bills came away with an interception. Had Miami scored there - and Buffalo's defense was offering no resistance at the time - the Dolphins would have held a 21-3 lead going into the 4.h quarter. And as good as Ryan Fitzpatrick was in this contest, I don't think he would have battled back from that deficit.    Fitzpatrick was very sharp, going 17-of-26 for 246 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. The Harvard product connected on deep throws to Terrell Owens (51 yards) and Lee Evans (32). Fitzpatrick also scrambled 7 times for 50 yards, including a 31-yard touchdown. After that score, forum member ChicagoJay commented, Wow, Ryan Fitzpatrick just ran further than Trent Edwards will ever throw it.    Owens, who had the game-clinching touchdown, finished with 5 receptions for 96 yards. I guess Perry Fewell's genius plan of getting the ball into Owens' hands is working. Lee Evans, meanwhile, had just 2 grabs for 40 yards.    Fred Jackson was the star for the Bills. He rushed 15 times for 73 yards and 2 touchdowns, and also had 5 receptions for 43 more yards. Marshawn Lynch did nothing (3 carries, 6 yards). If only Dick Jauron realized that Jackson gave his team the better chance to win... One of the hundreds of reasons his firing was warranted.    Ricky Williams wasn't the only Dolphin throwing interceptions. "

   "comment":"Ricky Williams combined for nearly 300 rushing yards in a meeting 4 weeks ago. The Browns did a much better job versus the run this time, limiting both backs. Rice had 87 yards on 23 attempts, while Williams tallied 45 yards on 10 tries. Rice was kept out of the end zone on the ground, but scored on a 42-yard reception (most of the yardage came through the air). He had 3 catches in total for 48 receiving yards.    "
