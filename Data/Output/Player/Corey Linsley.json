   "comment":"Corey Linsley's fault because he snapped the ball before Rodgers was ready. Rodgers threw some absolute darts to his receivers in the 4.h quarter, particularly Davante Adams, who got open quite easily against overmatched corner Sterling Moore. It really helped Rodgers that his offensive line held up extremely well following halftime. It struggled to protect Rodgers early on, but that changed as the afternoon progressed.    Adams actually led the team in receiving yardage, as he caught 7 balls for 117 yards and a touchdown. Adams was as fantastic as the numbers indicate; he beat Moore and juked an inept J.J. Wilcox when he ran into the end zone. He then broke out of a poor Moore tackle on a big gain to move the chains on Green Bay's final drive when the team successfully ran out the clock. "
