   "comment":"Linsley got knocked out with an injury.    A positive sign for Green Bay is that the running game appears to be back on track. Eddie Lacy, who was fat and lethargic earlier in the season, suddenly had this inexplicable burst in this contest, rushing for an even 100 yards on just 22 carries. James Starks got the start, but quickly gave way to Lacy, who looked like the talented runner of old. Starks managed just 14 yards on 8 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Cobb had numerous drops. He saw 9 targets, but was able to reel in just 2 of them for 24 yards. He did score a touchdown, however. Rodgers' other touchdown went to James Jones, who had a tremendous performance. He caught 6 of his 11 targets for 109 yards, highlighted by a juggling, diving catch at the end of the third quarter to set up a Green Bay score.    Linsley wasn't the only Packer who left the game with an injury. "
