   "comment":"Boykin piloted the offense the rest of the way. Wilson's injury is obviously huge. He had been enjoying a great performance, going 15-of-23 for 243 yards and a touchdown. He rushed only once for 3 yards, as he still clearly wasn't 100 percent, and now he appears to be in even worse shape. If there's a silver lining, it's that Boykin looked somewhat good, as he went 7-of-9 for 65 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. I watched every snap of Boykin's in the preseason, and while he definitely has some ability and upside, the mental part of his game just isn't there yet. A team smarter than the 49ers would be able to force him into numerous turnovers.    Boykin's sole score went to "

   "comment":"Boykin for the 4.h quarter. Wilson still put up good numbers for just 3 quarters of play, completing 19-of-32 passes for 258 yards and a touchdown.    Kaepernick completed 17-of-22 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown, with 8 completions and 115 yards coming on his first 8 passes. After that outburst, he went 9-of-14 for 100 yards and a touchdown in 3 quarters of play. Remember that this team didn't have Carlos Hyde or Torrey Smith, and even if both had been in, the talent deficiency across the board in San Francisco is abysmal. Maybe that's why general manager Trent Baalke was fired before the game? It is. With Seattle resting its starters in the 4.h quarter and the 49ers complete lack of talent, this game was boring, but once again, Kaepernick made it close, throwing a 9-yard touchdown to "
