   "comment":"Mendenhall gave away deep inside Cleveland territory. In fact, there were 4 fumbles (2 by both teams) in a span of just 8 plays in the third quarter. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the shady officials in this game reviewed an obvious Hines Ward touchdown, but ruled the catch incomplete even though the ball never hit the ground. When that happened, I had a pretty good feeling that the Steelers weren't going to cover the spread.    Two big stories for the Steelers. On the defensive side, Troy Polamalu played just his second game of the season. Polamalu made his presence known with an interception. Polamalu limped off the field on the same left knee he hurt in the opener after making the pick, but he returned to the game later on.    On offense, Ben Roethlisberger was 23-of-35 for a whopping 417 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Roethlisberger was sacked 3 times, but often had a ton of time to throw on most plays. On his first score, Roethlisberger seriously had 10 seconds in the pocket.    Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes both had huge games. Ward caught 8 balls for 159 yards and a touchdown, while Holmes grabbed 5 balls for 104 yards. Heath Miller, meanwhile, chipped in with 5 receptions for 80 yards and a score.    Rashard Mendenhall shouldered most of the workload in this contest, rushing for 62 yards and a score on 17 carries. Willie Parker had just 7 attempts for 26 yards, but fumbled the ball away in the third quarter. I was ready to criticize Mike Tomlin for using Parker, but Mendenhall fumbled on the next drive.    As for Cleveland's offense, there's only 1 thing of note. "

It's hard to believe that after a 6-2 start, the Steelers have fallen to 6-6 despite playing the Chiefs and Raiders. They need to win the rest of their games to make the playoffs. They have the Browns (road), Packers and Ravens (home) and then Dolphins (road). All of those contests are winnable, but then again, so were the battles against Kansas City and Oakland.   "

As shocking as it was to see Pittsburgh struggle to run the football, it was even more surprising to watch Indianapolis have so much success on the ground. "

   "comment":"Mendenhall (13-52, TD) and Heath Miller (5-73) also pleased their fantasy owners.    Walt Coleman was the official in this contest, so naturally there were a number of awful calls on both sides. Against the Ravens: - Smith's hold to negate an 80-yard Rice touchdown on the opening play was completely bogus. Cris Collinsworth nearly had an aneurysm yelling about it. - Rice ran into the end zone in the first quarter, but the play was blown dead extremely early. - Smith was held a bit later, which prevented a long reception. The hold wasn't called. Against the Steelers: - Brown was interfered with in the end zone, but no penalty was called. - Ike Taylor was whistled for a questionable pass interference in the third quarter that would later give Rice a short touchdown. - Max Starks' bogus hold wiped out a nice Rashard Mendenhall scamper later on. General ineptness: When Smith scored the decisive touchdown, there was also a pass interference penalty. Coleman apparently thought the Ravens would wipe the score off the board because he announced: Pass interference on the defense. The ball will be placed on the spot of the foul. Because that game-winning score wasn't exciting enough.   "

   "comment":"Mendenhall, but whatever. The offense also had numerous holding penalties that brought back big gains. I didn't count, but it seemed like rookie right tackle Marcus Gilbert had a half-a-dozen of them. Then, in the third quarter, Ben Roethlisberger (21-of-31, 193 yards, TD, INT) threw a poor interception deep downfield. I don't want to take much away from Kansas City's defense because Romeo Crennel did a phenomenal job game planning for Pittsburgh, but the Steelers really underperformed considering that they were coming off a bye and battling a team that was blown out on Monday Night Football.    As for Pittsburgh's defense, the unit did a great job bottling up the Kansas City offense for 3 quarters despite losing Troy Polamalu to a concussion on the opening drive. However, Palko (18-of-28, 167 yards, 3 INTs) must have sprinkled some pixie dust on himself because he inexplicably improved in the 4.h quarter. Unfortunately, his comeback was thwarted when Dwayne Bowe (7-69) quit on a route and didn't make an attempt to break up Palko's interception. A frustrated Palko yelled at Bowe for minutes, but the No. 1 wideout basically shrugged his quarterback off nonchalantly. And with that, Kansas City's season is officially over.    Some stats: Rashard Mendenhall rushed for 57 yards on 17 carries. "

   "comment":"Mendenhall fumble.    The Bucs' defense played well, but blew a 4.h-quarter lead for the third time in 4 games. Gerald McCoy was phenomenal for Tampa Bay. He had a sack, recovered a fumble and was in the backfield all day. Revis played well too, as he held Fitzgerald without a catch in the first half. In Buccaneers' territory, Revis picked off a pass intended for Fitzgerald in the third quarter. Revis also forced a fumble late in the 4.h quarter. Tampa Bay rookie corner Johnthan Banks made an awesome interception in the end zone with a leaping catch to take points away from Arizona.    Palmer was 21-of-38 for 248 yards with a touchdown and those 2 picks. Against a team with a decent offense, he wouldn't have played well enough to win. Michael Floyd was his top receiver as he caught 5 for 87 yards. WalterFootball.com caught up with Fitzgerald after the game, and he summed up the game nicely, The first half that [sic] was some ugly ball in the first half. All around. The defense kept fighting and fighting to keep the game manageable for us. Those guys played their tail off. They got banged up and we lost lots of bodies last week, but guys continued to step up in their roles and that is what a team is about.    Mendenhall was terrible for the Cardinals. Early on, he dropped an easy pass and fumbled the ball away after running into Fitzgerald. Mendenhall also fumbled the ball out of bounds after a strip by Revis inside the Bucs' 10-yard line when Arizona was setting up the go-ahead field goal. The Cardinals should bench Mendenhall and let young backs "

He rewarded anyone who started him in fantasy with a 3-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Mendenhall is trash, and I have no idea why Arizona is wasting its time with him. Every time he touches the ball, it's a waste. Granted, he didn't have good running lanes, but there were a few instances in this contest that he had some room, and a superior running back would've picked up much more yardage. The weird thing is that the Cardinals actually do have a better back. His name is "
