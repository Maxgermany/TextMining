The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - Matthew Stafford launched a pass toward Megatron deep downfield, but Brent Grimes was able to snare it with an amazing 1.handed catch. It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because DeAndre Levy dropped an easy interception in the end zone. - A field goal attempt by Detroit was blocked. Dion Jordan scooped up the ball and returned it to the Lions' 5-yard line. The Dolphins immediately converted with a Tannehill touchdown to Mike Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because Louis Delmas screwed up - but he broke up several passes intended for the league's best receiver.    Johnson wasn't the only Detroit receiver to eclipse the 100-yard barrier. Golden Tate was highly efficient, reeling in 11 of the 13 targets thrown in his direction for 109 yards. Tate made some key catches to move the chains.    The Lions didn't try to run the ball very much. Joique Bell mustered 44 yards on 10 carries, while Reggie Bush (4-20) hurt his ankle in the first half.    In addition to Bush, a couple of Detroit players got hurt. Stud guard Larry Warford was knocked out with a knee injury, and his absence didn't help an offensive line that couldn't block Cameron Wake. Safety James Ihedigbo also left the game, but was able to return.    Despite their slow start, the Dolphins held 2 separate leads in the second half. They held an advantage until there were 30 seconds remaining, and they easily could have prevailed. A horrible spot gave the Lions a first down, even after a review. Earlier, Charles Clay dropped a touchdown, and that conversion would've at least given Miami a chance to pull through in overtime. And even before that, Tannehill heaved a careless interception in the red zone. Being down by 1 would've made a difference; the Dolphins drove to their 40-yard line with 10 seconds left, so 1 long completion would have put them in position to try the game-winning kick. Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11.

Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). "

   "comment":"Jarvis Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was 1 of the 2 major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was 1 of the 2 major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Louis Delmas dropped a pass thrown right to him. Orton went 22-of-39 for 193 yards, but was just 10-of-22 for 93 yards following intermission. He was solid early, finding Chris Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front 4 that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered 5 sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone."

   "comment":"Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as Lamar Miller was held to 14 yards on 10 carries. Miami's rushing attack was putrid, though it should be noted that Miller was hindered by an ankle injury. Miller is expected to bounce back, so you can buy him low from a disappointed fantasy owner.    Rishard Matthews led the Dolphins' receivers with 6 catches for 115 yards. A fluky performance? Perhaps, but with Jordan Cameron getting hurt, Greg Jennings doing nothing and DeVante Parker being too raw, Ryan Tannehill will have to throw to someone else besides Jarvis Landry.    Jarvis Landry had 8 receptions for 110 yards. It's almost a lock at this point that he'll catch 5 passes each week. He's 1 of the most consistent fantasy receivers.    Jordan Cameron hauled in 3 for 62. He sustained a groin injury and didn't return. Cameron is talented, but it's not a good idea to rely on him, given his injury history.    Blake Bortles completed 18-of-33 for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played better than the numbers illustrate, as his offensive line allowed a lot of pressure in the pocket. He's not much of a fantasy option, however.    T.J. Yeldon ran for 70 yards on 25 carries to lead Jacksonville. The Dolphins have a stout front, so those numbers are more impressive than they might appear at first glance.    Allen Robinson was the offensive star for the Jaguars with 6 receptions for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. Robinson struggled in the opener, but he bounced back and played to his talent level. He can be started each week. Allen Hurns (4-68) and Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Jarvis Landry drop and a false start right before a delay-of-game flag was thrown. Following a quick Jets touchdown, there was a hold on Landry's bobbled kickoff return; Ryan Tannehill overshot Greg Jennings by a mile; and a false start on a punt backed up Miami even farther. Brandon Marshall was then open for a 22-yard gain on a third down, allowing the Jets to score once more. At that point, it was apparent that New York would run away with a blowout, and that's exactly what happened. The Dolphins had no sense of urgency throughout the game. They were guilty of unforced penalties; Philbin was asleep on 1 play and didn't recognize that he should challenge a Tannehill fumble that looked like a pass; offensive coordinator Bill Lazor didn't seem to understand how to deal with the Jets' constant blitzing. They just looked dead, yet they should have been desperate to avoid a 1-3 hole, which would drop them way behind every other team in the division. That's why Philbin needs to go. Immediately.    Ryan Tannehill went 19-of-42 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, but don't be fooled; much of his yardage came in garbage time when his team was down 27-7. He was 7-of-15 for just 58 yards and a touchdown by halftime. Tannehill played poorly - he missed numerous receivers - but it wasn't all his fault. His pass protection was horrid, and his offensive coordinator didn't seem to understand how to counter the Jets' constant blitzes. In an embarrassing sequence of events, the Dolphins had a 3.and-out in just 16 seconds, with all 3 plays featuring tipped passes as a result of blitzes that weren't picked up. It was a joke.    Another issue for Tannehill was that Jarvis Landry was bottled up. It was reported during the week that Landry drop and a false start right before a delay-of-game flag was thrown. Following a quick Jets touchdown, there was a hold on Landry's bobbled kickoff return; Ryan Tannehill overshot Greg Jennings by a mile; and a false start on a punt backed up Miami even farther."

Tannehill added his 4.h touchdown pass of the half with a 54-yard screen pass to Miller. He ran untouched into the end zone. If that wasn't bad enough, Texans tight end C.J.

Under 3 minutes before the half, Lamar Miller ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run. Miami took a 41-0 lead into the locker room. Obviously, the second half was all garbage time. The Texans produced a fumble from the Dolphins' Damian Williams, and that set up a 7-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster. Shortly later, Foster added another touchdown on a short run and Nate Washington caught a 27-yard score. Miami then tacked on a 53-yard field goal, and Washington had another short touchdown catch to conclude the scoring.    Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston.

He also caught 5 balls for 19 receiving yards. He could've had more yardage in that regard, but was barely tripped up. Meanwhile, "

As for Stills, he was a greater factor with DeVante Parker out. Only 2 other Dolphins caught multiple passes.    Ryan, meanwhile, had just a middling performance against a weak back 7. He finished 24-of-35 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick at the end of the game. The issue I had with Atlanta's game plan was that the team ran the ball so often on first down, putting Ryan in constant long-yardage situations. Ryan converted those in the opening half, but didn't have nearly as much success after the break. Prior to the final drive, Atlanta mustered only 45 yards in the second half!    "

Drake and Williams caught 6 passes each for 35 and 47 yards, respectively, with Williams scoring once aerially. Williams also had a long reception negated by a Landry hold. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Jarvis Landry, allowed the Buccaneers to operate on short fields. They took advantage, notching 20 points in the opening half. They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit. Parker was awful in this contest, as he was responsible for 2 interceptions. Kenny Stills was much better, catching 7 of his 8 targets for a whopping 180 yards and a touchdown. Jarvis Landry (6-95) also had a score, and he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Meanwhile, Parker (4-26) never really did anything positive. The Dolphins have been disgruntled with Parker's work ethic, so this type of performance is not surprising in the slightest.    Miami's running game had a nice pick-up with Williams' aforementioned 69-yard gain, but Williams didn't do anything else; he finished with 78 yards on 10 carries.
