   "comment":"Landry 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He then sacked Tannehill, dropping him for minus-11. The Lions' offense, meanwhile, was able to go up 10-0, thanks to a fake punt that the Dolphins weren't prepared for and a 49-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson on the first play following a Miami punt. It appeared as though Detroit would run away with this contest, but the mistakes surfaced. This includes: - Calvin Johnson's offensive pass interference (an obvious push-off) nullified an 18-yard catch. - The Dolphins were able to convert a fake punt of their own, though that was negated by an illegal shift. - Detroit tried a second fake punt, which the Dolphins were prepared for that time. I'm all for 1 fake punt, but it's not like the Lions were going to catch Miami off-guard again. - Matthew Stafford launched a pass toward Megatron deep downfield, but Brent Grimes was able to snare it with an amazing 1.handed catch. It was 1 of the best interceptions you'll ever see. - Suh was whistled for a face mask on a key third down, giving the Dolphins a field goal try. Miami was able to get 3 points because DeAndre Levy dropped an easy interception in the end zone. - A field goal attempt by Detroit was blocked. Dion Jordan scooped up the ball and returned it to the Lions' 5-yard line. The Dolphins immediately converted with a Tannehill touchdown to Mike Wallace.    Despite all of this, the Lions prevailed and (barely) covered. It appeared as though this game was headed to overtime when Calvin Johnson dropped a touchdown, but Stafford found Theo Riddick for the decisive score with 29 seconds remaining. Stafford finished 25-of-40 for 280 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was off on some of his passes - notably behind Megatron on 1 third-down try - but he was unquestionably more effective with his No. 1 receiver back on the field.    Speaking of that No. 1 wideout, Megatron was dominant in his return, snagging 7 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. He had a drop in the end zone, and he would've posted prettier stats if it wasn't for Brent Grimes, who did an outstanding job covering him. Grimes surrendered the long score - partly because Louis Delmas screwed up - but he broke up several passes intended for the league's best receiver.    Johnson wasn't the only Detroit receiver to eclipse the 100-yard barrier. Golden Tate was highly efficient, reeling in 11 of the 13 targets thrown in his direction for 109 yards. Tate made some key catches to move the chains.    The Lions didn't try to run the ball very much. Joique Bell mustered 44 yards on 10 carries, while Reggie Bush (4-20) hurt his ankle in the first half.    In addition to Bush, a couple of Detroit players got hurt. Stud guard Larry Warford was knocked out with a knee injury, and his absence didn't help an offensive line that couldn't block Cameron Wake. Safety James Ihedigbo also left the game, but was able to return.    Despite their slow start, the Dolphins held 2 separate leads in the second half. They held an advantage until there were 30 seconds remaining, and they easily could have prevailed. A horrible spot gave the Lions a first down, even after a review. Earlier, Charles Clay dropped a touchdown, and that conversion would've at least given Miami a chance to pull through in overtime. And even before that, Tannehill heaved a careless interception in the red zone. Being down by 1 would've made a difference; the Dolphins drove to their 40-yard line with 10 seconds left, so 1 long completion would have put them in position to try the game-winning kick. Tannehill was very inconsistent in this contest. He went 27-of-38 for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick. He should've had a second score to Clay, and he missed some routine passes he should have hit. The big 1 was a deep shot to an open Wallace that Tannehill completely whiffed on. He also completely misfired toward Clay for a potential score, so Clay fittingly paid Tannehill back with that aforementioned drop.    Wallace, who caught Tannehill's sole score, posted 5 catches for 51 yards. He was behind Jarvis Landry in both categories, as the rookie snatched 7 balls for 53 yards. Landry, who also had a good return, has been tremendous in his first season.    The Dolphins did not run the ball very well. Lamar Miller, who was questionable entering this contest, did very little (4-10). "

   "comment":"Landry's knee was down. Coleman reviewed it, but let the touchdown stand, either because he was too senile to understand what was going on, or he or someone associated with him had a big wager on the Dolphins.    Coleman was 1 of the 2 major reasons the Dolphins were able to prevail. The second was the Miami defensive front, which absolutely dominated the trenches after halftime. The Bills couldn't convert a single third down in the second half because the pressure was just too overwhelming. Orton barely had any time in the pocket and missed open receivers as a result. He didn't commit a turnover, but he easily could have, as Louis Delmas dropped a pass thrown right to him. Orton went 22-of-39 for 193 yards, but was just 10-of-22 for 93 yards following intermission. He was solid early, finding Chris Hogan repeatedly to move the chains in the first half. Orton only had issues in the red zone early on, but he had major problems doing anything after halftime, as the Miami defense made the appropriate adjustments, while the Bills' coaching staff was befuddled, as usual.    Buffalo's defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, was guilty of some stupid play-calling as well. Schwartz, for reasons unknown, blitzed the Dolphins on too many occasions. Doing so failed every time, as Ryan Tannehill was able to hit an open receiver with a quick pass that always seemed to turn into a big gain. There was absolutely no reason for Schwartz to blitz, as the Bills had a front 4 that could get to Tannehill, who was missing his left tackle. Buffalo registered 5 sacks, including 3.5 from Mario Williams, who was sporting red contact lenses, but Schwartz stupidly sent extra rushers unnecessarily. He paid the price every time, yet he just didn't seem to realize that he was costing his team. Schwartz's incompetence helped Tannehill thrive Thursday night, as he completed 26-of-34 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tannehill made only a couple of bad throws. He missed Mike Wallace on a deep bomb, and he nearly threw an interception at the very end. He also lost a fumble in the red zone in the first half and took a big loss on a sack (12 yards), but he was on point most of the evening. He even had an impressive juke on a Buffalo defender on a 15-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter.    Lamar Miller's effectiveness was a surprise. Expected to be limited, Miller gashed the Bills' strong run defense for 86 yards on only 15 carries. The Bills, conversely, couldn't run the ball at all. Anthony Dixon (10-35) picked up some short-yardage conversions, while Bryce Brown's only positive take-away as a runner was that he didn't fumble. Brown gained just 14 yards on 6 carries.    I mentioned earlier that Tannehill missed Wallace on a deep shot. That ruined the night for Wallace, who led the team in targets (7), yet was able to produce only 4 catches for 38 yards. Brian Hartline paced the team in receiving (3-55), while Landry (5-46) and Brandon Gibson (2-13) both found the end zone."

Tannehill finished 22-of-34 for 226 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he made numerous mistakes that even prompted picking podcast co-host Matvei to text me, I hope for Miami's sake that Tannehill signed his contract extension in pencil. He was a bit better in the second half, but he still had a very disappointing showing.    The hero of the game, Landry caught 8 out of 12 targets thrown to him for 53 yards to go along with that return touchdown. He finished only behind "

   "comment":"Landry's hands. Meanwhile, the offensive line was brutal. Tannehill barely had any time to throw. Still, he missed on several deep throws, and the other 2 picks were his fault. Tannehill also missed Jordan Cameron badly for a big gain when he threw behind him, and his deep passes didn't have any sort of touch. Tannehill figures to rebound, as his team, much like the Jets, was distracted heading into London. I'd buy Tannehill low if he didn't have a tough matchup against New York coming up.    I listed Rishard Matthews as a add last week, and he responded with a 6.catch, 113-yard, 2.touchdown output against Buffalo. Granted, most of that came in garbage time, but fantasy stats late mean as much as they do early. Meanwhile, Jarvis Landry caught 8 balls for 67 yards. He led the team with 13 targets, but 1 of the failed conversions was the aforementioned interception.    "

The Dolphins' defense and special teams gave Cutler the ball back near the 50-yard line with just over 3 minutes remaining. Ajayi ran the ball about 15 yards, and that set up Parkey, who was good on a 54-yard field goal to give the Dolphins a 19-17 lead. Rivers got the ball at his own 20 with a 61 seconds and 2 timeouts. Rivers proceeded to hit Allen and Henry (7-80) on 2 passes to get the ball to midfield in only 11 seconds. A 10-yard pass to Gordon and a penalty on Miami moved it to the 35. With 10 seconds left though, Koo missed a 44-yard field goal wide right. It was Koo's second miss of the game on a makeable field goal.    Rivers was 31-of-39 for 331 yards with 1 touchdown. Overall, the Chargers' revamped offensive line played well as Miami had only 1 sack in the game. Rivers had a consistently clean pocket to pass from.    Gordon had only 9 carries for 13 yards and a touchdown, but he did have 7 receptions for 65 yards. Allen led the Chargers in receiving with 9 catches for 100 yards.    Cutler was 24-of-33 for 230 yards with 1 touchdown, while Ajayi tallied 122 yards on 28 carries. Parker led the Dolphins in receiving with 4 receptions for 85 yards.   "

Only 2 other Dolphins caught multiple passes.    Ryan, meanwhile, had just a middling performance against a weak back 7. He finished 24-of-35 for 248 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick at the end of the game. The issue I had with Atlanta's game plan was that the team ran the ball so often on first down, putting Ryan in constant long-yardage situations. Ryan converted those in the opening half, but didn't have nearly as much success after the break. Prior to the final drive, Atlanta mustered only 45 yards in the second half!    "

In the wake of Jay Ajayi's departure, Kenyan Drake and Damien Williams split touches. Drake had more carries than Williams, 9-7, and outgained him 69-14, thanks to a 42-yard burst. However, Drake hurt his team with a lost fumble in the red zone when Miami led 6-3. Instead of taking control of the game, the Dolphins saw the Raiders capitalize with a score of their own following the turnover. Drake and Williams caught 6 passes each for 35 and 47 yards, respectively, with Williams scoring once aerially. Williams also had a long reception negated by a Landry hold.   "

They were able to reach the end zone twice, marking the first time they scored a touchdown in an opening half in 5 games! Tampa Bay maintained a 20-3 lead, but the Dolphins engineered a comeback with Matt Moore, who was tremendous in replacing Cutler, who was concussed. Moore actually tied the game at 20, but the Buccaneers were able to move into field-goal range on the final possession of the game to secure the victory.    Cutler should probably be removed as Miami's starting quarterback, at least for the next game. The Dolphins were so lethargic with Cutler, who went 6-of-12 for 83 yards, 1 touchdown and the 3 picks. Moore was so much better (17-of-28, 282 yards, 1 touchdown), and his numbers could've been even better because he was robbed of a touchdown when Julius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference. The call was completely bogus, as the FOX announcers pointed out.    The Dolphins should also think about removing DeVante Parker from the starting unit. Parker was awful in this contest, as he was responsible for 2 interceptions. Kenny Stills was much better, catching 7 of his 8 targets for a whopping 180 yards and a touchdown. Jarvis Landry (6-95) also had a score, and he drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Meanwhile, Parker (4-26) never really did anything positive. The Dolphins have been disgruntled with Parker's work ethic, so this type of performance is not surprising in the slightest.
