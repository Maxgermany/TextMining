  "comment":"Akiem Hicks to put pressure on Cam Newton all day. Newton was sacked 5 times, and never looked comfortable in the pocket. At points, it didn't look like he was fully healthy, and he seemed to be limping around the field a bit. Without protection, Newton was scrambling too often, and his accuracy suffered as a result. Newton frequently missed his receivers when he was in motion and had to settle for checkdowns.    While this was not Newton's best performance, he still did have some nice moments. Early in the contest, he made some nice midfield strikes to his receivers. But as the game went along, the pressure got to him. He finished 21-of-34 with 211 yards and 2 picks, though he also ran for 50 yards on 9 carries. The second pick wasn't his fault, as it glanced off ",
