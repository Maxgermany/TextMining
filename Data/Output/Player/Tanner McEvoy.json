   "comment":"Tanner McEvoy. That said, Wilson definitely wasn't himself. He couldn't move around at all, losing 5 yards on 5 scrambles. One of his only real rushing attempts caused him to fall down helplessly for a loss. Despite this, Wilson was able to perform on a high level because his offensive line held up. The Jets supposedly have a great defensive front, but that wasn't apparent in this contest, as they struggling to put pressure on Wilson, sacking the immobile quarterback only twice throughout the afternoon.    Speaking of injured players, "

  "comment":"Tanner McEvoy for 53 yards to the Texans' 7.yard line. The next play saw Wilson roll out and hit Richardson for a short touchdown to tie the game at 21 at halftime. In the third quarter, Houston produced a field-goal drive. The Seahawks then got a 66-yard gain after Houston had busted coverage to let fullback "
