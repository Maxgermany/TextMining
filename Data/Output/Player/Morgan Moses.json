  "comment":"Morgan Moses. The Redskins had their entire offensive line, save for their center and terrible left guard, on the field for this game, but Moses getting knocked out destroyed Washington's chances. That's because the Redskins had to use a backup to block DeMarcus Lawrence, who has been 1 of the top edge rushers in the league this year. Lawrence was the 1 who forced the aforementioned strip-sack on Cousins. Moses' absence forced Cousins into many short throws. Cousins had to dink and dunk too often far too often. He was able to make some nice throws, but it was telling that the Redskins had no faith in their ability to block the Cowboys when they settled for ineffective screens and swing passes on third-and-8s. Cousins finished 26-of-37 for 251 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The first pick was Crowder's fault, while the second was a desperation throw, down 31-14 in the 4.h quarter. Cousins did what he could, and he even had a brilliant play where he completed a 33-yard pass to Crowder while falling down, but the blocking simply didn't hold up.    Speaking of Crowder, he finished with 5 catches for 67 yards, trailing only Ryan Grant (5-76), who scored a touchdown, but also had a bad drop. It was a nice PPR performance from Crowder, but he killed his team with those 2 horrible mistakes. Josh Doctson, meanwhile, also found the end zone, catching 3 passes for 26 yards in the process. He dropped a pass as well. It's clear that the Redskins need a No. 1 wideout. Here are the .    ",
