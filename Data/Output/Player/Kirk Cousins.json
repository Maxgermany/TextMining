   "comment":"Kirk Cousins. Myself included. I liked Cousins as a prospect, but I thought a mid-round selection would have been better spent on a player to help Griffin or an anemic defense. What purpose would Cousins serve? If Washington used him, it would mean that Griffin either struggled or suffered an injury, which would be counterproductive because a 4.h-round pick would perhaps help prevent that from happening. Well, it looks like Shanahan and the front office knew what they were doing all along. Cousins was awesome in his first career NFL start. He went 3.and-out on his first drive and then was picked off, which ultimately resulted in a Cleveland touchdown, but he was on fire after that. Cousins finished 26-of-37 for 329 yards, 2 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was especially sharp in the second half, going 15-of-18 for 183 yards and a score. Cousins will be relegated to the bench next week if Robert Griffin is ready to play, but it has to be assuring that Cousins can step in and perform well in the event of an injury to the franchise quarterback. For the long term, the Redskins can trade Cousins for an early-round selection. This performance was very impressive considering that Cleveland's defense had been on fire heading into this contest.    As for the other rookie quarterback, "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins' yardage. Out of 197, Garcon accumulated 144 off 11 catches. He also found the end zone on a play that actually counted.    Speaking of Cousins, he took a major step backward in this contest, going 21-of-36 for 197 yards, the touchdown to Garcon and an interception that was way behind his receiver. The numbers don't look too bad, but Cousins was pretty inaccurate throughout the afternoon. He was way behind his targets on too many occasions, and he was brutal after halftime, going 8-of-16 for just 65 yards and a short score following the break. Any team looking to trade for Cousins this offseason needs to keep in mind that he was this pedestrian against 1 of the worst defenses in football.    "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins. Foles, who was writhing in pain during the final few minutes of the game, went 28-of-42 for 325 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was way high on some throws, including the 1 apparent pick that fell through the defensive backs hands and hit the ground. He also missed Brent Celek for a 4.h potential score, though he had yet another near-score (to Jeremy Maclin) wiped out by a penalty. What Foles did was very impressive considering that he had absolutely no help from his running game. Save for an 18-yard carry by Darren Sproles, the Eagle backs did nothing on the ground. LeSean McCoy gained just 22 yards on 20 carries, as Philadelphia's banged-up front couldn't open up any lanes for him. McCoy left the game in the first half with an apparent concussion. The coaches kept McCoy's helmet away from him because of protocol, but McCoy tested negative and was able to return to action shortly afterward. Sproles, meanwhile, lost a fumble in Washington territory.    Two of Foles' touchdowns went to Jordan Matthews (8-59), who redeemed himself after a horrible Monday night performance. However, Maclin was still the team's leading receiver, hauling in 8 of his 10 targets for 154 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned, he had a score negated by a penalty. Riley Cooper, meanwhile, wasn't much of a factor with 4 grabs for 34 yards.    As for Kirk Cousins, he also played well, particularly in the opening half. He went 30-of-48 for 427 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because of a miscommunication with "

The defense was better, the running game had improved, and Cousins wasn't awful. All that changed in yet another blowout defeat to the Giants. It's astonishing how many errors the Redskins made in this game. Kirk Cousins' first completion was negated by offensive pass interference. "

The Buffalo players seemingly had no interest in tackling him; it was an appalling lack of effort, and it set the tone for the rest of the game - at least until it was out of reach. The Redskins ultimately established a 28-3 lead, but the Bills made it seem closer than it really was when the Redskins took their foot off the gas.    Cousins played brilliantly, misfiring on just 6 attempts. He went 22-of-28 for 319 yards and 5 touchdowns (4 passing, 1 rushing). Again, Buffalo didn't offer much resistance with its poor tackling and blown coverages, but Cousins deserves tons of credit regardless. He's been so much better than most people expected him to be.    Both "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins as his starting quarterback entering this season. Robert Griffin was the high-priced signal-caller Daniel Snyder wanted to command his team, but Gruden knew that giving Cousins the nod was the right decision for his team. Cousins was shaky to begin the year, throwing 8 interceptions to just 6 touchdowns in his first 6 weeks, but he has improved and has been playing on another level recently. In his previous 5 contests, Cousins has now thrown 11 scores to just 1 pick. Four of the touchdowns came in this victory, which allowed the Redskins to clinch the NFC East.    Cousins was on fire against the Eagles, who looked helpless trying to defend his precise passes. He went 31-of-46 for 365 yards and the 4 touchdowns. He had only a couple of negative plays. Two potential interceptions were dropped, and Cousins took a knee instead of spiking the ball to stop the clock at the end of the first half.

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins, it won't manifest itself this week. Cousins played somewhat well for the most part, going 21-of-35 for 296 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, Cousins appeared to have cost his team the game following a huge mental blunder just prior to intermission. He showed horrible clock management, failing to use a timeout after converting a long play. He finally spiked the ball with 11 seconds remaining. Following an incompletion, there were 6 seconds left, and it was clear Cousins had to fire a short pass and then have his kicker try a field goal. Cousins, however, held the ball for an eternity and was strip-sacked. It was almost as dumb as the time he kneeled instead of spiking the ball. Cousins has a nice skill set, but it's quite apparent that he struggles with the mental part of the game. In addition to that red-zone blunder, he also threw way short of the line to gain on multiple third downs. He was nearly picked on 1 occasion, so it's not like he was just being safe. Cousins made some great throws as well, but the mistakes can't keep happening if he wants to receive the huge contract he's been pining for.    Cousins had long touchdowns of 55 and 44 to "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins took advantage of this liability in the early going, as Jackson accumulated 51 receiving yards in the first quarter alone. Jackson only caught 1 pass after than (4 receptions, 55 yards), but that was part Cousins being inconsistent and part Jackson's ineptitude; Jackson dropped a touchdown at 1 point, though the Redskins ultimately found the end zone on the same drive. Speaking of Cousins, he struggled to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-34 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that happened to be a pick-six; Cousins launched the turnover off his back foot while under pressure. He panicked, and it was the sort of blunder Cousins has been guilty of far too often. Cousins was just 6-of-14 in the second half with a pass that was nearly intercepted in the end zone, as his inaccuracy allowed the Eagles to hang around. Fortunately for the Redskins, Philadelphia couldn't muster anything offensively, so it didn't matter at all.    Both of Cousins' touchdowns went to the players replacing Jordan Reed's production: "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins. Washington running back Matt Jones had a disastrous performance with 3 fumbles, including 1 into the end zone to take away critical points from his team. The Lions earned their third-straight win to stay in the playoff race, while the Redskins were dealt a blow with the Giants and Eagles both winning on Sunday.    Late in the first quarter, the Redskins got on the move with a completion to Niles Paul taking the ball across midfield. They moved the ball close to the end zone, but Matt Jones had his second fumble of the game and the Lions recovered the ball in the end zone to take points away from Washington. Detroit took advantage by getting on the move with a 27-yard screen pass to Golden Tate (6-93). That set up a 43-yard field goal for Matt Prater. The Redskins were set to tie the game at 3 thanks to completions to Jamison Crowder, but Dustin Hopkins missed a 45-yarder off the upright. On the final play of the half, Hopkins tied the game at 3. In the third quarter, the Lions got moving with an 18-yard run from Stafford and then a 52-yard bomb to Marvin Jones, who got a step on Josh Norman. Norman was injured on the play and went into the locker room with a concussion. A few plays later, Zach Zenner (9-29-1) plunged into end zone. Matt Jones then had his third fumble of the game, which was recovered by the Lions' Kerry Hyder. A shovel pass to Tate went for 22 yards, and the Lions expanded their lead to 13-3 early in the 4.h quarter. The Redskins responded with a touchdown drive to cut the lead to 13-10. The big play was Cousins hitting Vernon Davis (6-79) for a 27-yard reception to the Lions' 1-yard line, and that set up a short touchdown pass to Robert Kelley. Chris Baker bull-rushed through Larry Warford to help get the ball back for the Redskins. Washington moved down the field with Chris Thompson receiving and running the ball into the red zone. Head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay made a great play call with a zone-read run that Cousins took into the end zone from 19 yards out. It caught Detroit's defense completely by surprise. The Redskins held a 17-13 lead with 1:05 to go. With the ball back, Stafford hit Marvin Jones on the run to get the ball to midfield and then took off on a scramble to get inside the 40-yard line. Andre Roberts (1-20) made a great leaping grab to move the ball inside the 20. With just under 30 seconds remaining, Stafford threw a frozen rope to Anquan Boldin (3-28-1) for an 18-yard touchdown pass to win the game for Detroit.    Stafford entered this game red hot, but the Redskins' defense put the clamps on him in the first 2 quarters while being aided by some dropped passes by his receivers. He was only 7-of-13 for 79 yards at the intermission, but came up big in crunch time to finish 18-of-29 for 266 yards with a touchdown. Stafford also ran for 32 yards.    Justin Forsett led the Lions with 33 yards on 8 carries, plus 2 receptions for 15 yards. Marvin Jones led Detroit with 4 catches for 94 yards.    Kirk Cousins completed 30-of-39 passes for 301 yards with a touchdown. Jamison Crowder (7-108) led Washington through the air.    Matt Jones (10-27) turned in a meltdown performance with 3 fumbles. Chris Thompson (12-73) should take over as the feature back for the Redskins.    Defensively, the Redskins ramped up the edge rush, with "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins in determining how large of a contract he would receive this offseason. A big performance in a victory would allow the Redskins to reach the playoffs, but if Cousins struggled, Washington would be stuck, and would probably have to resort to franchising its quarterback once again. Cousins didn't lead his team to victory, eliminating Washington in the process. However, Cousins didn't perform poorly. It's more like he didn't have much of a chance. Washington's offensive line was atrocious in this game. The Redskins couldn't block the Giants whatsoever, and Cousins was constantly hounded throughout the afternoon. Cousins took 4 sacks in the first 2.and-a-half quarters, as Washington couldn't get anything going offensively. It's not like Cousins held the ball too long in the pocket or anything; he simply didn't have any time to throw. He was being brought down before he could make any sort of progressions, which would explain why the Redskins mustered just 83 net yards of offense in the opening half. Something clicked in the 4.h quarter, however, as the Redskins engineered a couple of scoring drives. They managed to come back from down 10-0 to tie the game. However, following a New York field goal, set up by a deep "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins' obvious incomplete pass as a fumble at the very end. But as someone who has been screwed by countless horrendous calls throughout the years, I'll take it.    The Eagles were far and away the better team in this contest. While the score remained close for a majority of the game, the Redskins were clearly outplayed in every aspect. It all started with the poor performance of their offensive leader, Kirk Cousins. After a rocky preseason, Cousins just looked off for most of the day. During the 2016 season, the Redskins quarterback struggled out of the gate and led the team to 2 losses. Many of the same issues were prevalent in this defeat. Cousins struggled mightily with his accuracy throughout the contest. He consistently overthrew his receivers, and that caused many of the team's problems throughout the day. One of his most egregious overthrows came in in the 4.h quarter. With the Eagles leading 19-17, the Redskins were in the red zone and threatening to take the lead. Cousins threw a short pass that sailed over "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins. Cousins had 1 of his best performances of the season en route to the team's victory. Despite getting little production from his run offense, Cousins was able to find ways to move the ball and get things done himself. For a good chunk of the contest, the Redskins ran successful screen plays that Cousins helped to orchestrate. He used his eyes to look the 49ers off the back coming out and was able to get the ball to his teammates for big gains. Cousins also helped to make up for the lack of rushing offense by carrying the ball himself, totaling 27 yards and a touchdown on 3 carries. Cousins' throws were almost all accurate, save for 1 that was behind an intended receiver early in the game. For the most part, he was able to put the passes right in front of the receivers and let them make the catch in stride. His touchdown passes were things of beauty. On the first, he hit "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins had the worst 2-minute drill of all time in this game. With no timeouts, he attempted a slip screen, which had his teammate tackled in the middle of the field, and then he attempted a screen, which would've resulted in the same outcome had the pass not been tipped and picked. Does Cousins know that the clock stops if a player goes out of bounds?    The Redskins were leading this game for most of the first half, but it looked like it was going to be a close battle. Washington was attempting to extend its lead to 16-7 on a field goal attempt when the momentum abruptly shifted. The kick was blocked by Dallas and returned all the way to the Redskins' 5-yard line, from where Ezekiel Elliott punched it in for a touchdown. That gave the Cowboys a 14-13 lead from which they never looked back from.    During the contest, the Cowboys heavily relied on Ezekiel Elliott to carry them. From the start, they were content to hand the ball off to Elliott and allow him to shred the Redskins' defense. Washington was missing 2 key members of its front 7. Jonathan Allen and Mason Foster, leaving the home team unable to stop Elliott. On many plays, Elliott was able to run straight through the defense. His offensive line provided excellent blocking for a majority of the day, and there were several instances where he went untouched for at least 5 yards. Elliott finished the day with 33 carries for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he should continue to succeed, provided that he doesn't get suspended.    Elsewhere on offense, Dak Prescott had an efficient game, but wasn't asked to do much. Given the success of Elliott, Prescott just had to focus on completing short passes on third-and-shorts to convert first downs. The Cowboys did that well in most areas, expect for in the red zone. Prescott's ended up going 14-of-22 for 143 yards. He also scrambled for 16 yards in this uneventful performance. He did what was asked of him, but will have much bigger performances in the future, especially if Elliott gets suspended.    Because of the general lack of passing plays called on Sunday, the Cowboys' receivers didn't need to do much in the contest. Dez Bryant (4-39) was the leading receiver, and he was actually frustrated that he didn't get more targets on the afternoon. Bryant is a WR2 most weeks in fantasy, but he has upside as a WR1 if Elliott is suspended. As for the other receivers, Jason Witten (3-35) and Terrance Williams (2-36) led the way. Witten is a fine TE2 and can be used as a streamer in good matchups, but for the most part, Bryant is the only Cowboys pass catcher who is worth owning.    Kirk Cousins had a pretty strong day for the Redskins. Though his stat line may not look like anything more than average - 26-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 pick - he did well in the very rainy conditions. Cousins' ball placement was very good, but he was victimized by drops from his receivers and a couple of throws that were taken by gusts of wind. For the most part, he was able to hit his receivers with accurate passes. Cousins' best throw came on his touchdown pass to Doctson. Cousins showed poise in the pocket and took a hit while delivering a perfect strike to Doctson in the back of the end zone. It was lofted just over the linebacker where only Doctson could get it. Cousins has clutch abilities, and that will help him get a big deal if he hits the open market this offseason.    Though the receivers didn't play particularly well for the Redskins on Sunday, they finally got 1 of their top guys going. "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins had the worst 2-minute drill of all time in this game. With no timeouts, he attempted a slip screen, which had his teammate tackled in the middle of the field, and then he attempted a screen, which would've resulted in the same outcome had the pass not been tipped and picked. Does Cousins know that the clock stops if a player goes out of bounds?    The Redskins were leading this game for most of the first half, but it looked like it was going to be a close battle. Washington was attempting to extend its lead to 16-7 on a field goal attempt when the momentum abruptly shifted. The kick was blocked by Dallas and returned all the way to the Redskins' 5-yard line, from where Ezekiel Elliott punched it in for a touchdown. That gave the Cowboys a 14-13 lead from which they never looked back from.    During the contest, the Cowboys heavily relied on Ezekiel Elliott to carry them. From the start, they were content to hand the ball off to Elliott and allow him to shred the Redskins' defense. Washington was missing 2 key members of its front 7. Jonathan Allen and Mason Foster, leaving the home team unable to stop Elliott. On many plays, Elliott was able to run straight through the defense. His offensive line provided excellent blocking for a majority of the day, and there were several instances where he went untouched for at least 5 yards. Elliott finished the day with 33 carries for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns, and he should continue to succeed, provided that he doesn't get suspended.    Elsewhere on offense, Dak Prescott had an efficient game, but wasn't asked to do much. Given the success of Elliott, Prescott just had to focus on completing short passes on third-and-shorts to convert first downs. The Cowboys did that well in most areas, expect for in the red zone. Prescott's ended up going 14-of-22 for 143 yards. He also scrambled for 16 yards in this uneventful performance. He did what was asked of him, but will have much bigger performances in the future, especially if Elliott gets suspended.    Because of the general lack of passing plays called on Sunday, the Cowboys' receivers didn't need to do much in the contest. Dez Bryant (4-39) was the leading receiver, and he was actually frustrated that he didn't get more targets on the afternoon. Bryant is a WR2 most weeks in fantasy, but he has upside as a WR1 if Elliott is suspended. As for the other receivers, Jason Witten (3-35) and Terrance Williams (2-36) led the way. Witten is a fine TE2 and can be used as a streamer in good matchups, but for the most part, Bryant is the only Cowboys pass catcher who is worth owning.    Kirk Cousins had a pretty strong day for the Redskins. Though his stat line may not look like anything more than average - 26-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 pick - he did well in the very rainy conditions. Cousins' ball placement was very good, but he was victimized by drops from his receivers and a couple of throws that were taken by gusts of wind. For the most part, he was able to hit his receivers with accurate passes. Cousins' best throw came on his touchdown pass to Doctson. Cousins showed poise in the pocket and took a hit while delivering a perfect strike to Doctson in the back of the end zone. It was lofted just over the linebacker where only Doctson could get it. Cousins has clutch abilities, and that will help him get a big deal if he hits the open market this offseason.    Though the receivers didn't play particularly well for the Redskins on Sunday, they finally got 1 of their top guys going. "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins for the win. In the first 58 minutes of the contest, the team was barely able to do anything on offense. The run game was going nowhere, and the receivers were having trouble stepping up against the Seattle secondary. And with the Redskins down by 4 with just a couple minutes left, things looked hopeless. However, Cousins delivered with 1 of his best drives of the season. The possession only lasted 4 plays. After initially tossing an incompletion, Cousins connected on a throw to "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins had a very good showing for the Redskins. For the first time in a long while, he had all 5 of his starting offensive linemen available to play. The group gave Cousins the best protection he had in weeks, and it showed. Early on, Cousins took advantage of the better blocking and was able to methodically march the Redskins down the field. He threw a near-perfect ball to "

   "comment":"Kirk Cousins for the overall struggles of the team. He was 1 of the more consistent players for Washington, and he was able to help the Redskins consistently move the ball. Much like the Washington defense, New Orleans' stop unit had trouble allowing receivers to break open at times. There were a few throws that Cousins made to wide-open members of his receiving corps, and he was right on the money for all of them. Cousins did well to scan the field and find the best player to throw to. If anything, this performance strengthened Cousins' case as a franchise quarterback, though his inability to lead a game-winning drive was a bit concerning. That said, in overtime, Cousins had 2 passes dropped and was sacked for a big loss on second down. The sack may have been his fault, but both of the drops were catchable plays. Overall, Cousins finished 22-of-32 for 322 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, his stat line should have been even better, given that his receivers made some critical drops throughout the day.    Cousins finally appears to have a receiving corps he is comfortable with. He had 3 top targets during Sunday's contest. They were "
