It should have gone for more but Brandon Marshall dropped his second touchdown of the game. He is 1 of the league leaders in drops, and his 2 early in the game looked like they would be costly. His concentration and focus are terrible. If Marshall could get his head straight, he would be a much better receiver. Moore blew a scoring chance in the third quarter when he fumbled the ball away deep in Buffalo territory. A bit later, Marshall made up for his drops with a 65-yard touchdown on a go route. The pass was thrown in perfectly by Moore to Marshall, who made a nice over-the-shoulder catch while burning cornerback Drayton Florence. The reception put Marshall over 1,000 yards on the season for the fifth straight year. The afternoon got very sloppy in the third quarter. Dolphin safety Reshad Jones caught a deflected pass for an interception. On the Bills' next drive, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw his third interception to Davis (for his second) when he out-fought Stevie Johnson on a ball lofted downfield. The Bills made it 23-13 after a short touchdown pass to Spiller. Fitzpatrick threw an interception on the 2.point attempt. Late in the third quarter, and then early in the 4.h quarter, Bush was running well and moving the ball for the Dolphins. Miami's offensive line was winning the battle up front and doing a good job of opening up lanes and getting to the second level of the defense. Bush sealed the game with a 76-yard touchdown jaunt. He ran through a big hole and broke a tackle from Jarius Byrd to sprint downfield for the score. Bush had a few other highlight-reel runs in the game including an ankle-breaking spin move to juke a defender. He finished with 203 yards on 25 carries with a touchdown. Fitzpatrick attempted a comeback with a short touchdown toss to "

The team didn't even punt until midway through the third quarter.    Pittsburgh's blemishes on offense were few and far between. Dri Archer had a drop; LeGarrette Blount coughed up a possession; while Darrius Heyward-Bey, who appeared to be playing the sleeper agent role, lost a fumble while getting up after a reception, allowing the Colts to score a touchdown to help fuel their attempted comeback. They ultimately fell short, however, as Pittsburgh was too forceful, converting 8-of-13 third downs.    Two players caught multiple Roethlisberger touchdowns. Those were Antonio Brown, who was able to have a big game with 10 catches for 133 yards because of Davis' absence, and Martavis Bryant, who exploded for 5 grabs for 83 yards in his second NFL game."

As for the Redskins, their decision to turn to Colt McCoy didn't exactly backfire, as McCoy wasn't responsible for this loss. After all, it's not his fault that the defense allowed so many big gains with blown coverages. McCoy actually performed quite well, going 31-of-47 for 392 yards and 3 touchdowns.

Osweiler later overthrew Tyler Ervin in the end zone and then pulled a Blaine Gabbert by tossing a 4-yard pass on a third-and-8 near the red zone. It only got worse for Osweiler afer that, as he fired a pick on a pass behind DeAndre Hopkins, which Davis impressively secured. Several of Osweiler's other passes were way off the mark. By halftime, Osweiler was just 7-of-17 for 64 yards. The crowd continuously booed him, and many of the fans left he game early. They'll regret not sticking around, however, as something clicked for Osweiler. He was on fire beginning at the end of the third quarter, and he managed to go 18-of-22 for 205 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. Osweiler was going to receive a ton of criticism for choking in this game, so it was absolutely imperative for him to keep his critics at bay for now.    Osweiler's final numbers looked like this: 25-of-39, 269 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 pick. He was locked in on Hopkins, who caught 9 passes for 71 yards. Osweiler focused in too much on Hopkins at times, though that paid off late. Davis had Hopkins' number early on, but the stud receiver got the better of the veteran cornerback in the final quarter and overtime. Osweiler's touchdowns went to "

Roethlisberger could've posted a better stat line, but there were a couple of drops, 1 by Sammie Coates that would've moved the chains on a third-and-12.    All of Roethlisberer's touchdowns were hauled in by Antonio Brown, who made Davis look completely incompetent. It's a shame for Davis, as he's clearly not 100 percent. Thus, it was impossible for him to keep up with the best receiver in football. Brown caught 5 passes for 91 yards. Roethlisberger spent most of the evening targeting Brown, as only 3 other Steelers caught multiple passes, and only 1 other logged more than 2 catches. "
