   "comment":"Chris Perry received all but 2 carries for the Bengals, but totaled just 37 yards. If you're a Perry owner, don't worry; the Ravens had the top run defense in the NFL last season, per YPC numbers.    In a matchup between a veteran and a rookie quarterback, the former looked like the latter and vice-versa. Palmer was 10-of-25 for 99 yards and an interception. Baltimore's defense and a shoulder injury combined to shut down Chad Ocho Cinco, limiting him to 1 catch for 22 yards. It's either that, or Palmer hasn't followed the news and didn't recognize who that Ocho Cinco guy was.    Leave it to the Bengals to use a timeout on a 4.h-and-one in the second half, only to turn the ball over on downs. Good job preserving those timeouts, Marvin. Guess you could have used 1 when the Ravens were running out the clock, huh?   "

Going back to Perry, the former No. 1 pick couldn't do anything positive on the ground, as he rushed for 31 yards on 13 carries. Perry fumbled right after the Bengals recovered an onside kick in the 4.h quarter.
