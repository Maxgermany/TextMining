   "comment":"Perry received all but 2 carries for the Bengals, but totaled just 37 yards. If you're a Perry owner, don't worry; the Ravens had the top run defense in the NFL last season, per YPC numbers.    In a matchup between a veteran and a rookie quarterback, the former looked like the latter and vice-versa. Palmer was 10-of-25 for 99 yards and an interception. Baltimore's defense and a shoulder injury combined to shut down Chad Ocho Cinco, limiting him to 1 catch for 22 yards. It's either that, or Palmer hasn't followed the news and didn't recognize who that Ocho Cinco guy was.    Leave it to the Bengals to use a timeout on a 4.h-and-one in the second half, only to turn the ball over on downs. Good job preserving those timeouts, Marvin. Guess you could have used 1 when the Ravens were running out the clock, huh?   "
