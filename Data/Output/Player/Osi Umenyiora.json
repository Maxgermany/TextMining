That is their job I'm confident they are doing it and will do it. We've had 5 great years with the second most wins in the league. Second to only the Patriots, and the most in the NFC. It is disheartening at 2-8 with expectations that were reasonable coming into this year.  Blank said he absolutely has confidence in head coach Mike Smith and general manager Thomas Dimitroff. They've earned it over the last 5 years. They're proven leaders, proven by success and their records. They'll do the work that has to be done with my full support.    Future Hall of Famer "
