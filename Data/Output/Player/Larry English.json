   "comment":"Larry English, who has had made the case for being a first-round bust. English's sack was the big play that forced the field goal. English also recorded his second sack of the season. It was a coverage sack when Moore stepped up in the pocket next to English, and he took a couple steps to the quarterback away from left tackle "
