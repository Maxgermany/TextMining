The Packers recovered the attempt and were set up at midfield in prime position to get a game-clinching score. Rodgers made the Tampa Bay pay with a perfect pass he dropped into Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown. . After a terrible game last week, the Buccaneers dug deep and played the Packers really tough. Rodgers' accuracy was off frequently in the game and he didn't look like his normal self against Tampa Bay. Green Bay's defense is showing some weakness with the amount of yards they are giving up. That could come back to bite them in the postseason. Freeman was 28-of-38 for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Winslow caught 9 passes for 132 yards, while Blount ran for 107 yards on 18 carries. Rodgers was 23-of-34 for 299 yards with 3 scores and an interception.

The next Buccaneers' drive was almost as fruitless as the previous 1, since on the fifth play, defensive end John Abraham strip-sacked Freeman to set up another Falcons touchdown. Michael Turner has looked slow and washed up the last 5 weeks or so, but Tampa Bay's anemic run defense was the perfect remedy for him. He ran into the end zone on a fourth-and-goal to put Atlanta up 28-0. The Buccaneers got the ball back for less than a minute since Falcons linebacker Curtis Lofton intercepted Freeman (31-of-45, 274 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) on the drive's third play, returning the pick 26-yards for a touchdown. It was an ugly play where Tampa Bay running back Kregg Lumpkin got blasted by teammate, Kellen Winslow, leaving Lofton as the only player in position to catch the ball. On Atlanta's next possession, Turner capped the Falcons' collection of 42 unanswered points, with an 81-yard touchdown run. The Buccaneers finally got on the board with a short touchdown from Freeman to Briscoe on the next drive. At halftime Falcons were up 42-7, and Ryan had already been replaced by backup Chris Redmond.    Ryan was 6-of-9 for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns.
