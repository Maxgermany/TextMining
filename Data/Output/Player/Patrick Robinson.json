With his rookie contract winding down, Freeman did himself a lot of damage with another ugly inaccurate performance. With the way he is playing, starting competition for 2013 seems more in order rather than a lucrative contract extension.   "

   "comment":"Robinson rushed for 89 yards and the decisive touchdown on 21 carries.    Graham, as mentioned, was knocked out of the game with a shoulder injury. He caught just 2 balls for 36 yards and frustrated his fantasy owners with a pair of drops, including 1 in the red zone that would've set up a first-and-goal early on.    With Graham out, all Brees could do was throw short passes to Pierre Thomas and Brandin Cooks. Thomas caught 8 balls for 77 yards and 2 total touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing), while Cooks logged 9 grabs for 56 yards. Marques Colston (3-63) had a big drop late in the game that was nearly a fumble. It was reminiscent of the play in which he coughed up a ball in overtime of the season opener in Atlanta.    As for the Buccaneers, Mike Glennon once again looked much more competent than Josh McCown ever did, going 19-of-32 for 249 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick wasn't even really his fault, as it was a great play by Patrick Robinson. There was a sequence in which Glennon was a perfect 8-of-8 for 92 yards over a span of 2 drives. However, he took a bad safety that ultimately allowed the Saints to tie the game. Glennon's scores went to "

In the second half, he missed an open Heath Miller for a touchdown and then made a terrible decision to throw late across his body for another near-interception, and he was picked off on a second occasion when a pass of his was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Roethlisberger finished 32-of-58 for 435 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. Ignore those numbers; most of them came in garbage time when this game was well out of hand. To illustrate how poorly he played, Roethlisberger was just 8-of-22 for 115 yards and a pick in the first half. Again, Roethlisberger was playing hurt, and the Steelers will need him to heal up quickly with a big game against the Bengals next week.    Meanwhile, the Steelers as a whole were discombobulated. They had careless penalties and appeared to lack any sense of desperation in the second half. One infraction, a defensive hold, negated a sack on Drew Brees that allowed the Saints to keep a drive alive. Give the Saints credit for taking advantage of the Steelers' injuries and errors. They didn't have a promising start though, as Marques Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson.
