He threw a strike to Gronkowski in the front of the end zone for the lead. To start the game-winning drive, Manning got a huge gain to Ballard. Manning tossed a ball down the seam, and Ballard made a leaping catch for 28 yards. Manning then scrambled for 12 yards. On the next play, he threw incomplete for Victor Cruz in the end zone but pass interference was called. That put the ball on the Patriot's 1-yard line. Manning threw incomplete for Ballard. Jacobs got stuffed on the next play. On third-and-goal, with 19 seconds remaining, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Ballard running an out route in the end zone. That completed New York's massive road win and saw the Giants improve to 6-2 on the season. For the night, Manning was 20-of-39 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Jacobs ran for 72 yards on 18 carries, while Cruz led the Giants in receiving with 6 receptions for 91 yards. Ballard caught 4 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28-of-49 passes for 342 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Giants had a good rush, but Brady missed some open receivers whom he normally hits. Brady seemed off against New York. Welker led New England in receiving with 9 receptions for 136 yards. Gronkowski had 8 grabs for 101 yards and 1 touchdown.   "
