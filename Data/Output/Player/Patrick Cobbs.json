   "comment":"Cobbs for 53 yards, TOUCHDOWN. (Direct snap to MIA #23, who handed to MIA #34, who handed to MIA #10, who threw the pass.) </i> NFL.com doesn't even know who the players are! They had to refer to them as numbers!    Yet another impressive performance by the Dolphins. I know Houston's defense is absolutely abysmal, but still - Miami barely could move the chains last year. Bill Parcells, Tony Sparano, and all of the Tuna's other minions deserve tons of credit.    Ronnie Brown didn't put up monstrous numbers (50 yards), but he carried the ball just 13 times and he scored a touchdown as well. Chad Pennington, meanwhile, was 19-of-25 for 284 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Pennington's 2 scores were 80- and 58-yard throws to Patrick Cobbs, which undoubtedly had Ted Ginn, Greg Camarillo and Anthony Fasano fantasy owners cursing in disgust."
