He was targeted just 3 times, with 1 of the passes resulting in an interception on what was a desperation into double coverage. The Steelers made the proper adjustments to take Megatron out of the game, prompting Stafford to force poor throws elsewhere. Stafford was dreadful as a result, going just 3-of-16 for 35 yards and the pick after the break, though he was hurt by some drops. His final numbers (19-of-46, 362 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception) were disappointing considering what he had going on at halftime. The Steelers, meanwhile, couldn't be stopped. "
