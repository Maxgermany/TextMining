Schaub's touchdowns went to DeVier Posey (3-47), who suffered an injury in the 4.h quarter, and Arian Foster, whose 7 catches for 47 yards complemented his 90 rushing yards and score on the ground on 22 carries. However, Foster struggled to run early on, and he was guilty of a dropped ball on what surely looked like it would be a long gain.    New England will host the Ravens next Sunday in what will be a rematch of last year's AFC Championship. The Patriots are so sound offensively and defensively, but they have to be concerned about kick coverage. Manning had 2 big kickoff returns, so Jacoby Jones, who has 3 special-teams touchdowns this season, has to be licking his chops. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
