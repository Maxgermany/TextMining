   "comment":"Ninkovich forced a fumble, which Vince Wilfork pounced on, to set up a Ridley touchdown and a 31-7 lead for New England.    After Denver went down by 24 points, Manning moved the ball down the field quickly on a few possessions. He finished drives with short touchdown throws to Eric Decker (4-21), Joel Dreessen (4-21) and Brandon Stokley (2-10). Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1-handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the fourth quarter on a fourth-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a fourth down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the fourth quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   "
