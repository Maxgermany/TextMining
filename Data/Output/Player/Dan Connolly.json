   "comment":"Connolly going down with an injury. Something else that needs to be noted was some questionable play-calling on the Patriots' part. New England had the ball at the New Orleans 9-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but ran it 3 straight times and had to settle for a field goal as a consequence.    Meanwhile, the New England defense did a hell of a job on the Saints' scoring attack. I didn't think anything could be done to stop Jimmy Graham, but Bill Belichick, who specializes in shutting down 1 aspect of the opposing offense, has Aqib Talib blanket the All-Pro tight end. Graham, who was limited to no catches - he had 1 drop, which was really a great play by Kyle Arrington - was helped into the locker room with a leg injury in the second half. Drew Brees looked a bit flustered without being able to go to Graham very much. After all, when do you see his team have 3 3.and-outs in a single half? When does Griffin miss a wide-open receiver (Nick Toon) for a touchdown? Would anyone have ever imagined Brees completing fewer than half of his passes? All of that happened, as Brees went 17-of-36 for 236 yards, 2 scores and an interception that was a weird lob after he tried calling timeout but was not granted the stoppage. Brees had some great throws - including a 34-yard touchdown strike to Kenny Stills (3-64) on a third-and-20.    Brees' other aerial score was vultured by Travaris Cadet. Marques Colston surprisingly was limited to just 1 reception for 11 yards.    The Saints ran the ball well, which wasn't a surprise because Vince Wilfork's absence continues to be huge. Pierre Thomas gained 51 yards on 11 carries, but the big star was Khiry Robinson, who tallied 53 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries.    Moving back to New England, the team suffered a quartet of injuries. In addition to Connolly, Aqib Talib, Jerod Mayo and Danny Amendola all had to leave the game."
