And then all hell broke loose. Or rather, things reverted to what people expected back in September. The Dolphins spent the rest of the first half turning the ball over. They had as many give-aways (3) as first downs. The Eagles, meanwhile, had 13 first downs, as QBDK hooked up on multiple long gains to DeSean Jackson (4-59, TD) and LeSean McCoy.    McCoy carried the ball 27 times, which will make Eagle fans happy. However, McCoy had just 38 yards (though with 2 touchdowns). He also had 3 catches for 33 receiving yards.    As for QBDK (15-of-30, 208 yards, TD, INT), it was an up-and-down afternoon. He made some great throws that Vince Young would have tossed for interceptions. On the other hand, QBDK could have easily been guilty of 3 picks. His 1 interception was horrible, as he heaved a pass across his body in the third quarter.    Moore, meanwhile, was worse. He went 11-of-19 for 95 yards, the aforementioned touchdown to Marshall, and an interception. He also lost a fumble. Moore was pulled in favor of J.P. Losman (6-of-10, 60 yards) because of a concussion. Part of the reason Moore had been so good in recent weeks was that his pass protection improved. That was far from the case today, as Miami's front surrendered a whopping 9 sacks.    Moore's poor outing didn't stop Reggie Bush from having a good game. Bush rushed for 103 yards on just 14 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 27 receiving yards.    I mentioned Taylor before. His 2 sacks moved him ahead of Richard Dent for 6.h all time in sacks. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
