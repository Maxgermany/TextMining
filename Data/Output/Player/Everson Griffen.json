Rodgers suffered through some drops from his receivers, but as I wrote earlier, he still doesn't seem like himself. One pass that stands out was a horrible miss to Jones that a healthy Rodgers would've hit 10 out of 10 times.    To illustrate how inefficient some of the Packer receivers were, Jones caught 4 passes for 102 yards, but it took him 13 targets to get there. Meanwhile, Cobb logged 6 catches, but for only 37 yards. He dropped a pass.    Green Bay's leading receiver aside from Jones, was Richard Rodgers (7-59), who scored a touchdown despite looking like the slowest person of all time. "
