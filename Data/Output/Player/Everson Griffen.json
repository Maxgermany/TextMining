   "comment":"Griffen, who had a huge outing with 3 sacks, managed to strip it. Orton then took a bad sack on a third down, as Buffalo's predictable run-run-pass play-calling didn't have the Vikings fooled at all. Meanwhile, some injuries didn't help. Fred Jackson (3-12) left early with a groin injury. I thought this might be a blessing in disguise because it would force Buffalo's coaching staff to utilize C.J. Spiller much more. Sure enough, Spiller burst for a 53-yard gain on his first carry, but had to be carted off after the play. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with a broken collarbone. This forced Anthony Dixon to rush the ball exclusively, as the Bills didn't have any other active halfbacks on the roster. Dixon responded by gaining 51 yards on 13 attempts.    Orton ultimately won the game during the final drive. It looked like the Bills would be dead on a couple of occasions; they were stuck on a 4.h-and-20, while Orton was flagged for intentional grounding at another point. However, Orton converted the former situation with a 24-yard completion to Scott Chandler. Orton then launched a 29-yard bomb to Chris Hogan, who was tackled at the 1-yard line with just 5 seconds remaining. He found Sammy Watkins in the end zone on the next play for the decisive score. Orton finished 31-of-43 for 283 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception and the lost fumble. Aside from the turnovers, Orton did a solid job of moving the chains throughout the afternoon despite not having his top 2 running backs, as the Bills achieved 22 first downs.    Watkins had a huge outing. He hurt his team early with a drop in the red zone, but more than made up for it by securing 9 of his 14 targets for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Hogan (5-63) was the only other Bill with more than 40 receiving yards.    As for the Vikings, Teddy Bridgewater had a roller coaster of an afternoon. He struggled early on, completing just 3 of his first 10 passes. One incompletion was actually caught by Buffalo corner Leodis McKelvin on a horrible forced throw. His second pick, also to McKelvin, was even worse. Bridgewater caught fire after that, leading a 5.play, 60-yard touchdown drive that culminated with a 4.yard score to Cordarrelle Patterson, though Greg Jennings was the main receiver on the drive. Bridgewater, who finished 15-of-26 for 157 yards, with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, managed to complete just 4 passes after halftime, however. Pass protection was a huge issue, as Matt Kalil was once again anemic. It looked like he just stopped blocking Buffalo linemen in some instances. He surrendered multiple sacks, which disrupted a couple of promising drives. He also negated a Bridgewater 15-yard completion to Chase Ford with an illegal-hands-to-the-face infraction, and he followed that up by surrendering a sack to Jerry Hughes. It's amazing how terrible Kalil has gotten. He needs to be benched.    Bridgewater's sole score, as mentioned, went to Patterson, who managed to catch just 2 passes for 9 yards. Jennings was the team's leading receiver with 6 grabs for 77 yards.    Jerick McKinnon had another strong performance, gaining 103 yards on just 19 carries. Matt Asiata (6-24) wasn't much of a factor, but the Vikings curiously gave him an attempt on an early third-and-5, which he had no chance to convert.    Several Minnesota defenders stood out despite the loss. I already mentioned Griffen, who was incredible. Rookie "

One pass that stands out was a horrible miss to Jones that a healthy Rodgers would've hit 10 out of 10 times.    To illustrate how inefficient some of the Packer receivers were, Jones caught 4 passes for 102 yards, but it took him 13 targets to get there. Meanwhile, Cobb logged 6 catches, but for only 37 yards. He dropped a pass.    Green Bay's leading receiver aside from Jones, was Richard Rodgers (7-59), who scored a touchdown despite looking like the slowest person of all time. "
