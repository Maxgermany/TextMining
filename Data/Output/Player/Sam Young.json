   "comment":"Young, who took over for Joeckel, was anemic. If he has to start going forward, the Jaguars may not score any points against anyone.    Going back to Newton, his numbers definitely could've been better. Ted Ginn (2-54) dropped a touchdown, and then Greg Olsen had a score nullified by his own offensive pass interference, which was completely unnecessary because he would've caught the ball had he kept running. Newton's pick was probably a miscommunication, as the pass sailed to no 1 in particular.    You may notice that Olsen disappointed, logging just 1 reception for 11 yards. The Jaguars were determined to take him out of the game, using bracket coverage constantly throughout the afternoon. The interference call really hurt his fantasy owners. Because of this performance, Olsen could be obtained as a buy-low target in fantasy leagues.    Jonathan Stewart didn't have much running room, gaining 56 yards on 18 carries, but with most of it (22 yards) coming on 1 attempt. He also caught 4 balls for 25 receiving yards.    As for the Jaguars, Bortles was anemic, going 22-of-40 for just 183 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The huge liability at left tackle really hurt him, but aside from a couple of impressive drives, he was woeful. His first pass was a poor overthrow, which was a sign of how the afternoon would go. One of the picks was taken back for 6, as he telegraphed the throw. The other happened because he was hit as he released the ball. He also took some bad sacks. A few weren't his fault, as Young looked like a human turnstile, but Bortles struggled to release the ball quickly enough.    Bortles' supporting cast didn't help him. I mentioned the offensive line on numerous occasions already, but the receivers let him down as well. "
