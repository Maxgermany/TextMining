   "comment":"Browner, who inexplicably fell down at the 1-yard line. Lynch punched it in 1 play later. Palmer simply can't function behind this offensive line. For the Cardinals to improve in terms of being offensively consistent, they need to keep Palmer in shotgun on most plays, and they need to involve Ellington as much as possible. I don't care how small he is; Ellington must touch the ball 20 times. Perhaps a better game plan will keep Palmer more interested. He looked like he quit at the end, simply throwing away a pass on 4.h down because he was under pressure. He also fumbled earlier because he held the ball carelessly, but the ball trickled out of bounds.    "

   "comment":"Browner. There was some speculation that Ryan would play better in this contest because of Roddy White's return. White caught a 20-yard reception on the second drive, but didn't do anything after that despite being on the field for the majority of the game. He saw just 4 targets go his way.    Steven Jackson seemed to have a good matchup because Seattle's run defense has been leaky lately. Red Bryant being out only made it seem more lucrative. However, Jackson struggled yet again, mustering only 11 yards on 9 carries.    Ryan's leading receiver was Harry Douglas (7-49). Tony Gonzalez, who is rotting away on this putrid team for no apparent reason (why wasn't he traded?), had just 3 catches for 29 yards, as Ryan had major problems getting the ball to him the entire afternoon because of Kam Chancellor's coverage. Gonzalez complained of a toe injury afterward.    As for Wilson's wideouts, Golden Tate led the way with 6 grabs for 106 yards and an awesome, 1.handed touchdown. Jermaine Kearse had the other score to go along with 3 receptions for 75 yards. Doug Baldwin was also a factor (5-76).    Two Seattle defenders of note: Browner, who had the aforementioned dropped interception, suffered a hamstring injury in the first half. Linebacker "
