   "comment":"Nick Foles earlier in the season, but was afraid of losing the locker room as a result of benching the vastly overrated starter. Well, it appeared as though he didn't have the locker room anyway even though the quarterback change occurred in the wake of an injury. It's unreal how sloppy the Eagles were in the first half. Nick Foles threw an interception on the first drive because the ball went off Brent Celek's hands."

   "comment":"Nick Foles keeps this up, he's not getting fired. Sorry, Eagle fans. </i>    Ten years ago, the Buccaneers knocked out the Eagles on the road in the NFC Championship game. Philadelphia got a measure of revenge this Sunday by dealing a fatal blow to Tampa Bay's 2012 playoff hopes. The Bucs honored the 10-year anniversary of their Super Bowl Championship team with a reunion of the 2002 players and coaches, but the Eagles spoiled the celebration by ending their 2-month-long losing streak. Tampa Bay was lucky to almost get this win as Philadelphia outplayed the Buccaneers for the majority of the contest. Rookie quarterback Nick Foles was simply awesome. He was deadly on third down and would've had an even bigger day if his offensive line could've produced just an average performance.    In the second quarter, an insane catch by "

He had that aforementioned end-zone trip called back because of a penalty, while his quarterback overthrew him on 2 bombs. Jackson screwed up on his own, however.

   "comment":"Nick Foles could step in and operate Chip Kelly's offense once that happened. It's a small sample size, and it happened against a pathetic Giants' defense, but so far so good for Foles. QBDK suffered a hamstring injury at the end of the first half. He scrambled out of bounds for a decent gain, but pulled up and grabbed the back of his leg. He remained in the game for the duration of that drive, but showed no desire to run the ball after that. Foles entered on the next drive. He took over at his own 7-yard line, but led the team to a field goal on what would be the final drive of the first half. Foles ultimately finished 16-of-25 for 197 yards and 2 touchdowns. The difference in accuracy between Foles and QBDK was night and day. Foles can't run at all, but at least he was able to complete half of his passes. QBDK was 6-of-14 for 105 yards, but helped out with 79 rushing yards on 7 scrambles (including a 34-yard scamper on a third-and-19). The running ability is nice, but QBDK is such an injury liability because of that. The Eagles need to keep starting Foles so they can learn if they need to take a quarterback early in the 2014 NFL Draft.    "

The Glazers, the Bucs owners, and general manager Mark Dominik had to be thinking of what could have been with Chip Kelly. A Bucs source told me that Chip Kelly was Tampa Bay's head coach for 6 hours or so before changing his mind. Instead of landing Kelly, the organization hired Greg Schiano. The Bucs are now 7-14 under Schiano and 24-45 under Dominik with an 0-5 start to 2013. With the NFC East wide open, the Eagles showed they are just as dangerous, if not more so, with Nick Foles at quarterback.

   "comment":"Nick Foles' excellent first start at Tampa Bay last week was the result of the Buccaneers being distracted by all of their Staph infection problems (check out ). As awesome as Foles was last Sunday, he was even worse in this contest. Foles went 11-of-29 for 80 yards. That's good for a YPA of 2.8. Both starting running backs had a better yards-per-carry average. Foles was 0-for-6 following intermission. Foles' accuracy woes were disgusting. The Dallas pass rush had him hurried all afternoon, but that doesn't excuse him for missing his targets all afternoon. There was 1 occasion in which he had a wide-open "

   "comment":"Nick Foles, chosen way after Griffin in the 2012 NFL Draft, was the better quarterback on the field. He continuously torched Washington's helpless stop unit, going 17-of-26 for 298 yards along with 47 rushing yards and a touchdown on 9 scrambles. Foles would've had an even greater statistical day had the Redskins been able to keep up; he had 217 yards on 9-of-15 passing at intermission. Foles had been targeting Riley Cooper frequently over the past few weeks, but he spread the ball around evenly in this contest. No Eagle had more than 4 catches, as DeSean Jackson led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 82 yards. Cooper managed only 3 catches for 37 yards.    LeSean McCoy also had 4 receptions (73 receiving yards) to go along with 77 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries. McCoy went down and grabbed his hamstring in the second quarter. It appeared to be serious, but he was able to take the field after intermission.    Some Washington numbers: - "

McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well.

Foles went 17-of-26 for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns, though he took a number of bad sacks. Cris Collinsworth did a great job of highlighting the issue; when faced with a tough pass rush, Foles brings his eyes down. Dallas sacked him 5 times (1 of which resulted in a forced fumble) and also forced him into an intentional grounding. There actually should've been a second grounding call, but the officials incorrectly ruled that a Philadelphia receiver was in the area.    As many expected the Eagles ran all over the Cowboys. "

Foles didn't really have a chance to hit most of those passes, as his offensive line couldn't block very well. The Redskins swarmed his backfield and forced him to try to scramble too many times, which is obviously not a strength of his.    Britt, as mentioned, secured Foles' only touchdown. But before you rush to pick him up off of waivers, take note that he caught only 2 passes. Britt is a lazy bum who can't grasp the mental part of the game, as evidenced by his ridiculous taunting penalty after he scored.    The Rams' leader in receiving yardage turned out to be tight end "

He also ran in the 2.point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown.

Olson saved Bradley and Caldwell's jobs a year ago. Despite the change, however, Jacksonville's offense produced a whopping 14 points after 10 days to prepare for Kansas City. The attempt to save face was proven to be pathetic by the Chiefs, as the Jaguars turned the ball over 4 times - and 2 easy interceptions were dropped by the Chiefs. Clearly, the wrong people were fired, as Bradley and Caldwell have proven all they produce is losing for Jacksonville.    Early in the first quarter, the Jaguars had a hilarious blooper play as "
