   "comment":"Nick Foles was the star for the Eagles as he burned the Buccaneers' secondary with Riley Cooper and DeSean Jackson. The Glazers, the Bucs owners, and general manager Mark Dominik had to be thinking of what could have been with Chip Kelly. A Bucs source told me that Chip Kelly was Tampa Bay's head coach for 6 hours or so before changing his mind. Instead of landing Kelly, the organization hired Greg Schiano. The Bucs are now 7-14 under Schiano and 24-45 under Dominik with an 0-5 start to 2013. With the NFC East wide open, the Eagles showed they are just as dangerous, if not more so, with Nick Foles at quarterback. The first drive of the game was a clinic as Philadelphia moved the ball at will. It started with a 44-yard screen pass to Foles as the starter.    Like a MRSA infection, the Eagles offense gradually ate up the Bucs defense to lead to Philadelphia's third win of the season.

Foles had been targeting Riley Cooper frequently over the past few weeks, but he spread the ball around evenly in this contest. No Eagle had more than 4 catches, as DeSean Jackson led the team in receiving with 4 grabs for 82 yards. Cooper managed only 3 catches for 37 yards.

   "comment":"Nick Foles engineered a 3.game winning streak for the Eagles, but there was some uncertainty about the legitimacy of those victories because he battled 3 teams with horrific pass defenses. Arizona entered this weekend ranked fifth in terms of YPA, so this was Foles' first real test of the season. And he passed with flying colors. Foles went 21-of-34 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns. He once again threw no picks, though he tossed 1 and saw it negated by a defensive hold. He also had an interception dropped in the end zone by "

   "comment":"Nick Foles fired his first interception of the season on an overthrow. LeSean McCoy, meanwhile, was guilty of running backward and taking huge losses on several occasions. They also had trouble moving around on special teams, surrendering 2 touchdowns to Jeremy Ross. However, being the cold-weather team, they were able to adjust. McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well. Nick Foles, meanwhile, was so much more effective after halftime. He was just 4-of-10 for 35 yards and the pick prior to intermission, but he went 7-of-12 for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) afterward.

Aside from Gurley, the offenses were largely ineffective, and the Rams took a 10-3 lead into the third quarter. Cleveland started better in the second half with a 27-yard pass to Gary Barnidge and a 22-yard run by Robert Turbin. The drive stalled out for a 44-yard field goal. St. Louis answered with a screen to Tavon Austin for 11 yards. He had a great block on the next play to help spring Gurley for a 48-yard run. The drive was killed by a sack from Randy Starks, and Greg Zuerlein missed a 35-yard field goal. Barnidge climbed the ladder to make a 33-yard reception down the middle of the field.

   "comment":"Nick Foles, though Indianapolis' abomination of a defense may have had something to do with it. The Colts, who were already brutal defensively, lost Foles, though Indianapolis' abomination of a defense may have had something to do with it. The Colts, who were already brutal defensively, lost Vontae Davis to a concussion. Indianapolis surrendered countless third-and-longs, especially earlier in the contest, as its linebackers didn't have a prayer of covering Travis Kelce. As a result, the Chiefs were able to prevail despite Foles playing under center, which has to be utterly embarrassing for the Colts.    Foles, statistically, was better than Smith, which just sounds wrong. Smith went 9-of-19 for 127 yards and a touchdown, though he did have a 28-yard completion wiped out by penalty. Foles, meanwhile, finished 16-of-22 for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns. His numbers could've even been better, as he had a 37-yard reception to Kelce negated by replay review. The numbers are legitimate, as Foles looked as great as he did during his 27-touchdown, 2.interception season. I don't know how sustainable this is, especially given that he was battling perhaps the worst defense in football that was missing its top player, but Andy Reid has been able to work magic with poor quarterbacks before.    Both Smith and Foles targeted Kelce very heavily, as the dynamic tight end caught 7 passes for 101 yards and a touchdown, abusing Indianapolis' horrid linebackers. He was a problem all game, converting third-and-10 and third-and-13 on the opening drive. As mentioned, he also had a deep reception overturned by replay, as he dropped the ball prior to hitting the ground out of bounds.    "
