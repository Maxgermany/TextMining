Starting QBDK is pointless in the long-term, but Reid will continue to do so because that's his best chance of holding on to the job. That's why Reid needs to be fired immediately.    With the New York Giants looking vulnerable, the winner of this game could entertain thoughts of getting into the chase for the NFC East, but the Eagles and head coach Andy Reid lost their fifth straight game and are completely done in 2012.

Nick Foles threw an interception on the first drive because the ball went off Brent Celek's hands."

However, he checked down often and lost a fumble because he held on to the ball too long.

Almost immediately afterward, Foles was guilty of intentional grounding, which ended the contest because of the added 10-second run-off.    Maclin missed out on the touchdown at the very end, but still managed to put together a monstrous performance. He caught 8 balls for 116 yards and a score.

Speaking of Jackson, the quick receiver once again had a huge outing, registering 9 catches for 193 yards and a touchdown. Jackson missed out on 3 other big gains. He had that aforementioned end-zone trip called back because of a penalty, while his quarterback overthrew him on 2 bombs. Jackson screwed up on his own, however. He dropped a deep bomb and was whistled for a personal foul, which helped move San Diego into position for a 4.h-quarter touchdown.    "

   "comment":"Foles could step in and operate Chip Kelly's offense once that happened. It's a small sample size, and it happened against a pathetic Giants' defense, but so far so good for Foles. QBDK suffered a hamstring injury at the end of the first half. He scrambled out of bounds for a decent gain, but pulled up and grabbed the back of his leg. He remained in the game for the duration of that drive, but showed no desire to run the ball after that. Foles entered on the next drive. He took over at his own 7-yard line, but led the team to a field goal on what would be the final drive of the first half. Foles ultimately finished 16-of-25 for 197 yards and 2 touchdowns. The difference in accuracy between Foles and QBDK was night and day. Foles can't run at all, but at least he was able to complete half of his passes. QBDK was 6-of-14 for 105 yards, but helped out with 79 rushing yards on 7 scrambles (including a 34-yard scamper on a third-and-19). The running ability is nice, but QBDK is such an injury liability because of that. The Eagles need to keep starting Foles so they can learn if they need to take a quarterback early in the 2014 NFL Draft.    "

As awesome as Foles was last Sunday, he was even worse in this contest. Foles went 11-of-29 for 80 yards. That's good for a YPA of 2.8. Both starting running backs had a better yards-per-carry average. Foles was 0-for-6 following intermission. Foles' accuracy woes were disgusting. The Dallas pass rush had him hurried all afternoon, but that doesn't excuse him for missing his targets all afternoon. There was 1 occasion in which he had a wide-open "

   "comment":"Foles engineered a 3.game winning streak for the Eagles, but there was some uncertainty about the legitimacy of those victories because he battled 3 teams with horrific pass defenses. Arizona entered this weekend ranked fifth in terms of YPA, so this was Foles' first real test of the season. And he passed with flying colors. Foles went 21-of-34 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns. He once again threw no picks, though he tossed 1 and saw it negated by a defensive hold. He also had an interception dropped in the end zone by "

   "comment":"Foles fired his first interception of the season on an overthrow. LeSean McCoy, meanwhile, was guilty of running backward and taking huge losses on several occasions. They also had trouble moving around on special teams, surrendering 2 touchdowns to Jeremy Ross. However, being the cold-weather team, they were able to adjust. McCoy started running forward, ultimately rushing for a single-game franchise-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries. Chris Polk (4-50, TD) also ran well. Nick Foles, meanwhile, was so much more effective after halftime. He was just 4-of-10 for 35 yards and the pick prior to intermission, but he went 7-of-12 for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns (1 passing, 1 rushing) afterward.

Cris Collinsworth did a great job of highlighting the issue; when faced with a tough pass rush, Foles brings his eyes down. Dallas sacked him 5 times (1 of which resulted in a forced fumble) and also forced him into an intentional grounding. There actually should've been a second grounding call, but the officials incorrectly ruled that a Philadelphia receiver was in the area.    As many expected the Eagles ran all over the Cowboys. "

   "comment":"Foles couldn't get anything going before that, but he suddenly began pushing the ball downfield. Replacement Corey White had no chance of covering Jackson, as he immediately gave up a 40-yard reception to the speedy wideout. White was later whistled for a 40-yard pass interference on Jackson, allowing the Eagles to score 2 plays later.    Nick Foles played relatively well in his first postseason appearance. He went 23-of-33 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns. Proving Cris Collinsworth right, he took some bad sacks, including 1 where he seemingly had 10 seconds in the pocket and failed to throw the ball away. This was huge because a first-and-10 at the New Orleans 15-yard line ultimately transformed into a 48-yard field goal that was missed. Foles was also flagged for a horrible intentional-grounding penalty that disrupted a drive. Foles could've had a much better day if it wasn't for a "

Of course, Bailey is the player replacing holdout Kam Chancellor, who was the only Seahawk who won on that tying score.

Foles didn't really have a chance to hit most of those passes, as his offensive line couldn't block very well. The Redskins swarmed his backfield and forced him to try to scramble too many times, which is obviously not a strength of his.    Britt, as mentioned, secured Foles' only touchdown. But before you rush to pick him up off of waivers, take note that he caught only 2 passes. Britt is a lazy bum who can't grasp the mental part of the game, as evidenced by his ridiculous taunting penalty after he scored.    The Rams' leader in receiving yardage turned out to be tight end "

Cleveland started better in the second half with a 27-yard pass to Gary Barnidge and a 22-yard run by Robert Turbin. The drive stalled out for a 44-yard field goal. St. Louis answered with a screen to Tavon Austin for 11 yards. He had a great block on the next play to help spring Gurley for a 48-yard run. The drive was killed by a sack from Randy Starks, and Greg Zuerlein missed a 35-yard field goal. Barnidge climbed the ladder to make a 33-yard reception down the middle of the field. A Joe Thomas holding on Robert Quinn took away a great 36-yard catch by Travis Benjamin, and once again, Cleveland punted away after starting a drive well.

He also ran in the 2.point conversion to give the Vikings an 18-15 lead. Minnesota lucked out when Tavon Austin got wide open for a deep ball and dropped a well-thrown pass from Nick Foles that would have been a gain of about 40 yards, if not a touchdown.

   "comment":"Foles, though Indianapolis' abomination of a defense may have had something to do with it. The Colts, who were already brutal defensively, lost Vontae Davis to a concussion. Indianapolis surrendered countless third-and-longs, especially earlier in the contest, as its linebackers didn't have a prayer of covering Travis Kelce. As a result, the Chiefs were able to prevail despite Foles playing under center, which has to be utterly embarrassing for the Colts.    Foles, statistically, was better than Smith, which just sounds wrong. Smith went 9-of-19 for 127 yards and a touchdown, though he did have a 28-yard completion wiped out by penalty. Foles, meanwhile, finished 16-of-22 for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns. His numbers could've even been better, as he had a 37-yard reception to Kelce negated by replay review. The numbers are legitimate, as Foles looked as great as he did during his 27-touchdown, 2.interception season. I don't know how sustainable this is, especially given that he was battling perhaps the worst defense in football that was missing its top player, but Andy Reid has been able to work magic with poor quarterbacks before.    Both Smith and Foles targeted Kelce very heavily, as the dynamic tight end caught 7 passes for 101 yards and a touchdown, abusing Indianapolis' horrid linebackers. He was a problem all game, converting third-and-10 and third-and-13 on the opening drive. As mentioned, he also had a deep reception overturned by replay, as he dropped the ball prior to hitting the ground out of bounds.    "

   "comment":"Foles wasn't impressive, but he didn't need to be as Kansas City's defense carried the team to victory. After being beaten by the Titans in Week 8, the Jaguars made offensive coordinator Greg Olson the fall guy and the sacrificial lamb for the incompetence of head coach Gus Bradley and general manager David Caldwell. Olson saved Bradley and Caldwell's jobs a year ago. Despite the change, however, Jacksonville's offense produced a whopping 14 points after 10 days to prepare for Kansas City. The attempt to save face was proven to be pathetic by the Chiefs, as the Jaguars turned the ball over 4 times - and 2 easy interceptions were dropped by the Chiefs. Clearly, the wrong people were fired, as Bradley and Caldwell have proven all they produce is losing for Jacksonville.    Early in the first quarter, the Jaguars had a hilarious blooper play as Prince Amukamara ran under a terrible pass from Foles that looked like a punt down the middle of the field to get an interception, but Amukamara's teammate, Tashaun Gipson, ran into him to break up the catch."
