   "comment":"Tim Hightower and Edgerrin James inexplicably tallied 133 rushing yards on 37 attempts.    The main reason the Panthers lost, however, was the anemic play of Jake Delhomme. Playing on his 34th birthday, Delhomme committed 6 turnovers - 1 fumble, 5 interceptions - and threw into double coverage all evening. Delhomme had 5 total picks in his postseason career going into this contest. Thanks to Delhomme playing like a recovering a crack addict, Carolina couldn't move the chains at all. Following a quick opening touchdown, the team's other 6 first-half drives were comprised of: 3 3.and-outs, a pair of interceptions and a fumble. The Panthers ran 15 total plays in those 6 possessions!    Speaking of crack, it seemed as though Carolina's coaching staff completely forgot that Steve Smith and DeAngelo Williams were even on the team. Smith managed just 2 receptions for 43 yards and a late score, though he was the target of a long pass-interference infraction. Williams, meanwhile, carried the ball just 12 times despite gaining 63 rushing yards.    In the wake of the Carolina and Tennessee losses, it might be time for the NFL to address its postseason bye-week policy. Since 2003, playoff teams with byes are 6-16 against the spread. Since 2005, that figure is 3-11. <div class=dfpAdSlots> '); <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Tim Hightower scored from 4 yards out. Colin Kaepernick set up the Saints for more points as he didn't bother to read the Saints' defense before throwing a pass right to linebacker Craig Robertson. Robertson returned the pick 29 yards, which aggravated by a horse-collar penalty, put the ball at the 12-yard line. Brees, of course, finished the drive, throwing a touchdown pass to Thomas. The Saints quickly scored again as Brees and Hightower continued to move the ball. That drive ended with a 5.yard scoring pass to Mark Ingram. Surprisingly, the 49ers answered with Kapernick throwing a dump off to DuJuan Harris, who ran untouched down the sideline for a 47-yard touchdown. Just seconds later though, Ingram took off on a 75-yard touchdown run to put the Saints up 28-10. The 49ers' next drive saw a 31-yard pass to Garrett Celek set up another Dawson field goal. Just before the half, Kaerpernick hit Vance McDonald on a short crossing route, and McDonald turned down the field to run 65 yards for a touchdown. The Saints had completely busted coverage as they forgot to account for McDonald. In the final minute before the half, Brees ripped the ball down the field to get a field goal and a 31-20 lead at intermission. The 49ers opened the third quarter by moving the ball quickly down the field, but Nate Stupar forced a fumble from Mike Davis at the 1.yard line and New Orleans recovered the loose ball. The 49ers got the ball back after forcing a 4.and-out, however, and produced a field goal drive. Late in the third quarter, the Saints missed a long field goal, but Brees threw some beautiful passes, including a 32-yard touchdown to Thomas. It was a tremendous juggling catch by Thomas along the sideline. New Orleans added a field goal and then stopped the 49ers on a 4.h down in the red zone as Kaepernick fumbled the snap away. In garbage time, Kenny Vaccaro forced another fumble that was recovered by the Saints.    Brees completed 28-of-39 passes for 323 yards with 3 touchdowns. Thomas led the Saints with 5 receptions for 73 yards and 2 scores. Brandin Cooks (5-66) chipped in as well for New Orleans.    Tim Hightower (23-87-1) and Mark Ingram (15-158-1 rushing, 2-13-1 receiving) ran wild on the 49ers. It was good for Ingram to get back on track after being demoted for fumbling issues.    Kapernick was 24-of-39 for 398 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. His touchdowns were lucky plays and the result of terrible defense by the Saints.    DuJuan Harris (10-59 rushing, 5-83-1 receiving) was San Francisco's best offensive weapon with Carlos Hyde out. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Tim Hightower split carries once again. Ingram looked like the better of the pair, however, totaling 50 yards on 11 carries. There is some uncertainty over Ingram's health though, as he limped off the field during the second half. Hightower only averaged 2.6 yards per carry, but he caught 2 passes for 34 yards. He can carry the load if Ingram is out long term.    Final Note: The Saints' defensive front looked absolutely great today. They limited the Broncos' running game, plus recorded 6 sacks with 6 different players. Having rookie "
