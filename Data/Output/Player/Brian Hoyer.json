He had a stupid moment where he threw what briefly looked like a second score, but was flagged for an illegal forward pass because he was 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Hoyer had another pass that was wiped out by penalty when he hit Johnny Manziel - on a trick play in which Manziel pretended to go to the sideline to talk to Kyle Shanahan - for a big gain."

   "comment":"Hoyer, despite Deion Sanders' pleas to get him paid, is not the answer. He was absolutely dreadful in this game, as he gave his team no chance to win. Hoyer doesn't have the ability to lead a team deep into the playoffs, so Pettine really needs to think about inserting Johnny Manziel into the lineup. Manziel doesn't have the mental aspect of the game down yet - and I'm not sure he ever will - but he would be an upgrade over Hoyer. I wouldn't trust Pettine to make the right decision though, given how he has bungled the running back situation. He made the right move to bench "

   "comment":"Hoyer's interception with a couple of minutes remaining, and they were able to move into field goal range to attempt what appeared to be a game-winning kick. However, Smith inexplicably used timeouts instead of letting the clock bleed. The Browns, consequently, were able to preserve all 3 of their timeouts, which allowed them to easily move down the field and set up what turned out to be the true decisive field goal on the ensuing possession. The Falcons could easily be 6-5 right now, but Smith's horrible gaffes at the end of the Detroit and Cleveland games have really cost his team. Fortunately for him, the rest of the division sucks, so Atlanta is alive and well in the NFC South race.    The Browns, meanwhile, had some coaching mistakes themselves. Mike Pettine screwed up right before halftime; he had his kicker attempt a 60-yarder, which would've been returned by Devin Hester had Mike Smith not called a timeout to ice the kicker (a strategy that has been proven futile; I guess Smith never got the memo). Seeing this, you'd think Pettine would either concede or have Brian Hoyer throw a Hail Mary, but he tried a 60-yarder again. It fell short for the second time, and Hester nearly took it back for the touchdown. Pettine also misused his third timeout at the very end of the game, but it didn't matter because Cundiff was able to seal the victory. Pettine, however, needs to make a decision on his starting quarterback, as Hoyer was terrible once again. He deserves credit for leading his team on the final drive, but the Browns shouldn't have even been in that position, as Hoyer threw 2 horrific interceptions late in the game. The first occurred in the red zone when Hoyer inexplicably drifted back 15 yards in the pocket and forced it to "

Pettine should have made the change weeks ago, and he had the perfect opportunity to do so heading into this contest after Hoyer's stink bomb at Buffalo. Pettine, however, made the wrong choice, and it cost him dearly in a crucial game amid a tight AFC playoff race. Hoyer was woeful yet again. His numbers don't even describe how awful he was, and he went 14-of-31 for 140 yards and 2 interceptions. Hoyer struggled to maintain drives, throwing errant passes on third down all afternoon. The crowd booed him quietly after the first incompletion, and the jeers grew louder as the game progressed. Both of his picks were poor throws. The first was forced into tight coverage in the end zone, while the second was an inaccurate pass during a failed comeback attempt, and it followed a dropped interception. Hoyer didn't get much help from "

   "comment":"Hoyer, he sucks. If the Texans start Ryan Mallett, he sucks. Here's an idea: Why don't the Texans start a random quarterback - it doesn't matter which 1 - and immediately pull him after 1 drive? That would totally work, right?    Finally, someone found a way to slow down Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. The Texans threw all sorts of coverage at Jones and held him to 4 catches for 38 yards. It didn't matter. The 4-0 Falcons still hammered the Texans with running back Devonta Freeman, showing last week's effort wasn't a flash in the pan. For the second straight week, Freeman scored 3 rushing touchdowns. Freeman became the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score 3 rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. He also became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to have 7 rushing touchdowns in the first 4 games of a season. Freeman has made himself into a must-start in any fantasy league. He finished with 68 yards on 14 carries and also caught 5 passes for 81 yards. Freeman's numbers could have been even higher, but the Falcons replaced him with Terron Ward (19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown) once the game got out of hand.    Even with Jones being held quiet, quarterback Matt Ryan had an efficient day. Ryan completed 19-of-27 passes for 256 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions on a day when the Falcons didn't really need to throw the ball.    Atlanta wide receiver Roddy White continued his very quiet season. He had 2 catches for 8 yards. If you still have White on your fantasy team, it's time to consider letting him go. Age clearly is catching up to White, and his best days are behind him. If you're looking for a replacement, you might want to grab Leonard Hankerson. He could start to cut into White's playing time after producing 6 catches for 103 yards.    Atlanta's defense continues to play well. The Falcons forced 2 early turnovers that helped them build a quick 21-0 lead. Linebacker Paul Worrilow tipped a pass that was intercepted by defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux, and cornerback Desmond Trufant scored a touchdown after scooping up an Arian Foster fumble.    For the Texans (1-3), the big story entering the game was the return of Foster from an injury. However, Foster ended up having almost no impact. Foster had 8 carries for 10 yards. His longest run of the day went for 5 yards. Foster also had 3 catches for 25 yards. His backup, Alfred Blue, who had a big week last week, also was held in check. Blue was limited to 17 yards on 6 carries.    Ryan Mallett may have played his way out of a starting job. He completed 12-of-27 passes for 150 yards with an interception. Backup Brian Hoyer entered the game after it was out of control and fared much better than Mallett. Hoyer completed 17-of-30 passes for 232 yards with 2 touchdowns. The Texans could decide to make a switch at quarterback.    Wide receiver "

   "comment":"Hoyer executed a 16-play, 99-yard drive led by a 4.h-down conversion with a completion to DeAndre Hopkins and then finished the drive with a third-down 14-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster. The Jaguars answered with a drive that was aided by a few Texans penalties. Close to the end zone, Bortles hit Allen Robinson for a short touchdown pass against A.J. Bouye. The Texans answered with a field goal drive to take a 10-7 lead. Right before the half, Bortles drove the ball to Houston's 10-yard line, but he threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal to maintain the 3.point lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, the Jaguars stopped a 4.h-and-1 carry by Foster for a loss of a few yards, which set up Jacksonville at midfield. Bortles went on to hit Robinson for a gain of close to 20 and then threw a dart to a wide open Julius Thomas for a 29-yard touchdown. The Jaguars took a 14-10 lead, but after that, the Texans took over. Houston answered with Hopkins making a ridiculous 1.handed catch for 29 yards. A dumb 15-yard penalty on Jonathan Cyprien moved the ball to the 10-yard line, and Hoyer ended up throwing a bullet to Hopkins for a 9-yard touchdown. The Texans quickly got the ball back and struck again with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. Bortles promptly threw a pick-six to Hal, who jumped the route and returned it 31 yards for a score. The game was essentially over after that play. In garbage time, Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to "

   "comment":"Hoyer was too inept to take advantage of his absence. Freeny (wrist) played extremely well before leaving, while Blount (hip) wasn't missed very much.    Tom Brady misfired on just 8 occasions, going 22-of-30 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well when he had time to throw, but he was hit quite often. As a consequence, the Patriots were limited to just 20 points until very late. Brady took 3 sacks, but that number isn't very indicative of the pressure he faced. Jadeveon Clowney was a monster, as this was perhaps the best performance of his career. J.J. Watt, on the other hand, wasn't nearly as effective.    Brady was helped by the return of Rob Gronkowski. The NFL's top tight end didn't play on most downs, but he was a big factor whenever he was on the field. He was targeted just 4 times, but caught all 4 of those passes for 87 yards and a touchdown. The Texans left him in single coverage on most of his receptions, which was a very stupid thing to do.    Only 4 Patriots caught passes in addition to Gronkowski. They were: Danny Amendola (6-46), James White (4-38), Brandon LaFell (5-32) and Keshawn Martin (3-23, TD). White made a ridiculous reception on the sideline over a defender, but replay review ruled that 1 of his heels landed out of bounds. LaFell dropped a pass and had a touchdown negated by an illegal formation. Martin muffed a punt deep in his own territory, but it didn't end up hurting the Patriots because the Texans turned the ball over on downs.    I mentioned that Blount wasn't missed. Blount gained 53 yards on 10 carries, but Brandon Bolden was nearly as good, generating 51 yards on 16 attempts. White vultured a touchdown.    Houston's defense did the best it could, but the team was eventually gassed at the end because the offense couldn't sustain drives. The Texans picked up just 7 first downs, barely missing positive plays. For instance, Brian Hoyer threw behind his target on a third down with several minutes to go prior to halftime, allowing the Patriots to hold on to the ball for an eternity on 2 drives sandwiching halftime. Later on, there were numerous drops, including a couple deep downfield by "

   "comment":"Hoyer connected with Jonathan Grimes for a 14-yard touchdown. The Jaguars answered as blown coverage by Brian Cushing let Allen Robinson get open and take off down the field for a gain of 36 yards. That led to a Jacksonville field goal. Denard Robinson soon fumbled the ball away, and Watt recovered it in Jacksonville territory. A 25-yard run by Akeem Hunt set up a first-and-goal before Grimes scored his second touchdown on a short run to give the Texans a 17-3 lead. Just before the half, Andre Hal intercepted Blake Bortles with a great diving catch, and that set up a 51-yard field goal from Nick Novak and the Texans took a 20-3 lead into the half. Late in the third quarter, Hoyer had a bad pass off the mark that was deflected to Davon House for an interception."

   "comment":"Hoyer. The Lions managed just 6 points prior to a late punt return. They have some players on offense who are slacking off, namely Golden Tate and Eric Ebron. Tate was horrible, catching only 1 of his 4 targets, and he was responsible for Matthew Stafford's initial interception by running the wrong route. Stafford was furious on the sideline, prompting the coaching staff to bench Tate in the second half. Eric Ebron, meanwhile, dropped a pass on third down, committed a false start, missed a block and appeared to give up on a play late in the game. He's been a colossal bust and will need to be replaced soon. Stafford struggled as a result of some of his horrible teammates, and the offensive line didn't help matters, surrendering a ton of pressure to a defense in shambles. Stafford finished 23-of-36 for 213 yards and 2 interceptions. His second pick occurred late in desperation time.    Marvin Jones is Stafford's only reliable receiver; he caught 5 of his 7 targets for 74 yards. Only 3 other Lions caught more than 1 pass: Anquan Boldin (6-31), Ebron (4-42) and Theo Riddick (4-27).    Speaking of Riddick, he led the team with 31 rushing yards on 11 attempts. Dwayne Washington was expected to shoulder a greater workload, but he was given just 2 carries, which he turned into 6 yards. Washington left early with an ankle injury, but he wasn't getting much work behind Riddick anyway.    As bad as the Lions were offensively, they probably should be more embarrassed for what occurred on the defensive side of the ball. Brian Hoyer misfired on just 8 occasions, going 28-of-36 for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's not a typo. The Lions actually allowed for this to happen. It's evident now that they miss Ziggy Ansah and DeAndre Levy so desperately, but there's really no excuse for this.    There were 2 offensive stars for the Bears outside of Hoyer, and neither was "

In the end, the Rams prevailed, 41-39, in what turned out to be the highest-scoring game in Thursday Night Football history. It began very poorly for Hoyer, who was picked off on his very first pass.

   "comment":"Hoyer made ridiculous throws, helping his team get to overtime. However, the defense let him down, as the Colts were able to hit some big plays to set up the game-winning field goal on a day in which Peyton Manning's number was retired. Indianapolis is now 2-3. With a game coming up against the Titans in which Matt Cassel could start, the team could improve to 3-3. That's huge, as Andrew Luck could be back in a few weeks. If the Colts can tread water, they could give themselves a chance to reach the playoffs upon Luck's return.    As for the current Colt quarterback, Jacoby Brissett finished 22-of-34 for 314 yards and an interception. The pick was brutal, as it occurred in overtime. Brissett launched a bomb to T.Y. Hilton to set up the team at the 8-yard line. On the next play, however, Brissett underthrew an open receiver in the end zone, giving the 49ers a chance. San Francisco appeared as though it might score when Walt Coleman flagged Indianapolis for an absolutely horrendous pass interference on third down, but the Colts were able to force a punt after that. Following a big Marlon Mack play, Adam Vinatieri hit the 11th overtime field goal of his career to win the game. It was his 539th career field goal, moving him into second place, all time.    Speaking of Mack, he really put on a show, displaying his tremendous talent. Mack gained 91 yards and a touchdown on just 9 carries. He nearly had a second score, but replay review ruled him down a yard shy of the goal line. The FOX announcers remarked that the Colts may have found their running back of the future, and I would agree with that opinion. Mack could end up getting a larger workload as the year progresses, especially when considering that Frank Gore (14-48) is clearly not the same player. Mack provides Indianapolis with some game-breaking ability out of the backfield.    Hilton, meanwhile, had a huge performance. He caught 7 balls for 177 yards. He had 2 long catches; 1 in overtime prior to the pick, and the other when the game was 16-9 to set up a touchdown. His only blemish was a drop. Gore (3-38) was next on the stat sheet. Donte Moncrief (3-32) struggled once again, and he'll continue to be worthless until Luck returns.    As for the 49ers, Hoyer posted a terrific stat line, going 29-of-46 for 353 yards and 2 touchdowns. Much of this came in garbage time in the 4.h quarter, but Hoyer was able to lead San Francisco back from down 23-9. Hoyer was nearly picked in the early going, as safety "

   "comment":"Hoyer as a streamer because of Washington's secondary having some injuries. At the very least, I thought I'd get some nice points in garbage time. Whoops! I know you all care so much, so I thought I should tell you about that.    This game shouldn't have been as close as it was. The Redskins had this contest in control in the first half, but they let it slip away after intermission. It took a late defensive stop, aided by a penalty, to give the Redskins their third win of the season. Though the Redskins struggled in the second half, none of their issues were the fault of Kirk Cousins. Cousins had 1 of his best performances of the season en route to the team's victory. Despite getting little production from his run offense, Cousins was able to find ways to move the ball and get things done himself. For a good chunk of the contest, the Redskins ran successful screen plays that Cousins helped to orchestrate. He used his eyes to look the 49ers off the back coming out and was able to get the ball to his teammates for big gains. Cousins also helped to make up for the lack of rushing offense by carrying the ball himself, totaling 27 yards and a touchdown on 3 carries. Cousins' throws were almost all accurate, save for 1 that was behind an intended receiver early in the game. For the most part, he was able to put the passes right in front of the receivers and let them make the catch in stride. His touchdown passes were things of beauty. On the first, he hit Josh Doctson on a post route right in the end zone with a perfect pass. His second was more impressive. It was a dump-off to Samaje Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score. Cousins finished the day 25-of-37 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick. The interception was his only mistake, as he telegraphed a downfield throw to his receiver. However, Cousins' downfield accuracy improved in the second half, so that was a positive for him.    In terms of his receiving corps, Cousins was able to spread the ball around a lot. In fact, no player had more than 5 targets. The team's leading receiver was Chris Thompson (4-105). Thompson did a lot of his damage out of the backfield and was very elusive in space. He continued his breakout season, and he can be trusted as a FLEX play. As for the receivers, none really stood out. Josh Doctson (1-11) caught a touchdown. Terrelle Pryor (3-23) was mostly a non-factor. Jordan Reed (4-37) had a nice drive that saw him notch a few catches. Rigth now, there is no de facto top receiver, so it's hard to recommend any as a fantasy option. Doctson probably has the most upside, but even he is inconsistent.    With Robert Kelley out, the Redskins relied on Thompson to carry the load. He received 16 carries but was only able to get 33 yards. Thompson was bottled up in the second half for the most part. Samaje Perine also got a fair amount of action, and he was marginally better, gaining 23 yards on 9 carries. The team will be better off when Kelley is back to action, as the Redskins need a true power back for their offense.    In the first half, the San Francisco offense was completely lifeless. Under Brian Hoyer, the unit was barely able to accomplish anything. The 49ers were down 17-0 and Hoyer was 4-of-11 for just 34 yards before Kyle Shanahan chose to remove Hoyer from the game and play "
