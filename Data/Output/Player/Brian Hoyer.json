Completing 10 of his first 12 passes, Hoyer finished 25-of-38 for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns. It's worth noting that he did this against an injury-ravaged Cincinnati secondary, but I'm pretty confident that Brandon Weeden couldn't have duplicated this performance. At the very worst, Hoyer has cemented himself as a strong No. 2 NFL quarterback for years to come. Hoyer's first touchdown was a nice, touch fade to "

Pettine should have made the change weeks ago, and he had the perfect opportunity to do so heading into this contest after Hoyer's stink bomb at Buffalo. Pettine, however, made the wrong choice, and it cost him dearly in a crucial game amid a tight AFC playoff race. Hoyer was woeful yet again. His numbers don't even describe how awful he was, and he went 14-of-31 for 140 yards and 2 interceptions. Hoyer struggled to maintain drives, throwing errant passes on third down all afternoon. The crowd booed him quietly after the first incompletion, and the jeers grew louder as the game progressed. Both of his picks were poor throws. The first was forced into tight coverage in the end zone, while the second was an inaccurate pass during a failed comeback attempt, and it followed a dropped interception. Hoyer didn't get much help from "

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer, he sucks. If the Texans start Ryan Mallett, he sucks. Here's an idea: Why don't the Texans start a random quarterback - it doesn't matter which 1 - and immediately pull him after 1 drive? That would totally work, right? </i>    Finally, someone found a way to slow down Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. The Texans threw all sorts of coverage at Jones and held him to 4 catches for 38 yards. It didn't matter. The 4-0 Falcons still hammered the Texans with running back Devonta Freeman, showing last week's effort wasn't a flash in the pan. For the second straight week, Freeman scored 3 rushing touchdowns. Freeman became the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score 3 rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. He also became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to have 7 rushing touchdowns in the first 4 games of a season. Freeman has made himself into a must-start in any fantasy league. He finished with 68 yards on 14 carries and also caught 5 passes for 81 yards. Freeman's numbers could have been even higher, but the Falcons replaced him with Terron Ward (19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown) once the game got out of hand.    Even with Jones being held quiet, quarterback Matt Ryan had an efficient day. Ryan completed 19-of-27 passes for 256 yards with 1 touchdown and no interceptions on a day when the Falcons didn't really need to throw the ball.    Atlanta wide receiver Roddy White continued his very quiet season. He had 2 catches for 8 yards. If you still have White on your fantasy team, it's time to consider letting him go. Age clearly is catching up to White, and his best days are behind him. If you're looking for a replacement, you might want to grab Leonard Hankerson. He could start to cut into White's playing time after producing 6 catches for 103 yards.    Atlanta's defense continues to play well. The Falcons forced 2 early turnovers that helped them build a quick 21-0 lead. Linebacker Paul Worrilow tipped a pass that was intercepted by defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux, and cornerback Desmond Trufant scored a touchdown after scooping up an Arian Foster fumble.    For the Texans (1-3), the big story entering the game was the return of Foster from an injury. However, Foster ended up having almost no impact. Foster had 8 carries for 10 yards. His longest run of the day went for 5 yards. Foster also had 3 catches for 25 yards. His backup, Alfred Blue, who had a big week last week, also was held in check. Blue was limited to 17 yards on 6 carries.    Ryan Mallett may have played his way out of a starting job. He completed 12-of-27 passes for 150 yards with an interception. Backup Brian Hoyer entered the game after it was out of control and fared much better than Mallett. Hoyer completed 17-of-30 passes for 232 yards with 2 touchdowns. The Texans could decide to make a switch at quarterback.    Wide receiver "

Mallett looked stunned at first, and then angry, and then upset.

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer executed a 16-play, 99-yard drive led by a 4.h-down conversion with a completion to DeAndre Hopkins and then finished the drive with a third-down 14-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster. The Jaguars answered with a drive that was aided by a few Texans penalties. Close to the end zone, Bortles hit Allen Robinson for a short touchdown pass against A.J. Bouye. The Texans answered with a field goal drive to take a 10-7 lead. Right before the half, Bortles drove the ball to Houston's 10-yard line, but he threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Andre Hal to maintain the 3.point lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, the Jaguars stopped a 4.h-and-1 carry by Foster for a loss of a few yards, which set up Jacksonville at midfield. Bortles went on to hit Robinson for a gain of close to 20 and then threw a dart to a wide open Julius Thomas for a 29-yard touchdown. The Jaguars took a 14-10 lead, but after that, the Texans took over. Houston answered with Hopkins making a ridiculous 1.handed catch for 29 yards. A dumb 15-yard penalty on Jonathan Cyprien moved the ball to the 10-yard line, and Hoyer ended up throwing a bullet to Hopkins for a 9-yard touchdown. The Texans quickly got the ball back and struck again with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. Bortles promptly threw a pick-six to Hal, who jumped the route and returned it 31 yards for a score. The game was essentially over after that play. In garbage time, Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, but the bad news was that Allen Robinson went down with a leg injury on that drive.    DeAndre Hopkins was the fantasy star of the game with 10 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. For some strange reason, the Jaguars resisted sending double coverage to Hopkins, who ate up man coverage.    Brian Hoyer completed 24-for-36 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns. He played an efficient game for the Texans and was more steady than what they had received under "

Arian Foster ran for 58 yards on 18 carries with a score. He had 66 yards on 5 catches with another touchdown. However, late in the 4.h quarter, Foster had his left leg give out on him untouched and had to be helped off the field with a cart ride into the locker room.

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer and the Texans' offense. Houston controlled the game from start to finish to improve to 6-5 and stay in a tie for first place in the AFC South.    For the first time all season, the Texans scored on their first drive. They moved the ball methodically down the field on an 11-play drive that ended when Hoyer hit tight end Ryan Griffin for a 10-yard touchdown. Houston's defense forced a 3.and-out, and the Texans' offense marched down the field again. Akeem Hunt ran for 13 yards inside the 5-yard line before Cecil Shorts took a stretch run into the end zone. Midway through the first half, the Saints were given some life when Hoyer threw a terrible pass that was intercepted by Jairus Byrd. After trading some punts, New Orleans took advantage of good field position and had Mark Ingram rip off a run of 30 yards. Houston's defense kept New Orleans to a field goal. The Saints moved the ball before the half, and Kai Forbath hit a 57-yard field goal to cut the Texans lead to 14-6 at the intermission. In the third quarter, Houston's offense got back on track thanks to a 37-yard pass to Griffin after he was left uncovered by New Orleans' defense. Alfred Blue finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. The Texans quickly tacked on a field goal to expand their lead to 24-6. The Saints put a good drive together with Brees hitting Ben Watson for gains of 15 and 26 yards. However, Kareem Jackson made a diving interception at the 1-yard line and got up to return the ball to midfield. Another New Orleans drive moved the ball deep into Houston territory, but Quinton Demps broke up a 4.h-down pass in the end zone. That ended the game for the Texans.    Drew Brees completed 25-of-44 for 228 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. The Saints were led through the air by tight end Ben Watson with 4 catches for 53 yards. Willie Snead (4-50), Marques Colston (3-38) and Brandin Cooks (5-35) were held in check.    Mark Ingram had 52 yards on 9 carries and 6 receptions for 45 yards. The Saints had to abandon the run because they were way behind so early.    Brian Hoyer was 21-of-27 for 205 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He was yet another quarterback who torched New Orleans' defense.    "

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer was too inept to take advantage of his absence. Freeny (wrist) played extremely well before leaving, while Blount (hip) wasn't missed very much.    Tom Brady misfired on just 8 occasions, going 22-of-30 for 226 yards and 2 touchdowns. He played well when he had time to throw, but he was hit quite often. As a consequence, the Patriots were limited to just 20 points until very late. Brady took 3 sacks, but that number isn't very indicative of the pressure he faced. Jadeveon Clowney was a monster, as this was perhaps the best performance of his career. J.J. Watt, on the other hand, wasn't nearly as effective.    Brady was helped by the return of Rob Gronkowski. The NFL's top tight end didn't play on most downs, but he was a big factor whenever he was on the field. He was targeted just 4 times, but caught all 4 of those passes for 87 yards and a touchdown. The Texans left him in single coverage on most of his receptions, which was a very stupid thing to do.    Only 4 Patriots caught passes in addition to Gronkowski. They were: Danny Amendola (6-46), James White (4-38), Brandon LaFell (5-32) and Keshawn Martin (3-23, TD). White made a ridiculous reception on the sideline over a defender, but replay review ruled that 1 of his heels landed out of bounds. LaFell dropped a pass and had a touchdown negated by an illegal formation. Martin muffed a punt deep in his own territory, but it didn't end up hurting the Patriots because the Texans turned the ball over on downs.    I mentioned that Blount wasn't missed. Blount gained 53 yards on 10 carries, but Brandon Bolden was nearly as good, generating 51 yards on 16 attempts. White vultured a touchdown.    Houston's defense did the best it could, but the team was eventually gassed at the end because the offense couldn't sustain drives. The Texans picked up just 7 first downs, barely missing positive plays. For instance, Brian Hoyer threw behind his target on a third down with several minutes to go prior to halftime, allowing the Patriots to hold on to the ball for an eternity on 2 drives sandwiching halftime. Later on, there were numerous drops, including a couple deep downfield by "

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer. The Lions managed just 6 points prior to a late punt return. They have some players on offense who are slacking off, namely Golden Tate and Eric Ebron. Tate was horrible, catching only 1 of his 4 targets, and he was responsible for Matthew Stafford's initial interception by running the wrong route. Stafford was furious on the sideline, prompting the coaching staff to bench Tate in the second half. Eric Ebron, meanwhile, dropped a pass on third down, committed a false start, missed a block and appeared to give up on a play late in the game. He's been a colossal bust and will need to be replaced soon. Stafford struggled as a result of some of his horrible teammates, and the offensive line didn't help matters, surrendering a ton of pressure to a defense in shambles. Stafford finished 23-of-36 for 213 yards and 2 interceptions. His second pick occurred late in desperation time.    Marvin Jones is Stafford's only reliable receiver; he caught 5 of his 7 targets for 74 yards. Only 3 other Lions caught more than 1 pass: Anquan Boldin (6-31), Ebron (4-42) and Theo Riddick (4-27).    Speaking of Riddick, he led the team with 31 rushing yards on 11 attempts. Dwayne Washington was expected to shoulder a greater workload, but he was given just 2 carries, which he turned into 6 yards. Washington left early with an ankle injury, but he wasn't getting much work behind Riddick anyway.    As bad as the Lions were offensively, they probably should be more embarrassed for what occurred on the defensive side of the ball. Brian Hoyer misfired on just 8 occasions, going 28-of-36 for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's not a typo. The Lions actually allowed for this to happen. It's evident now that they miss Ziggy Ansah and DeAndre Levy so desperately, but there's really no excuse for this.    There were 2 offensive stars for the Bears outside of Hoyer, and neither was "

   "comment":"Brian Hoyer as a streamer because of Washington's secondary having some injuries. At the very least, I thought I'd get some nice points in garbage time. Whoops! I know you all care so much, so I thought I should tell you about that.    This game shouldn't have been as close as it was. The Redskins had this contest in control in the first half, but they let it slip away after intermission. It took a late defensive stop, aided by a penalty, to give the Redskins their third win of the season. Though the Redskins struggled in the second half, none of their issues were the fault of Kirk Cousins. Cousins had 1 of his best performances of the season en route to the team's victory. Despite getting little production from his run offense, Cousins was able to find ways to move the ball and get things done himself. For a good chunk of the contest, the Redskins ran successful screen plays that Cousins helped to orchestrate. He used his eyes to look the 49ers off the back coming out and was able to get the ball to his teammates for big gains. Cousins also helped to make up for the lack of rushing offense by carrying the ball himself, totaling 27 yards and a touchdown on 3 carries. Cousins' throws were almost all accurate, save for 1 that was behind an intended receiver early in the game. For the most part, he was able to put the passes right in front of the receivers and let them make the catch in stride. His touchdown passes were things of beauty. On the first, he hit Josh Doctson on a post route right in the end zone with a perfect pass. His second was more impressive. It was a dump-off to Samaje Perine that Cousins put just on Perine's fingertips that allowed him to get into space and get the score. Cousins finished the day 25-of-37 for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 pick. The interception was his only mistake, as he telegraphed a downfield throw to his receiver. However, Cousins' downfield accuracy improved in the second half, so that was a positive for him.    In terms of his receiving corps, Cousins was able to spread the ball around a lot. In fact, no player had more than 5 targets. The team's leading receiver was Chris Thompson (4-105). Thompson did a lot of his damage out of the backfield and was very elusive in space. He continued his breakout season, and he can be trusted as a FLEX play. As for the receivers, none really stood out. Josh Doctson (1-11) caught a touchdown. Terrelle Pryor (3-23) was mostly a non-factor. Jordan Reed (4-37) had a nice drive that saw him notch a few catches. Rigth now, there is no de facto top receiver, so it's hard to recommend any as a fantasy option. Doctson probably has the most upside, but even he is inconsistent.    With Robert Kelley out, the Redskins relied on Thompson to carry the load. He received 16 carries but was only able to get 33 yards. Thompson was bottled up in the second half for the most part. Samaje Perine also got a fair amount of action, and he was marginally better, gaining 23 yards on 9 carries. The team will be better off when Kelley is back to action, as the Redskins need a true power back for their offense.    In the first half, the San Francisco offense was completely lifeless. Under Brian Hoyer, the unit was barely able to accomplish anything. The 49ers were down 17-0 and Hoyer was 4-of-11 for just 34 yards before Kyle Shanahan chose to remove Hoyer from the game and play "
