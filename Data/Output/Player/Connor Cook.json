   "comment":"Connor Cook took over and was better, though he would've been by default anyway. Cook actually led a touchdown drive when he found Cooper in the end zone. The rookie finished 14-of-21 for 150 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception on a poorly thrown floated pass. Cook was also responsible for a lost fumble on a strip-sack, which ruined a promising drive. Cook has no experience, but he's probably the better option. He was better in the preseason than McGloin, and he actually has NFL-level talent. In fact, the Cowboys were going to select him instead of "

Making matters worse for them, left tackle Donald Penn was ruled out the day before the game, and then center Rodney Hudson missed some action with an ankle. Not having Penn was a huge issue for the Raiders, as they had to defend Houston's edge rushers. Cook predictably took some sacks, but even when he had time, he couldn't do anything. He started off by throwing an interception in his own territory. It was a screen to "
