He'll be praised for the victory by the national media and Buffalo fans, but there are some issues. I already outlined the turnovers and inaccuracy. Manuel was also tentative at times, checking it down too often. Some of his throws in the red zone - earlier in the contest - were way off. The final drive was awesome, but he went down the field against a skeleton-crew Carolina stop unit. Part of the reason I won't blame the Panthers too much for screwing themselves out of another potential victory was because they suffered so many injuries in this contest. It started when Charles Johnson went down, grabbing his elbow. Cornerbacks "

As for the Buccaneers, Greg Schiano could be fired this week, given that they're on a pseudo bye. I'm not a fan of Michael Silver, but he wrote an article about how Schiano has lost the locker room and that his players are tuning him out. Also, consider what Charlie Campbell tweeted (@DraftCampbell): The Bucs are 24-47 under GM Mark Dominik. Greg Schiano is 1-12 in his last 13 games, is 7-16 overall. Time for the Bucs to clean house.    It wouldn't be Thursday Night Football without a gaffe from Brad Nessler. "

   "comment":"Johnson (3-52) for a 22-yard score after he ran by Tramon Willims to get open. After Green Bay punted, Bridgewater made a bad mistake throwing a pass up for grabs off his back foot. Packers safety Micah Hyde went up to intercept the pass close to midfield. A great run by Lacy was taken away by a penalty, but Rodgers hit Andrew Quarless for a 34-yard reception to the 1-yard line. For the next play, Rodgers lobbed a pass to a wide open Richard Rodgers for a touchdown. Bridgewater had a drive going in the third quarter, but missed a few opportunities for big plays on some inaccurate and dropped passes. Minnesota still turned the possession into points with a 51-yard field goal from Blair Walsh. The Packers answered with a 48-yard field goal from Mason Crosby. In the fourth quarter, Rodgers came up with a critical drive featuring a clutch run of 18 yards on a third down. A nice run by Lacy set up a 10-yard touchdown pass to the power back. Bridgewater had an impressive response to lead a long drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Greg Jennings (4-38) and a 2-point conversion to Charles Johnson. The Packers got the ball with 3-and-a-half minutes on the clock, but the Vikings' defense couldn't stop Lacy as he rolled up a few first downs to run out the clock for Green Bay.    Rodgers finished completing 19-of-29 passes for 209 yards with 2 scores. Lacy was the leader for the Green Bay offense, as he ran for 125 yards on 25 carries with 2 receptions for 13 yards. "
