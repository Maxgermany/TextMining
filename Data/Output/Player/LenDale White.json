That's right - White ran for 80 yards without taking a break. Jeff Fisher must have promised him a trip to Wendy's after the game. White finished with 149 yards, 3 touchdowns and a dozen Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers. Johnson, meanwhile, tallied 168 yards and a score.    With Johnson and White running wild, "
