   "comment":"White wasn't in the game was because he had an inexplicable 54-yard run 2 plays earlier and was consequently sucking the air out of an oxygen tank. It's a good thing that White is on a diet (according to Jeff Fisher), or he would have just collapsed. Johnson was really instrumental in Tennessee's eighth victory of the season. In addition to his touchdown, Johnson had 161 total yards (89 rushing, 72 receiving) and accounted for 45 total yards in overtime.    Besides Johnson and White's 54-yard sloth-like run, no 1 else on Tennessee's offense did much. "

   "comment":"White fumbled the ball when he saw a hot dog on the ground and reached out for it. - Alge Crumpler fumbled the ball when he saw a hamburger on the ground and reached out for it.    With Tennessee's loss, we can update the chart I posted on my NFL Picks page. Teams that rested their starters in Week 17 have performed accordingly in their first playoff game since 2002: 2008: Titans* - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2008: Colts - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2007: Colts* - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2007: Jaguars - Win SU, Loss ATS 2007: Steelers - Loss SU, Win ATS 2007: Buccaneers - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2006: Eagles - Win SU, Loss ATS 2006: Saints* - Win SU, Loss ATS 2005: Colts* - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2004: Colts - Win SU, Win ATS 2004: Steelers* - Win SU, Loss ATS 2004: Chargers - Loss SU, Loss ATS 2004: Eagles* - Win SU, Win ATS 2002: 49ers - Win SU, Loss ATS Teams that rested their starters in Week 17 are 7-7 straight up and 3-11 against the spread in their opening postseason contest.    But enough about the Titans and my degenerate betting - let's talk about the team that actually won this contest. Joe Flacco didn't put up great numbers - 11-of-22 for 161 yards and a touchdown - and his stats really paled in comparison to Kerry Collins' (26-of-42, 281 yards, INT), but he made the big throws when he had to. He picked up 9 yards at the end of the game right before Matt Stover's field goal attempt. He had a clutch third-down conversion earlier in the decisive drive. He also had an incredible deep throw on third-and-13, connecting 48 yards downfield with Derrick Mason (5 rec., 78 yards, TD) for a touchdown. Amazingly, Flacco has not thrown a pick or taken a sack in the postseason thus far. Flacco threw the ball just 22 times. In the Live In-Games Thread, I continuously complained that Cam Cameron was being way too conservative and not throwing enough on first down. But in hindsight, I think he made all the right moves. After all, the Ravens didn't turn the ball over, unlike the Titans. And prior to Saturday evening, no rookie quarterback had ever won 2 playoff games in NFL history.    Some quick stats. For the Ravens: Willis McGahee: 12 carries, 32 yards. LeRon McClain: 12 carries, 12 yards. For the Titans: Chris Johnson: 11 carries, 72 yards (left the game early). LenDale White: 90 total yards. "
