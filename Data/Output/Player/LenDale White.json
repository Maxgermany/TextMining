It's a good thing that White is on a diet (according to Jeff Fisher), or he would have just collapsed. Johnson was really instrumental in Tennessee's 8. victory of the season. In addition to his touchdown, Johnson had 161 total yards (89 rushing, 72 receiving) and accounted for 45 total yards in overtime.
