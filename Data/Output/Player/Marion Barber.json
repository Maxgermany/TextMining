   "comment":"Barber (10-69) looking like his old self running for 15, 4 and 8 yards to start the drive. Hanie (18-for-36 254 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs) did more damage on the run (5-50), picking up 24 to convert a 3rd-and-18. Faced with 3rd-and-8, he found his hot receiver when the Raiders blitzed, and Johnny Knox (4-145, 1 TD) did the rest for the score. Despite being outplayed, the visitors were up 7-6. I have a little fun with fullback Marcel Reece calling him a matchup nightmare which is what radio announcer Greg Papa referred to him as in the preseason, but he looked like 1 taking a screen 47 yards down the sideline to start Oakland's next drive. That was all they did, but it was enough for another Janikowski boot and a 9-7 lead. A squib kick was returned 56 yards by Knox and at the 2-minute warning Chicago's offense was set up at the Oakland 35-yard line. A 16-yard pass to tight end Kellen Davis helped them reach the 6. However, a questionable play call of a throwback pass was blown up by the defense and resulted in an interception. Kamerion Wimbley caught the deflection from Curry and had a big return to the Chicago 6. Perhaps Hue Jackson is reeling himself in because, faced with third-and-goal from the 1, with 5 seconds left in the half, he wisely took the points for a 12-7 halftime lead. The field goals just kept coming in the second half. A 29-yard pass to Reece and a 17-yarder to Chaz Schilens keyed the change of field position, and Janikowski did the rest for a 15-7 advantage. The Raiders' defense held, and kept field position in their favor when the offense went nowhere. The Bears were forced to punt again after Wimbley sacked Hanie, but Oakland started the drive at its own 38 and continued to put pressure on a worn out Chicago defense. A long, scrappy drive just about closed out the third quarter and resulted in yet another Janikowski field goal for the 18-7 lead. His sixth boot was a franchise record. A 21-yard run by Barber and series of positive plays set up the Bears with a 4th-and-2 at the Raiders' 32. Lovie Smith went conservative taking the points to close within 1 score at 18-10 with 10:55 to play. The defense stood up, thanks to a smart challenge overturning a 15-yard reception by "

   "comment":"Barber rushed for 44 yards on 14 carries in relief. He's a nice, short-yardage battering ram, but he's incapable of shouldering a full workload at this stage of his career.    Caleb Hanie was awful again. He went 11-of-24 for 133 yards and 3 interceptions, 1 of which was on a desperation Hail Mary at the very end, so that shouldn't really count. However, his first pick was severely underthrown in the third quarter. He also missed a wide-open Earl Bennett for a touchdown just prior to halftime. Hanie should have thrown a score to Barber in the second quarter, but the touchdown was nullified by stupidity. Barber lined up incorrectly on a trick play.    It's hard to just blame Hanie though because Mike Martz's play-calling was completely idiotic. I have no idea why the hell he continuously asked Hanie to take 7-step drops in long-yardage situations. The easy answer is, It's Mike Martz, but he was better with this when Jay Cutler was still the quarterback earlier in the year. It's almost like Martz has checked out because he knows he'll be coaching in college next year.    Random stats: Hanie once again targeted "

Tebow drove his team down the field and set up Matt Prater with a game-tying 59-yard field goal with just a couple of seconds remaining on the clock. And if that wasn't enough, Chicago somehow found itself in field goal position in overtime. Barber, of course, coughed it up again. Minutes later, Prater drilled yet another 50-yarder for the win.    It'll be interesting to hear the excuses from Merril Hoge, Cris Carter and Bomani Jones this week. Tebow was 18-of-24 for 191 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter and overtime against a great Chicago defense, which should perhaps dispel the ESPN-contrived notion that he can't pass. Tebow's numbers through 3 quarters were ugly (3-of-16, 45 yards, INT), but he was really hurt by half-a-dozen drops, including 1 by "
