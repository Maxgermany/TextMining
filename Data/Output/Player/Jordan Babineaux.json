He was nearly picked off by Ryan Mouton in the second quarter and then immediately was intercepted by Robert Johnson. Ponder was picked a second time (Babineaux), but performed well otherwise, going 25-of-35 for 258 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also rushed for 31 yards on 3 scrambles.    Ponder's scores went to "
