   "comment":"Woodson interception in a clear case of Heisman-Trophy-winner-on-Heisman-Trophy-winner abuse. The Packers took advantage of a long penalty to set up first-and-goal from the 6, and Grant ran it in for a commanding 24-0 advantage. The first stop of the day for the Raiders came when Mike Mitchell took the ball away from Jermichael Finley in the end zone for an interception. The shutout was almost broken up, but after going 66 yards, Palmer connected with Rob Francois on another interception. The second half was just a matter of Green Bay holding on and staying healthy. The drives that mostly ended in touchdowns earlier in the afternoon were limited to field goals in the third quarter, but the points made sure the game stayed well in hand, allowing them to rest Rodgers for the 4.h quarter. Meanwhile, Oakland finally got on the board on its first possession of the second half via a very effective 80-yard march with all 9 plays going for positive yardage highlighted by a 34-yard pass to Heyward-Bey (5-78). Michael Bush (23-78, TD) finished the drive with a 2.yard scoring run. Even though the Packers' offense was less potent, the defense picked up the slack, scoring when Marcel Matchup Nightmare Reece fumbled and Erik Walden housed the recovery to make it 43-7 entering the 4.h quarter. Matt Flynn mopped up, and it was a good thing because he was nailed for a safety, and keeping Rodgers healthy is obviously a priority as this team marches towards history. The Raiders took the ensuing possession down the field for another garbage touchdown with Palmer (24-of-42 245 yards 1 TD 4 INT) hitting Kevin Boss for the 5.yard score and 46-16 final. Along the way, Oakland got to relive the tuck rule when Rodgers appeared to fumble and Kamerion Wimbley returned it for a touchdown. Well not really, because a clip would have negated it anyway. However, the fumble was ruled an incomplete pass because Rodgers was tucking the ball back in. I'm sure Woodson, who forced that now infamous non-fumble when he was with the Raiders, had to be chuckling when the referee uttered the word tuck after returning from the replay booth to overturn the call. Also of note, Rodgers had a little extra motivation for this 1 dating back to his college days. He is still bitter about his California Bears being stiffed for a Rose Bowl berth in favor of the Texas Longhorns. Current Raider "

Smith then took a terrible sack and didn't seem to know how to line the team up. He took a big hit, forcing Fitzpatrick to reenter the contest briefly, but Smith was able to return to make more mistakes. Smith went 27-of-42 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers are inflated because the Raiders let him have short completions in garbage time. Smith may not be any sort of downgrade over Fitzpatrick, but he's inconsistent, which could hurt going forward, since Fitzpatrick is set to miss some time. The Jets have reportedly already begun contacting some free-agent quarterbacks to replace Fitzpatrick.    "
