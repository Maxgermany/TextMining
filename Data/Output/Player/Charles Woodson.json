He was even better than the numbers indicate, as he made great decisions and displayed a powerful, accurate arm. Rivera had a coming-out party with 7 receptions for 109 yards and the score. San Francisco's defense looked hapless with no pass rush in the second half and a secondary that struggled to cover.    Kaepernick completed 18-of-33 for 174 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. It was an ugly game from him, as he made a number of bad decisions and had some missed opportunities.    Khalil Mack and Antonio Smith each played really well and had 2 sacks to lead Oakland's defense.   "

   "comment":"Charles Woodson, which was a forced pass. He then nearly had another interception, but the ball hit the ground. Following that, Orton hurled a potential pick-six that was dropped, and then almost had another 1 in a careless heave into double coverage. Orton was extremely fortunate that he didn't toss 5 interceptions in the first half. As he was getting away with possible turnovers, he was heaving inaccurate passes that missed his targets. The Bills, consequently, had numerous 3.and-outs, and it didn't get any better until the Raiders were up 2 scores. Orton had yet another near-pick in the second half and then fired an actual interception on a high pass. He was even lucky on a late touchdown, as "

Having said all of that, Cutler deserves credit for the victory. He went 28-of-43 for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception. The Raiders had no answer for him when he wasn't trying to let them win.    Alshon Jeffery didn't play, so Cutler targeted "

   "comment":"Charles Woodson. He later took a 5-yard loss on a third down late in the game by running out of bounds instead of throwing the ball away. Smith then took a terrible sack and didn't seem to know how to line the team up. He took a big hit, forcing Fitzpatrick to reenter the contest briefly, but Smith was able to return to make more mistakes. Smith went 27-of-42 for 265 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The numbers are inflated because the Raiders let him have short completions in garbage time. Smith may not be any sort of downgrade over Fitzpatrick, but he's inconsistent, which could hurt going forward, since Fitzpatrick is set to miss some time. The Jets have reportedly already begun contacting some free-agent quarterbacks to replace Fitzpatrick.    "
