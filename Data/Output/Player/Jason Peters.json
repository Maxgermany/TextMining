   "comment":"Jason Peters, and this will be an issue going forward. Wentz was sacked only 3 times, but it could've easily been more, as he was under heavy pressure. One sack was his fault because he held on to the ball too long, but the protection was still poor because the 49ers don't even have a very good pass rush. Peters' absence is a huge deal, so perhaps the Eagles will pull off a trade with the Texans, who are rumored to be shopping talented left tackle "
