Humorously enough - as long as you weren't rooting for the Patriots - the rain suddenly stopped seconds before Jones intercepted the pass. It's almost as if some higher being wanted to make sure the Bengals covered the spread. Perhaps he/she/it had Cincinnati in a parlay or a teaser.    All kidding aside, New England's offense was dreadful the entire afternoon, so the rain can't exactly be blamed for this loss. The front line couldn't hold up, as Brady was sacked 4 times, including twice on the first couple of drives. His receivers dropped what seemed like a thousand passes, including a crucial mishandle by "

   "comment":"Dobson (5-130) found the end zone twice. Dobson was targeted 11 times if penalties are included. This includes 1 sequence in which Brady fired 5 consecutive passes to him. Kenbrell Thompkins, by the way, was a healthy scratch.    The Patriots also ran the ball extremely well. Ridley gained 115 yards and 2 touchdowns on 26 carries. The biggest take-away here is that Ridley continued to handle the workload despite losing a fumble. Bill Belichick has had a habit of benching Ridley after coughing it up, but he stuck with his top runner. "

Considering all of the drops and the horrible weather, his 16-of-29, 247-yard and 1-touchdown line is impressive. Lewis has not been any sort of downgrade from E.J. Manuel this season. Manuel obviously has more long-term potential, but Lewis has solidified himself as a solid backup.    Manuel's aerial score went to Graham (3-62).
