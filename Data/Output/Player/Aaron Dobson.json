   "comment":"Aaron Dobson's injury didn't help.    As for the Bills, Lewis was pretty solid. Considering all of the drops and the horrible weather, his 16-of-29, 247-yard and 1.touchdown line is impressive. Lewis has not been any sort of downgrade from E.J. Manuel this season. Manuel obviously has more long-term potential, but Lewis has solidified himself as a solid backup.    Manuel's aerial score went to Graham (3-62). Jackson secured Buffalo's other touchdown (14-60); he was a factor in the passing game (3 catches, 53 receiving yards), though he was outgained on the ground by Dobson's injury didn't help.
