   "comment":"Boyce, and a second Brady score to Danny Amendola. Two of those plays featured awful calls by the officiating crew. The Patriots appeared to touch the football before it went 10 yards on the onside kick. The play was reviewed, but was strangely not overturned. The pass interference was way more egregious. McFadden barely touched Boyce. The infraction was obviously huge, as it set up New England at the 1-yard line. The key point is that the Patriots shouldn't have needed this miraculous comeback in the first place, but they played like complete crap early on. Brady, who was just 7-of-19 for 95 yards in the opening half, suffered from a whopping 5 drops, including 2 by Edelman. Brady also had a pick prior to intermission, as he forced it into double coverage. New England would ultimately come back, but it came at a price. "
