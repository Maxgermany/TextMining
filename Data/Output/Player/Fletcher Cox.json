The Eagles capitalized with a Wentz touchdown to Zach Ertz, immediately following a Luke Kuechly concussion. Kuechly was lost for the entire game, and that had a profound impact on this result. The Eagles were so much more effective offensively following halftime, gaining 188 yards compared to 122 in the opening 2 quarters, and their yards-per-play average rose to 5.2 compared to the 4.3 figure they maintained at halftime. Meanwhile, the Panthers continued to turn the ball over. Newton had a second pick that bounced off Jonathan Stewart's hands. A third interception sailed over the head of Kelvin Benjamin when Newton was trying a desperation comeback late in the 4.h quarter.    Wentz finished 16-of-30 for 222 yards and 3 touchdowns. He had his aforementioned early struggles, but caught fire with Kuechly off the field. He did a great job of converting third-and-long situations again, including a third-and-10 connection in which he stepped up in the pocket amid pressure. This ultimately led to a touchdown. Wentz's only real error, aside from his lost fumble, was not seeing an open Nelson Agholor to convert a first down to ice the game. Luckily for him, the defense did a great job on Newton.    Ertz had a tough matchup going into this game, as Carolina is excellent against tight ends. That changed with Kuechly out, as Ertz was able to score twice. He caught 2 balls for 18 yards. The other touchdown was caught by Agholor (4-55). Alshon Jeffery, meanwhile, finally had an easy matchup. He hauled in 4 balls for 71 yards, leading the team with 10 targets.    The Eagles ran the ball well for the most part; LeGarrette Blount did a good job of moving the pile and getting yards after contact. He mustered 67 yards on 14 carries. He also found the end zone on a 2.point conversion.    As for the Panthers, Newton struggled with the 3 turnovers, as his offensive line couldn't hold up against Philadelphia's elite defensive front. Cox's return had a major impact, and Newton frequently found himself under duress even though the Eagles seldom blitzed. Newton went 28-of-52 for only 239 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, Newton was able to scramble 11 times for 71 yards and a touchdown on the ground.    "
