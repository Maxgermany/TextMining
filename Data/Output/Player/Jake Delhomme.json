And look at the Vikings; they had a bunch of rinky-dinky scores against the Saints, but weren't so fortunate versus Detroit. They nearly lost to the Lions despite being massive favorites.    Because Tampa Bay had multiple defensive scores, Jeff Garcia didn't have to air it out that much. That's why he was just 15-of-20 for 173 yards and a touchdown. No Buccaneer caught more than 3 passes.    Warrick Dunn continues to amaze despite the fact that he's 33 years old. He had 115 yards on 22 carries, even though Carolina hadn't allowed a 100-yard rusher the entire season. Earnest Graham carried only 5 times because he had to play fullback in the wake of an injury. Dunn called Graham's willingness to do this 1 of the most unselfish acts I've ever seen on a football field.    While Dunn trampled Carolina's defense, DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart couldn't really do anything; the 2 runners combined for 39 yards on 17 carries.

   "comment":"Jake Delhomme, picking off 2 more of his throws. Look, I'm not saying the Buccaneers suck or anything; they're an above-average team. It's just that they're not going to get the benefit of a punt block or lucky turnovers every week. They didn't against Denver, and they consequently were debacled. And look at the Vikings; they had a bunch of rinky-dinky scores against the Saints, but weren't so fortunate versus Detroit. They nearly lost to the Lions despite being massive favorites.    Because Tampa Bay had multiple defensive scores, Delhomme, picking off 2 more of his throws. Look, I'm not saying the Buccaneers suck or anything; they're an above-average team.

And look at the Vikings; they had a bunch of rinky-dinky scores against the Saints, but weren't so fortunate versus Detroit. They nearly lost to the Lions despite being massive favorites.    Because Tampa Bay had multiple defensive scores, Jeff Garcia didn't have to air it out that much. That's why he was just 15-of-20 for 173 yards and a touchdown. No Buccaneer caught more than 3 passes.    Warrick Dunn continues to amaze despite the fact that he's 33 years old. He had 115 yards on 22 carries, even though Carolina hadn't allowed a 100-yard rusher the entire season. Earnest Graham carried only 5 times because he had to play fullback in the wake of an injury. Dunn called Graham's willingness to do this 1 of the most unselfish acts I've ever seen on a football field.    While Dunn trampled Carolina's defense, DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart couldn't really do anything; the 2 runners combined for 39 yards on 17 carries.    The only Panther to actually produce solid numbers was Steve Smith, who caught 6 passes for 112 yards. Delhomme had 242 yards on his own, but he also responsible those 3 interceptions.   "

He'll likely be out next week, and you have to wonder why he was scrambling for a score up 31-10 in the second half.    My greatest concern with the Eagles going into this contest was their pass protection; Jason Derrick Coleman Peters is terrible, while Winston Justice had never started at right tackle before. So, what have we learned? Absolutely nothing, though Peters was whistled for 2 false starts. The Eagles offense ran their ninth play when they were up 24-7, thanks to Delhomme's ineptness. All of Philadelphia's numbers were limited (McNabb: 79 yards, 2 TDs; Brian Westbrook: 64 rush yards) because the team barely had the ball.    Back in January, Jake Delhomme's son was kidnapped. In order to get his son back, Delhomme had to throw the game against Arizona. Five interceptions and a fumble later, we all assumed Delhomme's kid would be returned safely. Not so fast! Turns out the kidnappers parlayed that contest with Carolina's Week 1 opponent! Delhomme went on to toss 4 interceptions and fumble once in this contest. Hopefully this was just a 2-team parlay. In all seriousness, Delhomme (7-of-17, 73 yards) is arguably the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. In his last 2 games, Delhomme has NINE picks and 2 fumbles. Nine freaking picks! I'd advise John Fox to start his backup, but the Panthers don't believe in drafting signal-callers, so their top backups are Delhomme, but the big story is Donovan McNabb. McNabb fractured a rib on a touchdown run late in the game. He'll likely be out next week, and you have to wonder why he was scrambling for a score up 31-10 in the second half.

   "comment":"Jake Delhomme's kids aren't kidnapped anymore. Let's go over each of those: - <b> Michael Turner injury: </b> Turner left the game in the second quarter with a high ankle sprain. It's a shame because Turner had 111 yards on 9 carries. Jason Snelling got the rest of the work, gaining 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 rushes. - <b> Horrible Falcons play-calling: </b> Early on, Atlanta wasn't running the ball enough. Nine of their first 14 plays were passes - this without left tackle Sam Baker. If Carolina is strong versus the pass and weak against the run, why would you throw non-stop? Mike Mularkey's game plan was full of mularkey. Atlanta also had major problems converting third-and-short situations. Turner was out, but it was more than that; the play-calling was ridiculously predictable. Most of the calls were ineffective runs up the middle with Snelling. - <b> Atlanta can't tackle: </b> Whether it was defending Steve Smith, or trying to tackle DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart, the Falcons whiffed on numerous opportunities to bring down the Panthers. Williams rushed for 92 yards on 19 carries. Stewart managed 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 11 attempts. Smith scored twice, catching 4 balls for 34 yards. Muhsin Muhammad, meanwhile, somehow came up with 6 grabs for 91 yards. - <b> Matt Ryan sucked: </b> Ryan was 22-of-41 for 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He was off on a number of his throws. He tossed a really ugly interception at midfield down 21-19 in the 4.h quarter. He overthrew his receiver by a mile. Roddy White (7 catches, 98 yards) and Tony Gonzalez (6-67) still finished with decent performances. - <b> Jake Delhomme's son isn't kidnapped anymore: </b> Delhomme was 15-of-24 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he completely abused Atlanta's secondary all afternoon. It's now quite apparent that Delhomme's son has been returned safely. Delhomme no longer has to throw games anymore.   "

Eric Mangini surprisingly made the smart decision and went with Seneca Wallace. Wallace played really well, but suffered an injury in the second quarter.
