It's just that they're not going to get the benefit of a punt block or lucky turnovers every week. They didn't against Denver, and they consequently were debacled. And look at the Vikings; they had a bunch of rinky-dinky scores against the Saints, but weren't so fortunate versus Detroit. They nearly lost to the Lions despite being massive favorites.    Because Tampa Bay had multiple defensive scores, Jeff Garcia didn't have to air it out that much. That's why he was just 15-of-20 for 173 yards and a touchdown. No Buccaneer caught more than 3 passes.    Warrick Dunn continues to amaze despite the fact that he's 33 years old. He had 115 yards on 22 carries, even though Carolina hadn't allowed a 100-yard rusher the entire season. Earnest Graham carried only 5 times because he had to play fullback in the wake of an injury. Dunn called Graham's willingness to do this 1 of the most unselfish acts I've ever seen on a football field.    While Dunn trampled Carolina's defense, DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart couldn't really do anything; the 2 runners combined for 39 yards on 17 carries.    The only Panther to actually produce solid numbers was Steve Smith, who caught 6 passes for 112 yards. Delhomme had 242 yards on his own, but he also responsible those 3 interceptions.   "

   "comment":"Delhomme, picking off 2 more of his throws. Look, I'm not saying the Buccaneers suck or anything; they're an above-average team. It's just that they're not going to get the benefit of a punt block or lucky turnovers every week. They didn't against Denver, and they consequently were debacled. And look at the Vikings; they had a bunch of rinky-dinky scores against the Saints, but weren't so fortunate versus Detroit. They nearly lost to the Lions despite being massive favorites.    Because Tampa Bay had multiple defensive scores, Jeff Garcia didn't have to air it out that much. That's why he was just 15-of-20 for 173 yards and a touchdown. No Buccaneer caught more than 3 passes.    Warrick Dunn continues to amaze despite the fact that he's 33 years old. He had 115 yards on 22 carries, even though Carolina hadn't allowed a 100-yard rusher the entire season. Earnest Graham carried only 5 times because he had to play fullback in the wake of an injury. Dunn called Graham's willingness to do this 1 of the most unselfish acts I've ever seen on a football field.    While Dunn trampled Carolina's defense, DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart couldn't really do anything; the 2 runners combined for 39 yards on 17 carries.    The only Panther to actually produce solid numbers was Steve Smith, who caught 6 passes for 112 yards. Delhomme had 242 yards on his own, but he also responsible those 3 interceptions.   "

   "comment":"Delhomme was awful in the 2 contests going into this matchup. At Atlanta, the defense was to blame.    Matt Ryan led the Falcons on multiple scoring drives, helping the team convert 5-of-14 third-down situations. Ryan finished 17-of-27 for 259 yards.    Ryan didn't throw any touchdowns; those belonged to Michael Turner, who found the end zone 4 times. Turner rushed for 117 yards.    While Roddy White accumulated 70 receiving yards, the star in Atlanta's receiving corps was Harry Douglas. Douglas caught 4 balls for 92 yards and also scored a rushing touchdown. He had a punt return for a score as well.    Delhomme played well compared to his efforts against the Raiders and Lions, going 21-of-35 for 295 yards and a touchdown. "

How were the Cardinals, who played absolutely no defense in the second half of the season, epically debacling an undefeated home team? In a way, it's a little disheartening. The Cardinals flat-out quit after they clinched the division. They didn't even show up to the Minnesota and New England games. It troubles me that a team can just quit and simply flip on the switch in the playoffs. But give Arizona credit - for the first time all year, the team played a tough, physical game against a formidable foe on the road. Better late than never, right? The victory clinches the Cardinals' first NFC Championship appearance - ever.    The Panthers had no answer for "

   "comment":"Delhomme, but because they blew a 17-2 lead. Everything changed early in the 4.h quarter when Washington received a punt. Antwaan Randle-El signaled for a fair catch, but was bumped into by teammate Bryon Westbrook, who was pushed by a Panther player. It was ruled a muff and was challenged by Jim Zorn. However, the call was upheld. Two plays later, the Panthers scored the game-winning touchdown.    Jonathan Stewart was responsible for that score. He wasn't even expected to play, but he rushed for 39 yards on 10 carries. DeAngelo Williams, meanwhile, had only 40 yards on 18 attempts. The Panthers couldn't find any running room against Albert Haynesworth.    Jake Delhomme was 16-of-25 for 181 yards and a touchdown. He also tossed an interception, but "

That said, John Fox didn't show much confidence in Delhomme, as the Panthers often rushed the ball in third-and-medium and third-and-long situations. Delhomme will begin tossing picks again once Carolina falls behind early and Fox doesn't have the luxury of being so conservative.   "

   "comment":"Delhomme looked like a $7 quarterback with a kidnapped son, tossing 2 interceptions in addition to his 20-of-37 for 227 yards and a touchdown. Peyton Hillis, ironically getting a lot of work because Jerome Harrison fumbled too many times in the preseason, lost the ball twice. Harrison out-gained Hillis in rushing yardage, 52-41, with both runners getting 9 carries. Eric Mangini may go back to Harrison now that both backs have proven themselves to be too sloppy with the football. It's too bad Montario Hardesty is out for the year.    Mohamed Massaquoi caught Delhomme's touchdown, but finished with only 2 grabs for 46 yards. He's physically talented, but it's hard to like him in fantasy as long as the Browns keep refusing to draft franchise quarterbacks and instead trot out garbage every year.    I was glad to see that "
