I'd call it a draw. Check out the Panthers' play-calling on their first touchdown drive: Run 1 yard, run 4 yards, run 4 yards, run 14 yards, run 5 yards, run 10 yards (touchdown). Nice job, Chiefs. On Carolina's third drive, 10 of the Panthers' 11 plays were rushes. The only pass was an incompletion. Oh, and did I mention that Carolina was missing its 2 starting offensive tackles!?    I almost forgot! The Panthers' second scoring drive featured a converted third-and-17, which was a 19-yard pass from Jake Delhomme to Mark Jones, whoever that is."

   "comment":"Jake Delhomme, but the big story is Donovan McNabb. McNabb fractured a rib on a touchdown run late in the game. He'll likely be out next week, and you have to wonder why he was scrambling for a score up 31-10 in the second half.    My greatest concern with the Eagles going into this contest was their pass protection; Jason Derrick Coleman Peters is terrible, while Winston Justice had never started at right tackle before. So, what have we learned? Absolutely nothing, though Peters was whistled for 2 false starts. The Eagles offense ran their ninth play when they were up 24-7, thanks to Delhomme's ineptness. All of Philadelphia's numbers were limited (McNabb: 79 yards, 2 TDs; Brian Westbrook: 64 rush yards) because the team barely had the ball.    Back in January, Jake Delhomme's son was kidnapped. In order to get his son back, Delhomme had to throw the game against Arizona. Five interceptions and a fumble later, we all assumed Delhomme's kid would be returned safely. Not so fast! Turns out the kidnappers parlayed that contest with Carolina's Week 1 opponent! Delhomme went on to toss 4 interceptions and fumble once in this contest. Hopefully this was just a 2-team parlay. In all seriousness, Delhomme (7-of-17, 73 yards) is arguably the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. In his last 2 games, Delhomme has NINE picks and 2 fumbles. Nine freaking picks! I'd advise John Fox to start his backup, but the Panthers don't believe in drafting signal-callers, so their top backups are "

Antwaan Randle-El signaled for a fair catch, but was bumped into by teammate Bryon Westbrook, who was pushed by a Panther player. It was ruled a muff and was challenged by Jim Zorn. However, the call was upheld. Two plays later, the Panthers scored the game-winning touchdown.    Jonathan Stewart was responsible for that score. He wasn't even expected to play, but he rushed for 39 yards on 10 carries. DeAngelo Williams, meanwhile, had only 40 yards on 18 attempts. The Panthers couldn't find any running room against Albert Haynesworth.    Jake Delhomme was 16-of-25 for 181 yards and a touchdown. He also tossed an interception, but "

   "comment":"Jake Delhomme's kids aren't kidnapped anymore. Let's go over each of those: - <b> Michael Turner injury: </b> Turner left the game in the second quarter with a high ankle sprain. It's a shame because Turner had 111 yards on 9 carries. Jason Snelling got the rest of the work, gaining 61 yards and a touchdown on 18 rushes. - <b> Horrible Falcons play-calling: </b> Early on, Atlanta wasn't running the ball enough. Nine of their first 14 plays were passes - this without left tackle Sam Baker. If Carolina is strong versus the pass and weak against the run, why would you throw non-stop? Mike Mularkey's game plan was full of mularkey. Atlanta also had major problems converting third-and-short situations. Turner was out, but it was more than that; the play-calling was ridiculously predictable. Most of the calls were ineffective runs up the middle with Snelling. - <b> Atlanta can't tackle: </b> Whether it was defending Steve Smith, or trying to tackle DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart, the Falcons whiffed on numerous opportunities to bring down the Panthers. Williams rushed for 92 yards on 19 carries. Stewart managed 82 yards and 2 touchdowns on 11 attempts. Smith scored twice, catching 4 balls for 34 yards. Muhsin Muhammad, meanwhile, somehow came up with 6 grabs for 91 yards. - <b> Matt Ryan sucked: </b> Ryan was 22-of-41 for 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. He was off on a number of his throws. He tossed a really ugly interception at midfield down 21-19 in the 4.h quarter. He overthrew his receiver by a mile. Roddy White (7 catches, 98 yards) and Tony Gonzalez (6-67) still finished with decent performances. - <b> Jake Delhomme's son isn't kidnapped anymore: </b> Delhomme was 15-of-24 for 195 yards and 2 touchdowns, as he completely abused Atlanta's secondary all afternoon. It's now quite apparent that Delhomme's son has been returned safely. Delhomme no longer has to throw games anymore.   "

The Texans lost, but the big story is Yates' injury. It was to his non-throwing arm, but there's still a chance that Delhomme could start next week after his performance against the Titans. He went 18-of-28 for 211 yards and a touchdown, nearly leading his new team to a come-from-behind victory.
