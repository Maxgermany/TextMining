   "comment":"Clinton Portis was actually telling Zorn which plays to run on the sideline. Later in the evening, after the Redskins were contained to their 800th 3.and-out, Portis slammed his helmet down in frustration. I can't blame him. On the bright side, it can only get easier, as the Giants are 1 of the top teams in the league.    Clinton Portis was the only productive Redskins offensive player until the 4.h quarter. He had 84 yards on 23 carries. "

   "comment":"Clinton Portis literally carried the Redskins, compiling 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jason Campbell was 18-of-26 for 208 yards, connecting with Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley 5 times each (87 yards and 57 yards, respectively). Santana Moss had just 2 catches for 22 yards.    Congrats to Haslett for winning his first game as a head coach, but don't get excited if you're a Rams fan. They still suck. Of course, if you cheer for the team, I don't need to tell you that. Here's 1 telling play: Jason Craft missed an easy tackle on Ladell Betts on what would have forced a 4.h-and-11. Instead, Betts pushed forward for 10 more yards, setting up 4.h-and-inches. On the next play, Clinton Portis converted the first down. St. Louis was just lucky to catch an unfocused Washington squad on a bad week. The Redskins probably win this matchup 9 out of 10 times.   "

   "comment":"Clinton Portis ran left guard for a loss and up the middle for no gain. On third down, Portis was given the ball and he threw an incompletion to Chris Cooley. Washington has yet to score 30 points under Zorn, and it's not hard to see why.    Zorn almost made a huge gaff in this game. Up 9-7 with 2 minutes remaining in regulation, Zorn went for it on 4th-and-1 on the St. Louis 5, eschewing a field goal. The Redskins failed, so all the Rams needed was a field goal to win. Fortunately for Washington, Marc Bulger couldn't convert a single first down.    Campbell needs to get the ball more to Santana Moss. Moss once again had a lackluster performance, catching just 3 balls for 35 yards. Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.    Two guys who didn't disappoint were "

   "comment":"Clinton Portis ran the ball just 12 times for 42 yards against a pitiful Lions defense that hasn't been able to stop the rush. What is Zorn thinking? Is he facing Portis every week in his 2-man fantasy league? There is no reasonable explanation for this.    Zorn will also get criticized for going for it on 4th-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the first quarter. Portis couldn't get the touchdown, but I didn't really disagree with the call. I would have gone for it myself. Nevertheless, it gave the Lions the momentum they needed, as they went 99 yards for a touchdown.    "
