Later in the evening, after the Redskins were contained to their 800th 3.and-out, Portis slammed his helmet down in frustration. I can't blame him. On the bright side, it can only get easier, as the Giants are 1 of the top teams in the league.    Clinton Portis was the only productive Redskins offensive player until the 4.h quarter.

   "comment":"Portis literally carried the Redskins, compiling 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jason Campbell was 18-of-26 for 208 yards, connecting with Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley 5 times each (87 yards and 57 yards, respectively). Santana Moss had just 2 catches for 22 yards.    Congrats to Haslett for winning his first game as a head coach, but don't get excited if you're a Rams fan. They still suck. Of course, if you cheer for the team, I don't need to tell you that. Here's 1 telling play: Jason Craft missed an easy tackle on Ladell Betts on what would have forced a 4.h-and-11. Instead, Betts pushed forward for 10 more yards, setting up 4.h-and-inches. On the next play, Clinton Portis converted the first down. St. Louis was just lucky to catch an unfocused Washington squad on a bad week. The Redskins probably win this matchup 9 out of 10 times.   "

   "comment":"Portis, Zorn ran with Mike Sellers. Sellers scored, but the call was overturned, as the officials said Sellers stalled just short of the end zone. On the next play, Zorn ran Sellers again, who fumbled into the end zone. Congratulations, Zorn! You're now in a class with Brad Clueless as coaches who refuse to give the ball to your best player. At 7-7, Washington is pretty much done after such a promising start.    Speaking of Portis, he rushed for 77 yards on 25 carries. One has to wonder if he didn't get those all-important goal-line carries because of his feud with Zorn during the week. If Zorn wanted to penalize Portis by not giving him a touchdown as revenge for his comments, Zorn is a complete idiot.    "

Zorn will also get criticized for going for it on 4th-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the first quarter. Portis couldn't get the touchdown, but I didn't really disagree with the call. I would have gone for it myself. Nevertheless, it gave the Lions the momentum they needed, as they went 99 yards for a touchdown.    "
