Later in the evening, after the Redskins were contained to their 800th 3-and-out, Portis slammed his helmet down in frustration. I can't blame him. On the bright side, it can only get easier, as the Giants are 1 of the top teams in the league.    Clinton Portis was the only productive Redskins offensive player until the fourth quarter. He had 84 yards on 23 carries. "

Jason Campbell was 18-of-26 for 208 yards, connecting with Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley 5 times each (87 yards and 57 yards, respectively). Santana Moss had just 2 catches for 22 yards.    Congrats to Haslett for winning his first game as a head coach, but don't get excited if you're a Rams fan. They still suck. Of course, if you cheer for the team, I don't need to tell you that. Here's 1 telling play: Jason Craft missed an easy tackle on Ladell Betts on what would have forced a fourth-and-11. Instead, Betts pushed forward for 10 more yards, setting up fourth-and-inches. On the next play, Clinton Portis converted the first down. St. Louis was just lucky to catch an unfocused Washington squad on a bad week. The Redskins probably win this matchup 9 out of 10 times.   "

On the next play, Zorn ran Sellers again, who fumbled into the end zone. Congratulations, Zorn! You're now in a class with Brad Clueless as coaches who refuse to give the ball to your best player. At 7-7, Washington is pretty much done after such a promising start.    Speaking of Portis, he rushed for 77 yards on 25 carries. One has to wonder if he didn't get those all-important goal-line carries because of his feud with Zorn during the week. If Zorn wanted to penalize Portis by not giving him a touchdown as revenge for his comments, Zorn is a complete idiot.    "
