   "comment":"Barnes also ruined 3 drives with penalties. Pryor then had another turnover when he was strip-sacked after holding on to the ball forever. It's amazing how much Pryor has regressed since getting off to his hot start. He was just 11-of-26 for 122 yards and an interception, though he did help out his fantasy owners with 19 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Pryor had a nice play in this game when he broke out of a sack and found a receiver downfield, but he struggled throughout (2-of-12 on third down!) and hasn't played well since that weird, 11:30 p.m. San Diego contest. To give you an idea, here's a cool stat that the Associated Press' Josh Dubow came up with: Pryor has gone 112 passes without a touchdown pass (8 interceptions). JaMarcus Russell's longest drought was 104 attempts (5 picks).    Manning, meanwhile, wasn't much better. He went 12-of-22 for 140 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick-six. His 1 score went to "
