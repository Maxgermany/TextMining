   "comment":"Pouncey injured his ankle - allowing Mark Sanchez to nearly engineer a miraculous comeback. Sanchez went 20-of-33 for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was ultimately betrayed by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's slow and shoddy play-calling inside the red zone. I really have no idea why "

   "comment":"Pouncey snapped the ball before anyone was ready, resulting in a fumble recovery for Cincinnati. The Steelers got their act together after that, as Roethlisberger was 8-of-12 for 126 yards, a touchdown and an interception following halftime. His pick occurred because of a miscommunication, but Roethlisberger made up for it with a 63-yard bomb to Brown with a few minutes remaining in regulation, which helped cover the spread. It appeared as though Pittsburgh was trying its hardest to beat the number, as Tomlin was unusually aggressive at the end of the contest, even trying an unnecessary fake punt that was intercepted. Roethlisberger finished 24-of-38 for 317 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. He would've had an even bigger day if it wasn't for those drops. Roethlisberger had a clean pocket for most of the night, as the Cincinnati pass rush was a big disappointment.    Brown once again had a monstrous game, catching seen balls for 128 yards and a touchdown. He nearly had another score, but Roethlisberger missed him in the end zone. It seemed like he and Big Ben had trouble getting in rhythm early on, but the 63-yard score to clinch the cover made things right. "
