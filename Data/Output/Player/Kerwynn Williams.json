The Saints answered with a field goal drive, and then Larry Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away to New Orleans at the Cardinals' 30-yard line. New Orleans took advantage with Brees hitting Travaris Cadet (5-30-1) for a short touchdown pass. Arizona took the lead after Markus Golden burned Zach Strief to get a strip-sack of Brees. Calais Campbell scooped up the ball and returned it 53 yards for a touchdown. Quickly, the Saints responded with Brandin Cooks turning around D.J. Swearinger to get wide open for a 65-yard touchdown pass. Just 2 minutes before the half, Cooks burned Tyrann Mathieu on a crossing route before exploding down the field for a 45-yard touchdown. Carson Palmer moved the ball down the field in the final second of the half before finding J.J. Nelson (5-38-1) on a 10-yard touchdown pass. The Saints took a 24-20 lead into the locker room. The Saints would add a third-quarter field goal before Palmer led Arizona down the field, from where David Johnson scored from a couple of yards out to tie the game at 27. Early in the 4.h quarter, the Saints had a drive stall and settle for a field goal, but an offside penalty gave New Orleans a first down. The Saints promptly turned that into a Tim Hightower (11-37-2) touchdown and a 34-27 lead. The Cardinals drove down the field, and Johnson scored again from a few yards away. The Saints got going again with a 36-yard completion to Cooks, and then Michael Thomas (7-52-1) made a leaping grab over Brandon Williams for the score.

As for Palmer, his final numbers were 27-of-48 for 269 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. He could've been picked on a couple more occasions, so this was an ugly start to his 2017 campaign, especially considering the sort of defense he was playing. The Lions are projected to have 1 of the worst stop units in the NFL, so if Palmer struggled against them, what's going to happen against tougher defenses?    "
