Kansas City has the worst ground defense in the NFL, but no 1 could've expected that some unknown player would hit the century mark against them. It's clear that the Chiefs sorely miss Derrick Johnson and Eric Berry.    "

   "comment":"Kerwynn Williams and Stepfan Taylor were inexplicably effective, rushing for 75 and 61 yards, respectively on a near-equal share of 29 carries. The 136 yards on the ground made absolutely no sense, as the Rams had limited 4 of their previous 5 opponents to 66 rushing yards or fewer. Marginal talents like Williams and Taylor shouldn't be gaining nearly 5 yards per carry, but that's exactly what happened Thursday night.    As good as Arizona's ground attack was, the defense was so much better. The Cardinals made Shaun Hill look completely inept, while offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's predictable offense was an absolute failure. The Rams couldn't keep drives alive, going just 4-of-15 on third down. There were so many instances in which they had just 1 yard to go, but gave up and punted. That was the story of the game for them, as they moved the ball to the Arizona 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but had to settle for a field goal. The Rams, otherwise, made mistakes and blew opportunities. They committed their first error in the opening quarter when Tre Mason lost a fumble, setting up the Cardinals with a short field goal. They were flagged for offensive pass interference twice. They dropped 2 interceptions. They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball."
