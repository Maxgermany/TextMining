   "comment":"Wilson came in the end zone and led to a huge shouting match on the sideline between Brady and coach Bill O'Brien. Welker (7-86) and Gronkowski (6-160) were too much for Washington's secondary to contain. Grossman was 19-of-32 for 252 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Helu (27-126), Stallworth (4-96), Moss (3-81) and Gaffney (6-92) all had good games against the New England defense. The Redskins' offensive line did well in run blocking, but their pass blocking needs to improve. Carter had another good game for New England. The Patriots' defense has to up their game down the stretch, or the team could make a quick postseason exit. The secondary stinks. When New England faces better teams in the playoffs, they could get killed through the air. If the Redskins' offense can roll up yards (463) and points, then the Patriots have to worry about taking on a balanced team like the Steelers, or if they somehow make it to the Super Bowl, a team like the Packers or the Saints.

   "comment":"Wilson on a go route down the sideline. The drive ended with a short touchdown throw to Vincent Jackson. Freeman and Jackson connected on the next possession for a 54-yard bomb. That helped set up a touchdown run for LeGarrette Blount (6-17). Doug Martin (8-33) was held in check by Washington. Freeman moved the ball into field goal range later in the game, and the Bucs took the lead with a 47-yarder from Connor Barth. Freeman got away with a pass that should've been intercepted by Josh Wilson, but the signal-caller really played well in the second half against the Redskins. He completed 24-of-39 passes for 299 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Jackson (6-100) and Williams (4-115) played well for Tampa Bay.    The Redskins did a trick play on a critical third down at the end of the third quarter with a handoff followed by a lateral back to Griffin and a pass downfield to "
