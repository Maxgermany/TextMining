   "comment":"Colston for gains of 15 and 19 then capped the drive with a deep ball to Meachem for a touchdown. The final play of the third quarter turned out to be crucial. Matt Ryan hit Tony Gonzalez for a gain of 11, but instead of being in plus territory a petty flag on White for pass interference away from the ball moved them back to their own 31. On the first play of the 4.h quarter, White, likely still miffed, could not gather in a pass and instead put it up in the air for Scott Shanle to make the easy interception. Atlanta's defense held up, actually pushing New Orleans back 4 yards on the drive, but they hit the field goal to go up 20-13. Facing a deficit, the Falcons went to the passing game. A deep ball to White and quick slant to Douglas (8 reception for 133 yards) fell incomplete, leading to a quick punt. The Saints immediately came at them again, despite being pinned at their own 12 with Brees (30-of-43 322 yards 2 TD) hitting Lance Moore for 28 yards. The drive culminated in another long field goal and a 23-13 advantage, leaving them very much in control. Up against it, Matt Ryan (29-of-52 351 yards 2 TD 1 INT) came out firing from the shotgun, connecting with Gonzalez (6 receptions for 71 yards) to start the drive picking up 18 yards and to finish it with a 20-yard score. New Orleans took over nursing a 23-20 lead after a failed onside kick, but they do things a little differently even closing in on field-goal range. They were in the shotgun and converted a third-down pass to Colston for 13 yards to chew up a little clock throwing the ball. After stalling at the 27-yard line, Bryant hit a field goal for an apparent 6.point lead, but Graham's uneven game continued when he was flagged for holding, forcing a punt. Atlanta again went to shotgun mode and worked the ball immediately to Douglas. Four times in a row, they went to him, completing 3 for 66 yards putting them on the 33-yard line. Forced to third down, "

   "comment":"Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by Dashon Goldson."

   "comment":"Colston lost a fumble at midfield on the opening drive. - Jed Collins also lost a first-quarter fumble in New York territory. On the following drive, he had a hold to negate a 19-yard gain. - Lance Moore stepped out of bounds prior to making a reception that would have moved the chains on a third down in the red zone. - The Saints allowed the Giants to average a ridiculous 56.8 yards per kickoff return. Rookie David Wilson took 1 back for 6. - Drew Brees tossed 2 picks, 1 of which bounced right off the hands of Jimmy Graham.    Brees didn't have a good game by his standards. He went 26-of-43 for 354 yards, 1 touchdown and the 2 picks (the second 1 was his fault), both to Stevie Brown. He missed some throws and wasn't very efficient in the red zone.    Brees' lone touchdown went to Darren Sproles, who had 84 yards from scrimmage and scored a second time on the ground. Colston (4-61) and Graham (5-56) both disappointed statistically in addition to screwing up with key turnovers. Joseph Morgan led the team in receiving (106 yards), doing so on 2 deep completions.    The Saints actually ran the ball well when they tried to, but they couldn't maintain it because they were down big early. "

Colston had what looked like a huge fumble in the red zone in overtime, but the Saints were fortunate enough to recover on the Dallas 2-yard line, though I questioned why New Orleans was able to advance the ball on a forward fumble. Meanwhile, Graham's numbers were great, but he was guilty of some of the drops and a key false start when the Saints were trying to run out the clock. He made up for it, however, when he recovered Colston's aforementioned fumble.    Brees' other touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Colston dropped a 20-yard pass in the 2-minute drill at the end of the second quarter. - Some of Drew Brees' passes fluttered. Others were knocked down by the wind. He didn't throw an interception, but only because the Seahawks dropped 2 possible picks, the second of which was very Auburn-like, as the ball bounced off 2 Seattle defenders and into the arms of Robert Meachem for a long gain. Brees was better after halftime, but he was awful in the opening half, going just 5-of-12 for only 34 yards.    Brees finished 24-of-43 for 309 yards and a touchdown to Colston, who had a big game with 11 catches for 144 yards. I mentioned the near-picks, but perhaps Brees' best play in meaningful action was when he resembled "

   "comment":"Colston fumble in the extra session. What's really impressive about Ryan's performance is that he did it against what was supposed to be a stellar defense (though they had about a billion missed tackles), all while being without first-round rookie left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the contest. Matthews left in the first half with a foot injury and never returned, meaning Ryan was missing both starting tackles, as Sam Baker was also injured.    Julio Jones atoned for his first-half fumble. Despite catching just 1 pass prior to intermission, he finished with 7 grabs for a team-leading 116 yards. Devin Hester also had a big game. Meanwhile, Roddy White (5-72), Antone Smith and Levine Toilolo came up with Ryan's other scores.    The Falcons' 4 running backs all made contributions in this victory. Steven Jackson paced the group with 52 yards on 12 carries. Jacquizz Rodgers (6-34) and Smith scored. Fourth-round rookie Devonta Freeman did the least (2 carries, 15 yards; 2 catches, 18 rec. yards), but he made a crucial first down by refusing to be tackled.    Speaking of breaking tackles, Mark Ingram did plenty of that in this game. Ingram, who had a stellar preseason, rushed for 60 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored twice. Khiry Robinson (6-28) also found the end zone.    The 3 rushing touchdowns screwed over Drew Brees fantasy owners, who watched their quarterback do most of the work in between the 20s. Brees went 29-of-42 for 333 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. The Falcons did a good job of pressuring him in the second half, doing just enough to slow him down a little bit, giving themselves a chance to pull out the victory. Brees was hot in the first half. He and Brandin Cooks looked like they'd have an amazing afternoon, as the rookie wideout hauled in 6 balls for 68 yards (as well as an 18-yard carry) and a touchdown by intermission. However, Cooks finished with only 7 grabs for 77 yards, as he barely did anything following halftime.    Brees' leading receivers were the usual suspects. Jimmy Graham had the most receptions (8-82), while Colston led the way in yardage (5-110), but once again, he really cost his team in overtime. He also hurt his team with some drops.   "

   "comment":"Colston dropped a pass on third-and-10 on the first drive. Afterward, Brees had Kenny Stills wide open for a long touchdown, but he couldn't get the ball there because he was hit as he released the pass. I also mentioned the dropped pick-six from Robinson. Despite all of that, New Orleans snapped out of its funk, and Brees was able to torch Pittsburgh's sorry secondary by going 19-of-27 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns.    All of Brees' touchdowns went to different players, with Stills (5-162) leading the team in receiving. Stills' score was a 69-yarder in which he beat Ike Taylor, who was making his return from injury, with a double move. Marques Colston (3-16), Nick Toon, Ben Watson and Erik Lorig all found the end zone, with the former atoning for 2 drops."
