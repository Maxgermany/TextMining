One of the CBS announcers noted that Mack reminded him of the late Derrick Thomas. With Osweiler dealing with immense pressure, it's no surprise that he struggled. The numbers don't show it - he went 35-of-51 for 308 yards - but he did not have a good performance. He had a dropped interception early on and then missed a wide-open Virgil Green for a touchdown. After halftime, he was strip-sacked and then missed numerous targets because of the heavy pressure. The drops didn't help.    Thomas, as mentioned, struggled through a shoulder. He was fortunate early on when a tipped pass that popped high into the air landed into his arms for an inexplicable 16-yard gain. However, Thomas was ineffective after getting hurt. He finished with 10 catches for 95 yards, but dropped 3 balls and lost a fumble.    "

   "comment":"Khalil Mack picked off a Cam Newton screen pass and waltzed into the end zone for a 6-yard interception return for a touchdown. That put the Raiders up 24-7 at half. A 17-point lead is always nice to have at halftime, but those numbers seemed even more daunting when you realize that Newton had completed just 3 passes on 12 attempts in the first half. The Raiders got the ball to start the second half, and quickly, disaster struck as Derek Carr dislocated his right pinkie while fumbling a snap. That mangled pinkie was the spark the Panthers needed, because they then went on to score 3 touchdowns in the third quarter, 2 short Jonathan Stewart runs and a 88-yard score from Newton to Ted Ginn Jr. The Panthers had turned a 17-point deficit into a 1-point lead by the end of the third quarter, and they weren't done yet. After Carr left the game, Matt McGloin came in for the next possession. He wasn't able to move the ball, and by the time the Raiders got the ball back, the Panthers had scored 2 touchdowns and were only down by 4 points. If Carolina hadn't have scored so quickly, we might not have seen Carr back in this game, but as his lead had disappeared, he came back in with a glove on his throwing hand and promptly threw an interception, which led to Stewart's second rushing touchdown of the day. Now in the 4.h quarter, Newton struck again with a 44-yard touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin to give the Panthers a 32-24 lead. At this point, the Raiders had given up 4 unanswered touchdowns, lost a 17-point lead, and their star quarterback was hurting. Things did not look good for the home team. Carr had the glove on and couldn't take snaps from center, but he lined up in the shotgun and started the work to bring his team back. He methodically led his offense down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clive Walford. Then, Carr hit Seth Roberts for the 2.point conversion to tie the game midway through the 4.h quarter. The Panthers then stalled at midfield, and coach Ron Rivera opted to punt on 4.h-and-1 with 5 minutes left in the game. This was a decision that Riverboat Ron probably wants back. Carr then promptly moved his team down the field again, hitting Michael Crabtree twice, which Crabtree turned into great receptions; the last taking the Raiders down to the 5-yard line where Janikowski kicked a field goal to give his team the lead with 1:45 left on the clock. Newton had plenty of time to move his team down the field, but Greg Olsen dropped a pass that would have put the Panthers well within field-goal range, and then Khalil Mack strip-sacked Newton to end the game. This was a wild affair to say the least, but Carr was the catalyst behind Oakland's 4.h-quarter comeback and showed why he's right in the thick of the MVP race.    The Raiders at 9-2 are tied with the Patriots for the best record in the AFC, but the AFC West is tough, and Kansas City and Denver will play the Raiders again this year.    The Panthers are last in the NFC South at 4-7, and they go to Seattle next week.

If Carolina hadn't have scored so quickly, we might not have seen Carr back in this game, but as his lead had disappeared, he came back in with a glove on his throwing hand and promptly threw an interception, which led to Stewart's second rushing touchdown of the day. Now in the 4.h quarter, Newton struck again with a 44-yard touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin to give the Panthers a 32-24 lead. At this point, the Raiders had given up 4 unanswered touchdowns, lost a 17-point lead, and their star quarterback was hurting. Things did not look good for the home team. Carr had the glove on and couldn't take snaps from center, but he lined up in the shotgun and started the work to bring his team back. He methodically led his offense down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clive Walford. Then, Carr hit Seth Roberts for the 2.point conversion to tie the game midway through the 4.h quarter. The Panthers then stalled at midfield, and coach Ron Rivera opted to punt on 4.h-and-1 with 5 minutes left in the game. This was a decision that Riverboat Ron probably wants back. Carr then promptly moved his team down the field again, hitting Michael Crabtree twice, which Crabtree turned into great receptions; the last taking the Raiders down to the 5-yard line where Janikowski kicked a field goal to give his team the lead with 1:45 left on the clock. Newton had plenty of time to move his team down the field, but Greg Olsen dropped a pass that would have put the Panthers well within field-goal range, and then Khalil Mack strip-sacked Newton to end the game. This was a wild affair to say the least, but Carr was the catalyst behind Oakland's 4.h-quarter comeback and showed why he's right in the thick of the MVP race.    The Raiders at 9-2 are tied with the Patriots for the best record in the AFC, but the AFC West is tough, and Kansas City and Denver will play the Raiders again this year.    The Panthers are last in the NFC South at 4-7, and they go to Seattle next week. It's time to start thinking about next year. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
