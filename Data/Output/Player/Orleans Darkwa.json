   "comment":"Orleans Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York."

That, and it looked like the Broncos were half-asleep in this game, as they were caught off-guard by a winless foe they were supposed to vanquish quite easily.    "
