   "comment":"Darkwa started rolling over the Dallas defense as he had carries of 9 and 10 yards before a 15-yard touchdown to cap the drive. Dallas responded with a field goal drive that was led by a 27-yard pass to Terrance Williams, but a questionable offensive pass interference penalty negated a 31-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. Late in the second quarter, Cassel made a pretty touch pass on a corner post for 35 yards to the Giants' 5-yard line. A few plays later, McFadden plunged into the end zone from a yard out. In the final 2 minutes, Manning executed a drive to grab a field goal. The big play was a 38-yard slant to Dwayne Harris. Dallas took a 13-10 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Cowboys self-destructed. For 1. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped a route and Terrance Williams fell down. Rodgers-Cromartie picked off the pass and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. On the next drive, Dallas went into New York territory before Cassel threw a floater deep down the field and Brandon Meriweather ran under it for an interception at the Giants' 1-yard line. Randle made an amazing 1.handed reception for a 41-yard gain. Shane Vereen took off on a 39-yard run on the next play to the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Dallas stopped the drive, but Josh Brown hit a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 20-13 lead. Dallas put together another drive that ended with Rodgers-Cromartie picking off Cassel again. The pass was behind his receiver and flew right to Rodgers-Cromartie. After a New York punt, the Cowboys finally finished off a drive. They ran the ball to midfield before Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards on a corner route along the sideline. On the next play, Devin Street made a beautiful 25-yard touchdown catch as he tip-toed in bounds while reaching to catch the pass over the chalk. It was terrible coverage by Giants safety Landon Collins. With the game tied at 20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris brought the kickoff back 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Dallas went through a time-consuming drive starting at its own 31 before stalling at New York's 30. The Cowboys ate up 5 minutes of clock for those 60 yards. After forcing a Giants punt, Cole Beasley muffed the catch, and it was recovered by New York to clinch the win for the Giants.    Eli Manning was 13-of-24 for 170 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Manning avoided mistakes, and that was the difference between him and Cassel.    Shane Vereen (4-56), Orleans Darkwa (8-48-1), Rashad Jennings (5-19) and Andre Williams (4-13) split up the carries for New York."

   "comment":"Darkwa (8-69-1) was bursting through some huge holes, including a 23-yard touchdown run that put up New York 9-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Chargers got moving with a 22-yard pass to Tyrell Williams (1-22), aided by a 15-yard penalty on B.J. Goodson. After a few other short gains, Rivers threw a short touchdown pass to Melvin Gordon. New kicker Nick Novak cut the lead to 9-7. Late in the first half, Chargers receiver Travis Benjamin (2-18) got wide open in the end zone in busted coverage, but he had the pass bounce off his fingertips. Rivers moved inside the 5. but the drive stalled as Los Angeles settled for a field goal and a 10-9 halftime lead. In the third quarter, Rivers drove into Giants territory, but then he didn't see Darian Thompson, and the New York safety cut in front of Keenan Allen in the end zone for an interception. The Giants took advantage with Manning lofting in a touchdown pass to Roger Lewis, who beat Casey Hayward for the 29-yard score. Rivers responded by leading the Chargers down the field, spreading the ball around on a 92-yard, 12-play drive. Once again, the Giants were burned by a tight end as Rivers made a tremendous throw off his back foot to lead Hunter Henry (3-42-1) past 2 safeties for a 25-yard touchdown pass. That gave the Chargers a 17-16 lead entering the 4.h quarter. The lead didn't last long as Beckham got wide open after torching Hayward for a 48-yard touchdown. A 2.point attempt failed, so New York had a 22-17 lead. Rivers led another drive deep into Giants territory, but Thompson came up big with a diving pass breakup to save a touchdown. Los Angeles cut the lead to 22-20 with just under 5 minutes remaining. Disaster than struck for New York as Beckham went down with an injury to his left leg and had to be carted off the field. That sucked the air out of the building, and on the next play, Melvin Ingram strip-sacked Manning. Ingram recovered the loose ball to set up Los Angeles at the Giants' 11-yard line. A few plays later, Rivers hit Gordon in the flat, and Gordon darted into the end zone to give the Chargers a 27-22 lead. Manning had 1 more chance, but after getting to midfield, a tipped pass was picked off by Tre Boston to clinch the victory for Los Angeles.    Manning completed 21-of-36 for 225 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Manning was under constant duress as the Giants' offensive line was terrible in pass protection. Ingram and Joey Bosa each had 2 sacks and a forced fumble.    Beckham took 5 receptions for 97 yards and a score, but he broke his ankle. The Giants' receiving corps was absolutely decimated by injury in this game with Sterling Shepard (ankle), Brandon Marshall (ankle) and Dwayne Harris (foot) all going out prior to Beckham getting injured.    Wayne Gallman ran for 57 yards on 11 carries. He had more carries than Darkwa, but Darkwa outgained him.    Rivers completed 21-of-44 passes for 258 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. Allen led the Chargers in receiving with 4 reception for 67 yards.    Gordon ran for 105 yards on 20 carries with 6 receptions for 58 yards and 2 touchdowns. Gordon was excellent, and he dominated New York's vulnerable linebackers.   "

   "comment":"Darkwa before this game. A few individuals may have even confused his name with Darkwing Duck. Darkwa, however, gashed the Broncos' No. 1 ground defense for 117 yards on 21 carries. Darkwa looked good, but it was more of the Giants' new blocking scheme that did the trick. That, and it looked like the Broncos were half-asleep in this game, as they were caught off-guard by a winless foe they were supposed to vanquish quite easily.    "

   "comment":"Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a 4.h-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, Tyreek Hill (7-68) made a leaping 38-yard catch over Janoris Jenkins to get the Chiefs into New York territory. Once again, the drive stalled, and Kansas City tied the game at 6 with another field goal. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Chiefs tried a trick play with Kelce throwing a deep ball for Demarcus Robinson, but the pass was easily intercepted by Landon Collins. Kansas City's defense bailed out the offense and got the ball back, but the Chiefs were put in a tough situation again as Smith overthrew Robinson and Jenkins intercepted the pass. Jenkins then returned the pick to the Chiefs' 23-yard line with just over 2 minutes remaining. New York hit a 26-yard field goal to go up 9-6 with 1:38 left. The Chiefs got into field-goal range with a 32-yard completion to Kelce that put them inside the New York 35-yard line. Smith threw some short passes and ran for a first down to get inside the 15, but shots at the end zone went incomplete, so Kansas City tied the game at 9 to force overtime. The Chiefs had a drive going in overtime, but ended up punting again. With less than 2 minutes remaining in the extra period, Roger Lewis (3-55) made an incredible catch on 4.h down while sliding on the ground for 34 yards. That got the Giants to the Kansas City 2-yard line, and soon Aldrick Rosas drilled the 23-yard field goal for the win.    Smith was 27-of-40 for 230 yards with 2 interceptions. Hunt ran for 73 yards on 18 carries.    Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving with 8 catches for 109 yards. Surprisingly against Kelce, the Giants' defense ended their streak of 10 straight games of giving up a touchdown to a tight end.    Eli Manning was 19-of-35 for 205 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Darkwa had 74 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
