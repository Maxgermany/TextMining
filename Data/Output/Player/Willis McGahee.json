McClain (75 yards) scored a touchdown, while McGahee (62 yards), broke free for a 48-yard gain that set up Flacco's scoring scramble.    Baltimore travels to Tennessee next week. The Titans are going to have their hands full with the red-hot Ravens, especially after resting their starters in Week 17. The 1 team playing this weekend that rested its starters (Indianapolis) kissed its Super Bowl dreams goodbye. Tennessee is in serious danger of suffering the same fate, as are the Giants, who only played 1 half. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Willis McGahee dropped a pass on 4.h down and fumbled the ball in the red zone late in the game. I'm thinking about sending him an invoice for the $220 I lost betting on his team. F-U, Willis. </i>    Peyton Manning versus Tom Brady XIII turned out to be a familiar refrain for the 2012 Denver Broncos: another 4.h-quarter comeback that fell short after the defense dug too big a hole to climb out of. New England moved the ball at will on Denver and set a team record with 35 first downs, while running for 251 yards. Brady was firing bullets through the Broncos secondary early on with Wes Welker being his go-to receiver. So much for Welker (13-104) getting phased out by the Patriots; he had 9 catches in the first half and helped build New England's lead with a short touchdown catch. Brady finished 23-of-31 for 223 yards, that score, a rushing touchdown and zero interceptions.    All of the Patriots running backs contributed to the win. New England got the ground game going late in the first half with Steven Ridley and Brandon Bolden (14-54). That extended into the third quarter with Danny Woodhead (7-47) converting a third-and-17 with a run that caught Denver by surprise, and Shane Vereen's 1 carry was a touchdown plunge. The Broncos had no answer for Ridley, and he ripped up Denver's defense on runs to the outside and inside. Ridley (28-151) was having a flawless day until he fumbled the ball away with 5 minutes left on the clock. Von Miller ripped the ball out. Miller had a great game with a couple of sacks as well.    Manning moved the ball well from start to finish, but was let down by pass-protection issues and mistakes from his receivers. Demaryius Thomas caught a long pass early in the game and was racing down the field when Sterling Moore popped the ball out from behind. Moore recovered the ball just in front of the goal line. A blind-side sack by Rob Ninkovich forced a fumble, which Vince Wilfork pounced on, to set up a Ridley touchdown and a 31-7 lead for New England.    After Denver went down by 24 points, Manning moved the ball down the field quickly on a few possessions. He finished drives with short touchdown throws to Eric Decker (4-21), Joel Dreessen (4-21) and Brandon Stokley (2-10). Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1.handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a 4.h down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the 4.h quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   "
