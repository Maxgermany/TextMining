Yet, after a 3-yard rush from the former, the Ravens called 2 consecutive passes. Joe Flacco's second throw was an interception. Two possessions later, Flacco dropped back in the pocket on all 3 downs. He took a sack on first down; completed a short pass on second down; and fumbled the ball away on the final play. The sack and fumble put the Ravens back on their own 11, forcing poor field position on the ensuing punt. The Colts scored a touchdown on the next drive.    In total, the Ravens had just 14 rushing yards at halftime, which was shocking because the Colts have been so porous against opposing ground attacks. But looking at the plays, Baltimore ran the ball just 10 times in the first 30 minutes. That's not nearly enough against a defense whose strength is defending the pass.    It was clear early that Indianapolis didn't respect the pass. Good call on their part; Joe Flacco was completely abysmal, throwing 3 picks and fumbling twice.    Meanwhile, McGahee and McClain finished with terrible numbers. McGahee had 18 yards on 8 carries, while McClain had minus-2 yards and a fumble on 2 attempts. "

   "comment":"Willis McGahee ran up the middle for 24 yards. Broncos kicker McGahee ran up the middle for 24 yards. Broncos kicker Matt Prater made a 37-yard field goal to eke out another win for Denver. All game, San Diego's pass rush was pathetic. Tebow had all day to throw the ball on many pass plays. The Chargers' offensive line also struggled with the Broncos edge rushers. Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 3 sacks on the afternoon. Rivers was only 19-of-36 for 188 yards and 1 touchdown. Mathews ran for 137 yards on 22 carries. Gates had 6 catches for 50 yards and a score. Denver's play-calling is at best a work in progress. They don't mix in enough play-action passing. San Diego was selling out to stop the run and at the same time they couldn't get any pass rush. Tebow threw some good deep balls, and he is better at throwing deep than at precision passing in the short to intermediate part of the field. Tebow finished the game 9-of-18 for 143 yards and 1 touchdown. He also ran for 67 yards on 22 carries. McGahee had a good game with 117 yards on 23 carries.   "

New England moved the ball at will on Denver and set a team record with 35 first downs, while running for 251 yards. Brady was firing bullets through the Broncos secondary early on with Wes Welker being his go-to receiver. So much for Welker (13-104) getting phased out by the Patriots; he had 9 catches in the first half and helped build New England's lead with a short touchdown catch. Brady finished 23-of-31 for 223 yards, that score, a rushing touchdown and zero interceptions.    All of the Patriots running backs contributed to the win. New England got the ground game going late in the first half with Steven Ridley and Brandon Bolden (14-54). That extended into the third quarter with Danny Woodhead (7-47) converting a third-and-17 with a run that caught Denver by surprise, and Shane Vereen's 1 carry was a touchdown plunge. The Broncos had no answer for Ridley, and he ripped up Denver's defense on runs to the outside and inside. Ridley (28-151) was having a flawless day until he fumbled the ball away with 5 minutes left on the clock. Von Miller ripped the ball out. Miller had a great game with a couple of sacks as well.    Manning moved the ball well from start to finish, but was let down by pass-protection issues and mistakes from his receivers. Demaryius Thomas caught a long pass early in the game and was racing down the field when Sterling Moore popped the ball out from behind. Moore recovered the ball just in front of the goal line. A blind-side sack by Rob Ninkovich forced a fumble, which Vince Wilfork pounced on, to set up a Ridley touchdown and a 31-7 lead for New England.    After Denver went down by 24 points, Manning moved the ball down the field quickly on a few possessions. He finished drives with short touchdown throws to Eric Decker (4-21), Joel Dreessen (4-21) and Brandon Stokley (2-10). Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1.handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a 4.h down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the 4.h quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   McGahee dropped a pass on 4.h down and fumbled the ball in the red zone late in the game. I'm thinking about sending him an invoice for the $220 I lost betting on his team. F-U, Willis. </i>    Peyton Manning versus Tom Brady XIII turned out to be a familiar refrain for the 2012 Denver Broncos: another 4.h-quarter comeback that fell short after the defense dug too big a hole to climb out of. New England moved the ball at will on Denver and set a team record with 35 first downs, while running for 251 yards.
