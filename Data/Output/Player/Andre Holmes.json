   "comment":"Holmes connection, while their only points came off a botched snap by the Raiders inside their own 10, which prompted Phil Simms to remark, Matt McGloin pulled out a little quick. Somewhere, Matt Millen was watching the game and smiling. Romo had just 69 passing yards entering the final drive of the first half, trailing 21-7. He couldn't get anything going with Dez Bryant, who dropped a pass and was guilty of a fumble that Dallas recovered. Thanks in part to multiple injuries in Oakland's secondary, things seemed to click for Romo from that point on. Though he started with those 69 yards, he finished 23-of-32 for 225 yards and a touchdown. Romo was so efficient offensively that he helped his team score 4 times in the final 5 drives of the game.    Bryant, meanwhile, would go on to redeem himself. He led the team in receiving with 7 catches for 61 yards and a touchdown. Perhaps his best play occurred late when he caught a short pass and fought off 3 Raider tacklers to fight for a first down. He didn't completely get there, but it set up a third-and-short for his team that was easily converted to help Dallas bleed the clock.    DeMarco Murray is another Cowboy who began slowly, only to have a strong finish. Murray mustered just 12 rushing yards on 7 carries in the first half, but he finished with a 17-63 line to go along with 5 catches for 39 receiving yards. Murray also scored a whopping 3 touchdowns. He actually ran into the end zone on 4 occasions, but 1 of the touchdowns was negated by a holding penalty. Lance Dunbar, meanwhile, spelled Murray and had even more success in terms of yardage. He tallied 82 yards on just 12 carries.    As for the Raiders, they showed so much promise on offense in the early stages of this contest, but they fizzled out in the second half. McGloin, who was 11-of-15 for 146 yards in the opening 2 quarters, was just 7-of-15 for 109 yards and an interception following intermission. The pick was a back-breaker, as it occurred in the red zone when McGloin underthrew his intended receiver. Had Oakland just converted a field goal there, it could have concentrated on a touchdown on its final offensive drive where the team wisely settled for a field goal once it got into Sebastian Janikowski's range. McGloin, who ultimately finished 18-of-30 for 255 yards and the pick, targeted Andre Holmes frequently. Holmes, starting in favor of the injured Denarius Moore, made several incredible, acrobatic catches in this contest. He caught 7 balls for 136 yards and was inches short of a touchdown in the second quarter. "

   "comment":"Holmes, who got open against Justin Gilbert. Kenbrell Thompkins (4-34) made an awesome 1.handed, back-shoulder reception to give Janikowski an easy 38-yarder. The Browns took a 9-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Carr had a nice drive going with accurate passes to a variety of receivers, but at the 20-yard line, Darren McFadden (12-59 rushing, 4-26 receiving) fumbled the ball after getting blasted by Donte Whitner. Joe Haden caught the fumble in the air and returned it to midfield. On the next play, Brian Hoyer hit a 32-yard pass to Andrew Hawkins. Hoyer then hit tight end Jim Dray for 16 yards to the 5. Hoyer finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Hawkins (7-88). To clinch the win, Austin Howard was knocked back into Carr, who fumbled the ball away. Barkevious Mingo recovered at Oakland's 9-yard line. Ben Tate (15-26) scored to put the game on ice for Cleveland. In the final seconds of the game, Carr threw a short touchdown pass to Holmes (5-69), as he powered through Gilbert for 6.    Hoyer finished 19-of-28 for 275 yards with a touchdown. The Browns really never got into a groove offensively, as they had only 39 yards rushing.    The Browns' defense was the real star of the game. Haden has been criticized for his play this season, but he had a bounce-back performance against Oakland. Haden had 2 impressive pass breakups in the 4.h quarter. He led Cleveland with 9 tackles. "
