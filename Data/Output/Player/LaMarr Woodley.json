   "comment":"Woodley, so Pittsburgh didn't need to do anything offensively.    Watching Palmer play is like having a sick old dog that can't move around anymore. It's really sad to watch. Palmer has absolutely no zip on his passes, which allowed the Pittsburgh defenders to feast on his passes. He went 20-of-32 for 178 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. Palmer's score screwed all fantasy owners, as he went to tackle-eligible "

   "comment":"Woodley came down with the ball and it was the first interception of the season for the Pittsburgh defense. It led to a field goal and a 31-10 advantage for the Steelers. Sepulveda had a punt blocked midway through the 4.h quarter. It was picked up by Finnegan and returned for a touchdown, but a block in the back penalty took the score away and gave the Titans the ball in Steelers' territory. Hasselbeck finished the drive with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Damien Williams. For the game, Hasselbeck was 29-of-49 for 262 yards and 1 score with 1 interception. Johnson ran for 51 yards on 14 carries. The Steelers finished the game with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace. He had mainly caught short passes in the game, and that set up the Titans for a deep strike to the speedster receiver. Wallace caught 6 passes for 82 yards and 1 touchdown. Ward had 7 receptions for 54 yards and 2 scores.    Roethlisberger completed 24-of-34 passes for 228 yards with 5 touchdowns and 1 interception. It was very impressive considering he was playing with an injured foot. Dwyer led the Steelers in rushing with 107 yards on 11 carries. Overall, the Steelers' heavily criticized offensive line played well against the Titans defensive line. The Steelers had signed Max Starks off the street recently. He started and played well at left tackle. On the defensive side of the ball, Woodley, Ziggy Hood and Brett Keisel had good games."
