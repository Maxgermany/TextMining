The onside kick was recovered by Vernon Davis who drew a flag for trying to fair catch a ball that was driven into the ground. There was not much to this game. Both defenses can play. Smith (17-for-24 200 yards, 1 TD) was amazingly efficient and did not turn it over. Washington was forced to throw, and Chris Cooley or Santana Moss, that was not going to work. "

Cruz caught 7 balls for 131 yards. Two other Giants snagged more than 4 passes: Martellus Bennett (5-79) and Hakeem Nicks (5-53). Nicks didn't look like himself, struggling to get open because his knee injury was still plaguing him.    Ahmad Bradshaw, who was questionable coming into this game with a foot malady, received just 12 carries. He tallied 43 yards and a touchdown. Immediately afterward, he and Tom Coughlin engaged in a verbal fight on the sideline. Perhaps Bradshaw was angry that Coughlin allowed Andre Brown (5-17) to vulture a score earlier in the contest.    Alfred Morris rushed for 120 yards on 22 carries, but also was guilty of a fumble. This occurred after a long run of his was negated by a leg whip penalty.    Both of Griffin's scores went to Santana Moss (3-67), but before you get too excited, he received just 4 targets. There's not much here, as his touchdowns were fluky. He also had the game-losing fumble near midfield. Hankerson led the team with 6 catches for 70 yards.    The Redskins suffered 2 injuries in this contest. The first was to "

Manning lofted in an excellent throw on which Beckham made a typical great catch for a gain of 26 yards and put his team in range for Josh Brown. Atlanta answered with a field goal drive of its own thanks to a superb third-down catch by Devonta Freeman.

Beckham had ripped off 139 yards on 6 receptions by the half, when New York was up 13-10. To open the third quarter, the Giants got going thanks a quick pass to Shane Vereen for a 37-yard gain. Manning finished the drive by throwing a 10-yard bullet to Larry Donnell for a touchdown. After a quick 3.and-out for the Falcons, Andre Williams ripped off a 35-yard run. New York continued moving, arriving inside the 10, but Manning was strip-sacked by Kroy Bierman from behind to take the momentum back for Atlanta. Ryan soon took advantage with a 41-yard pass to Tamme to reach midfield. To cap the drive, a well-thrown pass beat good coverage for Hankerson to reel in a 10-yard touchdown.

   "comment":"Hankerson and Roddy White. Excluding Jones and Freeman, Hankerson was the only Falcon who saw more than 1 target. He caught 3 of the 6 balls thrown his way for 45 yards. He dropped a pass earlier that was nearly intercepted as a result. White, meanwhile, wasn't officially targeted. He caught a 17-yard pass, but it was nullified by a holding penalty. White is no longer a big part of Atlanta's offense, so he can be dropped in 12-team formats.    Going back to the Cowboys, "

   "comment":"Hankerson in the end zone to go up 2 touchdowns. Hasselbeck followed that up with a horrible pick into double coverage. And yeah, the Colts somehow won! It was a combination of factors that did the Falcons in, beginning with Matt Ryan. Atlanta's signal-caller was guilty of 3 interceptions himself. The first wasn't really his fault, as it was a tipped pass that appeared to hit the ground. Mike Carey said that it should've been ruled incomplete. Ryan's third pick was on a Hail Mary attempt that was actually snatched by Coby Fleener. The middle interception was the horrible 1. as the Falcons were backed up on their own 1-yard line. Ryan dropped back to pass and inexplicably didn't see D'Qwell Jackson, who scored the easiest pick-six of his life. Ryan also missed plenty of open receivers. One play stands out in the 4.h quarter, as Ryan had an open Julio Jones on third down. Converting would've moved the chains and put the Falcons close to midfield to potentially win the game, but Ryan simply sailed the ball wide of his stud receiver. Ryan finished 25-of-46 for 280 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The trio of scores helped his few fantasy owners, but don't let those fool you into thinking that Ryan had a decent performance. He was awful by his standards, and it's not like this is a 1.game abberation. Ryan has been struggling all season, and I have to wonder if he's playing through an undisclosed injury.    Another reason the Falcons fell to the Colts was Devonta Freeman's concussion. Freeman left in the middle of the opening quarter, leaving Tevin Coleman as the primary ball-carrier. Coleman proved to be a massive downgrade, mustering just 48 yards on 17 carries as well as a lost fumble. Freeman, by comparison, nearly had as much yardage (43) on just 3 attempts.    Some of Atlanta's receivers had some drops as well. Leonard Hankerson had a crucial ball slip through his hands, though he did enjoy a strong fantasy performance because of a touchdown. He caught 4 passes for 36 yards. He was second on the team in receiving, trailing Jones, who logged 9 receptions for 160 yards. Meanwhile, "
