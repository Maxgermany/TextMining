Cincinnati's defense was supposed to be the part of the team that sucked; not the offense. Yet, midway through the second quarter, the Bengals were averaging just 2.23 yards per play - and that excludes sacks! Then again, giving up 17 points to a rookie quarterback and first-year coach combination is pretty bad as well.
