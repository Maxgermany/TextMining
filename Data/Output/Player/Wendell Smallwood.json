   "comment":"Smallwood lost a fumble, and then it actually appeared as though the Eagles would be able to put it away with a field goal to make it a 10-point margin with a few minutes remaining. However, a bad Jason Kelce snap forced Philadelphia out of kicking range. The Cowboys followed that up with a game-tying drive and then ultimately won in overtime.    Prescott struggled in the first 3 quarters. On top of the aforementioned miscues, he was just inaccurate for the most part. However, Prescott put together 2 amazing drives to seal the victory. He hit Bryant for a 22-yard game-tying score, and following a successful sneak on 4.h-and-1 in overtime, he connected with a wide-open Jason Witten for the decisive touchdown. Prescott finished 19-of-39 for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and the interception to Hicks. He made up for that horrid completion percentage by moving well on the ground, scrambling 7 times for 38 rushing yards and an additional score. His early struggles at least have to be somewhat worrisome, but his ability to come through in the clutch means so much more.    The Cowboys welcomed Bryant back to the lineup for the first time since Week 3. Bryant caught just 4 of his 14 targets, though that wasn't his fault, as Prescott dealt with accuracy issues. Bryant did have 113 yards and a touchdown, but he really should have found the end zone 3 times. Aside from Bryant, only 2 other Cowboys had more than 25 receiving yards: Elliott (4-52) and Cole Beasley (4-53). Witten, who scored the game-winning touchdown, only snatched 2 balls for 16 yards.    Speaking of Elliot, he was impressive once again, gaining 96 yards on 22 carries. The Eagles have a strong ground defense, so don't read anything into Elliott failing to reach the century mark. Elliott burst for some tremendous runs in this contest, and he had a long gain negated by a shaky holding call.    Before moving on to the Eagles, it's worth noting that 2 important Dallas defensive backs - Morris Claiborne, Barry Church - were knocked out with injuries.    Carson Wentz had a solid performance in Dallas despite missing his very talented right tackle. Wentz finished 32-of-43 for 202 yards, and those stats should've been so much better because his teammates dropped a whopping 6 passes. He only had a couple of bad throws, 1 of which was a dropped pick-six by Orlando Scandrick in the 4.h quarter. Still, Philadelphia fans should take this as a positive, as Wentz would've posted much better stats if he were paired with superior teammates. There will be criticism for Wentz not testing Dallas deep, but with Johnson out, and the lack of talent at receiver, it can't be much of a surprise that the Eagles opted to play it safe. Wentz's 1 viable wide receiver is Jordan Matthews, who caught 11 passes for 65 yards and a touchdown. Matthews was guilty of a drop in the red zone, but it didn't matter because the Eagles scored on that drive anyway. Dorial Green-Beckham (5-55) was the only other Eagle who accumulated more than 25 receiving yards. Nelson Agholor (3-25) was guilty of a couple of drops. It's easy to see why the Eagles are desperate to trade for a wideout.    The Eagles have problems at running back as well. Ryan Mathews found the end zone, but was benched in the second half, as he finished the game with only 10 yards on 4 carries, none of which came following intermission. One of his replacements was Smallwood, who lost a fumble on his only attempt. "

   "comment":"Smallwood and Nelson Agholor each dropped passes. Doug Pederson called yet another slow-developing play on a third down, and Ryan Mathews was predictably stuffed. Special-teamer Najee Goode committed a dumb, late-hit personal foul after the play was whistled dead. With all of these blunders, the Eagles were just dying to blow this game, but the Falcons made their own mistakes and couldn't take advantage.    Carson Wentz finished 25-of-36 for 231 yards and the aforementioned lost fumble. He began the afternoon on an extremely hot pace, as he was 8-of-8 for 95 yards. He didn't start playing poorly, or anything, but his receivers, as mentioned, let him down with some bad drops. Outside of the fumble, Wentz had a strong afternoon.    The story of this game, from Philadelphia's perspective, was that Ryan Mathews reemerged as a big factor in the offense. Mathews played single-digit snaps the past 2 weeks, yet was featured heavily. Mathews was given 5 consecutive runs to cap off a touchdown drive to begin the afternoon. He ended up finishing 108 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 attempts. It's pretty astonishing that Mathews did this after barely being seen the past couple of weeks. Sproles, meanwhile, appeared to be the featured back heading into this contest, but had just 2 carries for 19 yards in this contest, though he was a big factor in the passing game, catching 8 balls for 57 receiving yards. Smallwood was given 13 attempts, which he transformed into 70 yards.    Besides Sproles, only 2 Eagles caught more than 2 passes: Jordan Matthews (6-73) and "

However, his inconsistent workload will make him a FLEX play most weeks. Smallwood actually outgained Blount with 71 yards on 12 carries. He looked fairly good, but Blount will continue to see goal-line work. "
