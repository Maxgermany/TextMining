   "comment":"Terrance West. Ben Tate was running well early - 6 carries, 41 yards - but he hurt his knee and left the game. Shocker. West took over and was dominant, tallying 100 yards on just 16 carries. He has lots of talent, so he needs to be added in all formats.    Ben Roethlisberger had a great stat line - 23-of-34, 365 yards, touchdown and an interception - but those numbers are slightly misleading because some of Roethlisberger's big, first-half gains came on screens. For instance, an Antonio Brown 41-yarder on the opening drive came on a slip screen. Roethlisberger also struggled in the second half, going just 7-of-12 for 87 yards following intermission. Having said that, Roethlisberger made several great plays to lead his team to victory, which was capped off by a game-winning drive at the very end when Cleveland had all of the momentum. What stood out most was when he escaped out of 2 potential sacks and found Brown in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. It should be noted that part of the reason Roethlisberger struggled after the break was because the offensive line couldn't block Cleveland at all.    Brown paced the Steelers in receiving yardage with 116 on 5 catches. Le'Veon Bell (6 catches, 88 yards) and Markus Wheaton (6-97) tied for the team lead in catches. Rookie cornerback Justin Gilbert struggled to cover Wheaton.    I mentioned Shazier earlier. The No. 15 overall pick had a terrific regular-season debut. He made a huge hit on Terrance West, stuffed another running back for a loss and made a pass break-up in the first half, nearly coming away with an interception. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   West.

   "comment":"Terrance West went the wrong way and couldn't get the handoff. These were the types of mistakes Cleveland made throughout the afternoon. Of course, Manziel's passing was atrocious. His stats don't even tell the whole story. He went 10-of-18 for 80 yards and 2 interceptions, but those numbers are misleading, as he was 5-of-12 for only 28 yards and the 2 picks by the time this game was 23-0. The trouble began when Manziel was picked on a late throw. He then passed way above Jim Dray's head on a third down. He tossed a high interception and laughed while walking off the field, but the play was negated by a penalty. It didn't matter though because he heaved his second pick later on the drive, carelessly launching the ball late across his body in the red zone. He nearly had another interception later, as he made the same mistake. Johnny Arena League Football wasn't even effective as a runner. He had a 10-yard scramble late, but did nothing otherwise. His totals were 13 rushing yards on 5 scrambles, as the Bengals were fully prepared for him with a spy. The Cincinnati players constantly mocked Manziel throughout the afternoon, making his patented money sign whenever they made a big play. They were right in doing so, as Manziel is a complete joke, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he's out of the league in a couple of years.    The Bengals, meanwhile, rammed the ball down Cleveland's throat early and often. They opened the game with multiple successful drives in which the Bengal running backs - especially Jeremy Hill - burst for gains of 6-10 yards on seemingly every carry. It was odd to see, as Cleveland's ground defense had been better lately, but the team just looked so inept trying to stop Hill, who finished with 148 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 carries. Giovani Bernard (15-79) also ran well, but it's clear that Cincinnati will be rolling with Hill as its featured runner from now on, and rightfully so. Bernard is a nice receiver out of the backfield, but Hill is so much better in between the tackles.    Cincinnati may have won this game 60-0 if it wasn't for Andy Dalton. The team prevailed in spite of him, as Dalton struggled once again. He went 14-of-24 for 117 yards and an interception, though he lucked out that the Browns were guilty of a low block on the return. Dalton was even more fortunate when Joe Haden dropped an interception of his. He also should've thrown a touchdown, but overshot an open Mohamed Sanu. Dalton is atrocious, but no 1 will talk about this because the Bengals prevailed in a blowout, as Manziel made Dalton look like the second coming of Joe Montana by comparison.    Dalton usually struggles versus Cleveland because Haden typically shuts down A.J. Green. That wasn't the case in this contest because Haden was knocked out with an injury in the second quarter. Green was still limited to 5 catches for 49 yards, thanks to Dalton's ineptitude.    Some other notes/stats for the Browns: - Josh Gordon led the Browns in receiving, catching just 3 passes for 48 yards. Jordan Cameron (1 catch, 4 yards) didn't do anything either. Neither will be a fantasy factor until the Browns make the change back to Brian Hoyer. - Manziel should've opened things up for the ground game, but that wasn't the case. Neither Terrance West (5-23) nor Isaiah Crowell (7-17) had any running room."

Six of Aiken's receptions came in the first half, so this was not a case of him accumulating garbage yardage. Aiken is legit and appears as though he can be a decent No. 2 receiver.   West handled the majority of the workload as a consequence, generating 76 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries, with most of his yardage coming on his 38-yard score.    Moving quickly through Baltimore's numbers, Clausen went 26-of-45 for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Clausen's highlight was launching a 48-yard Hail Mary right before halftime that hilariously landed way short of the end zone. It looked like a terrific punt. The Chiefs seemed surprised by this, allowing Aiken to catch the ball and score. Clausen didn't perform poorly or anything; on the contrary, he was better than expected. His 2 picks came late in desperation time, and he did a decent job of moving the chains. Unfortunately, the team's aforementioned mistakes proved to be too costly.    Speaking of which, Buck Allen didn't get a single carry after halftime, thanks to his early fumble. He gained 18 yards on 4 carries, and he watched Terrance West (7-35) handle the majority of the workload following intermission.    Aiken played great, catching 8 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown, including the Hail Mary.

   "comment":"Terrance West ripped a run of 35 yards to get inside the Redskins' red zone. A pass to Mike Wallace moved the ball to the 7-yard line, and the next play saw Flacco hit Crockett Gilmore (4-28) for a touchdown. The Redskins got on the scoreboard as Jamison Crowder ripped off an 85-yard punt return for a score, but Washington missed the extra point. Baltimore soon added a field-goal drive, with the big playing being a 26-yard pass interference on linebacker Will Compton. The Ravens were set up for more points when Zach Orr caused and recovered a fumble from Matt Jones at Washington's 15-yard line. The Redskins' defense held strong, however, and the Ravens tried a fake field goal, but Justin Tucker's pass fell incomplete. It was a curious decision that ended up hurting Baltimore in the 4.h quarter. Just before the half, the Redskins missed a 56-yard field goal, letting the Ravens take a 10-6 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, the Redskins took advantage of a short field with Cousins making a pretty throw to Pierre Garcon (5-56) for a 21-yard touchdown. With a 13-10 lead, Washington got the ball back deep in its own territory. Cousins was picked off by Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, but on the interception return, when he extended the ball for the end zone, he fumbled the ball out of bounds for a touchback. That turned out to be the play of the game as it robbed Baltimore of critical points, even if Mosley was tackled short of the end zone. It ended up being a 17-yard gain for Washington, and the Redskins took advantage with a drive that produced a field goal. After a bunch of punts from each team, the Ravens had 1 more shot and Flacco ran for a first down on a 4.h-and-2 at the 2-minute warning. Flacco continued to move the ball with short passes and then threw a strike to Wallace to get inside the Redskins' 25-yard line. A few plays later, Flacco hit Breshard Perriman, who made a catch over Josh Norman, for what was called a touchdown, but upon review, Perriman only got 1 foot down and it was overturned to an incompletion. On 4.h down, Will Compton broke up a pass intended for Wallace.    Joe Flacco was 30-of-46 for 210 yards and 1 touchdown. Baltimore's offensive line had problems protecting Flacco in the second half. Terrance West (11-95) led the Ravens on the ground.    Mike Wallace (7-63) was Baltimore's leading receiver. West ripped a run of 35 yards to get inside the Redskins' red zone.

On a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line, West could've cut upfield to potentially score, but he continued to run laterally and was consequently tackled short of the goal line. This play effectively lost the game for the Ravens. They should have tried a field goal, so they would've only needed 3 points at the very end.    Both teams are now 3-3, with the Ravens dealing with a 3.game losing streak. They can recover, however, but they need all of their injured players (Steve Smith, Jimmy Smith, Ronnie Stanley, C.J. Mosley, etc.) to return to action. They also have to stop committing senseless penalties; they racked up 111 penalty yards in this contest. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

The second problem area for the Ravens was the injury to West. Things could've been worse for Flacco, as he was tested for a concussion after a fierce hit. Fortunately, he was able to return to the game. The second problem area for the Ravens was the injury to Danny Woodhead. The pass-catching running back was a big part of their opening drive, snatching 3 receptions for 33 yards. However, he suffered an injury at the conclusion of the first possession, and he didn't return. If Woodhead is out for a while, the Ravens should consider trading for either Matt Forte or Dion Lewis.    With Woodhead gone, both West and Buck Allen saw a lot of work. West gained 80 yards and a touchdown on 19 tries, while Allen mustered 71 yards on 21 carries.    Save for Woodhead and Maclin (2 catches, 56 yards, touchdown), no Raven caught more than 1 pass. In fact, Maclin, Woodhead and "

Defensive lineman Brent Urban was knocked out with a foot sprain, while Maclin exited with a concussion (though he returned in the second half). Baltimore did not look prepared to play this silly 9:30 a.m. Eastern game, and it may have impacted the team's health as well. The NFL needs to abolish these horrible early games, as it is alienating West Coast football fans, who need to wake up at 6 a.m. to set their fantasy lineups. At any rate, Flacco finished 8-of-18 for 28 yards and 2 interceptions. One wasn't his fault, as the ball bounced off Maclin's hands, but the other occurred because Flacco stared down his receiver, allowing "
