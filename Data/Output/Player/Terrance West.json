   "comment":"Terrance West. Ben Tate was running well early - 6 carries, 41 yards - but he hurt his knee and left the game. Shocker. West took over and was dominant, tallying 100 yards on just 16 carries. He has lots of talent, so he needs to be added in all formats.    Ben Roethlisberger had a great stat line - 23-of-34, 365 yards, touchdown and an interception - but those numbers are slightly misleading because some of Roethlisberger's big, first-half gains came on screens. For instance, an Antonio Brown 41-yarder on the opening drive came on a slip screen. Roethlisberger also struggled in the second half, going just 7-of-12 for 87 yards following intermission. Having said that, Roethlisberger made several great plays to lead his team to victory, which was capped off by a game-winning drive at the very end when Cleveland had all of the momentum. What stood out most was when he escaped out of 2 potential sacks and found Brown in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown. It should be noted that part of the reason Roethlisberger struggled after the break was because the offensive line couldn't block Cleveland at all.    Brown paced the Steelers in receiving yardage with 116 on 5 catches. Le'Veon Bell (6 catches, 88 yards) and Markus Wheaton (6-97) tied for the team lead in catches. Rookie cornerback Justin Gilbert struggled to cover Wheaton.    I mentioned Shazier earlier. The No. 15 overall pick had a terrific regular-season debut. He made a huge hit on Terrance West, stuffed another running back for a loss and made a pass break-up in the first half, nearly coming away with an interception. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Terrance West went the wrong way and couldn't get the handoff. These were the types of mistakes Cleveland made throughout the afternoon. Of course, Manziel's passing was atrocious. His stats don't even tell the whole story. He went 10-of-18 for 80 yards and 2 interceptions, but those numbers are misleading, as he was 5-of-12 for only 28 yards and the 2 picks by the time this game was 23-0. The trouble began when Manziel was picked on a late throw. He then passed way above Jim Dray's head on a third down. He tossed a high interception and laughed while walking off the field, but the play was negated by a penalty. It didn't matter though because he heaved his second pick later on the drive, carelessly launching the ball late across his body in the red zone. He nearly had another interception later, as he made the same mistake. Johnny Arena League Football wasn't even effective as a runner. He had a 10-yard scramble late, but did nothing otherwise. His totals were 13 rushing yards on 5 scrambles, as the Bengals were fully prepared for him with a spy. The Cincinnati players constantly mocked Manziel throughout the afternoon, making his patented money sign whenever they made a big play. They were right in doing so, as Manziel is a complete joke, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he's out of the league in a couple of years.    The Bengals, meanwhile, rammed the ball down Cleveland's throat early and often. They opened the game with multiple successful drives in which the Bengal running backs - especially Jeremy Hill - burst for gains of 6-10 yards on seemingly every carry. It was odd to see, as Cleveland's ground defense had been better lately, but the team just looked so inept trying to stop Hill, who finished with 148 yards and 2 touchdowns on 25 carries. Giovani Bernard (15-79) also ran well, but it's clear that Cincinnati will be rolling with Hill as its featured runner from now on, and rightfully so. Bernard is a nice receiver out of the backfield, but Hill is so much better in between the tackles.    Cincinnati may have won this game 60-0 if it wasn't for Andy Dalton. The team prevailed in spite of him, as Dalton struggled once again. He went 14-of-24 for 117 yards and an interception, though he lucked out that the Browns were guilty of a low block on the return. Dalton was even more fortunate when Joe Haden dropped an interception of his. He also should've thrown a touchdown, but overshot an open Mohamed Sanu. Dalton is atrocious, but no 1 will talk about this because the Bengals prevailed in a blowout, as Manziel made Dalton look like the second coming of Joe Montana by comparison.    Dalton usually struggles versus Cleveland because Haden typically shuts down A.J. Green. That wasn't the case in this contest because Haden was knocked out with an injury in the second quarter. Green was still limited to 5 catches for 49 yards, thanks to Dalton's ineptitude.    Some other notes/stats for the Browns: - Josh Gordon led the Browns in receiving, catching just 3 passes for 48 yards. Jordan Cameron (1 catch, 4 yards) didn't do anything either. Neither will be a fantasy factor until the Browns make the change back to Brian Hoyer. - Manziel should've opened things up for the ground game, but that wasn't the case. Neither Terrance West (5-23) nor Isaiah Crowell (7-17) had any running room."

Dixon had 12 attempts compared to West's 10, but the rookie outgained the veteran, 57-27. On 1 occasion, Dixon converted a third-and-1 with a great power run. It's very evident that he's infinitely superior compared to West, and it's fair to wonder if the Ravens would've made the playoffs had they given the talented Dixon way more touches than the ineffective West in the second half of the season. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
