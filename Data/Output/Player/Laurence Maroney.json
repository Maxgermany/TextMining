At the end of the game, Denver gave the ball up on downs on back-to-back possessions inside the Indianapolis 20.    Kyle Orton went 37-of-57 for 476 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. His score was a beautiful 48-yard bomb to Brandon Lloyd. Lloyd put on a monstrous performance, catching 6 balls for 169 yards and that score. Jabar Gaffney also posted big numbers (12 catches, 140 yards) despite the presence of Demaryius Thomas. Thomas had 2 grabs for 43 yards, and almost pulled in a touchdown. However, Thomas suffered a hand injury at the end of the game.    With Knowshon Moreno out, Laurence Maroney got the start. It wasn't pretty. Maroney had just 24 yards on 12 carries, as well as 2 catches for 40 receiving yards. "
