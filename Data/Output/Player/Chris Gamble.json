   "comment":"Chris Gamble's (paraphrased). But I agree with Gamble. Moss didn't look like he was exerting too much effort on the field against the Panthers. He dropped multiple passes and had alligator arms a few times. He caught only 1 pass (16 yards) and fumbled the ball right away. Brady approached Moss a couple of times on the sideline. Brady looked like he was trying to encourage his receiver, but Moss didn't even look at his quarterback, sitting silently most of the time. It appears as though the locker-room toad everyone was expecting back in 2007 is finally festering in New England.    Including Moss' fumble, the Patriots had 2 turnovers in the red zone. That killed their chances of covering. Had they just scored 3 points on 1 of those 2 red-zone trips, they would have pushed.    The Patriots have other problems aside from Moss' lack of effort. Brady isn't even close to 100 percent. He could be playing with a broken finger and/or cracked ribs. He consequently was just 19-of-32 for 192 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He also missed a wide-open Moss in the end zone, though Moss probably would have dropped that pass anyway.    As for Brady's counterpart, "

   "comment":"Chris Gamble. As mentioned, Williams had a long score that was more of a product of poor Carolina tackling, so it's not like Hasselbeck was brilliant or anything. He was efficient though, which is all you can ask in the wake of Kenny Britt's injury.   "
