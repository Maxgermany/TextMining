He also had a 16-yard scramble. Smith endured many of the same issues Tom Brady faced. His receivers just let him down. "

   "comment":"Aqib Talib blanket the All-Pro tight end. Graham, who was limited to no catches - he had 1 drop, which was really a great play by Kyle Arrington - was helped into the locker room with a leg injury in the second half. Drew Brees looked a bit flustered without being able to go to Graham very much. After all, when do you see his team have 3 3.and-outs in a single half? When does Griffin miss a wide-open receiver (Nick Toon) for a touchdown? Would anyone have ever imagined Brees completing fewer than half of his passes? All of that happened, as Brees went 17-of-36 for 236 yards, 2 scores and an interception that was a weird lob after he tried calling timeout but was not granted the stoppage. Brees had some great throws - including a 34-yard touchdown strike to Kenny Stills (3-64) on a third-and-20.    Brees' other aerial score was vultured by Travaris Cadet. Marques Colston surprisingly was limited to just 1 reception for 11 yards.    The Saints ran the ball well, which wasn't a surprise because Vince Wilfork's absence continues to be huge. Pierre Thomas gained 51 yards on 11 carries, but the big star was Khiry Robinson, who tallied 53 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries.    Moving back to New England, the team suffered a quartet of injuries. In addition to Connolly, Aqib Talib, Jerod Mayo and Danny Amendola all had to leave the game."

New England had struggled against the run heading into this contest and didn't have Brandon Spikes available, yet Donald Brown was just limited to 63 yards on 17 carries. Take away a 16-yard burst, and Brown had a mere 16-47 line. Trent Richardson, meanwhile, was not a factor at all. He managed just 1 yard on 3 carries and was stuffed near the goal line.    Some other notes/stats for the Patriots: - Here's some history: Brady is now the first quarterback in league history with 6,000 career playoff passing yards. Meanwhile, New England's 6 rushing touchdowns in a postseason game is tied for second all time behind the 1940 Chicago Bears (7). - "

   "comment":"Aqib Talib pick-six at the very end ensured that the sportsbooks paid for posting such a short spread. Vegas lost millions because of that score. Manning struggled early, but ultimately got on track. He finished 22-of-33 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns, and he's now just 3 scores short of breaking Brett Favre's career record. One of Manning's best throws wasn't a touchdown, but ultimately led to 1. It was just an 8-yard completion, but he managed to find Demaryius Thomas for the gain while falling down. Thomas, in turn, tapped his toes inbounds, prompting Rex Ryan to throw the challenge flag. I have no idea how Manning managed to convert the pass. Manning's touchdowns once again went to nothing but Thomases. Demaryius (10-124) snagged 1. while Julius (4-51) had a pair. Julius yelled, It's so f***ing easy! It's so easy! following 1 of his scores. He was absolutely right, as New York's secondary once again offered no resistance.    "

   "comment":"Aqib Talib yanked off Crabtree's counterfeit gold chain during the game and then bragged about doing so to his teammates. Crabtree was hobbling around on a bum ankle all afternoon, as it was clear that he wasn't 100 percent. Crabtree caught 5 passes for 47 yards, while Cooper (4-39) snatched Oakland's only touchdown.    The Raiders were expected to run all over the Broncos, who have been weak to ground attacks all year. However, the Raider running backs mustered just 57 total rushing yards on 15 carries. "
