The pass sailed over Johnson's head, and the Lions settled for another field goal.    Stafford made a beautiful touchdown toss on a 4.h down. Calvin Johnson got behind Talib for a 36-yard touchdown score. Stafford threw a perfect pass just over the hand of Talib. On the next possession Stafford tossed an 11-yard score to "

Tampa Bay's lone touchdown drive was a nice mix of Doug Martin runs and Josh Freeman precision passes. It ended with a short touchdown pass from Freeman to Mike Williams (2-12). The Panthers had zero pass rush as Freeman had all day to throw the ball in the first half. They played better in the second half and were able to sack Freeman a couple of times.    Carolina's offense showed signs of life in the second half, too. Newton hit Steve Smith for 32 yards. Newton then had a nice third-down conversion to tight end Greg Olsen, before capping the drive with a touchdown strike to Brandon LaFell, who beat rookie safety Mark Barron to get wide open. Newton dropped in a bomb for 51 yards to Louis Murphy after he beat Talib down the field with 5 minutes in the 4.h quarter. The drive stalled inside the 5.yard line and Carolina settled for a field goal.    Tampa Bay ran out the clock with Martin to seal the win for new head coach Greg Schiano. The rookie running back totaled 95 yards on 24 carries. "

The Patriots put the game away early in the 4.h quarter when Alfonzo Dennard jumped a sideline out route and returned it 87 yards for a touchdown. It was a bad throw from Luck as the ball came out late.  The Colts' rookie signal-caller bounced back and dropped in a nice pass to Hilton (6-100) for a 43-yard touchdown. The wide out beat Talib on a go route running down the field. It was the second touchdown the former Bucs corner allowed in his debut with the Patriots.

   "comment":"Talib, meanwhile, picked him off twice. Smith did some nice things in this contest, but there was more bad than good. He finished 15-of-35 for 214 yards and the 3 picks. He also had a 16-yard scramble. Smith endured many of the same issues Tom Brady faced. His receivers just let him down. Stephen Hill lost a fumble and dropped a pass. Clyde Gates, who was on the field because Jeremy Kerley was out, couldn't control a second-quarter touchdown. He let the ball fall through his hands on a couple of other occasions. Still though, at least the Patriots didn't turn the ball over. Smith committed the 3 interceptions - 2 of which were terrible - and also missed some open receivers. He still has a long way to go.    As with Edelman and the Patriots, there was 1 positive in the Jets' receiving corps. Santonio Holmes actually looked like a functional receiver. He caught 3 balls for 51 yards. He's not nearly the same player he once was - he's not playing on all of the snaps - but he's at least turning into a dependable, veteran wideout for Smith.    The Jets actually ran the ball well and probably should've stuck with the ground game throughout the contest. Chris Ivory looked quick, gaining 52 yards on 12 carries. Bilal Powell (13-48, TD) also showed well. Meanwhile, Rildey gained just 40 yards on 16 attempts. I guess the silver lining is that he didn't fumble.    Two New York linemen were ejected at the end of this contest. D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Willie Colon were tossed for throwing punches after Talib's game-sealing interception. Losing them would be devastating for the Jets' chances next week, should they be suspended. New York plays the Bills, so Ferguson's potential replacement would be responsible for blocking "

   "comment":"Talib on a horribly thrown ball. That spotted New England a 53-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski, who later hit 2 more from 40+ yards. While the dropped passes hurt, Freeman had his normal accuracy problems. He completed just 19-of-41 passes for 236 yards. If Freeman doesn't make a big improvement next week against the Cardinals, the Bucs will probably be starting Mike Glennon against the Eagles after the bye.    Doug Martin (20-88) ran well for Tampa Bay as the team enjoyed Carl Nicks making his season debut. Jackson (3-34) left the game with a rib issue while Mike Williams (5-65) was gimpy with a leg injury.    The Bucs' defensive line played pretty well. Adrian Clayborn, Akeem Spence and Lavonte David recorded sacks. Gerald McCoy had a leg injury late in the 4.h quarter in garbage time.    The Patriots' defense struggled in the beginning before adjusting to Tampa Bay's offense. Talib played well against his former team. "

   "comment":"Talib made an awesome play to break up a potential touchdown to Roddy White to halt an Atlanta comeback from down 30-13 and seal the victory for New England. Brady's scores went to Thompkins and Matthew Mulligan. Thompkins had a huge outing, catching 6 balls for 127 yards, which included a great grab over stud safety William Moore. He wasn't perfect - he dropped a couple of passes - but it's extremely obvious that he has made big strides. The sky is the limit for him, as well as the Patriots, who will have Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski back in the next couple of weeks.    New England's other receivers of note include Julian Edelman (7-118), who did all of his damage in the second half, and Aaron Dobson (1-10) who left the game in the middle of the third quarter with an injury.    The Patriots ran the ball well against Atlanta's skeleton-crew defense that was missing Asante Samuel, as well as linebackers Akeem Dent and Paul Worrilow (both of whom left the game in the second half). Stevan Ridley gained 53 yards on 11 carries, while LeGarrette Blount (9-64) broke free for a 47-yard score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, can blame this loss on themselves. They made numerous errors in this contest, including: - Left tackle Sam Baker ruined a drive in the first half with 2 penalties (holding, face mask). He would leave the game with an injury a little bit later. - The Falcons went for it on a 4.h-and-2 inside the red zone in the middle of the second quarter. A field goal would've made a huge difference later on, though it's always difficult to know what would've happened. - Julio Jones dropped a big gain. He missed some time with a leg injury, but managed to finish with solid stats (6 catches, 108 yards). - Dent was whistled for a penalty that gave New England a first down on what would've otherwise been a punt attempt. The Patriots would go on to score a touchdown on that drive. - Atlanta surrendered a third-and-19. The team couldn't get any sort of pressure on Brady, who found Thompkins for a 26-yard completion. On top of that, the Patriots got 15 yards for a Moore hit to the helmet. - Roddy White was whistled for offensive pass interference on Talib in the red zone. - Talib came up with an interception when "

Graham, who was limited to no catches - he had 1 drop, which was really a great play by Kyle Arrington - was helped into the locker room with a leg injury in the second half. Drew Brees looked a bit flustered without being able to go to Graham very much. After all, when do you see his team have 3 3.and-outs in a single half? When does Griffin miss a wide-open receiver (Nick Toon) for a touchdown? Would anyone have ever imagined Brees completing fewer than half of his passes? All of that happened, as Brees went 17-of-36 for 236 yards, 2 scores and an interception that was a weird lob after he tried calling timeout but was not granted the stoppage. Brees had some great throws - including a 34-yard touchdown strike to Kenny Stills (3-64) on a third-and-20.    Brees' other aerial score was vultured by Travaris Cadet. Marques Colston surprisingly was limited to just 1 reception for 11 yards.    The Saints ran the ball well, which wasn't a surprise because Vince Wilfork's absence continues to be huge. Pierre Thomas gained 51 yards on 11 carries, but the big star was Khiry Robinson, who tallied 53 yards and a touchdown on 7 tries.    Moving back to New England, the team suffered a quartet of injuries. In addition to Connolly, Aqib Talib, Jerod Mayo and Danny Amendola all had to leave the game."

   "comment":"Talib covering his receivers. Brady had to deal with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie after the corner got hurt. Manning converted second-and-20 deep in his own territory. Brady was sacked on third-and-10 deep in Denver territory. Manning got points in the 2-minute drill with an impressive drive at the end of the first half. Brady couldn't hit an open Austin Collie down the sideline for a big gain just before halftime. Manning was 18-of-25 for 214 yards and a touchdown in the first half. Brady was just 9-of-15 for 144 yards in the first half. Manning helped the Broncos accumulate 270 net yards in the opening half. Brady restricted the Patriots to 119 net yards in the opening half. Manning achieved 6 first downs in the opening touchdown drive of the third quarter. Brady managed just 6 first downs in the entire opening half. Manning had a stretch in which he converted 19 of 20 passes. Brady didn't get the Patriots inside the Denver 18-yard line until there were 10 minutes remaining in the game. Manning went 32-of-43 for 400 yards (third-most in AFC Championship history) and 2 touchdowns. Brady finished 24-of-38 for 277 yards and only 1 touchdown.    Two things absolutely killed the Patriots' chances of winning this game, and I alluded to both already. The first was Brady's inaccuracy. He overthrew several of his targets. Had he hit them, New England may have been victorious. He was sharp in the 4.h quarter, but only because he had the luxury of battling a prevent defense. The second was Talib's injury. Talib got hurt in last year's AFC Championship, which completely ruined Bill Belichick's defensive game plan. The same thing happened in this contest. The Patriots actually played Denver's offense pretty well until Talib went down. After that, New England couldn't get the Broncos off the field, as Manning continuously hit Demaryius Thomas, who led all receivers with 134 yards and a touchdown on 7 catches. "

Manning struggled early, but ultimately got on track. He finished 22-of-33 for 237 yards and 3 touchdowns, and he's now just 3 scores short of breaking Brett Favre's career record. One of Manning's best throws wasn't a touchdown, but ultimately led to 1. It was just an 8-yard completion, but he managed to find Demaryius Thomas for the gain while falling down. Thomas, in turn, tapped his toes inbounds, prompting Rex Ryan to throw the challenge flag. I have no idea how Manning managed to convert the pass. Manning's touchdowns once again went to nothing but Thomases. Demaryius (10-124) snagged 1. while Julius (4-51) had a pair. Julius yelled, It's so f***ing easy! It's so easy! following 1 of his scores. He was absolutely right, as New York's secondary once again offered no resistance.    "

   "comment":"Talib sat on the route and hauled in an easy turnover. The other interception occurred under pressure, as McCown hurled the ball carelessly. Something that's not shown on the stat sheet is that McCown took 2 terrible sacks in overtime, which shifted the Browns out of field-goal range.

Benjamin's 9 receptions were triple than that of the next Cleveland player, and those catches went for 117 yards. Despite the tough matchup, Benjamin was very productive, and he would've scored a touchdown had Talib not made a great pass break-up. Benjamin is way better than the situational receiver from earlier in the year.    Both of McCown's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Talib yanked off Crabtree's counterfeit gold chain during the game and then bragged about doing so to his teammates. Crabtree was hobbling around on a bum ankle all afternoon, as it was clear that he wasn't 100 percent. Crabtree caught 5 passes for 47 yards, while Cooper (4-39) snatched Oakland's only touchdown.    The Raiders were expected to run all over the Broncos, who have been weak to ground attacks all year. However, the Raider running backs mustered just 57 total rushing yards on 15 carries. "

   "comment":"Talib nearly had 3 interceptions in total, but Dez Bryant broke up 2 potential turnovers. Talib had the last laugh, as he pick-sixed Prescott at the very end of the game. Prescott ended up 30-of-50 for 238 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks, but a chunk of his yardage came in garbage time. Prescott was 14-of-20 for only 85 yards at intermission.    As for Dallas' receiving corps, Bryant saw a whopping 16 targets, catching 7 of them for 59 yards and a touchdown. Bryant, as mentioned, broke up a couple of interceptions. "
