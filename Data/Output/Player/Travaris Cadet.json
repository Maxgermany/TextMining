   "comment":"Cadet, meanwhile, handled the Thomas aspect of the offense. He caught 4 balls for 40 receiving yards.    Before I move on to the Packers, there are 2 things that bothered me about the Saints. The first was Brees' clock management at the end of the first half. For whatever reason, he refused to spike the ball to stop the clock, and as a consequence, things got dicey. Brees threw a pass over the middle of the field without any timeouts, and the clock would have expired if there wasn't a defensive penalty. Brees did the same exact thing at the end of the Detroit loss. He would be so much better off spiking the ball, so I have no idea why he won't do that. Also, Sean Payton made a poor decision in the third quarter. Stationed just past midfield, Payton called for a run with his fullback on third-and-1. He was unsuccessful, but Payton opted to go for it on 4.h down. He had Ingram run, but the former first-rounder was stuffed. It was strange that Payton didn't even try a pass with 1 of the NFL's top quarterbacks on 1 of these crucial plays. Fortunately for Payton, it didn't hurt him, as the Packers didn't score on the short field because Rodgers proceeded to hurt his hamstring on the very next drive.    Some notes on the Packers: - Rodgers' sole aerial score went to "
