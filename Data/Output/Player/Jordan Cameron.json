Weeden had some nice chemistry with Cameron (9-108), but the second-year signal-caller otherwise struggled to move the ball with his receivers. In the second quarter, Cameron made a highlight-reel 22-yard reception. He set up a score with a big catch inside the 10 and finished the drive with a leaping touchdown reception in the corner of the end zone. That gave the Browns a 7-6 halftime lead. However, Cleveland couldn't move the ball in the final 2 quarters. Weeden finished 26-of-53 for 289 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. "

He didn't look like an NFL-caliber quarterback after playing so well in the first 6 weeks of the season.    Perhaps the reason for Hoyer's struggle - outside of center Alex Mack's absence - was that the Browns, for the first time, couldn't establish a ground attack. Jacksonville's defensive line put on an impressive showing, limiting "

   "comment":"Jordan Cameron, but followed that up with a lost a fumble on a botched snap near the red zone. Conny Football went 14-of-28 for 177 yards and a late pick, which was a weak throw while rolling out of the pocket. Shaw handled himself well considering the circumstances, and perhaps showed that he could be a No. 2 quarterback in this league. He just missed out on a touchdown when Andrew Hawkins was tackled at the 2-yard line. The Browns ran into the end zone on the next play.    Mike Pettine has been guilty of some odd decisions regarding the quarterback position this year. The same goes for the running back job. A week after Terrance West didn't carry the ball a single time, the Towson product tallied 94 yards and a touchdown on 18 attempts. He also had a 15-yard gain that was negated by a Mitchell Schwartz hold. Isaiah Crowell, who handled the workload last week, was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 6 yards.    With Josh Gordon getting into trouble again regarding his substance-abuse issues, the Browns will need to address the wideout position this offseason. Their leading receiver in this contest was Taylor Gabriel (3-66). Jordan Cameron caught 3 balls for 41 yards.   "

   "comment":"Jordan Cameron. On third-and-goal, Tannehill scrambled before finding running back Damian Williams for a score. Just before the half, the Dolphins missed a 42-yard field goal, and the Jaguars completed a couple of passes before Jason Myers made a 58-yard field goal to give Jacksonville a 20-13 lead. To start the third quarter, Tannehill hit Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as Lamar Miller was held to 14 yards on 10 carries. Miami's rushing attack was putrid, though it should be noted that Miller was hindered by an ankle injury. Miller is expected to bounce back, so you can buy him low from a disappointed fantasy owner.    Rishard Matthews led the Dolphins' receivers with 6 catches for 115 yards. A fluky performance? Perhaps, but with Jordan Cameron getting hurt, Greg Jennings doing nothing and DeVante Parker being too raw, Ryan Tannehill will have to throw to someone else besides Jarvis Landry."
