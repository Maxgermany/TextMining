   "comment":"Cameron Wake destroyed right tackle Mitchell Schwartz as he notched 2.5 sacks and had a ton of pressure. The defensive tackles Randy Starks (1.5 sacks), Paul Soliai (2 batted passes) and Jared Odrick all played well. Dion Jordan had a sack and Derrick Shelby had a strip-sack going against Schwartz. The front 7 did a great job defending the run as well. Browns' guard Oniel Cousins was horrible for Cleveland as he was beaten for sacks and called for a holding that took away a Browns touchdown. Trent Richardson had about 25 yards on the first drive and after that was shut down by Miami. Richardson (13-47, 2 catches for 30 yards) actually ran better than the numbers indicate considering his lack of holes. The Dolphins were crowding the tackle box, daring Brandon Weeden and the receiving corps to beat them. Cleveland had a nice first drive when Weeden threw a ball up for grabs, but it was off the mark and Nolan Carroll came down with an interception at the 1.yard line. Wide receiver Travis Benjamin (2-30) didn't do a great job of fighting for the ball either.    Playing his former team, Dimitri Patterson had probably the best game of his career against Cleveland. His first interception came when Greg Little (4-26) dropped another pass. Patterson made a fabulous catch off the deflection as he fell to the ground. That set up a Caleb Sturgis field goal. Weeden's third interception was a pass high and behind Jordan Cameron for a deflection. Patterson snatched the fluttering ball for the third pick of the half for Weeden.    Weeden had some nice chemistry with Cameron (9-108), but the second-year signal-caller otherwise struggled to move the ball with his receivers. In the second quarter, Cameron made a highlight-reel 22-yard reception. He set up a score with a big catch inside the 10 and finished the drive with a leaping touchdown reception in the corner of the end zone. That gave the Browns a 7-6 halftime lead. However, Cleveland couldn't move the ball in the final 2 quarters. Weeden finished 26-of-53 for 289 yards with a touchdown and 3 interceptions. "

He didn't look like an NFL-caliber quarterback after playing so well in the first 6 weeks of the season.    Perhaps the reason for Hoyer's struggle - outside of center Alex Mack's absence - was that the Browns, for the first time, couldn't establish a ground attack. Jacksonville's defensive line put on an impressive showing, limiting Ben Tate to just 36 yards on 16 carries. Isaiah Crowell (7-18) couldn't do anything. Then again, Mack not being in the lineup had something to do with that too.    Only 3 Cleveland players had more than 1 reception: Andrew Hawkins (5-112), Austin (3-53) and Taylor Gabriel (3-39). Cameron, expected to have a big outing against a defense that couldn't contain tight ends all year, snatched just 1 of his 6 targets for only 5 yards. As mentioned, Hoyer had Cameron open for a touchdown, but sailed the ball way over his head.    The Browns' special teams also contributed to this loss. It was just a 10-6 contest when "

He overthrew most of his targets, finishing 7-of-13 for 134 yards, the touchdown to Cameron and an interception late in the game. Hoyer is not the answer either, but unlike Manziel, he can serve as a solid backup in this league.    Cameron, as you can imagine, led the team in receiving with 88 yards and the touchdown on 3 catches. Josh Gordon was next with 45 yards on 4 grabs, but made some mental mistakes.

   "comment":"Cameron, but followed that up with a lost a fumble on a botched snap near the red zone. Conny Football went 14-of-28 for 177 yards and a late pick, which was a weak throw while rolling out of the pocket. Shaw handled himself well considering the circumstances, and perhaps showed that he could be a No. 2 quarterback in this league. He just missed out on a touchdown when Andrew Hawkins was tackled at the 2-yard line. The Browns ran into the end zone on the next play.    Mike Pettine has been guilty of some odd decisions regarding the quarterback position this year. The same goes for the running back job. A week after Terrance West didn't carry the ball a single time, the Towson product tallied 94 yards and a touchdown on 18 attempts. He also had a 15-yard gain that was negated by a Mitchell Schwartz hold. Isaiah Crowell, who handled the workload last week, was given just 4 carries, which he turned into 6 yards.    With Josh Gordon getting into trouble again regarding his substance-abuse issues, the Browns will need to address the wideout position this offseason. Their leading receiver in this contest was Taylor Gabriel (3-66). Jordan Cameron caught 3 balls for 41 yards.   "

   "comment":"Cameron. On third-and-goal, Tannehill scrambled before finding running back Damian Williams for a score. Just before the half, the Dolphins missed a 42-yard field goal, and the Jaguars completed a couple of passes before Jason Myers made a 58-yard field goal to give Jacksonville a 20-13 lead. To start the third quarter, Tannehill hit Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as Lamar Miller was held to 14 yards on 10 carries. Miami's rushing attack was putrid, though it should be noted that Miller was hindered by an ankle injury. Miller is expected to bounce back, so you can buy him low from a disappointed fantasy owner.    Rishard Matthews led the Dolphins' receivers with 6 catches for 115 yards. A fluky performance? Perhaps, but with Jordan Cameron getting hurt, Greg Jennings doing nothing and DeVante Parker being too raw, Ryan Tannehill will have to throw to someone else besides Jarvis Landry."

   "comment":"Cameron Wake, Taylor dropped countless perfect passes into his receivers' arms, including a perfect, 38-yard touchdown to Chris Hogan in the final frame. Taylor is a high-end backup on most teams, but he can be started against non-elite defenses.    Two Buffalo players sustained injuries in this contest. LeSean McCoy rushed for just 16 yards on 11 carries, spending most of his time on a bike. Fortunately, he helped out his owners with a 10-yard receiving touchdown. Sammy Watkins' owners weren't as lucky. All Watkins was able to do was catch a 39-yard pass before leaving with a calf injury. It's unclear if either will be available for next week's game. With McCoy sidelined for portions of this game, Karlos Williams had the most carries, gaining 110 yards and a touchdown on 12 attempts. Williams showed that he can be started if McCoy ever happened to miss a game.    Taylor's touchdowns were thrown to Charles Clay (5-82), Hogan (3-42) and McCoy. Clay is a borderline TE1, whose production might have been possible because of Watkins' injury. Hogan is not a fantasy option.    Percy Harvin had a big game. He snared 7 of the 8 passes thrown his way for 66 yards. He also rushed twice for 16 yards on the ground. I wouldn't trust Harvin as a third fantasy receiver, but he wouldn't be a terrible option if Watkins couldn't make it back.    Moving on to the Dolphins, it's hard to say if their offense was worse than their defense. Both aspects were inept. Miami didn't score until the third quarter and was responsible for 3 turnovers, all by Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was anemic, though his numbers indicate that he wasn't that bad. Tannehill went 26-of-49 for 297 yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, but he was just 11-of-23 for 112 yards and the 3 picks in the first half. Much of his yardage, including the 2 scores, came in garbage time. It's difficult to blame just Tannehill. His receivers didn't help him out at all. Greg Jennings opened the game with 2 drops, and Tannehill's first interception bounced off Jarvis Landry's hands. Meanwhile, the offensive line was brutal. Tannehill barely had any time to throw. Still, he missed on several deep throws, and the other 2 picks were his fault. Tannehill also missed Jordan Cameron badly for a big gain when he threw behind him, and his deep passes didn't have any sort of touch. Tannehill figures to rebound, as his team, much like the Jets, was distracted heading into London. I'd buy Tannehill low if he didn't have a tough matchup against New York coming up.    I listed "

   "comment":"Cameron Wake and Mario Williams were trampled by Blount and 3 rookies. Absolutely pathetic.    Blount finished wih 123 yards and 1 touchdown on 29 carries, including a hurdle on a 26-yard burst of his. Blount only lost 6 touches to James White, who caught just 2 passes, a surprising statistic.    With Rob Gronkowski out, Martellus Bennett stepped up and was the only Patriot to accumulate more than 100 receiving yards. He caught 5 passes for 114 yards and a touchdown, as he was able to run more routes with Nate Solder back in the lineup.    Garoppolo's 2 other touchdowns went to Danny Amendola (4-50). Julian Edelman paced the team with 7 receptions. He tallied 76 yards, but couldn't get into the end zone.    As for the Dolphins, it was a tale of 2 halves for the offense. The line couldn't pass protect prior to halftime, which would explain why Ryan Tannehill was just 10-of-18 for 116 yards and an interception before the break. He ended up finishing 32-of-45 for 389 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions, as New England's defense was completely gassed by the end. Tannehill actually moved the team into position for a close Hail Mary at the end, but his final throw was picked off in the end zone, so he had just 1 real interception on the afternoon. Tannehill happened to lead the team in rushing, scampering for 35 yards on 6 scrambles. Part of the reason for this was the early deficit. The other part was Arian Foster sustaining a hamstring injury. Foster managed just 9 yards on 3 attempts. I hope you didn't draft Foster, as he was an obvious candidate to get hurt, thanks to his horrific diet. Jay Ajayi started handling the workload afterward, but lost a fumble. Kenyan Drake ended up scoring a late touchdown, as he ran for 12 yards on 2 carries. Drake is a candidate to see a larger workload once the Dolphins figure out that using Ajayi is not in their best interest. Isaiah Pead will also be a factor when he gets healthy.    Jarvis Landry predictably led the team in receiving, catching 10 passes for 137 yards. He lost a fumble, however. DeVante Parker also played well with 8 grabs for 106 yards. Jordan Cameron (5-49) scored a touchdown, but had a crucial, early drop on an early third-down try.   "
