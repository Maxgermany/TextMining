   "comment":"Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.    Neither team received a good game from its defense, but Chargers rookie linebacker Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line.
