Baltimore tacked on 3 more and then tried a surprise onside kick, but the Steelers recovered. That ended up spotting Pittsburgh a field goal. Flacco got going with some big third-down conversions on a long 16-play drive. He hit Dallas Clark on third-and-goal from the 1 to tie the game at 16 with 2 minutes remaining. The ensuing kickoff saw Emmanuel Sanders (1-7) race down the sideline for a touchdown, but he stepped out at the 35-yard line. The Steelers moved the ball with a penalty on Lardarius Webb and completions to Antonio Brown (6-50) to set up a 42-yard field goal from Shawn Suisham on the final play of the game.    Roethlisberger completed 17-of-23 passes for 160 yards and a score. Bell ran for 93 yards on 19 carries.    The real star of the game was Pittsburgh's defense. The unit contained Smith (3-61) and Ray Rice (15-45 rushing; 4-27 receiving). Flacco completed 24-of-34 for 215 yards with a touchdown. Lamarr Woodley had a big sack to knocked Baltimore out of field goal range. Lawrence Timmons was all over the field with a great game. He had 17 tackles.    The Ravens' defense also played well. Suggs had 7 tackles with a sack. Brandon Williams, Elvis Dumervil and Ngata all recorded sacks for Baltimore.   "

He was down for a few seconds, but got up and turned out to be fine.    The Colts probably would've won this game by much more had they not sputtered in the red zone. The Ravens did a great job down there, but Indianapolis made things difficult for itself with some mistakes. For instance, the coaching staff called for an "

Rodgers finished 15-of-24 for 205 yards and 4 touchdowns. The yardage may seem low, but 66 yards are missing because of a long pass interference. Plus, Rodgers didn't have to throw very much because the Packers maintained a 31-3 lead at 1 point. Rodgers was so efficient that the Packers didn't even punt until there were 11 minutes remaining in regulation.    Rodgers showed tremendous chemistry with Jordy Nelson, as the 2 looked great together again. Nelson looked 100 percent once again, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns. "

The Lions tried to screw themselves from taking advantage of it with a hold, but they managed to score a touchdown. Of course, they messed up the extra point. To conclude the opening half, Palmer was nearly intercepted again, but the ball hit the ground. "
