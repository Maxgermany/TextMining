Rodgers finished 15-of-24 for 205 yards and 4 touchdowns. The yardage may seem low, but 66 yards are missing because of a long pass interference. Plus, Rodgers didn't have to throw very much because the Packers maintained a 31-3 lead at 1 point. Rodgers was so efficient that the Packers didn't even punt until there were 11 minutes remaining in regulation.    Rodgers showed tremendous chemistry with Jordy Nelson, as the 2 looked great together again. Nelson looked 100 percent once again, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns. "

   "comment":"Haloti Ngata dropped the ball. Not to be outdone, Palmer launched a pick because he couldn't step into his throw. The Lions tried to screw themselves from taking advantage of it with a hold, but they managed to score a touchdown. Of course, they messed up the extra point. To conclude the opening half, Palmer was nearly intercepted again, but the ball hit the ground. "
