   "comment":"Ted Ginn Jr. in the end zone, but Ginn dropped it (more on this later). On the next play, Henne connected with Hartline for an 18-yard pass down to the Saints 8-yard line. With time ticking down, Henne spiked the ball with 1 second on the clock. The Dolphins seemed to have 1 more play, but Parry, who wanted to ensure that New Orleans would cover, suddenly stopped Miami when the team walked up to the line of scrimmage and announced that 1 of the Dolphins wideouts was not lined up properly on the previous spike, meaning the game was over. Congrats, Parry, you crook. I hope you won a ton of money.    With a game like this, a lot of people deserve a ton of blame. Here's my top 5. 5. Chad Henne - Thanks for the 2 pick-sixes. Henne is low on this list because he played well early, but he sure took his jolly good time in the final few minutes when Miami was trying to get a backdoor score. 4. Tony Sparano - If you're a coach on any level reading this, take note: DO NOT CALL A TIMEOUT WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING AT THE END OF A HALF ON THE 1-YARD LINE WHEN THE OTHER TEAM HAS ITS FIELD GOAL TEAM OUT THERE. As soon as Sparano called his timeout, I yelled, F*** you at the TV because I knew what was coming. 3. God - Players thank God for a win. I'm blaming God for this loss and blown cover. It was that bad. Actually, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't blame God. So... 3. Gibril Wilson - This guy needs to attend a Pee Wee Football practice so he can learn how to tackle. Seriously, Wilson tackles like a little girl. 2. John Parry - Over-Under on how much Parry won with the Saints covering: $100,000. I got the Over. 1. Ted Ginn Jr. - If I were Bill Parcells, I'd cut Ted Ginn Jr. immediately. Ginn had 3 crucial drops in the 4.h quarter: 1 when the Dolphins were up; 1 when they were down 6. and 1 in the end zone when Miami was down 12. Ginn, who finished with 2 receptions for 16 yards, has now cost the Dolphins 2 big upsets with his hands of fail. He's hurting the team more than he is helping it. He needs to be cut. Now.    Rounding things up, Henne was 18-of-36 for 211 yards and the 2 pick-sixes.    Ricky Williams rushed for 80 yards and 3 touchdowns on 9 carries, thanks to a 68-yard gain. "

When I bet on Ginn's teams, he screws me by dropping touchdowns and losing fumbles. When I bet against Ginn's teams, he returns kickoffs and punts for touchdowns. This always happens, without fail. The 5.point-underdog Sehawks trailed by 2 late in this game, but Ginn ruined the potential cover by scoring on a kickoff and punt return.    I liked the Seahawks +5 because the crappy 49ers didn't deserve to be favored by more than a field goal. Both offenses played terribly, as Seattle and San Francisco totaled just 219 and 209 net yards, respectively. <br <li=/> "

   "comment":"Ted Ginn. Newton then had Greg Olsen open, but sailed the ball out of bounds. Right after halftime, Newton was blasted by Michael Mauti on the goal line, and it appeared as though he sustained a concussion. Newton actually went into the locker room for a bit, but returned to the field shortly afterward; he didn't miss a snap. However, Newton caught fire after that, as he was 15-of-22 for 224 yards and 4 touchdowns in the second half. He missed Olsen for a first down at 1 point, but was able to engineer a game-winning touchdown drive at the very end to achieve the team's 12th victory.    Newton actually could've enjoyed a much better day had Ted Ginn not disappointed him. That may sound strange after looking at Ginn's stat line - 5 catches, 80 yards, 2 scores - but Ginn dropped 2 long passes, both of which would've gone for touchdowns. They were long bombs, but both balls fell right into Ginn's lap. Any quality receiver would've reeled them in.    Ginn wasn't the only productive Panther play-maker who made mistakes. Olsen caught 9 passes for 129 yards, but lost a fumble in the red zone. As mentioned, he could've had a greater performance had Newton not missed him a couple of times. He didn't find the end zone.    Newton's other touchdowns went to "
