With time ticking down, Henne spiked the ball with 1 second on the clock. The Dolphins seemed to have 1 more play, but Parry, who wanted to ensure that New Orleans would cover, suddenly stopped Miami when the team walked up to the line of scrimmage and announced that 1 of the Dolphins wideouts was not lined up properly on the previous spike, meaning the game was over. Congrats, Parry, you crook. I hope you won a ton of money.    With a game like this, a lot of people deserve a ton of blame. Here's my top 5. 5. Chad Henne - Thanks for the 2 pick-sixes. Henne is low on this list because he played well early, but he sure took his jolly good time in the final few minutes when Miami was trying to get a backdoor score. 4. Tony Sparano - If you're a coach on any level reading this, take note: DO NOT CALL A TIMEOUT WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING AT THE END OF A HALF ON THE 1-YARD LINE WHEN THE OTHER TEAM HAS ITS FIELD GOAL TEAM OUT THERE. As soon as Sparano called his timeout, I yelled, F*** you at the TV because I knew what was coming. 3. God - Players thank God for a win. I'm blaming God for this loss and blown cover. It was that bad. Actually, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't blame God. So... 3. "

The 5.point-underdog Sehawks trailed by 2 late in this game, but Ginn ruined the potential cover by scoring on a kickoff and punt return.    I liked the Seahawks +5 because the crappy 49ers didn't deserve to be favored by more than a field goal.

   "comment":"Ginn. His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from Michael Crabtree (3-26), who made a leaping grab for 20 yards in the second quarter. Davis, meanwhile, had just 1 catch for 1 yard, but he did reel in Kaepernick's sole aerial touchdown by somehow dragging his feet inbounds as he was falling out of the end zone.    Some stats/notes for the Panthers: - DeAngelo Williams struggled to run the ball, mustering just 13 yards on 5 carries. Mike Tolbert outgained him with 20 yards on 8 attempts. - Only 4 Panthers caught passes, and all 4 of them had 4 receptions: Ginn (4-104), Smith (4-74, TD), Olsen (4-55) and LaFell (4-34). - Carolina suffered a tough injury to safety "

This took the differential from 6 to 13, putting the game out of reach.    Last thing: I need to discuss the officiating. Hochuli put on 1 of the worst performances by a ref I've ever seen. Based on how poorly he and his crew botched this game, it wouldn't surprise me if the NFL fired him, especially when he was heard saying, I got the word from Jungle Boy that was a good call on his mic at the beginning of the second half. The odd remark aside, Hochuli threw numerous terrible flags for defensive holding and pass interference. He then inexplicably stopped calling them when they should've been whistled. The Cardinals got away with a hold, but the worst instance was when Floyd's arm was grabbed and no flags were thrown. It got worse after that. Newton threw what appeared to be a backward pass, but it was ruled forward following replay. That may have been the right call, but it should've been intentional grounding. Hochuli announced there was a receiver in the area when there was no wideout within 20 yards of where the ball landed. This had Twitter up in arms, and my favorite tweet was from Ross Tucker, who said, In the area... does he mean in the stadium? <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Right after halftime, Newton was blasted by Michael Mauti on the goal line, and it appeared as though he sustained a concussion.

He missed Olsen for a first down at 1 point, but was able to engineer a game-winning touchdown drive at the very end to achieve the team's 12th victory.    Newton actually could've enjoyed a much better day had Ted Ginn not disappointed him. That may sound strange after looking at Ginn's stat line - 5 catches, 80 yards, 2 scores - but Ginn dropped 2 long passes, both of which would've gone for touchdowns. They were long bombs, but both balls fell right into Ginn's lap. Any quality receiver would've reeled them in.    Ginn wasn't the only productive Panther play-maker who made mistakes. Olsen caught 9 passes for 129 yards, but lost a fumble in the red zone. As mentioned, he could've had a greater performance had Newton not missed him a couple of times.

   "comment":"Ginn to set up an early touchdown.    Delving more into this and beginning with the offense, Cam Newton had a terrific performance. He scored 4 touchdowns (2 passing, 2 rushing) and completed 19-of-28 passes for 335 yards to go along with 47 rushing yards on 10 scrambles. He made only a couple of poor throws, including 1 in the red zone that was picked off, as it was behind his intended target. That didn't hurt Carolina at all, however, as Carson Palmer hurled an interception on the very next play.    Newton's 2 touchdowns went to Philly Brown (4-113) and Devin Funchess (2-21). The score to Brown was an 86-yarder that put the Panthers up 17-0, blowing the game completely open. It came on a third-and-long from the Carolina 14. Newton had plenty of time despite an Arizona blitz, and he connected to Brown, who broke away from Rashad Johnson, who gave a horrible tackling effort.    Greg Olsen didn't score, but he was a huge part of the offense. Newton continued to lean on him, targeting him more than any other player. Olsen caught 6 of the 8 balls thrown to him for 113 yards. I suppose we can safely say he's OK after he got banged up last week.    Speaking of injured Panthers, the 1 dark cloud over this game is that Thomas Davis appears to have broken his arm. That occurred when Darren Fells inexplicably leapt into him at the end of a 21-yard reception. The loss would be huge, but the Panthers won't be playing a quality offense in the Super Bowl.    Before moving on to the Cardinals' numbers, it should be noted that Jonathan Stewart ran well, gaining 83 yards on 19 carries. He had a pair of long gains on 1 drive and got tackled at the 1-yard line, but didn't score. Newton capitalized with a sneak. Also, Ted Ginn found the end zone on a 22-yard rushing touchdown, which was actually a reverse. <div class=dfpAdSlots>    As for Arizona, Palmer was absolutely disgraceful. You could've had him don a Brian Hoyer jersey, and no 1 would've known the difference. He was that bad, and that's not an exaggeration in the slightest. Carson Hoyer, I mean Palmer, went 23-of-40 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown, 4 interceptions and 2 lost fumbles. But those horrific numbers don't even tell the whole story. Palmer was wildly inaccurate throughout, beginning on the opening drive when he overshot "

   "comment":"Ginn muffed a return at the 1-yard line and Vance McDonald later scampered 75 yards when the Panthers seemed disinterested, but the Panthers were able to establish control and score a few times to clinch the all-important cover. All of this was possible because Cam Newton was unstoppable. The 49ers barely put any sort of pressure on him, allowing Newton to pick them apart. Newton ended up going 24-of-40 for 353 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was tipped into tight coverage. He also rushed 6 times for 37 yards.    The Panthers have to feel good about their win, but not completely because Jonathan Stewart was knocked out with a hamstring. Stewart disappointed his fantasy owners, mustering only 9 yards on 5 carries. He could miss some games, making Fozzy Whittaker an intriguing pick-up. Whittaker gained 100 yards on 16 carries.    Two of Newton's touchdowns went to Kelvin Benjamin, who was a beast in this matchup. He caught 7 passes for 108 yards and the pair of scores. The other touchdowns went to Greg Olsen (5-122) on a 78-yarder, and Devin Funchess (2-19), who made a late grab after doing nothing most of the afternoon. Newton nearly tossed a fifth score, but Ginn made a catch in which it was ruled that his second foot was out of bounds. Ginn secured a 52-yard reception later in the game in which he bobbled it out bounds, but the officials inexplicably ruled that it was complete after looking at the replay.    As for the 49ers, "

   "comment":"Ginn like a leering drunk, allowing the Buccaneers to snatch a pick-six. His next interception was targeted for Greg Olsen, but Keith Tandy came up with the turnover. Newton finished 18-of-32 for 237 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. It could've been far worse for him, however, as he nearly had a couple of other picks. One potential interception was actually overturned by replay review. It's clear that Newton isn't healthy at all, as he's been bothered by a shoulder injury for quite some time now.    Kelvin Benjamin abused Tampa's secondary, catching 6 passes for 93 yards and a touchdown at the end of regulation. He had a 47-yard reception to get the Panthers into Tampa territory on the final drive of the game. Ginn (4-69) was next on the stat sheet, while Olsen (3-22) was a major disappointment. Olsen is not 100 percent, so I'm sure he's looking forward to having some time off to heal.    "
