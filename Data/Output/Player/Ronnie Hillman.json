Denver outgained San Francisco by only 6 yards in the opening half. The difference was that while the Broncos converted in the red zone, the 49ers sputtered there in addition to making other mistakes.

A runner of Knowshon Moreno's ability and talent is sorely missed.    With no ground attack to support him, Manning struggled to cut the ball through the fierce wind. He threw a touchdown early, but needed a ticky-tack pass interference in the end zone on third down to do so. After that, Manning heaved an interception right to Rob Ninkovich and followed that up with a near-pick that Wes Welker had to break up. The Broncos opted to go for it on 4.h down on their next possession, but Akeem Ayers sacked Manning. Manning picked up some garbage yardage late in the game. His second interception wasn't his fault, as it bounced off Welker's hands. Welker got hurt on the play, as it looked like a bit of karma after he knocked Aqib Talib out of the AFC Championship with what Bill Belichick called a very dirty hit. Manning ultimately finished 34-of-57 for 438 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Once again though, a bulk of his yardage came late when the game was out of reach, as John Fox foolishly left his starting offense in the game too long. He's very fortunate that Welker was the only offensive player of his to get hurt.    Manning's 2 touchdowns went to Hillman (7 catches, 47 rec. yards) and "

Hillman's YPC figure looks nice, but most of his yardage came on a 16-yard burst. Anderson still remains a weekly play for now, but Denver's blocking is awfully sketchy. Maybe Kansas City's run defense is that good, but I'm beginning to have doubts.    Both of Manning's primary receivers hauled in 8 passes, with Sanders securing 2 of the touchdowns. Sanders (8-87) is worth selling high in fantasy right now, given Manning's struggles. The same can be said for Thomas (8-116).    Manning's third score went to Virgil Green. "

   "comment":"Hillman received 7 carries, with the former outgaining the latter, 34-1. Anderson was the better runner for the second-straight week, so the Broncos should think about moving back to him as the primary ball-carrier.    As for the winners, Andrew Luck continued his great momentum from his second-half surge at Carolina. Despite losing his offensive coordinator on a short week, Luck went 21-of-36 for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns to go along with 34 rushing yards on 6 scampers. There were reports earlier during the week that he was healthy, and that seemed apparent when he took off on a third-and-10 scramble and dived for the first down. Luck was nearly intercepted twice, but considering the caliber of defense he was battling, he had a terrific showing, and all Indianapolis fans should be optimistic going forward.    While Luck's good health was reported, "

   "comment":"Hillman (3-50) was great at catching passes out of the backfield.    The rushing attack for the Chargers actually featured a surprising leader. Andre Williams, signed off of the practice squad earlier this season, got a lion's share of the carries. With injuries to Melvin Gordon and Kenneth Farrow, Williams saw 18 carries and managed to turn them into 87 yards. He ran with some great physicality and looked to be in better shape than he was with the Giants. Perhaps he will be a backup for the Chargers in 2017. Hillman, meanwhile, also saw some carries, and showed some change-of-pace ability. He finished the day with 41 yards on 7 carries.    The Chargers got some great play out of some of their defensive stars. "
