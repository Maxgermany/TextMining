   "comment":"Cadillac Williams for some unknown reason, fumbled inside the 5-yard line. Josh Freeman also had Mike Williams open for a touchdown, but overthrew his stud rookie receiver. Freeman finished 17-of-28 for 182 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, and also ran twice for 34 more yards. All in all, Freeman played well considering he was coming off a broken thumb.    Rookie receiver Mike Williams had 5 grabs for 30 yards and a score. As noted earlier, Freeman missed him for another potential touchdown. Williams' numbers can only get better as Freeman's thumb continues to heal.    Cadillac Williams had a decent game. He had 98 total yards (75 rushing, 23 receiving), but was going against a pretty solid Browns front.   "
