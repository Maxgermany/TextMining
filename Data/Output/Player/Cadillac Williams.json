Unfortunately, Cadillac left the game with a knee injury.    This was a high-scoring game even though there were no penalty-related first downs by either team until the 1:14 mark of the first quarter. Then again, a 13-point favorite that needed a win to get into the playoffs just lost, so nothing can be a surprise at this point.   "

Freeman finished 17-of-28 for 182 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, and also ran twice for 34 more yards. All in all, Freeman played well considering he was coming off a broken thumb.    Rookie receiver Mike Williams had 5 grabs for 30 yards and a score. As noted earlier, Freeman missed him for another potential touchdown. Williams' numbers can only get better as Freeman's thumb continues to heal.    Cadillac Williams had a decent game. He had 98 total yards (75 rushing, 23 receiving), but was going against a pretty solid Browns front.   "
