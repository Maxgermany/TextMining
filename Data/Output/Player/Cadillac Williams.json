   "comment":"Cadillac Williams rushed for 77 yards and a score on 16 attempts. Williams rushed for 152 yards and 2 touchdowns on 30 carries. Jonathan Stewart, meanwhile, garnered 110 yards and a score on 17 attempts. It's worth noting that Stewart fumbled at the Tampa Bay 2-yard line.    It's hard to believe, but Steve Smith was shut down in this matchup. Smith's 1 catch for 4 yards can be attributed to the ineptness of Delhomme.    The Buccaneers were able to keep this contest close because of Stewart's fumble, Delhomme's pick-six and Sammie Stroughter's kick return for a touchdown in the third quarter. The offense really didn't do anything; Tampa Bay managed just 12 first downs and 245 total yards.    Josh Johnson played somewhat well (11-of-17, 147 yards), but once again made crucial errors that cost the team. Johnson launched an interception on the first play of the third quarter that led to a Panthers touchdown. He also had a whopping 5 fumbles.    Tampa Bay's leading receiver wasn't Antonio Bryant (2 catches, 37 yards). It wasn't Kellen Winslow Jr. (3-29). It wasn't even the great Michael Clayton (1-9). It was Stroughter, who snagged 3 balls for 65 yards.    It looks like Raheem Morris' revolutionary 2-2-1 RBBC rotation is gone. Cadillac Williams rushed for 77 yards and a score on 16 attempts. "
