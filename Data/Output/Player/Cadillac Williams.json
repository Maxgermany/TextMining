   "comment":"Williams rushed for 152 yards and 2 touchdowns on 30 carries. Jonathan Stewart, meanwhile, garnered 110 yards and a score on 17 attempts. It's worth noting that Stewart fumbled at the Tampa Bay 2-yard line.    It's hard to believe, but Steve Smith was shut down in this matchup. Smith's 1 catch for 4 yards can be attributed to the ineptness of Delhomme.    The Buccaneers were able to keep this contest close because of Stewart's fumble, Delhomme's pick-6 and Sammie Stroughter's kick return for a touchdown in the third quarter. The offense really didn't do anything; Tampa Bay managed just 12 first downs and 245 total yards.    Josh Johnson played somewhat well (11-of-17, 147 yards), but once again made crucial errors that cost the team. Johnson launched an interception on the first play of the third quarter that led to a Panthers touchdown. He also had a whopping 5 fumbles.    Tampa Bay's leading receiver wasn't Antonio Bryant (2 catches, 37 yards). It wasn't Kellen Winslow Jr. (3-29). It wasn't even the great Michael Clayton (1-9). It was Stroughter, who snagged 3 balls for 65 yards.    It looks like Raheem Morris' revolutionary 2-2-1 RBBC rotation is gone. Cadillac Williams rushed for 77 yards and a score on 16 attempts. "

When Miami was running the clock out, Chad Henne tossed a horrible interception to Quincy Black on a third down. You have to wonder what Henne was thinking because no Dolphins player was even in the vicinity. Henne redeemed himself by putting together a game-winning drive with 1:14 remaining on the clock. Henne was 17-of-31 for 175 yards, 1 touchdown and that pick.    Ted Ginn Jr. started the game and was booed when he dropped a long touchdown. He finished with no catches. If he wasn't such an effective return man, he wouldn't be on the team anymore. Davone Bess led the squad with 4 receptions for 72 yards.    Ricky Williams had way more carries (20) than Ronnie Brown (12)."

   "comment":"Williams for some unknown reason, fumbled inside the 5-yard line. Josh Freeman also had Mike Williams open for a touchdown, but overthrew his stud rookie receiver. Freeman finished 17-of-28 for 182 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick, and also ran twice for 34 more yards. All in all, Freeman played well considering he was coming off a broken thumb.    Rookie receiver Mike Williams had 5 grabs for 30 yards and a score. As noted earlier, Freeman missed him for another potential touchdown. Williams' numbers can only get better as Freeman's thumb continues to heal.    Cadillac Williams had a decent game. He had 98 total yards (75 rushing, 23 receiving), but was going against a pretty solid Browns front.   "

   "comment":"Williams substituted in for Jackson on the next drive for St. Louis, but again, the team couldn't move the ball, so it flipped back to the 49ers. Having started at their own 33-yard line, which on this day was par for the course, San Francisco executed 2 short runs, which Smith followed by hitting Vernon Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3-and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, Frank Gore (7-9) was clearly not part of the equation due to an exhausting season of wear and tear. Two runs from Kendall Hunter for a total of 19 yards helped put San Francisco in plus territory, and a completion to Davis made it an easy field goal opportunity for Akers who put the 49ers up 20-7 at halftime when the Rams failed on their final desperation 2-minute drive. To its credit, St. Louis came out firing in the second half. Jackson ripped off a 27-yard run, but the drive stalled. The field position was changed at least, and San Francisco had to punt after a weak ensuing posession.The Rams responded with big gains to Kendricks and Lloyd, keying a drive that resulted in a 49-yard field goal from Josh Brown, trimming the 49ers' lead to 20-10. It looked like San Francisco had had about enough of that, completing passes to Crabtree and Davis, setting up yet another Akers field goal attempt. A funny thing happened though. No 1 covered Crabtree wide and Akers hit him for an easy touchdown, creating a seemingly safe 27-10 lead as the third quarter came to a close. Still, the St. Louis would not quit. A couple passes to Danario Alexander moved the Rams into field goal range, and Brown was good from 48 yards to trim the advantage to 27-13. The 49ers went to more running from Hunter (16-76) but had to punt when Smith threw short to Antonio Dixon on a check down. However, the San Francisco defense came up big with Tarell Brown intercepting Clemens once again. Set up at the 13-yard line, the 49ers ran the ball 5 times with Hunter and Dixon (8-21 yards, TD) sharing the work and Dixon's score putting them safely up 34-13. Well, everyone thought San Francisco was safe with just 6:30 left in the game up 21 points. However, St. Louis was on a different page than the rest of America. A pass to Lloyd coupled with a 15-yard penalty put the Rams almost at midfield in the blink of an eye. Three plays later, a deep touchdown to Lloyd making it 34-20. After recovering the onside kick, which was moved up thanks to another 15-yard penalty on the 49ers, Brown was flagged for interfering with Lloyd, and the ball was spotted at the 1-yard line. Williams cashed in the touchdown from there, and, to everyone's amazement, the score was San Francisco 34, St. Louis 27 with plenty of time (4:36) left. The 49ers couldn't do anything with Smith sacked on third down by "
