   "comment":"Earl Bennett. He found Forte for 12 yards, putting the team in position for a Hail Mary at their own 46-yard line and just seconds to play. Then Hanie got stupid, or cute as the case may be, attempting to emulate the old Dan Marino fake spike before actually spiking it. One problem - that's intentional grounding which results in a runoff of 10 seconds to end the game. This game was won by the specialists for the Raiders as Janikowski had 4 field goals (of the 6 he made) beyond 40 yards and Lechler averaged 54.6 yards punting while repeatedly putting the Bears in bad field position. Chicago can ride the running game and defense to wins down the stretch and earn a wild card berth as long as Hanie protects the football, which on this day, he did not.   "

   "comment":"Earl Bennett for a touchdown just prior to halftime. Hanie should have thrown a score to Barber in the second quarter, but the touchdown was nullified by stupidity. Barber lined up incorrectly on a trick play.    It's hard to just blame Hanie though because Mike Martz's play-calling was completely idiotic. I have no idea why the hell he continuously asked Hanie to take 7.step drops in long-yardage situations. The easy answer is, It's Mike Martz, but he was better with this when Jay Cutler was still the quarterback earlier in the year. It's almost like Martz has checked out because he knows he'll be coaching in college next year.    Random stats: Hanie once again targeted "

   "comment":"Earl Bennett in the end zone for a touchdown. The Earl of Bennett was initially ruled out of bounds, but the officials eventually discovered that he impressively tapped his feet in the end zone after looking at the replay.    Cutler's connection with Bennett was his only touchdown. He went 20-of-30 for 159 yards. Cutler made only a couple of bad decisions, 1 of which was a deep attempt into double coverage on third-and-1 late in the third quarter.    "
