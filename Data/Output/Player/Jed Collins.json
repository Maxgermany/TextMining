   "comment":"Jed Collins logged Stafford's sole touchdown.    It was surprising that Reggie Bush wasn't used much at all, especially considering that Bell fumbled. Bush had 8 touches, carrying the ball 6 times for 26 yards and catching 2 passes for only 6 receiving yards.   Collins logged Stafford's sole touchdown.
