   "comment":"Kelce caught a pass to enter the red zone, but the ball popped out at the very end. It appeared as though it just harmlessly slipped out after he hit the ground, but Bruce Arians threw the challenge flag. It seemed as though there was a chance that the ball was lodged out before he was down by contact, but not enough to overturn the call. However, the officials overturned it, giving the Cardinals the ball. Arizona didn't score off the possession, but it was able to eat enough clock to ruin Kansas City's chances. That was 1 thing that did in the Chiefs, who are reeling themselves at 7-6. The other was their putrid run defense. C.J. Anderson trampled them last Sunday night, and someone named Kerwynn Williams picked up where he left off, gaining 100 yards on 19 carries. Kansas City has the worst ground defense in the NFL, but no 1 could've expected that some unknown player would hit the century mark against them. It's clear that the Chiefs sorely miss Derrick Johnson and Eric Berry.    Drew Stanton had an adventurous game, to say the least. I had 5 units on the Cardinals, and I was terrified every time he released the ball. He had some horrific throws - he was guilty of several near-interceptions, including 1 in the end zone, and he overthrew Larry Fitzgerald to ruin a potential score - but he had a few nice passes, including a perfect lob to Jaron Brown for a 26-yard touchdown. In the end, Stanton completed just half of his attempts, going 15-of-30 for 239 yards and that touchdown. He also fumbled the ball, but was lucky 1 of his teammates recovered. Stanton, who will need to play better on the road if the Cardinals want to wrap up homefield advantage, should have led the Cardinals to more points, but kicker Chandler Catanzaro missed 2 chip-shot field goals.    As for the Chiefs, Alex Smith was solid early on, misfiring just once in the first half. He had a 21-yard scramble on a third-and-14, and threw a conversion to Dwayne Bowe on a third-and-19 on the same drive. However, he was just 13-of-26 for 184 yards and a pick following the break. The Cardinals did a great job of pressuring him and forcing quick, errant throws. Once Smith had to come back from a deficit, he just couldn't get the job done because he's so limited. After all, there's a reason that no Kansas City receivers have yet to catch touchdowns this year. Smith finished 26-of-39 for 293 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was thrown right to Alex Okafor. He also scrambled 4 times for 26 rushing yards. It appeared as though Smith had a second score to Anthony Fasano, but the officials ruled that Fasano pushed off even though it was a bogus call. Smith is a good game manager, but he doesn't have the arm or the weapons around him to advance deep into the playoffs.    There was a scary moment in this game when Jamaal Charles bent backward after appearing to fumble. The officials changed the call after watching the replay, but Charles limped off. Fortunately, he turned out to be OK. Having said that, Charles was criminally underutilized for the second week in a row; he touched the ball just 12 times, rushing for 91 yards on 10 carries and catching 2 balls for 20 receiving yards. He scored twice, at least.    Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving with 7 grabs for 110 yards. Bowe (2-29) had 1 awesome reception, but otherwise did nothing.   "

Daniel was guilty of holding the ball too often on a couple of occasions and took some sacks as a consequence, but he was still able to complete more than half of his passes, finishing 16-of-27 for 157 yards and what should've been a touchdown to Bowe. He began the game 9-of-9 for 72 yards, but couldn't maintain his success, though some of that was because of a couple of drops, including 1 by Albert Wilson in the red zone.    Kelce turned out to be Daniel's leading receiver, hauling in 7 balls for 84 yards. Bowe was next with just 3 grabs for 30 yards. Wilson was a major disappointment, failing to log a single reception.    Another week, another game in which "

Conley led the way in receptions, catching 6 of his 7 targets for 63 yards and the game-winning touchdown. Kelce had some nice grabs, but his game-changing ability is not going to emerge that often in this offense. Even with Maclin out, Kelce still finished with 5 receptions for 73 yards and no touchdowns. Smith doesn't have the arm to throw into good coverage, so he will continue to spread the ball around to open, usually, close pass-catchers.    The Steelers, on the other hand, even with Jones at quarterback, were able to give their best players enough work to have nice statistical games, i.e. they didn't hurt you in fantasy. Antonio Brown finally started a new 5.reception/50+-yard streak, as he caught 6-of-8 targets for 124 yards. And Pittsburgh's other stud player, Le'Veon Bell, looked in top form as he rushed 17 times for 121 yards, including a Gale Sayer-esque 42-yard run, where he cut while going full speed, making a defender miss.    In the end, this was a win for the home team, but these teams are going in opposite directions, as the Steelers will get Roethlisberger back next week, while Kansas City won't get Charles back until next season.

   "comment":"Kelce was then guilty of a drop, and Cairo Santos followed that up with a whiff from 46 yards. On a following possession, a Charcandrick West 63-yard touchdown was nullified by offensive pass interference.    Smith went 15-of-23 for 191 yards, 1 touchdown and the underthrown interception. He picked up 40 rushing yards on 5 scrambles, but as mentioned, he could've easily been picked again. Smith's limitations are beginning to fester, which is not good news for Kansas City's January outlook.    Remarkably, only 3 Kansas City players caught passes.

The numbers are obviously meager, but Maclin still drew attention from the other players. Smith will have to result to throwing to third-round rookie Chris Conley instead. Conley caught a 9-yard touchdown in garbage time. Smith, meanwhile, went 17-of-22 for 190 yards, the score to Conley and an interception, which was behind his intended target. Smith also scrambled 5 times for 27 rushing yards. He did more of the same - he dinked and dunked for the most part. He took a deep shot early downfield to Albert Wilson, who torched first-round rookie Kevin Johnson, but he overthrew his receiver. Smith is not a good quarterback, despite ESPN gushing all over him, and he'll definitely be worse without his No. 1 receiver.    Being too mediocre to spread the ball around, Smith was able to connect with only 3 players on multiple occasions: Maclin, Travis Kelce (8-128) and Wilson (2-9). Kelce was guilty of a drop, but that was his only blemish on the afternoon. The Texans had absolutely no answer for Kelce. They tried to have various defenders cover him, yet no 1 had any sort of success.    The Chiefs ran the ball pretty well despite battling a Watt-led front for nearly 3 quarters. "

Down 14, the Chiefs took their time on a drive late in the 4.h quarter. They were ultimately set up with a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line with 2:50 remaining. However, they somehow ran just 1 play prior to the 2-minute warning. After that, the Chiefs actually huddled up with 1:40 on the clock, as it ticked down. It reminded me so much of the Patriots-Eagles Super Bowl 11 years ago when the Eagles took their time and Donovan McNabb puked all over the field. It's astonishing that Reid hasn't fixed this problem after more than a decade. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

   "comment":"Kelce. As a result, the Chiefs were able to prevail despite Foles playing under center, which has to be utterly embarrassing for the Colts.    Foles, statistically, was better than Smith, which just sounds wrong. Smith went 9-of-19 for 127 yards and a touchdown, though he did have a 28-yard completion wiped out by penalty. Foles, meanwhile, finished 16-of-22 for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns. His numbers could've even been better, as he had a 37-yard reception to Kelce negated by replay review. The numbers are legitimate, as Foles looked as great as he did during his 27-touchdown, 2.interception season. I don't know how sustainable this is, especially given that he was battling perhaps the worst defense in football that was missing its top player, but Andy Reid has been able to work magic with poor quarterbacks before.    Both Smith and Foles targeted Kelce very heavily, as the dynamic tight end caught 7 passes for 101 yards and a touchdown, abusing Indianapolis' horrid linebackers. He was a problem all game, converting third-and-10 and third-and-13 on the opening drive. As mentioned, he also had a deep reception overturned by replay, as he dropped the ball prior to hitting the ground out of bounds.    "

I thought the Chiefs would be able to run the ball successfully on the Broncos, but they didn't manage to do so. Ware gained 64 yards on 17 carries to go along with 2 catches for 32 receiving yards.    While the Chiefs were victorious, all questions were directed at Gary Kubiak for trying a 62-yard field goal with about a minute remaining in overtime. The miss gave Kansas City the ball on the Denver 48-yard line, effectively handing the Chiefs a free win. There were 2 reasons why Kubiak's decision was wrong. First, kicker "

   "comment":"Kelce. He was able to find space in the porous Atlanta defense, and that helped the Chiefs' offense to keep moving. Of course, Smith's performance did come with a crucial flaw. Smith had a wide open Spencer Ware off of a wheel route and threw the ball to him. However, he put it too far out in front of the back, who could not reel it in. Had he put it on target, it would have almost certainly gone for a touchdown. Smith needs to make sure that he can make the big throws. Like I said earlier, his deep accuracy was better today, but that was a pass that could have changed the outcome of the game.    Thanks to Smith's solid performance, 3 Chiefs receivers were able to post great days. The best performance came from Travis Kelce (8-140). The tight end was absolutely stellar and created some great mismatches for the Chiefs. By halftime, he had 4 catches for 99 yards, and he could have had a bigger day. Kelce should continue to be the top option for Smith moving forward. The other top receivers were "

Smith came back down to Earth after halftime, as he was just 6-of-10 for 62 yards, a telegraphed interception and a lost fumble (Khalil Mack strip-sack) following intermission. A regression to the mean was bound to happen for Smith, though in fairness, Andy Reid didn't seem interested in passing whatsoever, opting to just feed Spencer Ware instead. Overall, Smith finished 17-of-26 for 264 yards, 1 touchdown, the pick and the lost fumble.    The Raiders came into this game struggling against tight ends, so it's no wonder that Kelce went off. Kelce caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 1.handed grab thrown behind him for a gain of 34. Meanwhile, "

Just like that, it was 21-7, and the game was over. Denver would manage only 3 points the rest of the evening.    Alex Smith performed well in the opening half, though his overall stats are deceiving. Smith went 25-of-36 for 244 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. However, if you take away Kelce's touchdown, which was all Kelce and the great blocking, Smith would've gone 24-of-35, 164 yards and a pick. That would give him a YPA of 4.68, which is not acceptable for a quarterback who needs to step up to finally make a deep run into the playoffs. Like I said, however, Smith did some good things. He had a second touchdown that was dropped, and he was very effective on the ground when he needed to be, scrambling 4 times for 46 rushing yards and a score. His accuracy was also a positive trait, as he dinked and dunked very well to maintain control of the ball. The Chiefs won the time of possession by about 16 minutes. Smith's mistakes were pretty minimal. I mentioned an interception earlier; he threw the pick because he was hit upon releasing the ball, so it wasn't entirely his fault. In fact, Smith's first poor throw of the night came on his 10th attempt when he made an errant throw to "

   "comment":"Kelce had just 40 of those yards (5 catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no 1 should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. "

Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half.

   "comment":"Kelce for a 2-yard touchdown to give Kansas City a 17-14 lead, and we had a game! In that short time frame, we saw some of the best, worst and most exciting football of the season. At this point, Elliott hadn't done much, but in response to giving up 14 quick points, this Cowboys offense began to force their will a bit more with the running game, and moved down the field and responded with a 2.yard touchdown run by Elliott to take a 21-17 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish.    Alex Smith ended up throwing his first interception of the season, trying to bring his team back, giving him 18 touchdowns to just 1 pick on the season. That's amazing, considering he's thrown more 20-plus-yard completions so far, this season, than he did all of last season. This loss wasn't on Smith's shoulders. The Kansas City defense deserves much of the blame. The Chiefs usual bend-but-don't-break play was broken by Prescott. Kansas City couldn't get him off the field, especially in the second half. In the end, Dallas was able to convert on 7-of-12 third downs. The Chiefs also have some questions that need to be answered about their offense. Why did "

   "comment":"Kelce, which was deflected up in the air and then caught by Giants defensive tackle Snacks Harrison for an interception. That put New York at the Kansas City's 26. A pass interference on Marcus Peters in the end zone moved it to the 1-yard line and New York scored with Orleans Darkwa. The Chiefs drove across midfield, and Alex Smith converted a 4.h-and-5 with his legs to get the first down. Smith then hit Kelce for 21 yards to get inside the 15, but the drive stalled. A field goal cut the Giants lead to 6-3 at halftime. At the end of the third quarter, "
