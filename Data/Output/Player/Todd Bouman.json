   "comment":"Bouman, who hadn't started a game in 5 years, got the nod for the Jaguars with both David Garrard and Trent Edwards injured. Bouman's kids were too young to remember him under center, so they got to watch to watch their dad play the Chiefs. Things started well - the camera panned to his wife and children whenever he made a good play - but it all fell apart in the second half. Bouman tossed a pick-six in the third quarter and struggled from that point on. He finished 18-of-34 for 222 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks. Romeo Crennel, looking rather snazzy in a sweater vest and jacket, finally figured out how to stop the great Bouman.    "
