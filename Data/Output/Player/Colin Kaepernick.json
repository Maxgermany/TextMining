   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick was brilliant in San Francisco's second divisional-round victory in as many years, outplaying Aaron Rodgers by a wide margin - which is saying a lot because Rodgers performed well. Kaepernick came out of the tunnel with a pick-six, but was unstoppable after that. He finished 17-of-31 for 263 yards, 2 aerial touchdowns and the interception, as well as 183 rushing yards and 2 scores on the ground on 16 scrambles. Kaepernick had 80 rushing yards after 28 minutes of action. This is significant because he broke the record for most rushing yards in a playoff game by a quarterback at that point - and he went on to more than double that total! The Packers were just so incredibly befuddled by what they saw. Dom Capers kept the defense in man too long and consequently paid the price. All of the defenders, including Clay Matthews, were constantly fooled by the read option, which Kaepernick orchestrated to perfection. Many people on Twitter compared Kaepernick's performance to that of QB Dog Killer in <i>Madden 2004</i>. It was just that dominant, and quite frankly, it wasn't fair for the Packers. They just stood no chance.    Aaron Rodgers was able to match the 49ers point for point for slightly more than 1 half of action, but he couldn't keep up the pace. His team was just exhausted beginning in the middle of the third quarter because the game was too late. I discussed this on my NFL Picks page - San Francisco had a tremendous advantage in this contest because of the 8 p.m. start time. Circadian rhythms set in, and many Packer bodies shut down just after halftime. I don't think Green Bay would have won either way, but it turned into a blowout because of the NFL's irresponsible scheduling. This should have been a much tighter battle. At any rate, Rodgers finished 26-of-39 for 257 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that was pretty much like a punt on third-and-long. Rodgers didn't misfire on many attempts, but his big incompletion was a slight overthrow of Greg Jennings in the beginning of the 4.h quarter when this contest was still in question. Mike McCarthy then opted to punt on the ensuing 4th-and-5 despite being at midfield, which I thought was a huge mistake because the Packers hadn't been close to Kaepernick all evening. Green Bay pinned the 49ers deep, but as expected, Kaepernick drove the team down 93 yards for the game-sealing score.    Both running backs looked good. Green Bay had to abandon the run because of its deficit, but DuJuan Harris managed 53 yards and a touchdown on only 11 carries. "

When the Falcons won, he commented, This win legitimizes the Seattle Seahawks as the No. 1 seed and as the team to beat. He also suggested that the Seahawks should kick a field goal and then attempt an onside kick down 6 with 44 seconds remaining. It's been reported that Billick interviewed with the Eagles for their head-coaching position. I hope he takes the job so that we don't have to listen to his ridiculous analysis anymore. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Unfortunately for Green Bay, this was all for naught. Jim Harbaugh, who always seems to be 1 step ahead of Mike McCarthy, barely called any read-option plays for his quarterback. Kaepernick, instead, torched the Green Bay secondary. Kaepernick went 27-of-39 for 412 yards and 3 touchdowns to go along with 22 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. Kaepernick's 400-yard performance was the first by a 49er since Tim Rattay nearly a decade ago. What the Packers mainly weren't prepared for was "

Kaepernick failed to complete half of his passes, going 13-of-28 for 127 yards and the 4 give-aways. He managed to rush for 87 yards on 9 scrambles, but the negatives obviously outweighed those numbers. Kaepernick, who was constantly pressured by Seattle's fierce pass rush, didn't have much of a chance.    Kaepernick's supporting cast struggled. "

The 49ers were fortunate St. Louis struggled to do anything following a promising first couple of drives; they eventually got into a groove and converted touchdowns, putting this game away. The 49ers were able to do this via the ground attack. After completely neglecting the run against the Colts, they made sure they rammed it down St. Louis' throat. "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick through his second interceptions and second touchdown to the other team. And if you are a 49ers fan, you probably did click that clicker with authority and malice! When all was said and done, the Cardinals destroyed the 49ers, 47-7.    If you did keep on watching this game, you saw Kaepernick throw 2 more interceptions, with all 4 of them being his fault. Amazingly, Kaepernick hadn't thrown an interception yet this season. It was a terrible display as he completed just 6 passes on 19 attempts for 67 yards. He also ran 7 times for 46 yards and a touchdown. There is no doubt San Francisco would have fared better if Kaepernick had only run the ball and never thrown a pass.    The only other 49er to top 50 yards was "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick was able to be himself. The Packers, meanwhile, were able to cover, but I expected a much greater margin of victory from them. Aaron Rodgers took too many sacks, which has to be a bit of a concern. </i>    The Packers improved to 4-0, as they cruised over an anemic 49ers' offense. San Francisco's defense did a nice job of limiting Aaron Rodgers and the high-scoring Green Bay offense, but it was the Packers' defense that dominated from start to finish. Colin Kaepernick was helpless to move the ball, and the 49ers' offensive line was completely inept. Green Bay's secondary had an easy game as the Packers' defensive line and linebackers owned the line of scrimmage and lived in the 49ers' backfield.    On the first play from scrimmage, Rodgers dropped in a beautiful pass downfield for "

There were 2 silver linings, however. The first was that Kaepernick didn't throw an interception, though he certainly came close on some instances. In fact, on 1 play, he was nearly picked by 4 separate players. I'm not exaggerating. The second was that Kaepernick, unlike last week, showed a willingness to scramble. He picked up 28 rushing yards on 6 runs, and while that didn't end up mattering in this contest, perhaps it will versus lesser foes.    Kaepernick actually ended up leading the team in rushing yardage. In fact, no other back picked up more than 6 yards on the ground. Carlos Hyde was out, and "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick didn't get an obvious face-mask call in the first half. I saw it from a mile away, and so did the coaching staff, and everyone on the 49ers was furious. I'll just say that Kaepernick should not be expecting to get these sorts of calls in the near future.    Do not look now, but the Buffalo Bills are absolutely on fire. The team started the season 0-2, but has won 4 straight games for the first time since 2008 to improve to 4-2. Buffalo is now challenging the New England Patriots in the AFC East, and it is all thanks to some of the offensive improvements that the Bills have made. LeSean McCoy played what might have been 1 of the best games of his career on Sunday afternoon. Against the 49ers' putrid run defense, McCoy was unbelievable. He absolutely gashed the 49ers, carrying the ball 19 times for 140 yards and a whopping 3 touchdowns. It was his second straight week of averaging more than 7.4 yards per carry. That is absolutely ridiculous. As great as the numbers were for McCoy, he actually outperformed them. Nobody could keep track of McCoy on the field. He had numerous runs where he waited for his blockers to set up a lane, and then he was able to burst through. Arguably his best run came on a third-and-20 situation. He started running to the right before cutting back and running around multiple defenders to get the first down. He also was explosive on his touchdowns, bursting through the holes in the line with great speed and going in untouched almost every time. There is no question that McCoy is currently the best running back in the NFL. The change to Anthony Lynn as an offensive coordinator has done wonders for McCoy, and he should continue to be great for the rest of the season.    Tyrod Taylor was another member of the Bills' offense who played a stellar game. Taylor has been efficient since the start of the season, but today he was better than that. He went 17-of-26 on the day with 179 yards and 2 passing touchdowns. Taylor was able to complete most of his short to intermediate level passes with great accuracy. He was throwing darts to his receivers that had the perfect touch on them. He could stand to improve his deep accuracy, but it has not been a major issue. Taylor also had an impact for the Bills on the ground. During the contest, he scrambled 8 times for 68 yards. He was able to make quick decisions about when to scramble, which really helped the Bills. His mobility also allowed him to scramble around the pocket and avoid San Francisco's defenders. Taylor's mobility saved him from a few sacks, and it was critical to his offense's success. In terms of receiving, Taylor once again relied on a couple of receivers to carry the load. Charles Clay (5-52) and Robert Woods (5-44-1) were each targeted heavily by Taylor. Both players have been solid since Sammy Watkins was placed on the injured reserve. Clay is a high-end TE2 in fantasy at this point, and I would consider picking up Woods at this point as well. Woods does have issues with drops at times, but he is going to catch 5 passes most days. He is worthy of a bench spot in most 12-team leagues.    For the 49ers, this game was actually not all that bad. The final score is actually less lopsided than the scoreboard indicates. In fact, the 49ers were down 24-16 early in the 4.h quarter. A lot of this was thanks to the early play of Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick was nowhere close to perfect, but the veteran was an upgrade over Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick's numbers do not look all that good - 13-of-29 for 187 yards and 1 touchdown - but he played better than they indicate. He hit some downfield passes that Gabbert would not have made. On the 53-yard touchdown strike to "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick's pre-game antics, just wait until what happens until people catch wind of the racist t-shirt he wore in the post-game press conference. The 49ers should just do the league a favor and cut him. Maybe once they do that, they'll recoup the fans they lost this season - and believe me, based on the feedback I've received, they've lost many people to Kaepernick's stance.    The 49ers almost were able to exorcize their demons in this game. They jumped out to a 14-0 lead, and it looked like they were coming together. However, they collapsed after that and allowed the Buccaneers to take control. From there, the 49ers had no chance of winning; not that they ever did have a chance, given their quarterback play. Colin Kaepernick was pretty dreadful in the contest, going 16-of-34 for 143 yards for an awful yards-per-attempt statistic of 4.8. He did throw a touchdown, but that was negated by the 2 turnovers he had - a pick and a fumble. Frankly, Kaepernick does not look like a quarterback at all; neither a starter nor a backup. He needs to change positions. Kaepernick does have some serious athletic ability, which was on display during this game. He carried the ball 9 times for 84 yards and demonstrated great instincts when looking for lanes. He has great speed and size, so perhaps switching to wide receiver or tight end would be beneficial for him. It may be too late for him, but given the recent success of "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick is back to his former self! about a dozen times by the announcers. And whenever they showed the replay of what happened, Kaepernick was throwing to a wide-open player with no pressure in his face. I feel like an 80-year-old grandma in the stands could've registered 398 passing yards and 2 touchdowns against the Saints. She may not have even thrown an interception!    New Orleans got back to .500 (4-4) by cruising to a win over the hapless 49ers (1-7). With Tampa Bay losing on Thursday night, the Saints are in second place in the NFC South and remain in the wild-card race. San Francisco, meanwhile, protected its draft status with its 7.h-straight loss and is only 1 game behind Cleveland for the No. 1 overall pick. At this point, any wins the 49ers get would be meaningless and could hurt them for years to come.    The 49ers struck first in this contest with a Phil Dawson 49-yard field goal, which was set up by a 31-yard pass to Quinton Patton. The Saints came back with Drew Brees throwing lasers to Michael Thomas for 23 yards and tight end Josh Hill for 32 yards. To finish the drive, Tim Hightower scored from 4 yards out. Colin Kaepernick set up the Saints for more points as he didn't bother to read the Saints' defense before throwing a pass right to linebacker Craig Robertson."

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick. It really makes you wonder why the Patriots decided to deal Jones.    For the 49ers, this was a really nice showing. As mentioned earlier, the team was not expected to compete with the Cardinals, but the 49ers were able to do so. Colin Kaepernick had an OK performance. As a passer, he continued to be as mediocre as ever. He went 17-of-30 for 210 yards and a touchdown. Kaepernick avoided making too many mistakes, and while some of his throws were inaccurate, he got the job done. He led the game-tying drive with poise and proves that he at least belongs in the NFL. Kaepernick made more of an impact on the ground, per usual. He ran the ball 10 times for 55 yards, and he did run for the touchdown on the game-tying drive. That run was particularly nice, as the coaching staff designed it so Kaepernick would have a 1.on-one matchup. Kaepernick still 10.s to scramble too early, but for the most part in this game, he only did it when necessary. The 49ers have to be happy with his performance on Sunday.    Kaepernick was virtually the only impactful member of San Francisco's ground game. "

That may seem strange at first glance because Kaepernick attempted just 5 passes, completing only 1 for 4 yards, but he took so many bad sacks that he didn't give his team a chance. He was also limited on the ground - 6 carries, 20 rushing yards - and just didn't appear to be prepared for this opponent. And that's precisely a major part of the problem with Kaepernick. He just doesn't take his professional career seriously. He's a bum, and anyone who's been paying attention to how bad he's been amid the misleading stats knows he should not be in the NFL much longer. "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick struggled once again, going 20-of-33 for 183 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was doing nothing until the Falcons were up 21-0, which is when they relaxed and allowed Kaepernick to engineer a couple of scoring drives. Kaepernick can be a decent quarterback when the opponent doesn't try very hard, and that's exactly what happened in this contest. Kaepernick had a very ugly throw that was way late across the middle. He was fortunate that it wasn't picked off, but decisions like that will lead to interceptions in the future.    "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick, but the Rams have to be very discouraged by what they saw out of Jared Goff. Goff failed to complete half of his passes against 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL, going 11-of-24 for only 90 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. The 49ers already were devoid of talent, but they lost talented linebacker Gerald Hodges on top of that. Yet, Goff failed to do much in this easy matchup. He had a couple of positive moments, including a 4.h-and-1 conversion that eventually led to a Todd Gurley score, but the negatives far outweighted the positives. Goff's 2 interceptions were both ugly. The first occurred at the beginning of the afternoon, when he threw a ball right to Tramaine Brock. I can't explain the throw any better. Goff hurled it right to the San Francisco corner. Goff's second pick ended the game. The Rams had great field position after squandering their lead, but Goff ruined it by telegraphing a bad throw. Goff could've been intercepted on some other occasions as well; right before halftime, he was nearly pick-sixed on a bad throw on a third-and-5 to Tavon Austin. Brock nearly had another 1. but didn't see the ball. Goff is horrible so far, and if he doesn't progress at all next year, the Rams will have to declare him a sunk cost and just give up on him. That may seem like it's too soon, but Goff doesn't appear to have the stuff of an NFL quarterback. He might just be the worst quarterback in the entire NFL right now.    Despite the miserable quarterbacking, Kenny Britt managed to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards on the season, becoming the first Ram to do so since Torry Holt in 2007. Britt, however, didn't do much, catching just 1 pass for 15 yards. He was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a shoulder injury. As a result, Lance Kendricks led the Rams in receiving with a meager 36 yards.    Todd Gurley was expected to have a huge game versus the 49ers' horrible rush defense, but that never materialized. Gurley finished with just 67 yards on 23 carries. Gurley did manage to score, but he didn't have much blocking, and even when he did, he failed to show the same burst he possessed as a rookie. The FOX announcers commented about this as well. Gurley's inability to pick up chunks of yardage is 1 of the reasons why the Rams failed to hold on to their lead.    The other primary reason for this was that the Rams had yet another epic collapse. We've seen this before, as this contest mirrored the Rams-Dolphins affair from back in Week 11. The Rams led the entire game, and Miami had been doing nothing, but the defense had a meltdown, surrendering 2 touchdowns in a matter of minutes. That's exactly what happened in this game, as the 49ers roared back from down 21-7 to take a lead following a 2.point conversion. Colin Kaepernick was brilliant on the final 2 possessions, but I have to think that it had more to do with the Rams collapsing because Kaepernick really struggled for most of the afternoon. Some of that was his offensive line's inability to block, but Kaepernick also had some pretty poor moments. He floated an interception on a high throw in the early going, leading to a Rams touchdown on a Tavon Austin run. Kaepernick then had his tight end open for a sizable gain, but didn't pull the trigger for some reason. Later, he overthrew "

   "comment":"Colin Kaepernick led his team down the field, completing his first 8 passes for 115 yards. This has been a theme for Kaepernick this season. He'd start quickly and then get bogged down completely for 2 quarters before making a last-ditch effort to come back. Last week, that worked for the 49ers' second win of the season against the Rams, which happened to be the 49ers' second win against any team.    "
