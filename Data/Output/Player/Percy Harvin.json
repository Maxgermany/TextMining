   "comment":"Harvin caught just 1 ball for 10 yards and was targeted just 3 times. Harvin barely practiced this past week because of migraines.    As for the Panthers, I'm starting to really like this Matt Moore character. He had some shaky throws early on, but as the game progressed, it appeared as though John Fox and his staff had more confidence in him. As mentioned, he was 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. More importantly, in his 3 starts, he has turned the ball over only once. Moore is the guy Jake Delhomme was supposed to be - a steady, mistake-free quarterback who can make just enough throws to give the defense and running game a chance to win. Barring a massive meltdown the next 2 weeks, Moore needs to be the starter next year; not Delhomme.   "

   "comment":"Harvin returned the opening kick 103 yards. Adding injury to insult, Nate Kaeding tore his ACL on the play. He's out for the year. Even worse, 5.technique Luis Castillo is also done for the season. He's San Diego's top defensive lineman.    One other Charger who was injured was Mike Tolbert, but he appears to be fine. As usual, Tolbert vultured touchdowns (two) away from Ryan Mathews, though both running backs looked good in the passing game. Tolbert caught a whopping 9 balls for 58 receiving yards, while Mathews notched 73 receiving yards on 3 receptions. Mathews and Tolbert had 45 and 35 rushing yards, respectively.    Philip Rivers went 33-of-48 for 335 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions despite the fact that he was constantly harassed by a Minnesota front 4 that was missing Kevin Williams.    Excluding Tolbert, Rivers' top target was Antonio Gates, who notched 8 balls for 74 yards. Vincent Jackson (2-31) didn't do much, though Rivers nearly hooked up with him for a long touchdown.    As for the Vikings, they couldn't muster much offense, scoring just 10 points if you exclude the Harvin return. Minnesota managed only 187 net yards and 10 first downs. "

At least the Panthers did not let momentum sway too much, holding possession for 14 plays and converting a pair of third downs. The drive stalled when they failed twice on third down. The first time was an incomplete pass thrown into heavy traffic, but Byron Bell was called for holding. Leslie Frazier decided to back them up instead of risking a long made field goal. After an incomplete pass, the strategy paid off. A shovel pass to Adrian Peterson (5 receptions for 76 yards, 1 TD) for 22 yards helped Minnesota change field position, but it wound up not mattering. Carolina's offense started to click with 3 big plays by Steve Smith (8 touches for 112 yards) totaling 57 yards, 1 being a creative run. A touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey tied it up at 7 early in the second quarter. A flat possession by the Vikings followed. It was highlighted by Percy Harvin and Captain Munnerlyn, who had a terrific game, scuffling on the Panthers' sideline."

   "comment":"Harvin set up the Vikings in good field position at their 32-yard line. However, left tackle Charlie Johnson forgot that false starts are for visiting teams indoors. The loss was crucial as a pass on 3rd-and-5 to Kyle Rudolph came up a yard short. After a good punt backed the Raiders up, the defense gave up a first down then killed Oakland's first drive with a sack by Chad Greenway. Christian Ponder (19-of-33 for 211 yards 2 TD 3 INT) has a chance to be a good player and his scrambling ability is a big reason why. He ran 5 times for 71 yards in the game, but came up on the short end because the pass rush was effective in getting him out of rhythm. The Raiders came up with 5 sacks even with Richard Seymour out of the lineup; not to mention Matt Shaughnessy sitting on injured reserve. Tommy Kelly had the first drive stopped with a sack, but clipped Ponder's face mask while taking him down for a 15-yard penalty. Another personal foul, this 1 a questionable call on linebacker Aaron Curry, who merely hit Rudolph squarely after a short gain, set up the Vikings in plus territory. Harvin had a sweet 35-yard touchdown run negated by a hold on wide receiver Michael Jenkins, but the drive still ended with a score thanks in part to another 15-yard penalty on Oakland's defense, this 1 a face mask on Tyvon Branch."

   "comment":"Harvin set up the Vikings in good field position at their 32-yard line. However, left tackle Charlie Johnson forgot that false starts are for visiting teams indoors. The loss was crucial as a pass on 3rd-and-5 to Kyle Rudolph came up a yard short. After a good punt backed the Raiders up, the defense gave up a first down then killed Oakland's first drive with a sack by Chad Greenway. Christian Ponder (19-of-33 for 211 yards 2 TD 3 INT) has a chance to be a good player and his scrambling ability is a big reason why. He ran 5 times for 71 yards in the game, but came up on the short end because the pass rush was effective in getting him out of rhythm. The Raiders came up with 5 sacks even with Richard Seymour out of the lineup; not to mention Matt Shaughnessy sitting on injured reserve. Tommy Kelly had the first drive stopped with a sack, but clipped Ponder's face mask while taking him down for a 15-yard penalty. Another personal foul, this 1 a questionable call on linebacker Aaron Curry, who merely hit Rudolph squarely after a short gain, set up the Vikings in plus territory. Harvin had a sweet 35-yard touchdown run negated by a hold on wide receiver Michael Jenkins, but the drive still ended with a score thanks in part to another 15-yard penalty on Oakland's defense, this 1 a face mask on Tyvon Branch."

   "comment":"Harvin in particular. Harvin had a 104-yard kickoff return, but didn't score. He also found his way into the end zone, but didn't get a touchdown. I'll explain. Harvin's return came from the back of the end zone. He ran inside the Atlanta 5-yard line, where he was tackled. Four plays later, Harvin had what seemed like a touchdown. The replay clearly showed him breaking the goal line. However, the officials ruled that Harvin's progress was stopped at the 1-yard line. Brian Billick and his play-by-play analyst nearly had an aneurysm as this was happening. It was a shady call that would make any conspiracy theorist wonder if the refs wanted the Falcons to cover the 9.5 points.    Harvin had a big game though, catching 8 balls for 95 yards and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Harvin's injury happened. The dynamic wideout injured his ankle at the beginning of the second half. He missed some action and then reentered the contest, but he was completely ineffective once he took the field again. He was limping around, which really limited the offense. He finished with 2 catches for 10 yards and 4 carries for 24 rushing yards.    Christian Ponder didn't really have his top option in the second half, so some will blame Harvin's injury on Ponder's pathetic stats (11-of-22, 63 yards and an interception), but Ponder was just 7-of-13 for 42 yards prior to halftime, which is when Harvin was healthy. Ponder has regressed terribly the past few weeks, and those impressive home victories over the 49ers and Titans seem like a million years ago.    I mentioned Peterson earlier. He's the only reason why the Vikings were even competitive. He opened the contest with a 74-yard burst and finished with 182 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. Peterson had just 5 attempts after halftime, so the Vikings need to be criticized for abandoning the ground attack so willingly. Peterson also led the team with 3 catches for 11 receiving yards. Sadly, the leading Minnesota receiver was "

However, the other 2 picks were brutal; the second was a short pass off Smith's back foot, while the third wasn't even close to his target. At that point, I tweeted out - - a completely accurate stat: Geno Smith is on pace for 18 interceptions today. Unfortunately, we wouldn't get our 18 picks because QBDK entered the game. Not to defend Smith or anything because he was an abomination, but the play-calling was terrible. After the first 3 drives, Smith had 6 passes compared to just 1 Chris Ivory (13-43, 2 TDs) run. what happened to Ground and Pound? Why would Marty Mornhinweg sling the ball so willingly with such a pedestrian quarterback?    QBDK was only a bit better, but only because he ran so much. He scrambled 8 times for 69 rushing yards, but posted mediocre passing numbers, going 18-of-36 for 153 yards and an interception that occurred late when he was hit as he released the ball. He also fumbled twice, losing the ball once. QBDK's big issue was missing receivers; not just in terms of accuracy but just not seeing open targets downfield. A hectic Buffalo pass rush didn't help matters; the Bills registered 4 sacks, 1.5 from Kyle Williams. Smith's benching shouldn't be permanent. Smith had a solid outing against the Patriots, so the Jets should allow him to have another chance. At 1-7, it's not like they're going to the playoffs anyway. They need to make sure Smith is a bust before deciding on whether they want to draft Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston.    Harvin made his debut for the Jets, but served as an inefficient receiver - I already mentioned him being thrown to on the first pick - hauling in just 3 of 9 targets for 22 yards. He also had 4 carries for 28 rushing yards. He made a nice return to open the game, but then stupidly took a kickoff out of the back of the end zone in the third quarter. He sprinted to the 3-yard line and stopped to throw a pass back, but decided against it and was promply tackled.    The Jets' leading receiver was "

   "comment":"Harvin for a 51-yard touchdown. One of his best plays was just an 8.yarder, but it moved the chains on third down. He stood in the pocket, took a bit hit, but managed to hit Robert Woods on a strike to move the chains. Taylor also proved to be elusive, escaping sacks and picking up first downs with his legs. He was awesome - much better than either Matt Cassel or E.J. Manuel would have been, though it's maybe worth noting that Cassel actually started. He was under center on the opening play, while Taylor was split out wide. I'm not sure what that was about, but I guess it doesn't matter. In terms of fantasy, Taylor may have gone undrafted in your league. If so, pick him up. His rushing ability makes him a viable fantasy option - at the very least as a backup with upside.    Taylor was the big story in this game, but the primary reason the Bills prevailed was because of their dominant defense. Limiting Andrew Luck to just 14 points - and really just 8 considering that a late touchdown came in garbage time - is no joke, especially without Marcell Dareus. Buffalo intercepted Luck twice and nearly secured some other turnovers. The first occurred on an underthrown ball that Ronald Darby picked off. The second was a desperation try at the end of the contest that was tipped into the air. Luck finished 26-of-49 for 243 yards and 2 touchdowns otherwise, but a lot of that came late in meaningless action. He couldn't even complete half of his attempts in the opening 2 quarters, going just 11-of-23 for 124 yards and a pick by intermission.    Indianapolis fans have to be upset by the offense's lack of production. Granted, Buffalo may have the top defense in the NFL, but it's clear that the offensive line is a big problem. This was obvious heading into the offseason, yet Indianapolis' front office did nothing to fix it. An injury to Hilton is problematic as well. He sustained a knee bruise, ruining his 7.catch, 88-yard day. Jim Irsay said afterward that Hilton could be out for a few games. Frank Gore also got banged up with a calf problem, but came back into the game. Gore managed just 31 yards on 8 carries. He'll be better in easier matchups.    With T.Y. Hilton possibly out for a while, Donte Moncrief may step up. Moncrief collected 6 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown. The score came in garbage time, but he still looks like a promising fantasy option as long as Hilton is sidelined. Rookie Phillip Dorsett, meanwhile, struggled. He was guilty of a drop and a fumble. I would drop him if Hilton returns to the lineup because he's definitely behind Moncrief.    Elsewhere for the Colts, Andre Johnson converted just 4 of 10 targets for 24 yards. Much like Reggie Wayne last year, Johnson struggled to separate, and he even dropped a 2.point conversion try. It's still early, but he does not look like a good signing.    Going back to the Bills, LeSean McCoy tallied 87 total yards, 41 of which came on the ground (17 attempts), with the rest off 3 catches. The Colts were able to bottle him up for the most part, though they somehow lost track of him on a 20-yard screen early on. Karlos Williams (6-55) vultured a touchdown away from McCoy, who also had a score wiped out by a penalty.    Sammy Watkins, smothered by Vontae Davis, didn't come up with a single catch on 3 targets, thanks to Vontae Davis. Watkins is worth buying low. Harvin (5-79), a sell-high target, led the way in receiving, while Charles Clay (4-43) had a nice gain nullified by his own chop block."
