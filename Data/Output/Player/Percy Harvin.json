   "comment":"Percy Harvin caught just 1 ball for 10 yards and was targeted just 3 times. Harvin barely practiced this past week because of migraines.    As for the Panthers, I'm starting to really like this Matt Moore character. He had some shaky throws early on, but as the game progressed, it appeared as though John Fox and his staff had more confidence in him. As mentioned, he was 6-of-7 for 171 yards on his final 3 drives. More importantly, in his 3 starts, he has turned the ball over only once. Moore is the guy Jake Delhomme was supposed to be - a steady, mistake-free quarterback who can make just enough throws to give the defense and running game a chance to win. Barring a massive meltdown the next 2 weeks, Moore needs to be the starter next year; not Delhomme.   "

Tarvaris Jackson wasn't bad in limited relief, going 4-of-6 for 36 yards and a touchdown, as well as a 33-yard scramble in garbage time.    Adrian Peterson ran the ball well, rushing for 92 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. He also caught 5 balls for 50 more yards.    Percy Harvin led the Vikings with 6 receptions for 104 yards, but had that aforementioned horrible gaff that really cost Minnesota the game.    "

   "comment":"Percy Harvin returned the opening kick 103 yards. Adding injury to insult, Nate Kaeding tore his ACL on the play. He's out for the year. Even worse, 5.technique Luis Castillo is also done for the season. He's San Diego's top defensive lineman.    One other Charger who was injured was Mike Tolbert, but he appears to be fine. As usual, Tolbert vultured touchdowns (two) away from Ryan Mathews, though both running backs looked good in the passing game. Tolbert caught a whopping 9 balls for 58 receiving yards, while Mathews notched 73 receiving yards on 3 receptions. Mathews and Tolbert had 45 and 35 rushing yards, respectively.    Philip Rivers went 33-of-48 for 335 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of interceptions despite the fact that he was constantly harassed by a Minnesota front 4 that was missing Kevin Williams.    Excluding Tolbert, Rivers' top target was Antonio Gates, who notched 8 balls for 74 yards. Vincent Jackson (2-31) didn't do much, though Rivers nearly hooked up with him for a long touchdown.    As for the Vikings, they couldn't muster much offense, scoring just 10 points if you exclude the Harvin return. Minnesota managed only 187 net yards and 10 first downs. Donovan McNabb went 7-of-15 for 39 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was tipped and impressively caught by Shaun Phillips. McNabb had absolutely no time in the pocket. He was constantly on the run, scrambling for 32 yards.    Only 3 Vikings caught passes: Michael Jenkins (3-26, TD), Percy Harvin (2-7) and Adrian Peterson (2-6)."

   "comment":"Percy Harvin and Captain Munnerlyn, who had a terrific game, scuffling on the Panthers' sideline. It looked like Carolina might be starting to take over when Newton hit Greg Olsen on a beautiful 39-yard touchdown pass down the middle when he beat Husain Abdullah who probably wishes he had gotten safety help. Looking to get even, Minnesota drove right down the field, but at the end of a third-down conversion, Harvin had the ball stripped from his new friend Munnerlyn. Carolina worked its way out of the poor field position only to watch Allen get a different part of the sack/fumble action, this time leaving the recovery for Chad Greenway. At this point, Peterson (21 carries for 86 yards, 1 TD) was getting stood up in the running game, so the Vikings smartly threw to him twice for a quick 39 yards and the tying touchdown as the half pretty much expired. Once again, Carolina's offense got on the move, not even getting to third down until it was inside the Minnesota 30-yard line. Newton's 23-yard scamper was the highlight, and he capped the march by hitting Smith for a 22-yard scoring pass to put the Panthers up 21-14. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, Minnesota unleashed Toby Gerhart. His presence seemed to spark All Day, who up to that point had been flat. Basically alternating to start the drive, the duo combined to carry the ball 5 times for a quick 48 yards. A pair of 12-yard completions helped move them to the red zone and Peterson capped the scoring drive with a 9-yard touchdown run to tie the game. The third quarter came to a close with a 3.and-out by Carolina. Minnesota's next 2 possessions were sandwiched around another 3.and-out by the Panthers. This is where Ponder's steady play came in. He delivered a 13-yard pass to Visanthe Shiancoe on 3rd-and-11 to extend the first drive. On the next drive, Ponder utilized Percy Harvin to cash in another third down (11-yard pass) and completed 2 other throws totaling 37 yards with the game on the line. The drive did stall inside the 20 when he threw short twice, but Longwell hit the 31-yard field goal to put the visitors up 24-21. At this point, I expected some Newton magic. He opened the drive with an incompletion, but hit "

Harvin's return came from the back of the end zone. He ran inside the Atlanta 5-yard line, where he was tackled. Four plays later, Harvin had what seemed like a touchdown. The replay clearly showed him breaking the goal line. However, the officials ruled that Harvin's progress was stopped at the 1-yard line. Brian Billick and his play-by-play analyst nearly had an aneurysm as this was happening. It was a shady call that would make any conspiracy theorist wonder if the refs wanted the Falcons to cover the 9.5 points.    Harvin had a big game though, catching 8 balls for 95 yards and a touchdown. "
