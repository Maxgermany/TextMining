   "comment":"Johnson took the opening kickoff for a touchdown, and after they stopped getting in their own way with a couple of mistakes, they were able to establish a huge lead to improve to 2-0. Chicago offered very little resistance, as it continued to sport 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. The Bears were awful on that side of the ball. The trouble began when Kyle Fuller was flagged for a 42-yard pass interference on John Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. Alan Ball then took his turn with a deep pass interference flag, a 38-yarder, leading to a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. Chris Johnson handled most of the workload, but managed just 72 yards on 20 carries against a horrible defense. David Johnson scored a touchdown and looked better overall, gaining 42 yards on 5 attempts. David needs to be on the field more than Chris before Andre Ellington returns.

   "comment":"Johnson dropped a touchdown in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble on the kickoff. The Cardinals also sputtered in the red zone all afternoon. So, despite outgaining St. Louis, 447-328, Arizona lost its first game of the year.    I guess you can say that Palmer performed well in between the 20s - especially when considering the circumstances. Palmer went 29-of-46 for 352 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception despite having no time to throw on many of his snaps. He was hit constantly by the Rams' ferocious pass rush. Despite this, Palmer was able to move the chains, though his team just failed deep in St. Louis territory and screwed up with turnovers.    It's no surprise that Fitzgerald led the team in receiving (7-99), but had that aforementioned fumble, which led to a St. Louis touchdown. John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone. It's worth noting that Floyd drew a pair of pass interference penalties.    With Andre Ellington out, Chris Johnson drew another start. He looked good again, gaining 83 yards on 16 carries. David Johnson, as mentioned, had multiple screw-ups, including the fumble on the opening kickoff. David at least made up for it with 4 catches for 63 receiving yards and a touchdown. He was given just 3 attempts on the ground, which he turned into 18 rushing yards.    The Cardinals were screwed over by a horrible ruling. In the third quarter, "

   "comment":"Johnson dropped a touchdown in addition to losing that aforementioned fumble on the kickoff. The Cardinals also sputtered in the red zone all afternoon. So, despite outgaining St. Louis, 447-328, Arizona lost its first game of the year.    I guess you can say that Palmer performed well in between the 20s - especially when considering the circumstances. Palmer went 29-of-46 for 352 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception despite having no time to throw on many of his snaps. He was hit constantly by the Rams' ferocious pass rush. Despite this, Palmer was able to move the chains, though his team just failed deep in St. Louis territory and screwed up with turnovers.    It's no surprise that Fitzgerald led the team in receiving (7-99), but had that aforementioned fumble, which led to a St. Louis touchdown. John Brown (7-75) and Michael Floyd (5-59) also contributed, but neither found the end zone. It's worth noting that Floyd drew a pair of pass interference penalties.    With Andre Ellington out, Chris Johnson drew another start. He looked good again, gaining 83 yards on 16 carries. David Johnson, as mentioned, had multiple screw-ups, including the fumble on the opening kickoff. David at least made up for it with 4 catches for 63 receiving yards and a touchdown. He was given just 3 attempts on the ground, which he turned into 18 rushing yards.    The Cardinals were screwed over by a horrible ruling. In the third quarter, "

After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-5 selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to "

Nearly half of his production came on a 48-yard bomb. Michael Floyd was limited to just 1 reception for 14 yards. He saw just 1 other target, which was a deep drop.

   "comment":"Johnson, who gave a horrible tackling effort.    Greg Olsen didn't score, but he was a huge part of the offense. Newton continued to lean on him, targeting him more than any other player. Olsen caught 6 of the 8 balls thrown to him for 113 yards. I suppose we can safely say he's OK after he got banged up last week.    Speaking of injured Panthers, the 1 dark cloud over this game is that Thomas Davis appears to have broken his arm. That occurred when Darren Fells inexplicably leapt into him at the end of a 21-yard reception. The loss would be huge, but the Panthers won't be playing a quality offense in the Super Bowl.    Before moving on to the Cardinals' numbers, it should be noted that Jonathan Stewart ran well, gaining 83 yards on 19 carries. He had a pair of long gains on 1 drive and got tackled at the 1-yard line, but didn't score. Newton capitalized with a sneak. Also, Ted Ginn found the end zone on a 22-yard rushing touchdown, which was actually a reverse.    As for Arizona, Palmer was absolutely disgraceful. You could've had him don a Brian Hoyer jersey, and no 1 would've known the difference. He was that bad, and that's not an exaggeration in the slightest. Carson Hoyer, I mean Palmer, went 23-of-40 for 235 yards, 1 touchdown, 4 interceptions and 2 lost fumbles. But those horrific numbers don't even tell the whole story. Palmer was wildly inaccurate throughout, beginning on the opening drive when he overshot Michael Floyd. Palmer was then nearly picked on a deep attempt downfield, and then proceeded to toss the ball into the ground. On the following drive, Josh Norman dropped a potential interception, leading me to wonder why in the world Palmer was targeting Norman when the rest of the Carolina secondary was the weak spot of the defense. Palmer went on to float a short pass over Andre Ellington's head and then was strip-sacked. Palmer, facing a 17-0 deficit, then had a stretch in which he completed 7-of-9 passes, but went on to struggle after that. He lost a fumble and then heaved a careless interception into the end zone, staring down his receiver. Much later, whatever life the Cardinals had following a touchdown was sucked out when Palmer was responsible for a dumb interception into double coverage. Further embarrassing himself, Palmer was pick-sixed by Luke Kuechly with a few minutes remaining on the clock. People are going to say that Palmer's finger injury was the reason for his struggles. However, that doesn't excuse his horrible decision-making. We haven't seen much of him in the playoffs, but he's now 1-3, and it's safe to say that he's a choke artist. The Cardinals need to think about using a day(-2 selection on a quarterback to groom behind Palmer, who will turn 37 during the 2016 campaign.    Outside of Palmer, Arizona's greatest disappointment was Larry Fitzgerald, who caught 4 passes for 30 yards, and no, it wasn't because Norman was covering him. Norman was on Michael Floyd (3-37), who didn't catch a pass in meaningful action. Fitzgerald was guilty of 2 drops. Meanwhile, John Brown snagged just 1 pass for 16 yards.    David Johnson was the only Arizona offensive player who didn't suck. He could've had a big game on the ground had the Panthers not jumped out to a big lead, as he gained 60 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. He also caught 9 passes for 68 receiving yards. He has a very bright future ahead of him. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

New York held Johnson in check in the first half outside of his 58-yard scoring burst on the opening drive, but Johnson picked up chunks in the second half once the Jets' effort level decreased as a result of their defense realizing that their offense wasn't going to do anything.    The Cardinals saved their season by improving to 3-3. They needed the victory, as 3 of their next 5 games are against the Seahawks, Falcons and Vikings. They just don't look the same as last year, however, as this game was only 14-3 until the Jets checked out. Palmer definitely doesn't seem like himself. For more thoughts, check out my updated   "

   "comment":"Johnson had consecutive runs of 9, 10 and 11 yards. This opened a play-action chance for Carson Palmer, who hit Larry Fitzgerald with a 13-yard strike. The Cardinals took the lead on the drive, but they didn't do much after that. The Vikings made the appropriate adjustments and made Palmer's afternoon a living hell. Things began trending southward for Palmer when he was picked off in the end zone, as Xavier Rhodes ran the turnover back 100 yards for the defensive touchdown. The pass wasn't even close to the mark, so John Brown must have run the wrong route. Palmer later tossed a second pick, an overthrow into double coverage. Palmer had a chance at the very end because of a Sam Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on fourth down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries.

   "comment":"Johnson. He caught a couple of passes to get the team into field-goal range. Chandler Catanzaro tried to kick the game winner. His 43-yarder was good, and that ended the contest. Though the win will hurt their draft positioning, the Cardinals have to be happy with their performance. They played a complete game against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL, and Carson Palmer put together a solid showing.    Palmer compiled 1 of the best games of his entire season. He went 16-of-26 during the contest for 284 yards and a touchdown. Palmer was very accurate and was able to succeed despite seeing a lot of pressure. For the first time all year, he looked entirely comfortable in the pocket, and he was able to show his arm strength as well. Perhaps the best trait about Palmer is that he knows when to target certain players. He did not try to force anything today, and that was apparent by the fact that he did not log any turnovers. Palmer should build on this skill for next season, and perhaps he will be able to do that and get the Cardinals back to the postseason.    In the receiving corps, it was clear that the Cardinals were missing Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the fourth quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback "

   "comment":"Johnson. He caught a couple of passes to get the team into field-goal range. Chandler Catanzaro tried to kick the game winner. His 43-yarder was good, and that ended the contest. Though the win will hurt their draft positioning, the Cardinals have to be happy with their performance. They played a complete game against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL, and Carson Palmer put together a solid showing.    Palmer compiled 1 of the best games of his entire season. He went 16-of-26 during the contest for 284 yards and a touchdown. Palmer was very accurate and was able to succeed despite seeing a lot of pressure. For the first time all year, he looked entirely comfortable in the pocket, and he was able to show his arm strength as well. Perhaps the best trait about Palmer is that he knows when to target certain players. He did not try to force anything today, and that was apparent by the fact that he did not log any turnovers. Palmer should build on this skill for next season, and perhaps he will be able to do that and get the Cardinals back to the postseason.    In the receiving corps, it was clear that the Cardinals were missing Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the fourth quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback "
