   "comment":"David Johnson took the opening kickoff for a touchdown, and after they stopped getting in their own way with a couple of mistakes, they were able to establish a huge lead to improve to 2-0. Chicago offered very little resistance, as it continued to sport 1 of the worst defenses in the NFL. The Bears were awful on that side of the ball. The trouble began when Kyle Fuller was flagged for a 42-yard pass interference on John Brown after being beten badly, setting up a short score to Jaron Brown. Alan Ball then took his turn with a deep pass interference flag, a 38-yarder, leading to a Larry Fitzgerald touchdown. Missed tackles and blown coverages were prevalent throughout the afternoon. John Fox has a lot of work to do.    Carson Palmer went 17-of-24 for 185 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception that was a swatted pass in mid-air by Jared Allen. Palmer was on fire, but Chicago's putrid defense offered no resistance. If you happen to own Palmer, I'd recommend unloading him to a team that is enduring quarterback issues. Palmer, a ticking time bomb in terms of staying healthy, won't have the luxury of going up against Chicago's weak defense each week.    Another player you should attempt to trade is Larry Fitzgerald. Securing 3 of Palmer's 4 touchdowns, Fitzgerald logged 8 catches for 112 yards otherwise. Fitzgerald can still get it done, but he's coming off 2 games against the worst defenses in the NFL. It'll be tougher for him to produce versus superior foes, and besides, it's only a matter of time before he gets hurt.    While Fitzgerald had a huge outing, only 1 other Cardinal had more than 20 receiving yards. That was John Brown, who snatched all 5 of his targets for 45 yards. Not shown on the stat sheet were 2 long pass interference calls, 1 of which he drew on Kyle Fuller, whom he beat quite easily. Fuller was ultimately benched in the second half.    Arizona's running game was unimpressive, to say the least. Chris Johnson handled most of the workload, but managed just 72 yards on 20 carries against a horrible defense. David Johnson scored a touchdown and looked better overall, gaining 42 yards on 5 attempts. David needs to be on the field more than Chris before Andre Ellington returns.

   "comment":"David Johnson charged up the middle into the end zone. Abdullah fumbled again on the following kickoff return, but questionably, the ball was ruled to be Detroit's. Starting a drive at his own 1-yard line, Palmer laid out a 49-yard pass to John Brown, who got over the top of Darius Slay. Chris Johnson took off on a 40-yard run to the 2-yard line on the next snap. That set up another touchdown run for David Johnson. On the next possession, Johnson fumble? How insanely improbable. </i>    After Arizona lost last week for the first time this season, a game at Detroit was a perfect remedy to get the Cardinals back in the win column. This was pure domination with tons of self-inflicted moves by the Lions. Arizona looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, and Detroit looks like a legit top-five selector in the 2016 NFL Draft.    On the Lions' first possession, Matthews Stafford threw a terrible pick to Rashad Johnson. Stafford could have run for the first down rather than trying to force the pass to "

   "comment":"David Johnson and Tyrann Mathieu all missed time in this contest with what appeared to be serious injuries at first glance. Johnson was the first to get hurt. He left the field early right before halftime, but he was on the field to begin the third quarter. Palmer then banged his hand on Connor Barwin. His finger was dislocated, but the training staff was able to pop it into place, allowing Palmer to re-take the field after being out for several plays. Mathieu sustained an injury after an interception late in regulation, but he walked off under his own power. His status, however, is still up in the air. I don't understand why Mathieu was even on the field when the score was 40-17 with just 2 minutes remaining. I appreciate Arizona going hard at the end of the year to maintain momentum, but pressing the gas pedal too hard can definitely backfire.    Outside of the injuries, Johnson is certainly the lead story. The rookie supplanted an injured and ineffective Chris Johnson and has proven to be an incredible replacement. David Johnson gained 187 yards and 3 touchdowns on 29 carries to go along with 4 catches for 42 receiving yards, and those numbers don't even tell the entire story. Johnson broke numerous tackles, as the Eagles had major problems tackling him. He was so great on 1 of his touchdown runs that Cris Collinsworth exclaimed, That's worth of Beast Mode! Johnson is also terrific as a pass-catcher in the receiving game. It's remarkable that he's such a complete back this early in his career, and beyond his tackle-breaking ability, his patience is incredible.    Carson Palmer went 20-of-32 for 274 yards and a touchdown. The only reason he didn't post sterling fantasy numbers is because Johnson hogged all the scores. Palmer nearly had a deep touchdown early, but Johnson and Tyrann Mathieu all missed time in this contest with what appeared to be serious injuries at first glance. Johnson was the first to get hurt.

   "comment":"David Johnson continued his spectacular play. He didn't lead the team in rushing, but only because he had just 1 carry following intermission. His 9 tries went for 39 yards and a touchdown, but his best moments came when he caught passes out of the backfield. Johnson snatched 3 balls for 88 receiving yards, including a 44-yarder where he broke numerous tackles. Johnson is the real deal, and his emergence is a major reason why the Cardinals have a great chance of going the distance. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

New York held Johnson in check in the first half outside of his 58-yard scoring burst on the opening drive, but Johnson picked up chunks in the second half once the Jets' effort level decreased as a result of their defense realizing that their offense wasn't going to do anything.    The Cardinals saved their season by improving to 3-3. They needed the victory, as 3 of their next 5 games are against the Seahawks, Falcons and Vikings. They just don't look the same as last year, however, as this game was only 14-3 until the Jets checked out. Palmer definitely doesn't seem like himself. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div id=comments><span style=font-weight:bold; font-size:16pt;>LOADING COMMENTS...</span>   "

   "comment":"David Johnson. The 49ers have the worst rush defense in the league, and many expected that Johnson would have a huge performance against them. However, Johnson had some trouble getting through San Francisco's defensive line. He ran the ball 19 times for just 55 yards and a touchdown. He also had an impact in the receiving game, catching 5 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown. Johnson is still the workhorse back, and he will rebound. Being without left tackle Jared Veldheer certainly had an impact on Johnson today.    Defensively, Johnson.

   "comment":"David Johnson had consecutive runs of 9. 10 and 11 yards. This opened a play-action chance for Carson Palmer, who hit Larry Fitzgerald with a 13-yard strike. The Cardinals took the lead on the drive, but they didn't do much after that. The Vikings made the appropriate adjustments and made Palmer's afternoon a living hell. Things began trending southward for Palmer when he was picked off in the end zone, as Xavier Rhodes ran the turnover back 100 yards for the defensive touchdown. The pass wasn't even close to the mark, so John Brown must have run the wrong route. Palmer later tossed a second pick, an overthrow into double coverage. Palmer had a chance at the very end because of a Sam Bradford fumble turned into a touchdown, but Palmer was sacked on numerous occasions on the final couple of drives. It appeared as though the officials felt so sorry for Palmer that they gave him a free first down on a clean hit that should've ended the game, but Palmer was ultimately sacked on 4.h down, allowing Minnesota to prevail. Palmer finished 20-of-38 for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pair of interceptions. However, he was brutal in the second half, going 9-of-19 for 45 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick following intermission. He took only 4 sacks, but it really felt like 14. Palmer was hit hard all afternoon. In fact, I'm surprised he made it through the game without an injury. The second half was a mess for the entire team, as Arizona managed just 5 first downs.    As for David Johnson, he didn't do much in the second half either. In fact, he was given just 5 carries after the break, which was a huge error on Arizona's part, given how well Johnson had been running. Johnson finished with 103 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Johnson was also second on the team in receiving yardage, as he reeled in 7 of 11 targets for 57 yards and a touchdown. He was only behind Fitzgerald (6-63), who made an amazing 1.handed catch in the opening half.    Elsewhere in the passing game, Johnson had consecutive runs of 9. 10 and 11 yards.

   "comment":"David Johnson doing the heavy lifting, and he capped the drive with a short touchdown run. A pass to Chris Thompson (2-24, 1-21) and a run from Rob Kelley got Washington moving with 40 yards on 2 plays, and that set up a 47-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins. Washington got the ball back, and Kirk Cousins quickly moved the ball down the field using Pierre Garcon and Ryan Grant (2-20), but the Cardinals produced a goal-line stand to limit Washington to a field goal. Just before the half, Arizona tacked on a field goal thanks to some excellent receptions by Larry Fitzgerald and Johnson. Arizona took a 10-6 lead into the locker room. To open the third quarter, Cousins threw a beautiful 59-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (his only catch), who ran by Tyvon Branch down the middle of the field to get inside the 10-yard line. Cousins was able to dive into the end zone on third-and-goal to get the Redskins a 13-10 lead. A Trent Murphy sack led to Arizona missing a 53-yard field goal. However, Calais Campbell strip-sacked Cousins and Markus Golden returned the fumble to the Redskins' 10-yard line. Carson Palmer then fired a fastball to Michael Floyd (3-18-1) for the score and a 17-13 lead. Cousins struck back with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder (3-42-1), who beat Tony Jefferson to get wide open. Arizona responded by ripping the ball down the field quickly and scored with a 25-yard pass to Johnson. The Redskins countered with a field goal to make it 24-23 Arizona midway through the 4.h quarter. The Cardinals went for a 4.h-and-1 at their own 34-yard line and Johnson ripped off an 18-yard run. Palmer then hit J.J. Nelson (1-42) for a 42-yard touchdown strike just after the 2-minute warning a few plays later. With forty seconds remaining, D.J. Swearinger blitzed to force a pass off the mark, and it was picked off by Patrick Peterson to clinch the Cardinals' win.    Palmer played very well, completing 30-of-46 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Fitzgerald continues to rewrite the record books as he totaled 9 catches for 91 yards.    David Johnson was the big star for the Arizona offense with 18 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Through the air, he had 9 receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown.    Cousins was 21-of-37 for 271 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He added a rushing touchdown. Garcon led the Redskins in receiving with 78 yards on 7 receptions.

To open the third quarter, Cousins threw a beautiful 59-yard pass to DeSean Jackson (his only catch), who ran by Tyvon Branch down the middle of the field to get inside the 10-yard line. Cousins was able to dive into the end zone on third-and-goal to get the Redskins a 13-10 lead. A Trent Murphy sack led to Arizona missing a 53-yard field goal. However, Calais Campbell strip-sacked Cousins and Markus Golden returned the fumble to the Redskins' 10-yard line. Carson Palmer then fired a fastball to Michael Floyd (3-18-1) for the score and a 17-13 lead. Cousins struck back with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder (3-42-1), who beat Tony Jefferson to get wide open. Arizona responded by ripping the ball down the field quickly and scored with a 25-yard pass to Johnson. The Redskins countered with a field goal to make it 24-23 Arizona midway through the 4.h quarter. The Cardinals went for a 4.h-and-1 at their own 34-yard line and Johnson ripped off an 18-yard run. Palmer then hit J.J. Nelson (1-42) for a 42-yard touchdown strike just after the 2-minute warning a few plays later. With forty seconds remaining, D.J. Swearinger blitzed to force a pass off the mark, and it was picked off by Patrick Peterson to clinch the Cardinals' win.

   "comment":"David Johnson. He caught a couple of passes to get the team into field-goal range. Chandler Catanzaro tried to kick the game winner. His 43-yarder was good, and that ended the contest. Though the win will hurt their draft positioning, the Cardinals have to be happy with their performance. They played a complete game against 1 of the best defenses in the NFL, and Carson Palmer put together a solid showing.    Palmer compiled 1 of the best games of his entire season. He went 16-of-26 during the contest for 284 yards and a touchdown. Palmer was very accurate and was able to succeed despite seeing a lot of pressure. For the first time all year, he looked entirely comfortable in the pocket, and he was able to show his arm strength as well. Perhaps the best trait about Palmer is that he knows when to target certain players. He did not try to force anything today, and that was apparent by the fact that he did not log any turnovers. Palmer should build on this skill for next season, and perhaps he will be able to do that and get the Cardinals back to the postseason.    In the receiving corps, it was clear that the Cardinals were missing Michael Floyd. Though he had not been a major factor during the season, the team lacked a de facto No. 2 option. The leading receiver for the Cardinals was actually J.J. Nelson. The speedster had an early 80-yard touchdown catch, and later used his speed to nearly score another later on. He finished the day with 3 catches for 132 yards and appears to have taken over John Brown's role. Speaking of Brown, he only logged a single catch for 12 yards. Larry Fitzgerald (4-31) was also a major disappointment, though he dealt with Richard Sherman for a majority of the day. Fitzgerald also caught a key pass to set up Catanzaro's game winner.    David Johnson was absolutely terrific on the ground. Despite being stopped behind the line a number of times and committing a horrendous fumble, the second-year back continues to be 1 of the best dual-threat players in the league. During Saturday's contest, Johnson saw 28 carries and turned them into 95 yards. He also reeled in 4 passes for 41 yards. Almost all of that came on the final drive in regulation. He had an impressive burst in the 4.h quarter to help set up a Cardinals scoring drive, but his most impressive work came on the goal line. Overall, Johnson was able to score 3 touchdowns on Saturday. That not only gave his fantasy owners some holiday cheer, but it really allowed the Cardinals to do as they pleased in the red zone. Johnson was able to power through the tough Seahawks front every time the team got close. Even when he was stuffed at the line, his team kept coming back to him. The coaching staff obviously has faith in Johnson, and that will likely make him the top fantasy player for all formats next season.    For the Seahawks, this performance was a mix of highs and lows. In the first half, they could do nothing on offense, but played great defense. It was the exact opposite during the second half. One consistent aspect for them was the play of their starting quarterback Johnson. He caught a couple of passes to get the team into field-goal range.
