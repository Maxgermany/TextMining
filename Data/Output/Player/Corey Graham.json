   "comment":"Graham to snatch a nice-looking interception. The second was another weak-armed floater. No 1.s saying anything about it in the media because they're afraid to offend Lord Peyton - Michael Irvin even admitted that he was hesitant - but his arm seems to be sapped. Denver had an early bye - back in Week 4 - so it's possible that Manning could just be fatigued. Manning ultimately generated 173 yards. He was battling a tough defense and tried to get rid of the ball as quickly as a consequence, but that doesn't excuse the weak throws.    Because Manning didn't try to go deep very often - and struggled when he did - both "

   "comment":"Graham. He was all over the Arizona receivers and defended 3 passes, including multiple deep balls from Carson Palmer. Graham grabbed a crucial late interception that took away a scoring chance in the red zone. Graham also posted a sack and played an all-around great game.    For the Cardinals, this game was a massive disappointment. Carson Palmer was absolutely terrible, and his final numbers do not even tell the whole story. He finished the game 26-of-50 for 264 yards and a ridiculous 4 picks during the game. Palmer started the game horribly, and at 1 point, he was 2-of-10 for just 8 yards. As Walt would say, Brodie Croyle would scoff at that YPA of 0.8. Palmer threw behind receivers and constantly tried to force passes down field. His picks at the end of the game were careless, forced throws. He simply was off for the entirety of the game.    Because of Palmer's troubles, Arizona's receivers had trouble catching passes until garbage time. The team's Big Three of receivers ended up with solid numbers, but they were definitely skewed. "
