   "comment":"Julius Thomas, Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past 3 weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does 10. to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him 4 away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish 1 to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on 8 carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on 3 tries.    As mentioned, Caldwell was the 1 who found the end zone on both occasions, leaving Demaryius Thomas (4-45), Julius Thomas (4-49) and Decker (2-42) with meager numbers.    Denver's defense, meanwhile, couldn't do anything right. This includes... - Stopping the run. "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas in the 4.h quarter. Manning entered this contest with 47 touchdowns, and while his tying 50th was controversial - Eric Decker was clearly bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds, but the officials didn't want to ruin history - he still managed to come back and throw a final score to Thomas to officially pass his arch rival on the all-time list. Thanks to his final stat line - 32-of-51, 400 yards and 4 touchdowns - Manning is now 265 yards shy of Drew Brees' single-season record for passing yardage. He should be able to eclipse that mark as well; the Raiders will offer very little resistance next week, and Manning will have to play because the Patriots beat the Ravens, meaning Denver will have to triumph in Week 17 to secure homefield advantage, barring a New England loss to Buffalo.    However, all of this should be irrelevant. Manning has posted records and earned regular-season MVPs before, yet he's often come up short in the playoffs. His 2013 campaign will ultimately be measured by how successful he is beyond Week 17, meaning what happened in the first quarter of this contest is far more significant than Manning's flurry of touchdowns late in the game. On Houston's second possession, Von Miller went down with a knee injury. He would eventually walk off on his own power, but the Denver Post reported that the Broncos fear that the star linebacker tore his ACL. Miller will undergo tests on Monday. If he's out for the playoffs, it's highly unlikely that Manning will earn his second Super Bowl ring. As great as Manning has been this season, he probably won't be able to win if 1 of the league's best defensive players is sidelined.    Miller's absence didn't have much of an impact on this contest because Matt Schaub was just so completely inept. Schaub failed to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-37 for 176 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Schaub was a mess. He missed an open Andre Johnson (4-63) for a touchdown in the first half. One of his picks was completely lazy, as he tried to force something that just wasn't there while rolling out of the pocket. He also fumbled following intermission, but his tight end, Ryan Griffin (5-66), pounced on the ball.    Manning wasn't the only player to make history in this game. Andre Johnson became just the second player in NFL history to log 100-plus receptions in 5 or more seasons. Wes Welker was the first.    The Texans couldn't run the ball at all without Ben Tate. Dennis Johnson started, but did nothing, mustering just 29 yards on 12 carries.    Some stats/facts for the Broncos: - Manning wasn't picked, but Houston safety Shiloh Keo nearly had 2 interceptions. One was thrown right to his hands in the end zone, but he just dropped it. - Manning's aforementioned 4 touchdowns went to Decker (10-131), Demaryius Thomas (8-123) and Julius Thomas (6-78). Decker found the end zone on 2 occasions. - "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas for a gain of 21 along the sideline. Manning was also able to move the chains after hitting his target on a third-and-6. This allowed Denver to bleed the clock out, as all Rivers could do was stand on the sidelines and wave his arms in disgust.    Manning didn't post eye-popping numbers like he did on many occasions during the regular season, but he was able to convert clutch throws. He went 25-of-36 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns andan interception that wasn't his fault (the ball deflected off Eric Decker's chest to safety Darrell Stuckey in the end zone). Manning suffered through several drops, including that Decker screw-up. Wes Welker also had a potential touchdown clang off his arms. However, Manning got away with a couple of picks, including 1 where he floated a pass downfield on the opening drive. The San Diego defender had the ball simply fall through his arms. This was a blown opportunity for the Chargers, as Denver eventually found the end zone on that drive.    Manning's touchdowns went to Welker (6-38) and Demaryius Thomas (8-54). Julius Thomas led the team in receiving (6-76) though he also committed a drop and lost a fumble that led to a missed field goal (more on that later). Decker, meanwhile, barely did anything positive on offense (2-32), but had a great punt return that would've been a touchdown had he not tripped over his own 2 feet.    The Broncos ran the ball extremely well with both of their running backs. Knowshon Moreno tallied 82 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, while Montee Ball looked very powerful as he registered 52 yards on just 10 attempts. Denver's ability to pound the ball allowed it to control the clock - it won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 11 minutes - which is exactly how San Diego won the previous matchup between these teams. The Broncos simply gave the Chargers a taste of their own medicine.    San Diego was able to control the clock last time via the run. That was not the case in this contest, as a hobbled Ryan Mathews mustered just 26 yards on 5 carries (most of which came on a 16-yard scamper in which he was bottled up that was broken outside). Danny Woodhead led the team with 29 rushing yards on 9 attempts.    There were 3 themes for the Chargers in this game: 1. San Diego couldn't pass protect. "

He fumbled a ball, which made a lucky bounce right into a teammate's arms.

   "comment":"Julius Thomas in the end zone and then tripped over Orlando Franklin's leg and took a sack. However, on third down, Manning found Demaryius Thomas, who tapped both feet in before falling out of bounds. Thomas, for good measure, also reeled in 510, which was a 40-yard rainbow. Manning's final stat line looked like this: 22-of-26, 318 yards and the 4 touchdowns. He was on fire, and 1 of his 4 incompletions was dropped. It's impressive that he did this against a strong defense (albeit 1 that was missing Patrick Willis), and if he continues to play this way, no 1 will be able to beat him.    Demaryius Thomas, who found the end zone twice, logged 8 yards for 171 yards. He vastly outgained everyone else, including Welker (3-50, TD), Sanders (3-41, TD), who drew a pass-interference flag, and Julius Thomas (4-27).    Despite Manning throwing touchdowns left and right, there was still room for "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas overwhelmed the Oakland secondary, while Derek Carr and the Raiders' offense had no chance.    On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to Khalif Barnes. He fumbled the ball to Denver at the Oakland 18-yard line. Manning quickly produced another touchdown with a slant to Julius Thomas (6-63). Another touchdown pass to Thomas put the game away. Carr soon threw an interception to "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were Demaryius Thomas, C.J. Anderson and Wes Welker. Thomas led the team in receiving, catching 7 passes for 103 yards. He just barely outgained Sanders, who was having a huge afternoon before going down. Sanders snagged 5 balls for 102 yards and a deep touchdown when the Rams were caught offguard on a 4.h-and-10 in the second quarter just over midfield. Welker continued to do nothing; he had just 4 receptions for 28 yards to go along with a drop. Jacob Tamme, meanwhile, took over for Julius Thomas and was highly inefficient, converting just 4 of 10 targets for 31 yards.    As for Anderson, he struggled to find running lanes against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 29 yards on 9 carries. However, he was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 8 passes for 86 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the victors didn't melt down for once. Perhaps the difference was Shaun Hill replacing the inconsistent Austin Davis. Hill had some accuracy issues early on, completing a pass to "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas for a 29-yard touchdown. The Jaguars took a 14-10 lead, but after that, the Texans took over. Houston answered with Hopkins making a ridiculous 1.handed catch for 29 yards. A dumb 15-yard penalty on Jonathan Cyprien moved the ball to the 10-yard line, and Hoyer ended up throwing a bullet to Hopkins for a 9-yard touchdown. The Texans quickly got the ball back and struck again with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins. Bortles promptly threw a pick-six to Hal, who jumped the route and returned it 31 yards for a score. The game was essentially over after that play. In garbage time, Bortles threw a short touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, but the bad news was that Allen Robinson went down with a leg injury on that drive.    DeAndre Hopkins was the fantasy star of the game with 10 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. For some strange reason, the Jaguars resisted sending double coverage to Hopkins, who ate up man coverage.    Brian Hoyer completed 24-for-36 for 293 yards with 3 touchdowns. He played an efficient game for the Texans and was more steady than what they had received under Ryan Mallett.    Arian Foster finished with 53 yards on 18 carries. He did more damage through the air with 59 yards on 5 receptions and a touchdown. Foster had a fumble that Houston recovered.    Bortles was 30-of-53 for 331 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The Texans' pass rush rattled Bortles into a number of misguided throws.    With T.J. Yeldon out, the Jaguars' rushing attack was nonexistent. They were led by Toby Gerhart (9-26) and Denard Robinson (7-19).    Allen Robinson had 6 receptions for 86 yards and a score. His injury is worth monitoring for fantasy rosters. Allen Hurns (2-30) and Julius Thomas (7-78) each caught touchdowns.    The Texans' defense played their best game of the season. "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas for a 34-yard gain. Once again, the drive stalled for a field goal. Rivers answered by connecting with Stevie Johnson for 25 yards, which set up a Chargers field goal. San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line. Two plays later, Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson, but San Diego defended the onside kick to clinch its third win of the season.    Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.    Stevie Johnson led the Chargers with 7 receptions for 92 yards and a score. Antonio Gates had 4 receptions for 53 yards and 2 scores.    Melvin Gordon ran for 60 yards on 14 carries with 5 receptions for 20 yards.    Blake Bortles was 30-of-49 for 329 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He moved the ball well between the 20s, but struggled in the red zone.    T.J. Yeldon had 36 yards on 9 carries with 4 receptions for 46 yards. He was a huge disappointment in what appeared to be a great matchup.    Julius Thomas led the Jaguars through the air with 9 catches for 116 yards and a score. Allen Robinson had 5 receptions for 56 yards. In the 4.h quarter, Allen Hurns (4-42) suffered a scary head/neck injury after diving for a pass and had to be carted off the field.

The pummeling for Hasselbeck continued when he got shoved hard out of bounds by Telvin Smith. Charlie Whitehurst had to enter the game for a second time after Hasselbeck left the game with a rib injury. Whitehurst couldn't move the ball and overthrew on a 4.h-and-10 to give the Jaguars the ball near midfield. They moved the ball to the 2-yard line, from where Denard Robinson scored. Jonathan Cyprien went on to intercept Whitehurst around midfield and return it to the 1-yard line. Bortles leapt over the goal line on 4.h-and-goal to hang the Jaguars' 50th point on the Colts.    Bortles completed 16-of-30 for 250 yards with 3 touchdowns. He ran for 17 yards on 4 carries with a score. Hurns led the Jaguars through the air with 105 yards on 3 receptions and a score.

   "comment":"Julius Thomas for a touchdown and then getting flagged for intentional grounding on a play in which the Raiders were offside. Robinson, meanwhile, spent the afternoon dropping passes, while the special teams were guilty of a muffed punt. The Raiders, meanwhile, did just enough offensively to prevail. Derek Carr went 23-of-37 for 200 yards and a touchdown. He could've thrown a second score, but Clive Walford dropped the ball in the end zone. With the Raiders leading throughout, Carr didn't have to force the issue at all, so he effectively was just a game-manager in this contest, all while the Jaguars melted down in front of his very eyes.    Michael Crabtree was Oakland's only productive receiver in this contest. He caught 8 balls for 96 yards and the only touchdown Carr threw on the afternoon. Amari Cooper didn't do much - 4 catches, 29 yards - but that's because Ramsey was draped all over him.    Latavius Murray returned from injury, and while he didn't run particularly well - he gained 59 yards on 18 carries - he managed to find the end zone twice, rewarding those who were bold enough to start him in fantasy.    As for the Jaguars, I detailed their numerous blunders. Bortles was absolutely awful, and he doesn't seem to be progressing mentally. This was a concern for Bortles coming out of Central Florida, so it's not a surprise that he's regressing like this, despite the great offensive coaching he's been receiving. If Bortles can't ever develop into a consistent passer with Greg Olson aiding him, there might not be any hope. Bortles finished 23-of-43 for 246 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions, and even those pedestrian numbers were helped by garbage time. Bortles was just 5-of-14 for 57 yards and a pick in the first half. Oakland's pass defense has gotten better in recent weeks, but there's still no excuse for this.    Allen Robinson posted a miserable stat line, catching just 2 of his 8 targets for 9 yards. Robinson wasn't completely to blame for this, as Bortles constantly missed him on numerous basic throws. Robinson, as mentioned, was guilty of 2 drops. Allen Hurns (4-45) wasn't much better. Marquise Lee (7-107) was the grand-prize winner of the Blake Bortles Garbage Time Sweepstakes, while Julius Thomas (3-20) caught Bortles' sole touchdown, but would've secured another score had Bortles been accurate.

   "comment":"Julius Thomas, who didn't fight for the ball. Ken Crawley, starting for the disciplined P.J. Williams, snatched the pick. The Saints followed that up by moving into the red zone themselves, but they also screwed up. Zach Strief's hold forced a field goal, which was missed from 41 yards. Many mistakes were made throughout the opening half. Aside from all the penalties - there were 16 total prior to intermission - the Saints were guilty of a botched snap on third down. The Dolphins, meanwhile, were whistled for offensive pass interference, negating a first down. They also fumbled deep in their own territory, but were lucky to recover. The Saints cleaned up their act following intermission. By the time the game was 20-0, New Orleans outgained Miami in the second half, 217-25! The Dolphins couldn't sustain drives because of poor blocking and mistakes, while their defense whiffed on numerous tackles, allowing the Saints to convert several key third-and-longs.    Drew Brees was very sharp in the second half, going 16-of-20 for 171 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. His overall numbers were 29-of-41, 268 yards and the 2 scores. His touchdowns went to Michael Thomas (8-89) and Alvin Kamara (10-71), who happened to be the Saints' leading receivers. No other New Orleans player logged more than 31 receiving yards. Kamara is very interesting; he also rushed for 25 yards on 5 carries. Every time Mark Ingram or Adrian Peterson handled the ball, I wondered, Why isn't that Alvin Kamara? The rookie is such a special talent, and he's the best fit for what the Saints want to do offensively. New Orleans has a bye coming up, so I expect Kamara to be an even bigger part of the offense in Week 6 and beyond. Ingram (14-45) will still be in the mix), but Peterson (4-4) should be completely phased out, or even cut.    The dark cloud over the Saints' victories was a pair of injuries they suffered. Impressive rookie linebacker Alex Anzalone hurt his arm in the first quarter. More importantly, right tackle Zach Strief, who returned from injury this week, hurt his knee.    As for the Dolphins, Cutler was extremely impressive on the opening possession, as referenced earlier. However, he did absolutely nothing afterward. Cutler finished 20-of-28 for 164 yards and the aforementioned pick against 1 of the worst defenses in football that lost a starting linebacker in the early going. Cutler didn't play well, but this wasn't nearly all his fault. The line couldn't block, Julius Thomas didn't try, and Adam Gase came up with a horrible game plan, which includes a failed Wildcat play that Cutler hilariously didn't participate in, opting to stand still as the action was going on.
