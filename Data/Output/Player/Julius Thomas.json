An incredibly dumb un-sportsmanlike conduct penalty on Thomas (4-22). Jacksonville had a lot of opportunities for big plays go wasted. In the first quarter, the Jaguars dropped 2 potential interceptions. An incredibly dumb un-sportsmanlike conduct penalty on Andre Branch gave the Broncos a first down after they just been stopped on third down. Manning took advantage with a pass down the seam to Wes Welker (6-63) for a 20-yard touchdown. After the Jaguars got a field goal set up by Justin Blackmon, Manning fumbled a snap. Jacksonville recovered that for its second field goal. A bobbled field goal snap cost the Jaguars more points, but a few plays later Paul Posluszny made a fantastic leaping catch before racing down the field for a 59-yard pick-six. The 2.point conversion try was picked off by Champ Bailey, but the Broncos had only a 14-12 halftime lead. Denver came out in the third quarter with a nice drive that almost ended in a turnover from a Ronnie Hillman fumble, but Eric Decker (5-50) recovered the ball. The Broncos finished the drive by having Moreno plunge into the end zone. The Jaguars answered with a possession led by completions to Blackmon. Maurice Jones-Drew (21-71) ripped off a 28-yard run and ended it with a short touchdown run. Manning came back to hit Demaryius Thomas (3-78) along the sideline, and he had a great run after the catch for a 42-yard gain. That set up Moreno for an 8.yard touchdown run. A 34-yard fake punt by the Broncos had them deep in Jacksonville territory, but another fumbled snap by Manning was recovered by the Jaguars. "

   "comment":"Julius Thomas, Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past 3 weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does 10. to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him 4 away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish 1 to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on 8 carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on 3 tries.    As mentioned, Caldwell was the 1 who found the end zone on both occasions, leaving Demaryius Thomas (4-45), Julius Thomas (4-49) and Decker (2-42) with meager numbers.    Denver's defense, meanwhile, couldn't do anything right. This includes... - Stopping the run.

   "comment":"Julius Thomas in the 4.h quarter. Manning entered this contest with 47 touchdowns, and while his tying 50th was controversial - Eric Decker was clearly bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds, but the officials didn't want to ruin history - he still managed to come back and throw a final score to Thomas to officially pass his arch rival on the all-time list. Thanks to his final stat line - 32-of-51, 400 yards and 4 touchdowns - Manning is now 265 yards shy of Drew Brees' single-season record for passing yardage. He should be able to eclipse that mark as well; the Raiders will offer very little resistance next week, and Manning will have to play because the Patriots beat the Ravens, meaning Denver will have to triumph in Week 17 to secure homefield advantage, barring a New England loss to Buffalo.    However, all of this should be irrelevant. Manning has posted records and earned regular-season MVPs before, yet he's often come up short in the playoffs. His 2013 campaign will ultimately be measured by how successful he is beyond Week 17, meaning what happened in the first quarter of this contest is far more significant than Manning's flurry of touchdowns late in the game. On Houston's second possession, Von Miller went down with a knee injury. He would eventually walk off on his own power, but the Denver Post reported that the Broncos fear that the star linebacker tore his ACL. Miller will undergo tests on Monday. If he's out for the playoffs, it's highly unlikely that Manning will earn his second Super Bowl ring. As great as Manning has been this season, he probably won't be able to win if 1 of the league's best defensive players is sidelined.    Miller's absence didn't have much of an impact on this contest because Matt Schaub was just so completely inept. Schaub failed to complete half of his passes, going 18-of-37 for 176 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Schaub was a mess. He missed an open Andre Johnson (4-63) for a touchdown in the first half. One of his picks was completely lazy, as he tried to force something that just wasn't there while rolling out of the pocket. He also fumbled following intermission, but his tight end, Ryan Griffin (5-66), pounced on the ball.    Manning wasn't the only player to make history in this game. Andre Johnson became just the second player in NFL history to log 100-plus receptions in 5 or more seasons. Wes Welker was the first.    The Texans couldn't run the ball at all without Ben Tate. Dennis Johnson started, but did nothing, mustering just 29 yards on 12 carries.    Some stats/facts for the Broncos: - Manning wasn't picked, but Houston safety Shiloh Keo nearly had 2 interceptions. One was thrown right to his hands in the end zone, but he just dropped it. - Manning's aforementioned 4 touchdowns went to Decker (10-131), Demaryius Thomas (8-123) and Julius Thomas (6-78). Decker found the end zone on 2 occasions. - Thomas in the 4.h quarter. Manning entered this contest with 47 touchdowns, and while his tying 50th was controversial - Eric Decker was clearly bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds, but the officials didn't want to ruin history - he still managed to come back and throw a final score to Thomas to officially pass his arch rival on the all-time list.

This allowed Denver to bleed the clock out, as all Rivers could do was stand on the sidelines and wave his arms in disgust.    Manning didn't post eye-popping numbers like he did on many occasions during the regular season, but he was able to convert clutch throws. He went 25-of-36 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns andan interception that wasn't his fault (the ball deflected off Eric Decker's chest to safety Darrell Stuckey in the end zone). Manning suffered through several drops, including that Decker screw-up. Wes Welker also had a potential touchdown clang off his arms. However, Manning got away with a couple of picks, including 1 where he floated a pass downfield on the opening drive. The San Diego defender had the ball simply fall through his arms. This was a blown opportunity for the Chargers, as Denver eventually found the end zone on that drive.    Manning's touchdowns went to Welker (6-38) and Demaryius Thomas (8-54). Julius Thomas led the team in receiving (6-76) though he also committed a drop and lost a fumble that led to a missed field goal (more on that later). Decker, meanwhile, barely did anything positive on offense (2-32), but had a great punt return that would've been a touchdown had he not tripped over his own 2 feet.    The Broncos ran the ball extremely well with both of their running backs. Knowshon Moreno tallied 82 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, while Montee Ball looked very powerful as he registered 52 yards on just 10 attempts. Denver's ability to pound the ball allowed it to control the clock - it won the time-of-possession battle by nearly 11 minutes - which is exactly how San Diego won the previous matchup between these teams. The Broncos simply gave the Chargers a taste of their own medicine.    San Diego was able to control the clock last time via the run. That was not the case in this contest, as a hobbled Ryan Mathews mustered just 26 yards on 5 carries (most of which came on a 16-yard scamper in which he was bottled up that was broken outside).

   "comment":"Julius Thomas had a dominant outing. He caught 7 balls for 104 yards and 3 touchdowns, all of which occurred prior to intermission. This prompted my editor to comment, I think Julius Thomas has crashed ESPN's fantasy servers. Thomas made a couple of errors in the second half, however. He fumbled a ball, which made a lucky bounce right into a teammate's arms. He then dropped an onside kick recovery, but that didn't end up hurting the Broncos because Luck threw a subsequent interception.    Elsewhere for the Broncos, Thomas fell down in the red zone. Thomas struggled, catching 4 passes for 48 yards. He dropped a ball late in the game.    Unlike Demaryius Thomas, "

The Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and never relinquished possession. Russell Wilson converted first down after first down using both his arms and his legs. He marched Seattle all the way down the field and into the end zone. Manning never even had a chance in the extra session. What Manning did in the final minute was unbelievable, but he struggled mightily throughout the afternoon. He had issues with the crowd noise throughout the entire contest, and he simply didn't try to convert third-and-longs very much, settling for ineffective Montee Ball draws in those situations. His passes fluttered all over the place, some of which weren't even close to his intended targets. He also nearly threw a second interception - though it occurred prior to his actual 1 - as Kam Chancellor snagged a pass that just barely hit the ground. Chancellor would redeem himself later by securing what seemed to be a game-clinching pick in the red zone. However, Manning flipped the switch at the very end and gave his team a chance. He finished 31-of-49 for 303 yards, 2 touchdowns and that pick. Consider that Manning was just 11-of-16 for only 87 yards at intermission. Also, to be fair, Demaryius Thomas was hobbled with an injury throughout. He left the game briefly, but was never the same upon returning. It didn't help that he had to battle "

On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half. In the opening minute of the third quarter, Carr was getting sacked by multiple defenders and tossed the ball to Khalif Barnes. He fumbled the ball to Denver at the Oakland 18-yard line. Manning quickly produced another touchdown with a slant to Julius Thomas (6-63). Another touchdown pass to Thomas put the game away. Carr soon threw an interception to Thomas overwhelmed the Oakland secondary, while Derek Carr and the Raiders' offense had no chance.    On the second play of the game, Manning threw a wounded duck that floated too long in the middle of the field. D.J. Hayden tipped the ball to himself for an interception. Carr moved the ball from midfield to set up a 41-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. Manning promptly moved the ball down the field, but couldn't get enough on a throw as he faded back from Khalil Mack to miss short of a wide-open Ronnie Hillman (6-13) for a touchdown. The Raiders' defense came through with a stand to force a field goal. After another Denver field goal, Oakland's defense came up with a huge play. Defensive end Justin Tuck made a leaping deflection and caught the pass. He got up and rumbled for a few yards to the Broncos' 12-yard line. The Raiders took advantage, as Carr delivered a strike to Brice Butler for a 5-yard touchdown. Surprisingly, the Raiders had the lead at 10-6, but that was short lived. Late in the second quarter, Carr was pressured and made a bad decision, throwing a ball up for grabs in the middle of the field that was picked off by Bradley Roby. Denver took the lead when Manning threw a check-down pass to C.J. Anderson, who broke 4 tackles to jet down the field for a 51-yard touchdown. The Broncos got the ball back with 1:40 left before the half and had Anderson rip off 2 runs for 29 yards. Manning then tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders (5-67), who laid out for a diving touchdown reception. It was a great throw and catch by Manning and Sanders to give the Broncos a 20-10 lead at the half.

   "comment":"Julius Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury. Ball made a huge mistake by returning too early, as he re-injured his groin. Skill-position players often screw up by coming back prematurely as a result of player overconfidence, and Ball's arrogance has cost him. Thomas going down was huge, as he sprained his ankle after making a short catch in the first quarter. Things got worse when Emmanuel Sanders was knocked out with a concussion. The officials flagged Rodney McLeod on a helmet-to-helmet hit on the violent collision, but they made a mistake because it was shoulder-to-shoulder. It ultimately didn't matter because the Rams prevailed, but Sanders is now in the concussion protocol. He may not be able to play next week.    Despite the injuries, Manning racked up the yardage, going 34-of-54 for 389 yards and a touchdown. However, he threw a pair of interceptions; 1 was an inaccurate throw, while the other was forced into double coverage. The Rams did a great job of pressuring Manning, who has never had much success against 4.man rushes.    With Sanders, Thomas and Ball out, all Manning had at his disposal by the end of the game were Demaryius Thomas, C.J. Anderson and Wes Welker. Thomas led the team in receiving, catching 7 passes for 103 yards. He just barely outgained Sanders, who was having a huge afternoon before going down. Sanders snagged 5 balls for 102 yards and a deep touchdown when the Rams were caught offguard on a 4.h-and-10 in the second quarter just over midfield. Welker continued to do nothing; he had just 4 receptions for 28 yards to go along with a drop. Jacob Tamme, meanwhile, took over for Julius Thomas and was highly inefficient, converting just 4 of 10 targets for 31 yards.    As for Anderson, he struggled to find running lanes against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 29 yards on 9 carries. However, he was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 8 passes for 86 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the victors didn't melt down for once. Perhaps the difference was Shaun Hill replacing the inconsistent Austin Davis. Hill had some accuracy issues early on, completing a pass to Thomas were knocked out early on. Ball's absence only affected depth, as C.J. Anderson was expected to carry the load in the wake of Ronnie Hillman's injury.

Chris Ivory had only 26 yards on 23 carries with 2 touchdowns on the ground and 3 receptions for 22 yards. The Jaguars' front 7 was excellent against the run.    Eric Decker tallied 6 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars really struggled to cover Decker.

San Diego took 24-12 lead into the 4.h quarter. The Chargers struggled to defend Thomas as he scored on a 4.h-and-7 with a 21-yard strike from Bortles. After crossing midfield, Rivers converted a 4.h-and-seven with his legs. He had Jacksonville's defense on its heels and threw a short touchdown pass to Johnson. It was a 14-play, 80-yard drive that spanned over 6 minutes and broke the back of Jacksonville. With 90 seconds remaining, Jaguars rookie linebacker Hayes Pullard blocked a punt to set up the offense at the Chargers' 14-yard line.

Rivers completed 29-of-43 passes or 300 yards and 4 touchdowns with zero interceptions. He impressively bounced back after last week's brutal showing.

The Saints followed that up by moving into the red zone themselves, but they also screwed up. Zach Strief's hold forced a field goal, which was missed from 41 yards. Many mistakes were made throughout the opening half. Aside from all the penalties - there were 16 total prior to intermission - the Saints were guilty of a botched snap on third down. The Dolphins, meanwhile, were whistled for offensive pass interference, negating a first down. They also fumbled deep in their own territory, but were lucky to recover. The Saints cleaned up their act following intermission. By the time the game was 20-0, New Orleans outgained Miami in the second half, 217-25! The Dolphins couldn't sustain drives because of poor blocking and mistakes, while their defense whiffed on numerous tackles, allowing the Saints to convert several key third-and-longs.    Drew Brees was very sharp in the second half, going 16-of-20 for 171 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission. His overall numbers were 29-of-41, 268 yards and the 2 scores. His touchdowns went to Michael Thomas (8-89) and Alvin Kamara (10-71), who happened to be the Saints' leading receivers. No other New Orleans player logged more than 31 receiving yards. Kamara is very interesting; he also rushed for 25 yards on 5 carries. Every time Mark Ingram or Adrian Peterson handled the ball, I wondered, Why isn't that Alvin Kamara? The rookie is such a special talent, and he's the best fit for what the Saints want to do offensively. New Orleans has a bye coming up, so I expect Kamara to be an even bigger part of the offense in Week 6 and beyond. Ingram (14-45) will still be in the mix), but Peterson (4-4) should be completely phased out, or even cut.    The dark cloud over the Saints' victories was a pair of injuries they suffered. Impressive rookie linebacker Alex Anzalone hurt his arm in the first quarter. More importantly, right tackle Zach Strief, who returned from injury this week, hurt his knee.    As for the Dolphins, Cutler was extremely impressive on the opening possession, as referenced earlier. However, he did absolutely nothing afterward. Cutler finished 20-of-28 for 164 yards and the aforementioned pick against 1 of the worst defenses in football that lost a starting linebacker in the early going. Cutler didn't play well, but this wasn't nearly all his fault. The line couldn't block, Julius Thomas didn't try, and Adam Gase came up with a horrible game plan, which includes a failed Wildcat play that Cutler hilariously didn't participate in, opting to stand still as the action was going on.    Only Thomas, who didn't fight for the ball. Ken Crawley, starting for the disciplined P.J. Williams, snatched the pick. The Saints followed that up by moving into the red zone themselves, but they also screwed up. Zach Strief's hold forced a field goal, which was missed from 41 yards.
