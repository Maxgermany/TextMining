   "comment":"Johnathan Joseph ran under the ball for the interception. That turnover produced the only touchdown of the first half.    Wide receiver Devon Bess led Miami with 2 catches for 42 yards. Joseph ran under the ball for the interception. That turnover produced the only touchdown of the first half.    Wide receiver Devon Bess led Miami with 2 catches for 42 yards. Brandon Marshall had 2 receptions for 39 yards.    In the third quarter, the Dolphins put a good drive together. Thomas was effective with some good runs. Miami capped the possession with Henne tossing a 12-yard touchdown to Marshall. With Miami grabbing the momentum in the third quarter, Thomas gave it back to the Texans when he fumbled the ball away at midfield. Even though the Texans didn't produce points on that possession, the fumble stalled the Miami offense that had Houston on its heels.    Miami was unable to produce any more points against Houston. The Texan defense finished the game well with a good pass rush and better run defense. For the game, Henne was 12-of-30 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Henne was inaccurate on his passing, and his blocking had issues keeping pressure off of him. Thomas had his first 100-yard rushing game of his career with 107 yards on 18 carries. Bush finished the game with just 18 yards on 6 carries. Marshall finished the game with 79 yards on 6 receptions and a score.    Texans quarterback Matt Schaub had a strong first half. He was 16-of-22 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown. Arian Foster was kept in check by the Miami defense with only 33 yards on 10 carries. Foster re-injured his hamstring and the Texans kept him on the sideline in the second half.    Houston moved the ball through the air with wide receiver Andre Johnson. He caught 5 passes for 63 yards in the first half. Owen Daniels had 3 receptions for 25 yards and a touchdown. Schaub connected with Daniels from 4 yards out for the only touchdown in the first half after Henne's interception. Schaub and the passing game helped move the ball to get 3 field goals in the first half.    Ben Tate had 4 carries for 21 yards in the first half, but with Foster sidelined, Tate had a big second half. He ran downhill and did a good job of picking up yards after contact. Tate totaled 103 yards on 23 carries. It was unclear when Foster could return to the lineup.    After dropping a potential touchdown pass, Johnson came back to catch a 23-yard touchdown strike from Schaub. The Texans established Tate in the second half, and Schaub's job was pretty easy. He only threw 7 passes after halftime. He finished the game with 21-of-29 passes for 230 yards and 2 scores.    Johnson paced Houston with 7 receptions for 93 yards and 1 touchdown. Daniels did not record a reception in the second half. Jacoby Jones was second on the team with 3 catches for 48 yards.    The Texan defense showcased some good rushes from Williams, rookie J.J. Watt, Connor Barwin, and others. It wasn't all good for Joseph; after recording his interception, the former Bengal injured his ankle and did not return. Joseph was on the sideline and it looked more like a sprain or twist than a long-term injury.   "

   "comment":"Johnathan Joseph and Jared Crick had huge whiffs - allowing the Chiefs to score 2 touchdowns, extending their lead from 13-0 to 27-0 rather quickly. The Chiefs prevailed, but this was a classic example of a Pyrrhic victory. Jeremy Maclin went down with a knee injury in the third quarter. He was helped off the field and was seen crying on the sideline. It's possible that he may have torn his ACL, which is obviously terrible news for a Kansas City offense that has just 2 play-makers. Travis Kelce will be the only 1 remaining.    Alex Smith threw to Maclin just 4 times, with the receiver being able to catch 3 passes for 29 yards. The numbers are obviously meager, but Maclin still drew attention from the other players. Smith will have to result to throwing to third-round rookie Chris Conley instead. Conley caught a 9-yard touchdown in garbage time. Smith, meanwhile, went 17-of-22 for 190 yards, the score to Conley and an interception, which was behind his intended target. Smith also scrambled 5 times for 27 rushing yards. He did more of the same - he dinked and dunked for the most part. He took a deep shot early downfield to Albert Wilson, who torched first-round rookie Kevin Johnson, but he overthrew his receiver. Smith is not a good quarterback, despite ESPN gushing all over him, and he'll definitely be worse without his No. 1 receiver.    Being too mediocre to spread the ball around, Smith was able to connect with only 3 players on multiple occasions: Maclin, Travis Kelce (8-128) and Wilson (2-9). Kelce was guilty of a drop, but that was his only blemish on the afternoon. The Texans had absolutely no answer for Kelce. They tried to have various defenders cover him, yet no 1 had any sort of success.    The Chiefs ran the ball pretty well despite battling a Watt-led front for nearly 3 quarters. Spencer Ware shouldered most of the workload, gaining 67 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Charcandrick West managed just 26 yards on 8 tries. West was thrown to just once, catching a 9-yard pass.    Going back to the Texans, I wasn't exaggerating when I said Hoyer had such a bad game that it'll go down as 1 of the all-time worst playoff performances. It was apparent that Hoyer was in for a rough afternoon when he started by throwing behind Nate Washington and missing an open Cecil Shorts on the opening drive. He then began committing horrible turnovers. The first was hurled right to Eric Berry. The pass was inexplicable; it appeared as though Hoyer thought Berry was on his team - that's the only explanation. Hoyer then lost a fumble in field-goal range. The second pick was a back-breaker, as the Texans drove down to the 2-yard line. Instead of scoring a touchdown, Hoyer, being under pressure on second down, forced the issue. The third occurred on a horrible deep shot right before halftime, while the 4.h came at the end of the game on a putrid pass attempt. The sad thing is, Hoyer could've easily tossed more picks. Joseph and Jared Crick had huge whiffs - allowing the Chiefs to score 2 touchdowns, extending their lead from 13-0 to 27-0 rather quickly.

Travis Kelce will be the only 1 remaining.    Alex Smith threw to Maclin just 4 times, with the receiver being able to catch 3 passes for 29 yards. The numbers are obviously meager, but Maclin still drew attention from the other players. Smith will have to result to throwing to third-round rookie Chris Conley instead. Conley caught a 9-yard touchdown in garbage time. Smith, meanwhile, went 17-of-22 for 190 yards, the score to Conley and an interception, which was behind his intended target. Smith also scrambled 5 times for 27 rushing yards. He did more of the same - he dinked and dunked for the most part. He took a deep shot early downfield to Albert Wilson, who torched first-round rookie Kevin Johnson, but he overthrew his receiver. Smith is not a good quarterback, despite ESPN gushing all over him, and he'll definitely be worse without his No. 1 receiver.    Being too mediocre to spread the ball around, Smith was able to connect with only 3 players on multiple occasions: Maclin, Travis Kelce (8-128) and Wilson (2-9). Kelce was guilty of a drop, but that was his only blemish on the afternoon. The Texans had absolutely no answer for Kelce. They tried to have various defenders cover him, yet no 1 had any sort of success.    The Chiefs ran the ball pretty well despite battling a Watt-led front for nearly 3 quarters. Spencer Ware shouldered most of the workload, gaining 67 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Charcandrick West managed just 26 yards on 8 tries. West was thrown to just once, catching a 9-yard pass.    Going back to the Texans, I wasn't exaggerating when I said Hoyer had such a bad game that it'll go down as 1 of the all-time worst playoff performances. It was apparent that Hoyer was in for a rough afternoon when he started by throwing behind Nate Washington and missing an open Cecil Shorts on the opening drive. He then began committing horrible turnovers. The first was hurled right to Eric Berry. The pass was inexplicable; it appeared as though Hoyer thought Berry was on his team - that's the only explanation. Hoyer then lost a fumble in field-goal range. The second pick was a back-breaker, as the Texans drove down to the 2-yard line. Instead of scoring a touchdown, Hoyer, being under pressure on second down, forced the issue. The third occurred on a horrible deep shot right before halftime, while the 4.h came at the end of the game on a putrid pass attempt. The sad thing is, Hoyer could've easily tossed more picks. "
