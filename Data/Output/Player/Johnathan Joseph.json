Gus Johnson and his broadcasting partner actually questioned whether or not Cincinnati quit in the second half. Meanwhile, Facebook friend Todd K. posted the following: <i> Do you want to apologize to Ryan Fitzpatrick now? I don't think you understand the irascible intangibles of Paddy Power. If Andrew Luck was playing he would be thinking about his cold toes, down 28-7. Anyway, Ryan and I are waiting. He likes fruit baskets. </i> Fitzpatrick was amazing in the second half, going 21-of-34 for 316 yards, 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned dual interceptions. However, he still has major physical limitations, and it's highly doubtful that he would have been able to accomplish this against a defense that wasn't horrible and hadn't quit.    Three of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns went to "

Despite a lot of positive press about Bortles and the Jaguars' regime, the jury is clearly still out on whether the organization is actually headed in the right direction.    Keenum was 25-of-35 for 250 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Andre Johnson had maybe his best game of the season with 10 catches for 134 yards and a touchdown. "

   "comment":"Johnathan Joseph led a strong game from the secondary. Mercilus had 5 tackles, 3.5 sacks and a forced fumble. Playing without a cast on his broken hand, Watt had an insane performance and stat line. He totaled 8 tackles, 3 sacks, 2 batted passes, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and 2 tackles for a loss in the ground game. He also drew some holding calls. It was the epitome of a defensive lineman dominating a game from start to finish.    There was a huge loss that hit Houston in this game, though. At the end of the first quarter, the Texans suffered a devastating injury as left tackle "

   "comment":"Johnathan Joseph and Jared Crick had huge whiffs - allowing the Chiefs to score 2 touchdowns, extending their lead from 13-0 to 27-0 rather quickly. The Chiefs prevailed, but this was a classic example of a Pyrrhic victory. Jeremy Maclin went down with a knee injury in the third quarter. He was helped off the field and was seen crying on the sideline. It's possible that he may have torn his ACL, which is obviously terrible news for a Kansas City offense that has just 2 play-makers. Travis Kelce will be the only 1 remaining.    Alex Smith threw to Maclin just 4 times, with the receiver being able to catch 3 passes for 29 yards. The numbers are obviously meager, but Maclin still drew attention from the other players. Smith will have to result to throwing to third-round rookie Chris Conley instead. Conley caught a 9-yard touchdown in garbage time. Smith, meanwhile, went 17-of-22 for 190 yards, the score to Conley and an interception, which was behind his intended target. Smith also scrambled 5 times for 27 rushing yards. He did more of the same - he dinked and dunked for the most part. He took a deep shot early downfield to Albert Wilson, who torched first-round rookie Kevin Johnson, but he overthrew his receiver. Smith is not a good quarterback, despite ESPN gushing all over him, and he'll definitely be worse without his No. 1 receiver.    Being too mediocre to spread the ball around, Smith was able to connect with only 3 players on multiple occasions: Maclin, Travis Kelce (8-128) and Wilson (2-9). Kelce was guilty of a drop, but that was his only blemish on the afternoon. The Texans had absolutely no answer for Kelce. They tried to have various defenders cover him, yet no 1 had any sort of success.    The Chiefs ran the ball pretty well despite battling a Watt-led front for nearly 3 quarters. Spencer Ware shouldered most of the workload, gaining 67 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Charcandrick West managed just 26 yards on 8 tries. West was thrown to just once, catching a 9-yard pass.    Going back to the Texans, I wasn't exaggerating when I said Hoyer had such a bad game that it'll go down as 1 of the all-time worst playoff performances. It was apparent that Hoyer was in for a rough afternoon when he started by throwing behind Nate Washington and missing an open Cecil Shorts on the opening drive. He then began committing horrible turnovers. The first was hurled right to Eric Berry. The pass was inexplicable; it appeared as though Hoyer thought Berry was on his team - that's the only explanation. Hoyer then lost a fumble in field-goal range. The second pick was a back-breaker, as the Texans drove down to the 2-yard line. Instead of scoring a touchdown, Hoyer, being under pressure on second down, forced the issue. The third occurred on a horrible deep shot right before halftime, while the 4.h came at the end of the game on a putrid pass attempt. The sad thing is, Hoyer could've easily tossed more picks. "

Hogan finished 20-of-37 for an embarrassingly low 140 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. I wrote last week that DeShone Kizer needed to be benched for a few weeks. I thought Cody Kessler should get the nod, so I'm not sure what Hue Jackson was thinking by starting Hogan. It does not appear as though Hogan belongs in the NFL, even as a third-string signal-caller. He needs to prepare to become a college football analyst of some sort because he's not going to be in the NFL much longer.    "
