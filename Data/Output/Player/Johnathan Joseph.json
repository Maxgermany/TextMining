   "comment":"Joseph, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown.    OK... as you can tell by the score, the Bills mounted an improbable comeback and actually blew out the Bengals. Gus Johnson and his broadcasting partner actually questioned whether or not Cincinnati quit in the second half. Meanwhile, Facebook friend Todd K. posted the following: Do you want to apologize to Ryan Fitzpatrick now? I don't think you understand the irascible intangibles of Paddy Power. If Andrew Luck was playing he would be thinking about his cold toes, down 28-7. Anyway, Ryan and I are waiting. He likes fruit baskets. Fitzpatrick was amazing in the second half, going 21-of-34 for 316 yards, 4 touchdowns and the aforementioned dual interceptions. However, he still has major physical limitations, and it's highly doubtful that he would have been able to accomplish this against a defense that wasn't horrible and hadn't quit.    Three of Fitzpatrick's touchdowns went to "

   "comment":"Joseph ran under the ball for the interception. That turnover produced the only touchdown of the first half.    Wide receiver Devon Bess led Miami with 2 catches for 42 yards. Brandon Marshall had 2 receptions for 39 yards.    In the third quarter, the Dolphins put a good drive together. Thomas was effective with some good runs. Miami capped the possession with Henne tossing a 12-yard touchdown to Marshall. With Miami grabbing the momentum in the third quarter, Thomas gave it back to the Texans when he fumbled the ball away at midfield. Even though the Texans didn't produce points on that possession, the fumble stalled the Miami offense that had Houston on its heels.    Miami was unable to produce any more points against Houston. The Texan defense finished the game well with a good pass rush and better run defense. For the game, Henne was 12-of-30 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Henne was inaccurate on his passing, and his blocking had issues keeping pressure off of him. Thomas had his first 100-yard rushing game of his career with 107 yards on 18 carries. Bush finished the game with just 18 yards on 6 carries. Marshall finished the game with 79 yards on 6 receptions and a score.    Texans quarterback Matt Schaub had a strong first half. He was 16-of-22 for 170 yards with 1 touchdown. Arian Foster was kept in check by the Miami defense with only 33 yards on 10 carries. Foster re-injured his hamstring and the Texans kept him on the sideline in the second half.    Houston moved the ball through the air with wide receiver Andre Johnson. He caught 5 passes for 63 yards in the first half. Owen Daniels had 3 receptions for 25 yards and a touchdown. Schaub connected with Daniels from 4 yards out for the only touchdown in the first half after Henne's interception. Schaub and the passing game helped move the ball to get 3 field goals in the first half.    Ben Tate had 4 carries for 21 yards in the first half, but with Foster sidelined, Tate had a big second half. He ran downhill and did a good job of picking up yards after contact. Tate totaled 103 yards on 23 carries. It was unclear when Foster could return to the lineup.    After dropping a potential touchdown pass, Johnson came back to catch a 23-yard touchdown strike from Schaub. The Texans established Tate in the second half, and Schaub's job was pretty easy. He only threw 7 passes after halftime. He finished the game with 21-of-29 passes for 230 yards and 2 scores.    Johnson paced Houston with 7 receptions for 93 yards and 1 touchdown. Daniels did not record a reception in the second half. Jacoby Jones was second on the team with 3 catches for 48 yards.    The Texan defense showcased some good rushes from Williams, rookie J.J. Watt, Connor Barwin, and others. It wasn't all good for Joseph; after recording his interception, the former Bengal injured his ankle and did not return. Joseph was on the sideline and it looked more like a sprain or twist than a long-term injury.   "

Hogan finished 20-of-37 for an embarrassingly low 140 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. I wrote last week that DeShone Kizer needed to be benched for a few weeks. I thought Cody Kessler should get the nod, so I'm not sure what Hue Jackson was thinking by starting Hogan. It does not appear as though Hogan belongs in the NFL, even as a third-string signal-caller. He needs to prepare to become a college football analyst of some sort because he's not going to be in the NFL much longer.    "
