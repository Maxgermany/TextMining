   "comment":"Taylor (12-40 rushing, 2-19 receiving). In the second quarter, Michael Floyd (3-47) beat Tarell Brown for a jump ball and coasted into the end zone for a 33-yard score. The Raiders answered, as Derek Carr hit Brice Butler for a 55-yard reception inside Arizona's 10-yard line. A few plays later, Darren McFadden (14-48) plunged into the end zone. The Raiders had a chance to tie it up quickly as a few plays after McFadden's score when Cardinals tight end John Carlson deflected an inaccurate Palmer pass up in the air and Charles Woodson picked it off. He returned it 27 yards to the Arizona 13-yard line. That was the first Cardinals interception this season, but Oakland settled for a field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders narrowed the lead to 1 point with a field goal drive, led by runs to McFadden and a few passes. The Cardinals answered with a drive featuring Andre Ellington, and Taylor finished the possession with another short touchdown run. The Raiders had some decent drives that fizzled because of penalties, receivers not getting open and poor execution by the offensive line. Late in the 4.h quarter, Arizona tacked on another field goal to ice the win.    Palmer completed 22-of-31 for 253 yards with 2 scores and an interception. "

The 136 yards on the ground made absolutely no sense, as the Rams had limited 4 of their previous 5 opponents to 66 rushing yards or fewer. Marginal talents like Williams and Taylor shouldn't be gaining nearly 5 yards per carry, but that's exactly what happened Thursday night.
