   "comment":"Cooley. Washington has yet to score 30 points under Zorn, and it's not hard to see why.    Zorn almost made a huge gaff in this game. Up 9-7 with 2 minutes remaining in regulation, Zorn went for it on 4th-and-1 on the St. Louis 5, eschewing a field goal. The Redskins failed, so all the Rams needed was a field goal to win. Fortunately for Washington, Marc Bulger couldn't convert a single first down.    Campbell needs to get the ball more to Santana Moss. Moss once again had a lackluster performance, catching just 3 balls for 35 yards. Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.    Two guys who didn't disappoint were "

Pittsburgh's early advantage forced the Redskins to abandon the ground attack, which was big because Alfred Morris was able to find plenty of running room with his limited opportunities. Morris rushed for 59 yards on 13 attempts.    Meanwhile, the Steelers, as mentioned, couldn't be stopped. Ben Roethlisberger was a machine, particularly on third down, converting nearly all of his attempts in the first half. He also led the team into the end zone on 4.h-and-inches at the goal line of the opening drive. Big Ben went 24-of-33 for 222 yards and 3 touchdowns. That completion percentage is especially impressive considering that he endured at least 3 drops, including 1 by "
