   "comment":"Gunter and Swearinger all recorded sacks for Arizona. Goff is going to be a huge project for Los Angeles' new coaching staff, but with how bad he looked as a rookie, it wouldn't be at all surprising if he ends up being a bust.    Gurley ran for 40 yards on 14 carries plus made 4 receptions for 37 yards. Playing in what he previous described as a middle-school offense, Gurley was the Rams' leading receiver against Arizona. "
