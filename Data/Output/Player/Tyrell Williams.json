   "comment":"Williams slants. The Colts were able to take over, however, and because of a concussion Brandon Flowers sustained, they scored on a 63-yard touchdown to T.Y. Hilton, who blew by 2 San Diego defenders to score a 63-yard, go-ahead touchdown. The Chargers still had a chance to re-take the lead, but Hunter Henry fumbled near midfield, giving Indianapolis its first victory. Though the Colts prevailed, it didn't seem like they should have won. They made numerous mistakes throughout the afternoon. Frank Gore started by dropping a pass. Dwayne Allen did the same thing in the end zone. Andrew Luck was strip-sacked, and the Chargers returned the turnover for a touchdown. And on 1 drive, they had so many penalties that they were stuck in a second-and-40. The Colts couldn't get anything going offensively in the second half prior to that long Hilton touchdown, save for a score that only occurred because of a bogus pass interference call on Adrian Phillips, which should've gone the other way. The CBS color analyst agreed, pining for offensive pass interference on the play.    Luck finished with a great stat line of 24-of-37 for 331 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception, plus the aforementioned fumble. He didn't play up to that stat line, however, especially in the second half. He was the beneficiary of Flowers' concussion and the poor play of Jason Verrett, who inexplicably struggled in this contest after a strong start to his 2016 campaign.    Hilton finished with a huge stat line, as he caught 8 balls for 174 yards and a touchdown. He blew right by San Diego's slow-looking defense on the 63-yard decisive score, but his best play came earlier in the second half when he somehow tapped both feet inbounds while falling out of play on a 33-yard reception.    As for Luck's other weapons, Phillip Dorsett was a disappointment, catching 3 passes for 27 yards. Jack Doyle (6-65) and Dwayne Allen (3-35) picked up the slack with Donte Moncrief being out. Allen, as mentioned, dropped a touchdown.    Right after Allen missed out on a score, Frank Gore took advantage with an end zone trip of his own. He gained 82 yards and the touchdown on 21 carries. Robert Turbin (4-9) vultured a score. The Colts may have run the ball better had guard Jack Mewhort not sustained an injury in the second half.    The Chargers gave this game away at the end, but they also made some mistakes earlier in the afternoon. An unsportsmanlike penalty allowed the Colts to turn an early field goal into a touchdown. Philip Rivers missed an open Dexter McCluster for a score. Rivers was then strip-sacked when his backup left tackle was beaten badly, and this occurred 1 play after a poor pass on a terrificly designed screen. Travis Benjamin was guilty of an error later, dropping a crucial third down. The real killers occurred at the end, however.    Rivers had a great game outside of the few blunders, finishing 26-of-39 for 330 yards. He was borderline unstoppable in the second half, going 18-of-23 for 224 yards following the break. Rivers, as mentioned, figured out that the Colts could not stop the slant to Tyrell Williams, who ended up catching 6 balls for 69 yards.    Rivers did manage to spread the ball around, as 3 players in addition to Williams caught at least 4 players. They were Travis Benjamin (4-82), Hunter Henry (5-76) and "

   "comment":"Williams for a 29-yard touchdown after he beat David Amerson and Nelson to get open on a post route. The Raiders answered with a field goal drive, but Rivers hit Travis Benjamin on the sideline, and he exploded down field for a 54-yard gain to set up a San Diego field goal. Just before the half, Rivers threw a ball up for grabs and it was picked off by Karl Joseph - the first NFL interception for the rookie. Oakland turned that into a 56-yard field goal from Janikowski to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-9 before the half. To open the third quarter, Rivers found Hunter Henry in busted coverage for a 59-yard gain. Rivers then hit a checkdown to Melvin Gordon, who coasted into the end zone from 18 yards out. Oakland answered with Amari Cooper's first touchdown of the year as he burned Adrian Phillips for a 64-yard touchdown. San Diego responded with a 50-yard pass to Williams and a 24-yard run by Gordon to the 1-yard line. Rivers then hit Henry, who was wide open, for the touchdown. After a field goal drive by the Raiders cut the lead to 24-19, fumbles struck San Diego again with Gordon coughing the ball up. Joseph recovered the loose ball to set up the Raiders at the Chargers' 38-yard line. On fourth-and-2, Carr made San Diego pay with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and then a 2-point conversion to Amari Cooper. That gave the Raiders a 27-24 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Chargers punter "

   "comment":"Williams (6-70) and Dontrelle Inman (4-51) were the top traditional receivers on the day. Both were solid and should be integral parts of the San Diego offense next year. Ronnie Hillman (3-50) was great at catching passes out of the backfield.    The rushing attack for the Chargers actually featured a surprising leader. Andre Williams, signed off of the practice squad earlier this season, got a lion's share of the carries. With injuries to Melvin Gordon and Kenneth Farrow, Williams saw 18 carries and managed to turn them into 87 yards. He ran with some great physicality and looked to be in better shape than he was with the Giants. Perhaps he will be a backup for the Chargers in 2017. Hillman, meanwhile, also saw some carries, and showed some change-of-pace ability. He finished the day with 41 yards on 7 carries.    The Chargers got some great play out of some of their defensive stars. "
