   "comment":"Jacob Tamme (6-50) and Willis McGahee (5-51 receiving) contributed as well.    Demaryius Thomas (9-188) had a phenomenal game for Denver, aside from his fumble, and overwhelmed the Patriots defensive backs with some highlight-reel catches. One was a 30-yard 1.handed grab. He had a leaping 45-yard reception, too, beating double coverage downfield. Manning went downfield to Thomas late in the 4.h quarter on a 4.h-and-short. He made the catch on his knees for 28 yards. Manning finished 31-of-44 for 345 yards and 3 touchdowns.    McGahee (14-51) had a clunker of a game with a bad dropped pass on a 4.h down that would've gone for a first down and a fumble late in the 4.h quarter after getting hit by Ninkovich. The fumble was inside the red zone and ended the Broncos' comeback attempt.    Denver's defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and head coach John Fox have to fix their defense. There are too many big windows in the secondary and the gap integrity of the front 7 has to get better. These big deficits from the defense could prove to be the Achilles' heel that keeps the Broncos out of the playoffs.   "

As for Anderson, he struggled to find running lanes against St. Louis' stout ground defense, mustering just 29 yards on 9 carries. However, he was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 8 passes for 86 receiving yards.    Meanwhile, the victors didn't melt down for once. Perhaps the difference was Shaun Hill replacing the inconsistent Austin Davis. Hill had some accuracy issues early on, completing a pass to "
