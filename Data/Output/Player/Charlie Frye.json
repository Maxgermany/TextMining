   "comment":"Charlie Frye) at quarterback? </i> Check out Seattle's second-half possessions: First drive: Three-and-out, net total minus-5 yards. Second drive: Three-and-out, net total zero yards. Third drive: Three-and-out, net total minus-3 yards. Fourth drive: Interception on the third play. Fifth drive: Interception on the fifth play.    Frye was so awesome on Sunday that he threw for just 83 yards and 2 interceptions. Hey, at least he didn't fumble. Frye actually tossed 2 touchdowns, but his YPA of 3.6 is depressing.    Only 1 offensive player on the Seahawks is worth noting in a positive manner. "
