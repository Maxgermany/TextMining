Frye was so awesome on Sunday that he threw for just 83 yards and 2 interceptions. Hey, at least he didn't fumble. Frye actually tossed 2 touchdowns, but his YPA of 3.6 is depressing.

   "comment":"Charlie Frye left the game with an injury. I laughed as JaMarcus Russell put down his Skittles packet and donned his helmet. My survivor pick was safe. Or so I thought. Captain Skittles to the rescue! JaMarcus Russell did some stupid stuff when he entered the game. He took a sack and fumbled the ball. He even left for a play in which J.P. Losman looked completely helpless. But Russell came back and hit some clutch throws on the final drive, leading the Raiders to an improbable touchdown and victory. Survivor pick debacled. Well, it was a nice run. If it takes Captain Skittles to beat me, so be it.    Captain Skittles was 5-of-11 for 47 yards and that game-winning touchdown to Chaz Schilens. Charlie Frye, meanwhile, was 9-of-17 for 68 yards and a pick. He also had a 26-yard scramble. Those numbers look pretty bad, but the team played hard under Frye.    The Raiders were able to give themselves a chance to win by pounding the rock. Frye left the game with an injury. I laughed as JaMarcus Russell put down his Skittles packet and donned his helmet.
