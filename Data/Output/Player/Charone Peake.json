   "comment":"Charone Peake on third down. Fitzpatrick, however, finished 9-of-14 for 120 yards and a score. He made some mistakes - he took a sack to knock the team out of field-goal range and was whistled for a delay of game - but he was uncharacteristically sharp. It should be noted that the Ravens didn't have half of their defense on the field and couldn't generate any sort of pass rush as a result, so it's not like the Jets should suddenly have hope in Fitzpatrick. Still, it would be a surprise if Fitzpatrick didn't start the next game.    One key Baltimore defender who was still on the field despite coming into the game as very questionable was cornerback "
