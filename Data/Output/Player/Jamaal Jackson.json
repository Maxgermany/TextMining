   "comment":"Jamaal Jackson tore his bicep. Inside linebacker Jackson tore his bicep. Inside linebacker Stewart Bradley endured a concussion. Kevin Kolb suffered a similar fate later on. And for the Packers, Ryan Grant left the game with an ankle injury. Both Kolb and Grant are in danger of missing their Week 2 games.    Thanks in part to immense pressure in his face, Kolb was awful in the season opener, going just 5-of-10 for 24 yards before getting knocked out of the game. QB Dog Killer entered afterward, and caught an unprepared Packers defense off-guard by rushing for 103 yards on 11 carries. The Packers didn't prepare to defend QB Dog Killer going into the contest, so don't buy the deranged psychopath's performance.    With Kolb out or struggling, none of Philadelphia's receivers did much. DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin each had 4 catches for 30 and 38 yards, respectively, with Maclin scoring once."
