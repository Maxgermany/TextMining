   "comment":"Isaac Redman ran the ball 10 times for 28 yards.    After the first drive, Tennessee's offense struggled to maintain possession of the ball. The Steeler defense played well with a number of pass breakups. They bottled up Johnson and got some sacks of Hasselbeck. They held Hasselback to 8-of-14 for 76 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Johnson ran the ball for 42 yards on 10 carries. Wide receiver Damien Williams had 42 yards on 4 receptions.    In the third quarter, the Steelers produced another scoring drive that ended with a short touchdown pass to Ward. Down 28-3, Hasselbeck and the Titans moved into the hurry-up offense. They were aided by a catch to Jared Cook that was actually an incompletion. The Titans capped the drive with Johnson's first touchdown of the season from 1.yard out. After the score, the Titans executed a nice onside kick that was recovered by cornerback "
