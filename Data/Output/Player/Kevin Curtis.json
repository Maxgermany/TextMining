   "comment":"Curtis, meanwhile, paced the team in receiving yardage (4 catches, 122 yards).    I mentioned the awful officiating earlier. The most glaring error occurred on a second-quarter kickoff by the Eagles. The referees claimed the ball went out of bounds, when it was clearly evident that it was nowhere near the white chalk. Instead of giving the Cardinals the ball (they recovered it at the Philadelphia 35), official Walt Anderson awarded the Eagles possession. Arizona tried challenging it, but Anderson, perhaps scared that his 5-unit bet on the Eagles wouldn't cash, claimed that the play wasn't reviewable. First of all, why isn't this reviewable? There's no reason for it not to be. Roger Goodell needs to stop suspending everyone in the league and change this rule. Second, when you're refereeing a championship game like this, you can't screw up easy calls like that. If a play isn't reviewable, you have to talk about it with the other zebras and get the call right. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "
