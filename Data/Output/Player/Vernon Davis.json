Singletary said that Davis would be more of use to him in the shower than on the field. I have to agree, though Davis' hands are so bad he's a candidate to bobble his bar of soap in the shower, resulting in a pretty awkward situation.    A great quote from Singletary, speaking of Davis' attitude: I would rather play with 10 people ... rather than play with 11 when that person is not sold out to be part of this team. Bravo. If Davis doesn't turn his attitude around quickly, the 49ers should cut their losses so that he can go ruin another organization.    Moving on, "

The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that "

The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis, but 2 things stick out to me. First, he had an open Kyle Williams downfield for a long touchdown in the second quarter, but overthrew him by about 5 yards. Second, Smith couldn't convert a third down to save his life. He was 1-of-13 in those situations, with the only positive result coming right at the very end of regulation when the Giants allowed him to complete a pass well short of the end zone. I don't want you to think that Smith is a lost cause or anything. He made great strides this year, and it wouldn't be fair to dismiss him because of this loss, especially after his late-game heroics versus New Orleans. He deserves a chance with more than 1 weapon to throw to. Vernon Davis was a monster again (3-112, 2 TDs), but no other Niner receiver or tight end did anything. "

Davis (2 catches, 8 yards) was hit cheaply in the back and had to leave the game, which was horrible news for Kaepernick, who has never played well without his prized tight end. However, Kaepernick overcame Davis' absence and was able to lead his team on several second-half scoring drives to lead his team to victory.    Michael Crabtree also got hurt. He suffered a foot injury, but was able to shake it off, save for a dropped pass. He tied Anquan Boldin with 5 catches each, with Boldin outgaining him, 62-43. "

Anquan Boldin remains Kaepernick's favorite target, as he threw it his way 10 times, of which he caught 6 of them for 60 yards and a touchdown, and also had an uncharacteristic drop near the end zone. Boldin will need similar game scripts to be a force in fantasy, but he will, at least, lead the 49ers in targets.    Both defenses in this game were poor statistically, but the Steelers got after Kaepernick, sacking him 5 times, and didn't let the 49ers score a touchdown until the 4.h quarter.    The 49ers were coming off a good home win on Monday night and traveling cross-country to Pittsburgh, while the Steelers were coming off a 10-day rest and a loss to the Patriots.

   "comment":"Vernon Davis had worse performances. Sanders caught just 2 passes for 17 yards and was guilty of a muffed punt. Davis snatched 7 balls for 74 yards, but spent the majority of the time running the wrong way in the first half. He also had a game-ending drop that would've picked up about 40 yards and put the team into field-goal range.    The Broncos couldn't run the ball whatsoever. Ronnie Hillman mustered just 20 yards on 12 carries. C.J. Anderson's power was missed on some failed short-yardage conversions.    The Raiders, meanwhile, had some offensive struggles themselves. I mentioned that they recorded minus-12 yards of offense by halftime. Derek Carr looked completely helpless. He had immense issues dealing with the pressure, forcing some poor passes. For example, he overthrew a wide-open Amari Cooper because he felt like he had to rush the throw. By halftime, Carr was just 2-of-8 for 7 yards. Yeah, it was that bad. Oakland had better success after intermission, as the line began giving Carr more time. Carr ultimately finished 12-of-29 for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns. He still had some blunders, including taking a sack to move the team out of field-goal range, but he was definitely sharper after halftime, so Jack Del Rio and his staff needs to be given credit for making the proper adjustments.    Amari Cooper had a disappointing performance. He was targeted 8 times, but didn't catch a single pass, thanks to Aqib Talib's terrific coverage. Cooper dropped a ball, but also had bad luck. As mentioned, Carr missed him for a deep connection. Later, Talib grabbed Cooper by the throat in the end zone, yet the officials didn't throw a flag for some reason.    Carr's touchdowns went to Mychael Rivers (3-49) and Seth Roberts (2-20). Like Cooper, Michael Crabtree struggled, catching 4 balls for only 19 yards.    Latavius Murray had no running room, mustering just 27 yards on 16 carries. Murray appeared to score a touchdown at 1 point, but the play was nullified by a false start.    Sebastian Janikowski needs to get his act together. He whiffed on a 43-yard try, which would've been costly had Vernon Davis not dropped a crucial ball. Janikowski has secretly been a choke artist, though no 1 knows that because the Raiders haven't been good for a long time. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

The end of this game was a nail-biter, as Roethlisberger threw an inexplicable interception in clock-killing mode, but the Steelers' defense, as they had done all second half, tightened up and stopped the Denver offense. Then, on third down, when the Steelers needed a first down to ice the game, whom did they go to? You are correct; Mr. Brown. Brown ended up catching 16-of-18 targets for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is par for the course for him this year, but still unexpected against the Broncos' No. 1 defense.    Roethlisberger completed 40-of-55 passes for 380 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Broncos hadn't allowed 300 yards passing all season and had allowed 3 touchdowns just once, to "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a Trent Williams hold.    Cousins' primary target was Thompson, who caught 6 of his 7 targets for a ridiculous 150 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 8 times for 38 rushing yards. Involving him more on offense than Samaje Perine (19-49) in something the Redskins must do in the future if Robert Kelley misses more action. Actually, Washington's best pure runner this evening was Mack Brown, who gained 27 yards on 6 attempts. Brown is a talented player who should be given a chance to be the starter.    Aside from Thompson, Cousins' touchdowns went to Vernon Davis (5-58) and Josh Doctson (1-52)."

As long as Reed is out, Davis can be started as a low-end TE1. If he is available in your league, make sure to pick him up. Meanwhile, Doctson did most of his damage on the 38-yard pass on the final drive of the game, but it's clear that he's becoming a bigger part of the team's offensive system. Doctson can be added, and in certain matchups, he can be used as a FLEX. Elsewhere in the pass game, "

Crowder had 1 nice catch that saw him find open space and turn on the jets to get 36 yards. He looks like a WR3 candidate for the rest of the season. As for Davis, he was able to steadily rip off chunks of yardage throughout the day. He was reliable for the Redskins, and at this point, they may want to consider keeping him as the starter over the disappointing and oft-injured Jordan Reed. Whenever Reed is out, Davis can be used as a TE1. Meanwhile, "
