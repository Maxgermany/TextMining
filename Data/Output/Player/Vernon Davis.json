I have to agree, though Davis' hands are so bad he's a candidate to bobble his bar of soap in the shower, resulting in a pretty awkward situation.    A great quote from Singletary, speaking of Davis' attitude: I would rather play with 10 people ... rather than play with 11 when that person is not sold out to be part of this team. Bravo. If Davis doesn't turn his attitude around quickly, the 49ers should cut their losses so that he can go ruin another organization.    Moving on, "

   "comment":"Davis holds on Chris Long, who was pretty much unblockable in this contest. San Francisco also had a Sam Bradford interception negated by a penalty. In the end though, San Francisco won and kept itself alive in the NFC West race. Unfortunately, left tackle Joe Staley fractured his fibula and could be out 4-6 weeks.    The encouraging thing for the 49ers is that Troy Smith looked pretty damn good. Smith displayed a great arm and hit his receivers downfield for 4 passes of 30 yards or more. Smith went 17-of-28 for 356 yards and a touchdown. Pick him up in your fantasy league if he's available.    Four of Smith's receivers had 4 catches: Delanie Walker (80 yards), Vernon Davis (79) and Michael Crabtree (61, TD)."

   "comment":"Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

   "comment":"Davis followed by a 14-yard run by Frank Gore. The back was not the punishing force he is when completely healthy and fresh, but did log 24 carries for 88 yards. When the lead was in hand, Anthony Dixon (7 carries for 32 yards) and rookie Kendall Hunter (11 carries for 27 yards) took over, allowing Gore to rest up on a short week for the Harbaugh Bowl. A short field goal from Akers capped the drive and made it 3-0. Yet another opportunity opened up for San Francisco to blow this game open in the first half when the first play by Arizona resulted in a fumble by Beanie Wells, who had just 8 carries for 33 yards. Arizona only ran the ball a total of 11 times, never holding the ball on sustained drives to get the running game in a rhythm against a stout defense. The field position resulted in just 3 points after Alex Smith threw behind Braylon Edwards on third down and Akers connected from 43 yards out. I got a good laugh when Brian Billick referred to him as Fred while making a golf analogy about him getting his swing back. Maybe he thought he was covering Fred Couples at the Masters. The Cardinals had another unsuccessful drive as the first quarter wrapped up, but the 49ers were having trouble putting them away. Smith missed Crabtree for what should have been an easy touchdown and Akers had another field goal blocked, this time by Peterson who did not make his presence felt otherwise on special teams because he only got his hands on a punt return twice. San Francisco quickly got the ball back and drove down the field yet again. This march was highlighted by wide receiver Kyle Williams who slipped by linebacker Sam Acho for a pickup of 10 yards and had another reception for 15. It was somewhat of a breakout performance for Williams with 5 receptions for 54 yards and (spoiler alert) a touchdown. Since the injury to Josh Morgan, the team has been looking for someone to pick up the slack. The drive ended with Smith throwing to Davis, who came up just short of the first down. Akers hit the field goal, making it 9-0. After yet another failed Arizona drive, the game mercifully went to halftime. Finally, San Francisco asserted itself as the bully, taking the ball right up the field 84 yards capped by the aforementioned touchdown to Williams. Crabtree had 2 receptions for 44 yards early in the drive which put them up 16-0. At that point it might as well have been 100-0 given the ineptness of Arizona's offense. On the second play of their first possession of the half, "

   "comment":"Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, Frank Gore (7-9) was clearly not part of the equation due to an exhausting season of wear and tear. Two runs from Kendall Hunter for a total of 19 yards helped put San Francisco in plus territory, and a completion to Davis made it an easy field goal opportunity for Akers who put the 49ers up 20-7 at halftime when the Rams failed on their final desperation 2.minute drive. To its credit, St. Louis came out firing in the second half. Jackson ripped off a 27-yard run, but the drive stalled. The field position was changed at least, and San Francisco had to punt after a weak ensuing posession.The Rams responded with big gains to Kendricks and Lloyd, keying a drive that resulted in a 49-yard field goal from "

Second, Smith couldn't convert a third down to save his life. He was 1-of-13 in those situations, with the only positive result coming right at the very end of regulation when the Giants allowed him to complete a pass well short of the end zone. I don't want you to think that Smith is a lost cause or anything. He made great strides this year, and it wouldn't be fair to dismiss him because of this loss, especially after his late-game heroics versus New Orleans. He deserves a chance with more than 1 weapon to throw to. Vernon Davis was a monster again (3-112, 2 TDs), but no other Niner receiver or tight end did anything. "

   "comment":"Davis for 20 yards. In fact, he had just 2 connections greater than 12 yards when he still had a chance to win.    San Francisco's offensive game plan perplexed me. The team is built on running the ball and playing great defense, so why did Frank Gore carry the ball only 6 times in the first half? It's not like it was a blowout early or anything; Minnesota was up by no more than 11 prior to intermission until Blair Walsh's 52-yard field goal as time expired. And it's not like Gore ran poorly or anything; he gained 63 yards on just 12 carries. He did lose a fumble, but there's no excuse for feeding him the ball so seldom.    Smith's touchdown went to Davis (5-53). "

   "comment":"Davis (4-33) in the middle of the end zone. San Francisco had a drive go inside the Saints 20 with a critical 14-yard reception by Boldin on a third down, but the Saints' defense stepped up to force another 49er field goal. Brees answered with a 34-yard pass to Meachem (2-78) and dropped in a beautiful 26-yard touch pass to Marques Colston (5-80). Garrett Hartley finished the drive by hitting a chip shot. The Saints got the ball back and moved to tie the game. The play of the game happened when Brooks had a sack-fumble on Brees that was recovered by the 49ers, but a roughing-the-passer was called on Brooks to take the turnover away. It was a questionable call, but that is the 2013 NFL. Brees connected with Colston to set up a game-tying 42-yard field goal for Hartley. Junior Galette sacked Kaepernick to help force a punt. Darren Sproles fair caught the punt at the 25-yard line, but was tackled by Kassim Osgood. That penalty put the Saints at the 40. A pass to Colston and 2 passes to Graham moved the ball in position for a 31-yard field goal by Hartley as time expired.    New Orleans' defense stepped up with a big game. Once again, Rob Ryan did a great job of coaching and scheming. Cam Jordan was excellent as he batted pass on a third-down throw, beat Anthony Davis to sack Kaepernick in the second quarter and almost had a safety in the 4.h. "

Boger was an equal-opportunity incompetent official Sunday afternoon, as he completely botched a call in the second quarter. Frank Gore (14-49) clearly fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Rams and taken the other way for a touchdown. However, Boger's crew ruled the play dead and incorrectly said that Gore's forward progress was stopped. Jeff Fisher looked like he wanted to murder the refs with his bare hands.    I'm sure Fisher feels better now that his team won. This was despite some very shaky play by Austin Davis, who went 13-of-24 for only 105 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Davis' picks were both underthrown, as he panicked in the pocket while under pressure. He was better in the second half, completing 6-of-9 attempts, but for only 31 yards. Davis looked like he would have to leave the game early when he came up hobbled after sliding awkwardly, but he was fine.    "

It seemed as though they were guilty of an illegal formation or an offsides on every single drive in the second half. San Francisco also had 3 turnovers, all of which were fumbles by Kaepernick, Patton and Bruce Miller; the latter give-away occurred in the red zone early on.    Only 1 San Francisco player had more than 22 receiving yards. That was Anquan Boldin, who reeled in 7 passes for 61 yards. Michael Crabtree had just 1 reception in overtime; he spent the majority of the game on the sidelines wearing a baseball cap. Davis didn't log a single reception, but had a long score wiped out by 2 penalties.    Both teams incurred a high number of injuries. I already mentioned Watt and Troutman; the Chargers also lost key defenders in "

Torrey Smith had the big splash play for the 49ers with a 75-yard touchdown reception, which helped him to 6 receptions for 120 yards and a touchdown. Unfortunately, he won't get to face Pittsburgh's pass defense every week.    Anquan Boldin remains Kaepernick's favorite target, as he threw it his way 10 times, of which he caught 6 of them for 60 yards and a touchdown, and also had an uncharacteristic drop near the end zone. Boldin will need similar game scripts to be a force in fantasy, but he will, at least, lead the 49ers in targets.    Both defenses in this game were poor statistically, but the Steelers got after Kaepernick, sacking him 5 times, and didn't let the 49ers score a touchdown until the 4.h quarter.    The 49ers were coming off a good home win on Monday night and traveling cross-country to Pittsburgh, while the Steelers were coming off a 10-day rest and a loss to the Patriots. Also, the 49ers' weakness is their pass defense, and the Steelers' strength is their run defense. All signs pointed to this finish.   "

   "comment":"Davis with 5 and then 7 other players with 1 to 4.    Torrey Smith had the big splash play for the 49ers with a 75-yard touchdown reception, which helped him to 6 receptions for 120 yards and a touchdown. Unfortunately, he won't get to face Pittsburgh's pass defense every week.    Anquan Boldin remains Kaepernick's favorite target, as he threw it his way 10 times, of which he caught 6 of them for 60 yards and a touchdown, and also had an uncharacteristic drop near the end zone. Boldin will need similar game scripts to be a force in fantasy, but he will, at least, lead the 49ers in targets.    Both defenses in this game were poor statistically, but the Steelers got after Kaepernick, sacking him 5 times, and didn't let the 49ers score a touchdown until the 4.h quarter.    The 49ers were coming off a good home win on Monday night and traveling cross-country to Pittsburgh, while the Steelers were coming off a 10-day rest and a loss to the Patriots. Also, the 49ers' weakness is their pass defense, and the Steelers' strength is their run defense. All signs pointed to this finish.   "

Then, on third down, when the Steelers needed a first down to ice the game, whom did they go to? You are correct; Mr. Brown. Brown ended up catching 16-of-18 targets for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns, which is par for the course for him this year, but still unexpected against the Broncos' No. 1 defense.

   "comment":"Davis on the ensuing drive. Cousins ended up missing on a few deep shots, but he was pretty accurate for the most part. He spent most of the second half targeting Mackensie Alexander after Xavier Rhodes was knocked out with a concussion. It goes without saying that as with Kendicks' absence, Rhodes being out was absolutely huge. The Redskins' offense simply couldn't be stopped following intermission after the Vikings seemed to perhaps figure things out in the second quarter. Cousins finished 22-of-33 for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, his accuracy was very good, and he was able to throw some perfect dimes at times. Sure, the Vikings were missing Kendricks for the entire game and Rhodes for the final quarter, but Cousins' performance was impressive nonetheless, especially when considering that Trent Williams was out of the lineup, while right tackle Morgan Moses got banged up. Moses sustained an injury, but returned after missing a few plays. He wasn't completely healthy though, as he was limping around.    Robert Kelley made the start for the Redskins, as Matt Jones was a healthy scratch. Kelley ran well, gaining 97 yards on 22 carries. Kelley had some spurts in this contest that would've gone for losses, but he was able to power his way forward for pick-ups of 3 to 4 yards at a time. He's a strong runner, and he appears to definitely be an upgrade over the fumble-prone Jones.    With DeSean Jackson out, Pierre Garcon saw the most targets (10) and led the team with 6 catches for 81 yards. Davis (3-66) and Jamison Crowder (4-37) caught touchdowns, while Jordan Reed disappointed, finishing with just 2 grabs for 41 yards."

   "comment":"Davis touchdown. Things didn't get better after intermission. Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half. The Raiders were able to score off of a muffed punt and a fumble, but that was it. The Raiders looked like they thought they could just show up and win, but they were humbled by this result. Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a Trent Williams hold.    Cousins' primary target was Thompson, who caught 6 of his 7 targets for a ridiculous 150 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 8 times for 38 rushing yards. Involving him more on offense than Samaje Perine (19-49) in something the Redskins must do in the future if Robert Kelley misses more action. Actually, Washington's best pure runner this evening was Mack Brown, who gained 27 yards on 6 attempts. Brown is a talented player who should be given a chance to be the starter.    Aside from Thompson, Cousins' touchdowns went to Vernon Davis (5-58) and Josh Doctson (1-52)."

As long as Reed is out, Davis can be started as a low-end TE1. If he is available in your league, make sure to pick him up. Meanwhile, Doctson did most of his damage on the 38-yard pass on the final drive of the game, but it's clear that he's becoming a bigger part of the team's offensive system. Doctson can be added, and in certain matchups, he can be used as a FLEX. Elsewhere in the pass game, "

Crowder had 1 nice catch that saw him find open space and turn on the jets to get 36 yards. He looks like a WR3 candidate for the rest of the season. As for Davis, he was able to steadily rip off chunks of yardage throughout the day. He was reliable for the Redskins, and at this point, they may want to consider keeping him as the starter over the disappointing and oft-injured Jordan Reed.

Doctson had a coming-out party in the first half, as he looked like the explosive play-maker who the Redskins believe they had drafted in the first round. Doctson had a nice, long catch early on and generally did well to find space. He is worth a speculative add as a potential FLEX play late in the year. As for Davis, he has taken over as the top tight end for the Redskins. He has great receiving ability and is a reliable target. He did have 1 brutal drop on the first play of overtime, but other than that, he was generally solid. Davis appears to be a TE1 as long as Jordan Reed is out.
