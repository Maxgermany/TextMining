San Francisco also had a Sam Bradford interception negated by a penalty. In the end though, San Francisco won and kept itself alive in the NFC West race. Unfortunately, left tackle Joe Staley fractured his fibula and could be out 4-6 weeks.    The encouraging thing for the 49ers is that Troy Smith looked pretty damn good. Smith displayed a great arm and hit his receivers downfield for 4 passes of 30 yards or more. Smith went 17-of-28 for 356 yards and a touchdown. Pick him up in your fantasy league if he's available.    Four of Smith's receivers had 4 catches: Delanie Walker (80 yards), Vernon Davis (79) and Michael Crabtree (61, TD)."

The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Davis well short of the sticks. That was basically it for the first quarter. The second quarter opened with another long drive by New York paced by consecutive completions to Mario Manningham for 13 and 14 yards, respectively. The Giants stalled in the red zone but took the lead with another field goal to make it 6-3. The rest of the quarter was controlled by San Francisco. They worked field position and time of possession by virtue of a turnover (a Manning interception) and onside kick recovery. Two short drives covering 46 and 31 yards ended in field goals and put them ahead 9-6 at halftime. It is worth noting that Frank Gore (6 rushes for 0 yards, 1 reception 8 yards) was stuffed in the first half and other than running on the field prior to a commercial break, did not appear in the second half due to a knee injury. His presence was missed, but backup Kendall Hunter (6 rushes for 40 yards) had some nice runs in relief, and Anthony Dixon (2 carries for 10 yards) also chipped in. Mostly, the 49ers put the game on Smith's arm and he delivered. His numbers are never fantasy-worthy, but he was 19-of-30 for 242 yards with a touchdown and interception. On San Francisco's first possession of the second half, they went right down the field for first-and-goal, but 3 incompletions forced a field goal to put them up 12-6. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, New York seemed to gain control of the game, charging 90 yards for the game's first touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Manningham who caught 6 passes for 77 yards. An exchange of punts later, it looked like this would go down as a defensive war as the third quarter ended. The 49ers got the ball at midfield after a shanked punt and did what great teams do by turning great field position into 6 points. Well, 8 points actually. They picked up 15 yards on 3 runs by Gore's backups and another 5 with their tricky move to draw opponents offsides. Last week, it was called illegal motion on their offense, but not this time. This set them up to find Davis, who was otherwise pretty much invisible (3 catches for 40 yards), for a 31-yard touchdown play down the sideline. He leaped over safety "

The back was not the punishing force he is when completely healthy and fresh, but did log 24 carries for 88 yards. When the lead was in hand, Anthony Dixon (7 carries for 32 yards) and rookie Kendall Hunter (11 carries for 27 yards) took over, allowing Gore to rest up on a short week for the Harbaugh Bowl. A short field goal from Akers capped the drive and made it 3-0. Yet another opportunity opened up for San Francisco to blow this game open in the first half when the first play by Arizona resulted in a fumble by Beanie Wells, who had just 8 carries for 33 yards. Arizona only ran the ball a total of 11 times, never holding the ball on sustained drives to get the running game in a rhythm against a stout defense. The field position resulted in just 3 points after Alex Smith threw behind Braylon Edwards on third down and Akers connected from 43 yards out. I got a good laugh when Brian Billick referred to him as Fred while making a golf analogy about him getting his swing back. Maybe he thought he was covering Fred Couples at the Masters. The Cardinals had another unsuccessful drive as the first quarter wrapped up, but the 49ers were having trouble putting them away. Smith missed Crabtree for what should have been an easy touchdown and Akers had another field goal blocked, this time by Peterson who did not make his presence felt otherwise on special teams because he only got his hands on a punt return twice. San Francisco quickly got the ball back and drove down the field yet again. This march was highlighted by wide receiver Kyle Williams who slipped by linebacker Sam Acho for a pickup of 10 yards and had another reception for 15. It was somewhat of a breakout performance for Williams with 5 receptions for 54 yards and (spoiler alert) a touchdown. Since the injury to Josh Morgan, the team has been looking for someone to pick up the slack. The drive ended with Smith throwing to Davis, who came up just short of the first down. Akers hit the field goal, making it 9-0. After yet another failed Arizona drive, the game mercifully went to halftime. Finally, San Francisco asserted itself as the bully, taking the ball right up the field 84 yards capped by the aforementioned touchdown to Williams. Crabtree had 2 receptions for 44 yards early in the drive which put them up 16-0. At that point it might as well have been 100-0 given the ineptness of Arizona's offense. On the second play of their first possession of the half, "

Two runs from Kendall Hunter for a total of 19 yards helped put San Francisco in plus territory, and a completion to Davis made it an easy field goal opportunity for Akers who put the 49ers up 20-7 at halftime when the Rams failed on their final desperation 2.minute drive. To its credit, St. Louis came out firing in the second half. Jackson ripped off a 27-yard run, but the drive stalled.

San Francisco had a drive go inside the Saints 20 with a critical 14-yard reception by Boldin on a third down, but the Saints' defense stepped up to force another 49er field goal. Brees answered with a 34-yard pass to Meachem (2-78) and dropped in a beautiful 26-yard touch pass to Marques Colston (5-80). Garrett Hartley finished the drive by hitting a chip shot. The Saints got the ball back and moved to tie the game. The play of the game happened when Brooks had a sack-fumble on Brees that was recovered by the 49ers, but a roughing-the-passer was called on Brooks to take the turnover away. It was a questionable call, but that is the 2013 NFL. Brees connected with Colston to set up a game-tying 42-yard field goal for Hartley. Junior Galette sacked Kaepernick to help force a punt. Darren Sproles fair caught the punt at the 25-yard line, but was tackled by Kassim Osgood. That penalty put the Saints at the 40. A pass to Colston and 2 passes to Graham moved the ball in position for a 31-yard field goal by Hartley as time expired.    New Orleans' defense stepped up with a big game. Once again, Rob Ryan did a great job of coaching and scheming. Cam Jordan was excellent as he batted pass on a third-down throw, beat Anthony Davis to sack Kaepernick in the second quarter and almost had a safety in the 4.h. "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis both had multiple, back-breaking drops in the first half. Even the sure-handed Davis both had multiple, back-breaking drops in the first half. Even the sure-handed Anquan Boldin (7-50) was guilty of a drop, which happened to occur in the end zone. It ruined a great-looking drive in which Boldin made a fantastic catch of a ball thrown behind him deep in Denver territory. This game ultimately got out of control in the middle of the third quarter. Down 21-10, the 49ers had a chance to draw to within 1 score. However, Colin Kaepernick made a terrible read, eschewing an open target for a first down, instead launching it deep into double coverage. The pass was picked off, and Manning launched a touchdown to Demaryius Thomas on the very next play. Game, set, match.    Kaepernick went 24-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and the killer interception. As mentioned, many of Kaepernick's incompletions were dropped, so this loss definitely wasn't his fault, though he did miss an open Brandon Lloyd for a long score. That said, I was disappointed that he scrambled just 3 times (18 rushing yards). His legs are his best weapons, so he should use them more.    Kaepernick's sole touchdown went to Stevie Johnson, who actually led the team with 79 receiving yards off 5 catches. Boldin (7-50) was solid outside of the dropped score, but Crabtree (4-27) and Davis (2-21) both had awful outings.    The Broncos did a great job of shutting down the run. "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis both had multiple, back-breaking drops in the first half. Even the sure-handed Davis both had multiple, back-breaking drops in the first half. Even the sure-handed Anquan Boldin (7-50) was guilty of a drop, which happened to occur in the end zone. It ruined a great-looking drive in which Boldin made a fantastic catch of a ball thrown behind him deep in Denver territory. This game ultimately got out of control in the middle of the third quarter. Down 21-10, the 49ers had a chance to draw to within 1 score. However, Colin Kaepernick made a terrible read, eschewing an open target for a first down, instead launching it deep into double coverage. The pass was picked off, and Manning launched a touchdown to Demaryius Thomas on the very next play. Game, set, match.    Kaepernick went 24-of-39 for 263 yards, 1 touchdown and the killer interception. As mentioned, many of Kaepernick's incompletions were dropped, so this loss definitely wasn't his fault, though he did miss an open Brandon Lloyd for a long score. That said, I was disappointed that he scrambled just 3 times (18 rushing yards). His legs are his best weapons, so he should use them more.    Kaepernick's sole touchdown went to Stevie Johnson, who actually led the team with 79 receiving yards off 5 catches. Boldin (7-50) was solid outside of the dropped score, but Crabtree (4-27) and Davis (2-21) both had awful outings.    The Broncos did a great job of shutting down the run. "

I mentioned that Boger screwed up San Francisco's chances late in the game. Boger was an equal-opportunity incompetent official Sunday afternoon, as he completely botched a call in the second quarter. Frank Gore (14-49) clearly fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Rams and taken the other way for a touchdown. However, Boger's crew ruled the play dead and incorrectly said that Gore's forward progress was stopped. Jeff Fisher looked like he wanted to murder the refs with his bare hands.    I'm sure Fisher feels better now that his team won. This was despite some very shaky play by Austin Davis, who went 13-of-24 for only 105 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. Davis' picks were both underthrown, as he panicked in the pocket while under pressure. He was better in the second half, completing 6-of-9 attempts, but for only 31 yards. Davis looked like he would have to leave the game early when he came up hobbled after sliding awkwardly, but he was fine.    "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis had worse performances. Sanders caught just 2 passes for 17 yards and was guilty of a muffed punt. Davis snatched 7 balls for 74 yards, but spent the majority of the time running the wrong way in the first half. He also had a game-ending drop that would've picked up about 40 yards and put the team into field-goal range.    The Broncos couldn't run the ball whatsoever. Ronnie Hillman mustered just 20 yards on 12 carries. C.J. Anderson's power was missed on some failed short-yardage conversions.    The Raiders, meanwhile, had some offensive struggles themselves. I mentioned that they recorded minus-12 yards of offense by halftime. Derek Carr looked completely helpless. He had immense issues dealing with the pressure, forcing some poor passes. For example, he overthrew a wide-open Amari Cooper because he felt like he had to rush the throw. By halftime, Carr was just 2-of-8 for 7 yards. Yeah, it was that bad. Oakland had better success after intermission, as the line began giving Carr more time. Carr ultimately finished 12-of-29 for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns. He still had some blunders, including taking a sack to move the team out of field-goal range, but he was definitely sharper after halftime, so Jack Del Rio and his staff needs to be given credit for making the proper adjustments.    Amari Cooper had a disappointing performance. He was targeted 8 times, but didn't catch a single pass, thanks to Aqib Talib's terrific coverage. Cooper dropped a ball, but also had bad luck. As mentioned, Carr missed him for a deep connection. Later, Talib grabbed Cooper by the throat in the end zone, yet the officials didn't throw a flag for some reason.    Carr's touchdowns went to Mychael Rivers (3-49) and Seth Roberts (2-20). Like Cooper, Michael Crabtree struggled, catching 4 balls for only 19 yards.    Latavius Murray had no running room, mustering just 27 yards on 16 carries. Murray appeared to score a touchdown at 1 point, but the play was nullified by a false start.    Sebastian Janikowski needs to get his act together. He whiffed on a 43-yard try, which would've been costly had Vernon Davis not dropped a crucial ball. Janikowski has secretly been a choke artist, though no 1 knows that because the Raiders haven't been good for a long time. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Davis had worse performances. Sanders caught just 2 passes for 17 yards and was guilty of a muffed punt. Davis snatched 7 balls for 74 yards, but spent the majority of the time running the wrong way in the first half. He also had a game-ending drop that would've picked up about 40 yards and put the team into field-goal range.    The Broncos couldn't run the ball whatsoever. "

   "comment":"Vernon Davis on the ensuing drive. Cousins ended up missing on a few deep shots, but he was pretty accurate for the most part. He spent most of the second half targeting Davis on the ensuing drive. Cousins ended up missing on a few deep shots, but he was pretty accurate for the most part. He spent most of the second half targeting Mackensie Alexander after Xavier Rhodes was knocked out with a concussion. It goes without saying that as with Kendicks' absence, Rhodes being out was absolutely huge. The Redskins' offense simply couldn't be stopped following intermission after the Vikings seemed to perhaps figure things out in the second quarter. Cousins finished 22-of-33 for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, his accuracy was very good, and he was able to throw some perfect dimes at times. Sure, the Vikings were missing Kendricks for the entire game and Rhodes for the final quarter, but Cousins' performance was impressive nonetheless, especially when considering that Trent Williams was out of the lineup, while right tackle Morgan Moses got banged up. Moses sustained an injury, but returned after missing a few plays. He wasn't completely healthy though, as he was limping around.    Robert Kelley made the start for the Redskins, as Matt Jones was a healthy scratch. Kelley ran well, gaining 97 yards on 22 carries. Kelley had some spurts in this contest that would've gone for losses, but he was able to power his way forward for pick-ups of 3 to 4 yards at a time. He's a strong runner, and he appears to definitely be an upgrade over the fumble-prone Jones.    With DeSean Jackson out, Pierre Garcon saw the most targets (10) and led the team with 6 catches for 81 yards. Davis (3-66) and Jamison Crowder (4-37) caught touchdowns, while Jordan Reed disappointed, finishing with just 2 grabs for 41 yards."

Carr, who was frequently surprised by bad Rodney Hudson snaps, was sacked twice on the opening possession of the second half.

Perhaps this will serve as a needed wake-up call, as Oakland is certainly better than this.    Carr finished just 19-of-31 for 118 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions. His score went to Jared Cook (4-43), who was the only Raider who accumulated more than a dozen receiving yards before the final drive of the game! Carr's primary wideouts, Cooper and Crabtree, caught 1 ball each for 6 and 7 yards, respectively. Crabtree left the game with a chest injury.    Lynch struggled, mustering only 18 yards on 6 carries. He had just 1 tough run for a gain of 5. and that was it. As mentioned, he was stuffed on a big third-and-2 play.    The Redskins, meanwhile, did a great job of moving the chains, but weren't exactly tested. The Raiders might have the worst defense in the NFL, and it showed in this contest, as Cousins went 25-of-30 for 365 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had a first-down run, but that was negated by a Trent Williams hold.    Cousins' primary target was Thompson, who caught 6 of his 7 targets for a ridiculous 150 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 8 times for 38 rushing yards. Involving him more on offense than Samaje Perine (19-49) in something the Redskins must do in the future if Robert Kelley misses more action.
