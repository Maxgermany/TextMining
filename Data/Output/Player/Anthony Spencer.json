   "comment":"Spencer started a strip sack that was recovered in the end zone for a touchdown by Jason Hatcher. Foles finished 22-of-32 for 219 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He flashed good and bad, and he doesn't look ready to take the league by storm. Philadelphia's play-calling was once again pathetic about using LeSean McCoy (16-82 rushing, 4-20 receiving).    The Cowboys answered an early Vick touchdown with a nice drive. They tied the game on a short screen pass from Tony Romo to Felix Jones (16-71) where Nate Allen, Nnamdi Asomugha and others missed tackles on Jones. Romo later set up a field goal after Dez Bryant (3-87) burned Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie on a double move for a gain of 49 yards.    Romo played well, but his offensive line stunk. Nate Livings and Doug Free were really struggling. The interior of the line was getting whipped by Eagles defensive tackles Fletcher Cox and Cullen Jenkins. Romo made an insane play during the third quarter on which he dodged 3 defenders to make a throw downfield for a 25-yard completion to Miles Austin (2-32). Romo threw for the end zone on the drive, and Bryant laid out for the ball. It was a bad call and ruled a 30-yard touchdown, as the ball had clearly rolled on the ground. There also was a pass interference penalty called on Rodgers-Cromartie. However, the officials botched the review and kept it a Dallas touchdown to tie the score at 17 entering the 4.h quarter. Dwayne Harris gave the Cowboys the lead with a 78-yard punt return for a touchdown just a bit later. Romo finished the game completing 19-of-26 passes for 209 yards with 2 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Jason Witten (8-47) had a modest contribution.    Defensively, there were a number of standouts for each team. Cowboys' linebacker Bruce Carter was excellent defending the run with some hard hits. Victor Butler and Spencer recorded sacks and both played well. Eagles' linebackers Mychal Kenricks and "
