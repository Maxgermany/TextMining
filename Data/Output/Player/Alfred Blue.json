The Saints put a good drive together with Brees hitting Ben Watson for gains of 15 and 26 yards. However, Kareem Jackson made a diving interception at the 1-yard line and got up to return the ball to midfield. Another New Orleans drive moved the ball deep into Houston territory, but Quinton Demps broke up a 4.h-down pass in the end zone. That ended the game for the Texans.    Drew Brees completed 25-of-44 for 228 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. The Saints were led through the air by tight end Ben Watson with 4 catches for 53 yards. Willie Snead (4-50), Marques Colston (3-38) and Brandin Cooks (5-35) were held in check.    Mark Ingram had 52 yards on 9 carries and 6 receptions for 45 yards. The Saints had to abandon the run because they were way behind so early.    Brian Hoyer was 21-of-27 for 205 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. He was yet another quarterback who torched New Orleans' defense.    DeAndre Hopkins was held to 36 yards on 5 receptions, disappointing his fantasy owners despite a great matchup. Tight end Ryan Griffin led the Texans in receiving with 4 catches for 72 yards and a score.    Alfred Blue ran for 77 yards on 16 carries with a touchdown.

Matt Hasselbeck took advantage of the short field and moved the ball before threading a needle between defenders to Donte Moncrief for an 11-yard touchdown. A holding call and sack from Kendall Langford quickly got the ball back for Indianapolis with a nice punt return to the Texans' 35-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Andre Johnson moved the ball to the 17-yard line. That produced a chip-shot field goal for the Colts and a 10-0 lead. Houston's offense finally did something positive with a 41-yard run from Blue, but Bill O'Brien made a very questionable decision to have Nick Novak attempt a 57-yard field goal that wasn't even close."
