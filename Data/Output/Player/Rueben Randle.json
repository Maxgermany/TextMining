   "comment":"Randle (3-75) had the lone aerial touchdown, but got away with what would've almost certainly been the biggest bone-headed move of the week. Randle went down untouched in the red zone. He slammed the ball down on the ground in frustration, which was really should've been ruled a fumble because Chicago alertly pounced on it. Trestman tried to challenge, but official John Parry incorrectly ruled that Randle gave himself up, which was very shady on his part. Randle absolutely did not give himself up.    As for the Bears, "

   "comment":"Randle setting up New York in St. Louis territory. The drive stalled inside the 15-yard line despite a great 1-handed catch by Beckham. The Rams' Benny Cunningham promptly fumbled the ball back to New York on the kick return to set up the Giants at St. Louis' 21-yard line. Manning turned that into a 9-yard strike to Beckham for a touchdown. The Rams' next drive was aided by a Beckham taunting penalty and more New York defensive penalties to produce a field goal drive. After a T.J. McDonald sack helped produce a punt, Tavon Austin (1-15 receiving, 3-25 rushing) ripped off a 41-yard return. However, Austin deflected a high screen pass, and it was intercepted by Giants rookie defensive end Kerry Winn. That resulted in another field goal. New York soon put together an 11-play drive that ended with Orleans Darkwa (4-21) darting into the end zone with a 12-yard score. The Rams answered with Kenny Britt (9-103) making a super leaping catch for 27 yards. Tre Mason (13-76) finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run. On the Giants' next possession, Alec Ogletree hit Beckham late out of bounds after a screen pass, which caused a huge fight to break out between the 2 teams. New York's Damontre Moore and Preston Parker were kicked out, while St. Louis' William Hayes was also ejected. The Rams tacked on another field goal before the half. In the third quarter, Andre Williams (26-110) ripped off a 45-yard run that saw him run over a safety and pick up another 15 yards. Manning finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to Randle. The Rams answered with a scoring drive that ended with a 23-yard scoring pass to "

   "comment":"Randle and Odell Beckham Jr. Each caught 7 balls each for 116 and 79 yards, respectively. Randle's score, a 41-yarder, came very late in which Manning surprised the Redskins with a pass on a third down as he was running out the clock. Randle wasn't even open; there was good coverage, but the ball bounced right into his hands after it was tipped. Beckham, on the other hand, is a legitimate stud receiver, and this sort of production will be typical for him going forward.    "

They tried to mount a comeback, and they actually took over with possession down 6 points, but they just ran out of time.    Manning couldn't get anything going until late. He just didn't have the protection, thanks to 4 starting offensive linemen being hurt. He caught fire at the end, but the Redskins were playing prevent, so I don't know how much I'd read into it. Manning finished 26-of-51 for 321 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 3 interceptions.    Odell Beckham Jr. may have made the catch of the year. I'm sure you've all seen it by now; Beckham dived for the ball in the end zone and was able to reel it in with just 1 hand. As this happened, I shouted, What? Nooo... I couldn't believe he caught it, but I should've known better, given how ridiculously talented he is. Beckham had a huge game otherwise, finishing with 9 catches for 142 yards and that touchdown. With all of the linemen being out, Manning spent most of the afternoon heaving balls up for Beckham, so if you want to know why Beckham had 18 targets, well, there it is.    Only 1 other Giant had more than 40 receiving yards. That was tight end Will Tye, who snatched 6 balls for 74 yards. Tye was on the field with Larry Donnell being out. Meanwhile, Randle snatched Manning's other touchdown, but that was the only pass he hauled in of his 6 targets.    The Giants, as usual, struggled to run the ball. "

   "comment":"Randle caught 2 balls for 80 yards and a touchdown, but his 72-yard score came when the Vikings took their foot off the gas. Randle, who dropped a pass in the red zone, is a bum who shouldn't be starting in this league. The Giants need a second receiver, so perhaps look for that in the next 2016 NFL Mock Draft update.   "
