The Langford near-pick was terrible in particular; Sanchez just tossed it to the defensive lineman, who wasn't expecting such an easy would-be interception to come his way. Henne went 26-of-44 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception at the very end of the game. Despite the loss, his performance has to be encouraging to Dolphins fans who watched Henne struggle in the first 2 weeks.    Langford.

   "comment":"Kendall Langford quickly got the ball back for Indianapolis with a nice punt return to the Texans' 35-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Andre Johnson moved the ball to the 17-yard line. That produced a chip-shot field goal for the Colts and a 10-0 lead. Houston's offense finally did something positive with a 41-yard run from Blue, but Bill O'Brien made a very questionable decision to have Nick Novak attempt a 57-yard field goal that wasn't even close. Before the half, Texans quarterback T.J. Yates moved the ball into Colts' territory, but went down with a knee injury that ended his day. Weeden finished the drive with a few completions to get inside the 5-yard line before having to settle for a field goal. The Colts took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. In the third quarter, Bernardrick McKinney sacked Hasselbeck at the 1-yard line on a third down, and that set up the Texans to start a drive at the Colts' 32-yard line. Penalties on Houston's inept tight ends killed some nice plays, and Houston settled for a 47-yard field goal from Novak. After going 25 straight drives without a touchdown, the Texans started at their 11-yard line, and Weeden moved down the field with passes to Hopkins. Houston converted a 4.h-and-1 with Blue, and had a pass interference on Dwight Lowery move the ball to inside the 20-yard line. To end the drive, Weeden hit Jaelen Strong on the run for an 8-yard touchdown and a 13-10 Houston lead. After trading punts, the Colts got the ball back at midfield with 3 minutes remaining. Hasselbeck completed a pass to Griff Whalen, but Johnathan Joseph knocked the ball loose and Kareem Jackson returned the fumble 34 yards to Indianapolis' 21-yard line. That set up a short field goal for Novak to give the Texans a 16-10 lead. The next play from scrimmage saw Hasselbeck throw a ball up for grabs down the middle of the field, and A.J. Bouye ran underneath it for a game-clinching interception.    Hasselbeck completed 17-of-30 for 147 yards with a touchdown and interception. Moncrief led the Colts in receiving with 5 receptions for 51 yards and a score. Johnson (3-52 and T.Y. Hilton (3-29) were held in check by Joseph, Jackson and Kevin Johnson.    Frank Gore ran for 44 yards on 16 carries. He battled a tough defense, but appears to be worn down.    DeAndre Hopkins had 8 receptions for 94 yards to lead Houston's receivers.    Yates was 6-for-10 for 68 yards with an interception before his knee injury that could be serious. Weeden was 11-of-18 for 105 yards with a touchdown.    Blue had 20 carries for 107 yards for the Texans. As mentioned, he lost a fumble.    The Texans' defense had a group effort with strong play from their edge rushers and secondary. The Colts got a good game from Mike Adams, Robert Mathis, Kendall Langford and Robert Mathis.   Langford quickly got the ball back for Indianapolis with a nice punt return to the Texans' 35-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Andre Johnson moved the ball to the 17-yard line.
