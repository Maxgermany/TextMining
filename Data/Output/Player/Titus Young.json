Tight end Brandon Pettigrew came close to having a big game. He almost had a couple of touchdowns, and he should have a productive season for Detroit. Pettigrew finished with 57 yards on 4 catches.    Wide receiver Nate Burleson also had an effective game for Detroit with catching all 5 of his targets for 60 yards.    For Tampa Bay, quarterback "

   "comment":"Titus Young. And finally, the Titans kicked a field goal in overtime, which gave the Lions a chance. They moved it deep into Tennessee territory and looked like they might find the end zone, but they botched a quarterback sneak on a 4.h down when they should have tried a game-tying kick. Jim Schwartz said afterward that he wanted to lure the Titans offside and that snapping the ball was a mistake.    I mentioned earlier that Stafford suffered an injury. He'll have an MRI on his right leg Monday. Ser Stafford went 33-of-42 for 278 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Hill replaced him and was really sharp, going 10-of-13 for 172 yards and a pair of scores.    Four Lions had at least 6 receptions: Calvin Johnson (10-164, TD), Young (6-75, TD), "
