   "comment":"Hawkins (6-70), who got wide open in busted coverage. That set up Cundiff's game-winning 29-yard field goal with just a few seconds left on the clock.    Hoyer was 24-of-40 for 204 yards with a touchdown. Brees, meanwhile, finished having completed 27-of-40 passess for 237 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. Graham notched 10 receptions for 118 yards and 2 scores, but he went almost the entire first half without a target. Sean Payton screwed up not getting Graham involved immediately, and he easily could have produced a lot more because the Browns had no answer for him. New Orleans' receivers didn't do much. "

   "comment":"Hawkins for a potential score by overshooting him. His next interception, which occurred shortly afterward, came off a deflection. Hoyer has simply not played well ever since All-Pro center Alex Mack was knocked out for the year. Hoyer was able to lean on a strong ground attack, but that hasn't been possible the past few weeks. Ben Tate once again absolutely had no running room, as he tallied just 3 yards on 10 carries. Terrance West took over as the primary ball-carrier as the afternoon progressed, and he was much more effective. West notched 48 yards on 15 attempts, and he also caught a 2-yard touchdown. He did a good job picking up some blitzes - including 1 on Hoyer's game-winning touchdown pass - so he might be Cleveland's starting running back going forward.    Hoyer's 2 scores went to West and Taylor Gabriel (5-87). Andrew Hawkins led the team with 8 targets, but couldn't convert many of them, logging 3 grabs for 34 yards. Hoyer simply couldn't connect with him; as mentioned, Hawkins missed out on a long touchdown because of an overthrow. Hoyer was also inaccurate on several other attempts to his speedy wideout.    Glennon was also guilty of some bad misfires, and he was even worse than Hoyer. Barely completing half of his passes, Glennon went 17-of-33 for 260 yards, 2 touchdowns and a couple of picks, 1 of which occurred in the end zone that wasn't even close to his intended target. The other was an underthrow in which "

He finished 8-of-15 for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns, but take away those 3 plays, and he was just 5-of-12 for 44 yards. Not good, especially against a defense that isn't very talented. Having said that, I expect Manziel to keep starting until he loses. In other words, it may take Josh McCown a while to get cleared for his concussion.    As for Travis Benjamin, he needs to be ignored in 12-team leagues. Sure, Benjamin accumulated 115 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he was targeted only 4 times, and his quarterbacks still suck. Benjamin is just a situational deep threat, much like Devery Henderson was for the Saints a few years ago. He's not worth owning, and neither are "
