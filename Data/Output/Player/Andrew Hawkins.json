Graham notched 10 receptions for 118 yards and 2 scores, but he went almost the entire first half without a target. Sean Payton screwed up not getting Graham involved immediately, and he easily could have produced a lot more because the Browns had no answer for him. New Orleans' receivers didn't do much. "

   "comment":"Andrew Hawkins in which he scrambled right and impressively connected with his receiver. However, despite the 3 glimpses of greatness, Manziel struggled otherwise. He finished 8-of-15 for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns, but take away those 3 plays, and he was just 5-of-12 for 44 yards. Not good, especially against a defense that isn't very talented. Having said that, I expect Manziel to keep starting until he loses. In other words, it may take Josh McCown a while to get cleared for his concussion.    As for Travis Benjamin, he needs to be ignored in 12-team leagues. Sure, Benjamin accumulated 115 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he was targeted only 4 times, and his quarterbacks still suck. Benjamin is just a situational deep threat, much like Devery Henderson was for the Saints a few years ago. He's not worth owning, and neither are "
