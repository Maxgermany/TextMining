   "comment":"Simmons skied over Cooper to snatch the clinching interception.    It's unclear what Carr's injury is, but the Raiders need him to give themselves a chance at the playoffs; they won't win many games with Manuel, despite what we saw late in this contest. Carr went 10-of-18 for 143 yards and a touchdown. His offensive line struggled to block Denver's pass rush, and it didn't help that Michael Crabtree was out of the lineup. However, given how Manuel performed, it's conceivable that Carr could've led the Raiders to a victory at the very end. Manuel, by the way, went 11-of-17 for 106 yards and the pick.    Cooper was a major disappointment. He saw 8 targets, but came up with just 2 catches for 9 yards. He also had his 7.h drop of the year. He needed to step up with Crabtree out, and he was a big-time bust, despite the tough matchup. Jared Cook had 3 receptions for 46 yards.    Speaking of struggling fantasy stars, "
