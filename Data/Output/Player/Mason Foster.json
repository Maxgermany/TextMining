   "comment":"Foster. The Buccaneers gave it right back. An amazing run by Blount ended with him fumbling the ball away. Early in the 4.h quarter, the Jaguars put a good drive together and Gabbert capped it with another touchdown pass to Jones-Drew. Later on, Jones-Drew scored his 4.h all-purpose touchdown of the afternoon with a short run. He rushed for 85 yards on 27 carries and caught 6 passes for 51 yards and the 4 scores. Gabbert had the best game of his rookie season, completing 19-of-33 for 217 yards with 2 scores and 2 interceptions. The Jacksonville defense played excellent football for the final 3 quarters, totaling 5 turnovers, and the Jaguars' special teams caused 2 turnovers for a total of 7 takeaways. Tampa Bay had a meltdown performance, making 1 of the worst quarterbacks and worst offenses in the NFL look good. The Buccaneers have lost back-to-back games in convincing fashion to 3.win teams. Tampa Bay's 7.game losing streak is proof they lack the talent to compete on a weekly basis. They entered Sunday having spent more time playing from behind than any team in the NFL, and their defense struggles to stop anyone. It looks like Tampa Bay is making a run at a top-five pick.   "

   "comment":"Foster in the opening half. McCoy broke his hand, while Foster left with a shoulder and never returned. However, the Rams were moving the chains effectively before they got hurt.    There was a weather delay in this game that lasted about an hour, thanks to afternoon thunderstorms. That begs the question: Why the hell did this contest start at 4:05? As someone who has vacationed in Tampa on multiple occasions during the summer, I could've told the schedule-makers that this was a huge mistake. Screw the heat; all Tampa home games prior to October should begin at 1.   "

   "comment":"Foster were all off the field at various points. While 4 returned, the team could be in trouble if Kelley and Moses are hurt.    For the Rams, the result has to be disappointing. They came all the way back from 13 down to tie the game only to lose on Washington's final real offensive drive of the contest. Jared Goff had a fine performance that was certainly a regression from his Week 1 performance. Goff went 15-for-25 with 224 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. The pick was probably his worst throw of the game, and it came in the team's final drive of the contest. Goff looked directly at a short checkdown, allowing Mason Foster to jump the route. It essentially sealed the victory for the Redskins. Still, the California product looks a lot better in Sean McVay's offense than he did all of last season. Goff looked poised in the pocket and was confident in his arm. He was fairly accurate and his receivers when open. Goff did hold on to the ball too long at times, but he certainly has grown a lot since last year.    Goff's top receivers on Sunday were a couple of rookies. "
