Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. If it wasn't obvious before, Cleveland has to look for a new quarterback this offseason.    Only 1 Cleveland receiver ("
