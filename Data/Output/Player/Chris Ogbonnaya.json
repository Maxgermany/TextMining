Ogbonnaya's fumble on Cleveland's opening drive allowed the Texans to score an easy second touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Browns ruined any chance they had with another turnover right before halftime. McCoy foolishly heaved a weak-arm lob into triple coverage on a 2nd-and-19. It was naturally picked off, allowing the Texans to kick a field goal with 2 seconds remaining prior to intermission. McCoy went 14-of-22 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. If it wasn't obvious before, Cleveland has to look for a new quarterback this offseason.    Only 1 Cleveland receiver ("

   "comment":"Ogbonnaya was guilty of a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. The Bengals were up 31-13 by halftime, yet Dalton had thrown for just 63 yards on 8-of-18 passing. That's the type of weird game this was. The Browns managed just 1 touchdown following the break - a long bomb to Josh Gordon down the sideline. This was a rare, quality throw by Campbell, who had a disastrous afternoon after putting together a few good starts. Campbell's numbers don't look completely terrible - he was 27-of-56 for 248 yards and a touchdown - but he also threw 3 interceptions. His yardage was inflated - he had just 65 yards by halftime, so most of his stats came in garbage time - and he spent the entire afternoon throwing either behind or over his receivers. It's remarkable how inaccurate he was after several strong outings.    Dalton, meanwhile, wasn't any better. He threw 3 touchdowns, but that's a misleading stat, as he went 13-of-27 for 93 yards and the 2 aforementioned interceptions otherwise. He simply couldn't get anything going with Haden smothering his favorite receiver. Green finished with just 2 catches for 7 yards. With Green doing nothing, the Bengals' leading receiver, excluding Giovani Bernard, was Jermaine Gresham (2-27, TD), who had a bad drop. Mohamed Sanu and Alex Smith (the tight end) also scored.    The 1 thing Cincinnati was able to do offensively - remember, most of its scores came via the defense and special teams - was run the ball with both BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Bernard. The 2 backs had 16-62 and 10-45 lines, respectively. Bernard, who also had 4 catches for 41 receiving yards, aggravated his rib injury in the second quarter, but was able to gut it out.    The Browns, meanwhile, couldn't run very well, which really hurt them in the second-half monsoon conditions. Ogbonnaya broke a 43-yard run in the first quarter, but he finished with just 26 yards on his other 7 carries. "
