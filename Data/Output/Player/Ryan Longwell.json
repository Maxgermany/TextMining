   "comment":"Longwell shanked the 45-yard field goal attempt. Little did we know how much the next play would turn the game later on. Newton was sacked by E.J. Henderson and fumbled. Jared Allen, who occasionally made his presence felt in this 1. was there for the recovery. The Vikings went to Harvin on consecutive runs and quickly covered the 16 yards for a 7-0 lead. At least the Panthers did not let momentum sway too much, holding possession for 14 plays and converting a pair of third downs. The drive stalled when they failed twice on third down. The first time was an incomplete pass thrown into heavy traffic, but Byron Bell was called for holding. Leslie Frazier decided to back them up instead of risking a long made field goal. After an incomplete pass, the strategy paid off. A shovel pass to Adrian Peterson (5 receptions for 76 yards, 1 TD) for 22 yards helped Minnesota change field position, but it wound up not mattering. Carolina's offense started to click with 3 big plays by Steve Smith (8 touches for 112 yards) totaling 57 yards, 1 being a creative run. A touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey tied it up at 7 early in the second quarter. A flat possession by the Vikings followed. It was highlighted by Percy Harvin and Captain Munnerlyn, who had a terrific game, scuffling on the Panthers' sideline. It looked like Carolina might be starting to take over when Newton hit Greg Olsen on a beautiful 39-yard touchdown pass down the middle when he beat Husain Abdullah who probably wishes he had gotten safety help. Looking to get even, Minnesota drove right down the field, but at the end of a third-down conversion, Harvin had the ball stripped from his new friend Munnerlyn. Carolina worked its way out of the poor field position only to watch Allen get a different part of the sack/fumble action, this time leaving the recovery for Chad Greenway. At this point, Peterson (21 carries for 86 yards, 1 TD) was getting stood up in the running game, so the Vikings smartly threw to him twice for a quick 39 yards and the tying touchdown as the half pretty much expired. Once again, Carolina's offense got on the move, not even getting to third down until it was inside the Minnesota 30-yard line. Newton's 23-yard scamper was the highlight, and he capped the march by hitting Smith for a 22-yard scoring pass to put the Panthers up 21-14. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, Minnesota unleashed Toby Gerhart. His presence seemed to spark All Day, who up to that point had been flat. Basically alternating to start the drive, the duo combined to carry the ball 5 times for a quick 48 yards. A pair of 12-yard completions helped move them to the red zone and Peterson capped the scoring drive with a 9-yard touchdown run to tie the game. The third quarter came to a close with a 3.and-out by Carolina. Minnesota's next 2 possessions were sandwiched around another 3.and-out by the Panthers. This is where Ponder's steady play came in. He delivered a 13-yard pass to Visanthe Shiancoe on 3rd-and-11 to extend the first drive. On the next drive, Ponder utilized Percy Harvin to cash in another third down (11-yard pass) and completed 2 other throws totaling 37 yards with the game on the line. The drive did stall inside the 20 when he threw short twice, but Longwell hit the 31-yard field goal to put the visitors up 24-21. At this point, I expected some Newton magic. He opened the drive with an incompletion, but hit "
