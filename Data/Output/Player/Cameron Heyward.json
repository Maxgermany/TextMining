   "comment":"Heyward-Bey (1-31), Markus Wheaton (1-30) and Jesse James (2-15). Sammie Coates had a solid showing for once, snatching 6 balls for 79 yards. He also led the team with 8 targets. Coates has immense upside, so perhaps he's finally beginning to live up to expectations.    Le'Veon Bell made his 2016 debut in this debut following his 3.game suspension. Bell didn't disappoint, generating 144 yards on only 18 carries. He also caught 5 passes for 34 receiving yards. The only downside was that DeAngelo Williams (4-7) vultured a touchdown late in the evening.    Before moving on to the Chiefs, it's worth mentioning that the Steelers sustained ankle injuries to Marcus Gilbert and Jarvis Jones. A Gilbert loss would be substantial against teams with better pass rushes.    Speaking of Jones, he caught Alex Smith's single interception when it slipped out of his hands and was tipped by Cameron Heyward. Smith posted what appear to be solid numbers overall - 30-of-50, 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and the pick. However, these stats are totally bogus. Smith was just 13-of-21 for 131 yards and the interception in the opening half, and he was able to throw his 2 scores in garbage time when the Steelers stopped trying. Smith wasn't completely at fault for this loss, but the Chiefs didn't have much of a chance with him because of his limitations once they fell behind so early. The mistakes were a huge problem. There were numerous drops, while "
