It's worth noting that he was able to get a 56-yard pass-interference flag on an attempt to Johnson.    Megatron totaled just 5 catches for 54 yards, but had that long pass-interference flag, as just mentioned. He also nearly caught a touchdown, but Harrison Smith dislodged the ball with a great hit.

Skelton, however, wasn't helped by his blocking (sacked 7 times; 3 by Robison), play-calling and his own clock management. The coaching staff called for a Skelton bootleg on a 4th-and-2 deep in Minnesota territory in the middle of the third quarter. Skelton scrambled right, but couldn't find anyone open. He took a loss in the process. Later on, Skelton was responsible for a delay of game on a 4th-and-5 on the Vikings' 32. He was sacked immediately after the penalty on a 4th-and-10.

It was a truly awful penalty that allowed Griffin to keep the drive alive and ultimately lead his team into the end zone. However, Griffin took some bad sacks and couldn't get anything going on the team's final drive as a consequence. He was also hesitant to run on a crucial 4.h-and-6, hurling a low throw instead, turning the ball over on downs. Griffin finished 18-of-28 for 251 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick. He also picked up 24 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The important thing is that he finished this game unscathed, but there was a scary moment in the first half when he was sacked. He was bent backward awkwardly and limped around for a bit. He was fine, however.    Griffin's sole aerial score went to DeSean Jackson, who totaled 4 catches for 120 yards. Jackson made a great reception in double coverage during the first half. "

   "comment":"Smith, arguably the best safety in the league, and Anthony Barr, an outstanding linebacker, left early after aggravating their injuries. I've always maintained that the toughest things NFL coaching staffs have to do is adjust for key injuries during a game. Losing Smith and Barr put the Vikings in an impossible situation. I'm not saying the Vikings would've won with all 3 players on the field, but they at least would've been more competitive, at least on the defensive side of the ball. Still, having said that, I don't want to take anything away from Wilson. He was amazing despite missing Jimmy Graham, and I love what the coaching staff has done in terms of having him release the ball quickly.    "
