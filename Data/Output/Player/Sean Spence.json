He was nearly picked on a sloppy throw, and he was only moving the chains because the Lions were giving him free yards with their dumb penalties. Mariota eventually threw a pick when he forced a pass into double coverage, but he was sharp in the second half. Going 15-of-19 for 157 yards and 2 touchdowns following intermission, Mariota finished 25-of-33 for 238 yards, 2 scores and a pick overall.
