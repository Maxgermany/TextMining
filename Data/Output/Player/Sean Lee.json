At the very best, he'll be a career backup, but even that is questionable. Hours after the game, ProFootballTalk.com reported that QB Eagles No. 7 could be back for the Week 8 matchup against the Giants. It's amazing how quickly his hamstring healed in the wake of Foles' poor performance. It's almost as if there's some sort of correlation!    QBDK's return would help a running game that hasn't done much in his absence. "

   "comment":"Lee got hurt the following week; outplayed the Giants, but sustained a defeat because of special teams after the bye; dropped a game to the Seahawks by 1 point last week; and now this. This latest loss felt a lot like the New Orleans defeat. In fact, it was exactly like that loss. The Cowboys played evenly - or perhaps even better - with the opposition until losing Sean Lee to an injury. Lee was knocked out with a concussion yet again, and Philadelphia's offense was unstoppable after that, with the offensive coordinator, much like Sean Payton, constantly targeting Lee's replacement. Despite this, the Cowboys still took the game to overtime. However, like New Orleans, Philadelphia won the coin toss and went the distance for a touchdown. Not only did it win, but it covered the 3.point spread - the exact number in the Saints contest. The Cowboys, and those who bet on them, have been snake-bitten this year. Believe me, I know.    With Lee out of the lineup, the Cowboys wilted against the run. As a result, the 3 primary Philadelphia backs combined for 173 rushing yards on 34 carries. "

While the big story was how the Cowboys would look without Ezekiel Elliott, it became apparent that their true problems lie on the offensive line. This can be seen from the performance of Adrian Clayborn. Clayborn is not 1 of the better pass-rushers in the NFL. At best, he is an average player. But on Sunday afternoon, he looked like the second coming of Lawrence Taylor. Throughout the game, Clayborn tortured the Cowboys' left tackle, Chaz Green. Normal starter Tyron Smith was out with an injury, and Green couldn't contain Clayborn. The Atlanta end registered a whopping 6 sacks during the day, upping his season total to 8. He was unstoppable, and the only way that the Cowboys could avoid him was to roll away from him. And even then, he still made some nice plays on chase downs. Clayborn's 6 sacks were 1 shy of the NFL single-game record (Derrick Thomas, 7).    On the offensive side of the ball, Matt Ryan had 1 of his most consistent performances of the season. Of course, his job got a lot easier when Sean Lee went out for the game, but Ryan was still solid. He spent the whole day throwing accurate passes to his receivers and fitting balls into tight windows. On 1 of his best throws, he hit "
