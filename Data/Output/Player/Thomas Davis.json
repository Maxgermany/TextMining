   "comment":"Thomas Davis played out of their minds in this matchup. They each intercepted Brees once, with Kuechly's pick being the result of the quarterback not being able to step up in the pocket because of pressure. Kuechly did get away with pass interference on Graham in the red zone at 1 point during the first half, but something like this is a weekly occurrence for the stud linebacker. New Orleans still led despite all of this when the Panthers took over at their own 36 with 55 seconds remaining. The Saints strangely called 3 runs on the previous drive, barely mustering anything on the ground. It was a strange decision by the usually aggressive Sean Payton, who called for a failed fake punt and a successful onside kick earlier in the afternoon. Why run it 3 times when you have 1 of the top quarterbacks in the NFL at your disposal? It really makes no sense. At any rate, "
