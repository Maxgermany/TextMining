   "comment":"Davis played out of their minds in this matchup. They each intercepted Brees once, with Kuechly's pick being the result of the quarterback not being able to step up in the pocket because of pressure. Kuechly did get away with pass interference on Graham in the red zone at 1 point during the first half, but something like this is a weekly occurrence for the stud linebacker. New Orleans still led despite all of this when the Panthers took over at their own 36 with 55 seconds remaining. The Saints strangely called 3 runs on the previous drive, barely mustering anything on the ground. It was a strange decision by the usually aggressive Sean Payton, who called for a failed fake punt and a successful onside kick earlier in the afternoon. Why run it 3 times when you have 1 of the top quarterbacks in the NFL at your disposal? It really makes no sense. At any rate, Cam Newton struggled throughout most of this game without Steve Smith, who injured his knee in the first quarter. Newton, however, made several clutch throws, ultimately culminating with a touchdown strike to Domenik Hixon for the decisive score. Like Brees, Newton took several hits in this contest - he was sacked 4 times - and was constantly limping off the field. But he got job done at the very end to clinch a first-round bye for his team.    Newton finished 13-of-22 for 181 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was tipped in the red zone. He didn't do much on the ground, scrambling 4 times for only 6 yards. Without Smith at his disposal, Newton targeted Greg Olsen more than anyone else, but all the tight end could do was catch 4 passes for 35 yards. Ted Ginn (2-66) led the team in receiving, thanks to his 37-yard reception on the team's final drive.    DeAngelo Williams scored Carolina's other touchdown. He was bottled up for most of the contest, but burst for a 43-yard touchdown after Davis picked off Brees. The Saints had been great defensively all afternoon, but the stop unit simply wasn't ready after the sudden change.    The Saints, meanwhile, actually ran the ball well with "

A 20-yard pass to Marshall moved the ball to the 10-yard line before a slip screen to Matt Forte tied the game at 7. Willie Young soon got a strip-sack of Cam Newton, and the Bears recovered to set up the offense at Carolina's 13-yard line. On third-and-7, Cutler ran the ball into the end zone to give Chicago the lead. Cutler the threw a quick hitter to Jeffrey, who darted into the end zone from 25 yards out on the next drive. The Panthers drove into Chicago territory before Ego Ferguson batted 2 passes, with the second 1 being intercepted by Lance Briggs. Forte broke a tackle from Davis to bolt down the field for a 56-yard gain, but Robbie Gould missed a chip-shot field goal."
