Joe Flacco was a machine, as he at 1 point had 17 passing touchdowns compared to no interceptions in his previous 6 playoff games. And then he became human.

For instance, Brian Hoyer threw behind his target on a third down with several minutes to go prior to halftime, allowing the Patriots to hold on to the ball for an eternity on 2 drives sandwiching halftime.
