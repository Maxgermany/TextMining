As for the dumb coaching decision, Mike Tomlin opted to try an onside kick in the 4.h quarter - only he was up 2 points and there were 4 minutes remaining in regulation. Tomlin said afterward that he didn't have any confidence in his defense to stop the Packers. Well, I'm not going to disagree with that, but an onside kick has what, a 20-percent chance of working? Did Tomlin actually think that there was less than a 20-percent chance that his defense could contain Rodgers? If so, will he try an onside kick every single time he plays a good offense? If so, I'd like to see that game.   "

He was wide open because of busted coverage, and no defender was within 15 yards of him. Matthews put the Packers in position for more points on a sack-fumble of Manning that was recovered by teammate B.J. Raji. Mason Crosby missed a 43-yard field goal, but Green Bay was up 21-17 at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Rodgers out-executed the New York defense on another drive. He moved the ball down the field with some superb passes. To finish the series, Rodgers lofted in a 20-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1.handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1. 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

The Lions scored a quick touchdown and then secured a safety when Green Bay kickoff returner Patrick Lee had a brain fart and walked backward into the end zone after picking up the football when it was laying on the 1-yard line. With a 9-0 lead and Aaron Rodgers sidelined because of a coaching decision, it looked like the Lions were going to run away with an easy victory. And then Matt Flynn happened. All he did against the Lions was set the all-time Green Bay single-game passing yardage record. That's right - Flynn outgained Bart Starr, Brett Favre and Rodgers. Crazy. Flynn went 31-of-44, 480 yards, 6 touchdowns and an interception. It was all legitimate too. He tossed multiple bombs to his receivers, mostly to Jordy Nelson (9-162, 3 TDs). Flynn led the Packers on a game-winning scoring drive with just a minute remaining. Due to hit free agency this March, Flynn has made himself a TON of money. At just 26 years old, Flynn now has to be considered 1 of the top free agents available this offseason. I'll have 2012 NFL Free Agency Rankings posted soon.    As great as Flynn was, Matthew Stafford threw for more yardage, going 36-of-59 for 520 yards, 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The second pick was a killer though, as it occurred on the final drive and iced the game for the Packers. It's a shame because Ser Stafford was incredible otherwise.    Calvin Johnson had a monstrous outing, catching 11 balls for 244 yards and a touchdown. He was guilty of offensive pass interference against Tramon Williams in the end zone, however.    With all of that passing yardage, other quality fantasy performances came from: Brandon Pettigrew (7-116), Tony Scheffler (4-65, TD), Titus Young (4-24, 2 TDs), James Jones (6-89), Jermichael Finley (7-64, TD) and Donald Driver (2-52, TD).
