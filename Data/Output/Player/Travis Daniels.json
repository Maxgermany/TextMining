   "comment":"Daniels ended the next 2 Oakland drives with interceptions to give Palmer his own hat trick. His debut could not have been more forgettable, completing just 8-of-21 passes for 116 yards. The 3 quarterbacks finished 30-of-65 for 338 yards and 8 interceptions. Adding up their quarterback ratings still results in a pretty bad mark of 77.9. The story of the game was the importance of McFadden to the Raiders' offense. He fights for yardage on running plays and creates offense. Bush finished with 99 yards rushing, but could not punch it in when it mattered, and over 1-third of his yardage came on the 1 long run which of course also resulted in no points. The Chiefs came in desperate and it showed. This was a sloppy game with both teams in double digits for penalties for a combined 218 yards. For good measure, "
