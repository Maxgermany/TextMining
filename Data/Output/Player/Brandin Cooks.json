He made some ridiculous catches in this game, and it's fair to wonder if he's 1 of the most underrated players in the NFL. People attribute Snead's production to Brees, but some of his receptions in this contest were pretty amazing.    The Saints didn't try to establish the run all that much, as Mark Ingram was given 12 carries, which he turned into 58 yards. He also caught 2 balls for 29 receiving yards.    Rookie Michael Thomas made an impact in this game, logging 6 receptions for 58 yards. He was also Johnny on the spot, picking up a fumble in the fourth quarter and running it inside the Oakland 5-yard line. He has some fantasy potential, but doesn't appear as though he'll be leaping Snead anytime soon. He could be a high-end WR3 if either Cooks or Snead gets hurt. Oh, and by the way, "

   "comment":"Cooks all afternoon. Offensively, dropped passes continued to plague Arizona. This has been a lost season for the Cardinals, in part due to a plethora of dropped balls.    Early in the first quarter, Arizona took the lead as Kerwynn Williams took a carry for 49 yards for a touchdown, and that set the tone for the first half. The Saints answered with a field goal drive, and then Larry Fitzgerald fumbled the ball away to New Orleans at the Cardinals' 30-yard line. New Orleans took advantage with Brees hitting Travaris Cadet (5-30-1) for a short touchdown pass. Arizona took the lead after Markus Golden burned Zach Strief to get a strip-sack of Brees. Calais Campbell scooped up the ball and returned it 53 yards for a touchdown. Quickly, the Saints responded with Brandin Cooks turning around D."

It was a very mixed performance, and it should've been better because he had great protection for most of the evening. That changed late when Justin Houston, who was terrific throughout, began dominating Marcus Cannon. However, Brady had time to exploit Kansas City's defense for the most part, as Cannon did a good job on Houston in the early going.    As for Cooks, he didn't have the best statistical debut, catching only 3 balls for 88 yards. Cooks, however, drew a deep pass interference to set up the Patriots at the Kansas City 1-yard line, which "

   "comment":"Cooks for the first of his 2 big gainers for the day, with a 52-yard bomb. Brady then picked the Raiders apart, as he finished the drive with his arm, connecting on a short touchdown to Danny Amendola. At that point, it was 14-0, and the Raiders knew they had to score or be trounced. Oakland got the ball back, and on 2nd-and-10, Marshawn Lynch busted off a 25-yard run, then Jalen Richard touched the ball on the next 4 plays for 19 yards. Lynch then went back to work for 11 yards on 2 carries. Then, at the Patriots' 15-yard line, Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts for 12-yards, but he fumbled and the Patriots recovered. The Raiders had bullied their way into the red zone with the run game and then, pfft. That fumble was a back-breaker, and there really was no way the Raiders were going to be able to keep up with the Patriots offense down 14-0.    Lynch ended up carrying the ball 11 times for 67 yards, which probably makes sense, as the Raiders were down big and would need the passing game to come from behind, but in retrospect, keeping their offense on the field might have been valuable to the defense that was getting picked apart. But I'm grasping at straws here, because they just didn't have the personnel to stop Brady.    Brady was unstoppable in the first half, completing 20-of-24 passes for 201 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Raiders came into this game allowing the best completion percentage to opposing quarterbacks, and this performance will only help push them into the upper echelons of pass defense futility. Going into halftime Brady and company went 48 yards in 33 seconds to set up a mammoth 62-yard field goal for Steven Gostkowski, who nailed it in the high elevation. It likely would have been good from 70 yards. Of course, Brady wasn't done, as he took the ball on the first drive after halftime and hit Brandin Cooks for a 64-yard touchdown in stride. If you weren't sure if the last nail had been driven into the coffin, well, that was it.    The Raiders didn't muster much after that until the fourth quarter. Trailing 30-0, they went on a meandering 5 minutes and 20 seconds drive that ended in a 9-yard touchdown to "
