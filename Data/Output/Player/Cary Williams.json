Except it never happened because the officials blew the play dead. Yeah, this isn't a Kansas City mistake, but it was amusing watching an ultra-nice Romeo Crennel refrain from lashing out at the refs in his post-game press conference.    Cassel suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter. The crowd cheered when Cassel was on the ground, which drew the ire of right tackle "

Romo, who missed an open Jason Witten on a fourth-and-3 in the second quarter, was picked on another occasion in which he carelessly flung the ball up for grabs, but the turnover was negated by a defensive hold.    With Romo struggling, Dez Bryant had a frustrating afternoon. Bryant still managed to lead the Cowboys in receiving, but had just 4 catches for 73 yards. Bryant should have drawn a pass interference deep downfield early in the game, but the officials inexplicably didn't throw a flag on Cary Williams. It wouldn't have affected the outcome of this game, but the penalty hurt fantasy owners, as Dallas would have been in the red zone. By the fourth quarter, Bryant spent some time yelling at Romo and various coaches on the sidelines.    The Eagles have been great against the run this year, so it's not a surprise that they stymied "

He finished 28-of-53 for 429 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception.    Odell Beckham once again proved to be unstoppable. He abused Philadelphia's miserable secondary, snatching 12 balls for 185 yards and a touchdown. Rueben Randle also had a good game with 6 grabs for 158 yards. The player with the next-most receiving yardage was tight end Larry Donnell (2-26), who just missed out on a score when Manning overshot him in the end zone.    Rashad Jennings returned from injury, but saw Andre Williams handle more of a workload. Williams mustered 43 yards and a touchdown on 15 attempts, while Jennings (10-33) didn't do much on the ground, though he caught 3 balls. Neither back had much of a chance versus Philadelphia's stout ground defense.   "
