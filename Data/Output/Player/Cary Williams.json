  "comment":"Cary Williams, and his attempts were all over the place in general. Manning was finally picked off in the 4.h quarter when he carelessly heaved the ball off his back foot. He finished 28-of-53 for 429 yards, 1 touchdown and the interception.    Odell Beckham once again proved to be unstoppable. He abused Philadelphia's miserable secondary, snatching 12 balls for 185 yards and a touchdown. ",
