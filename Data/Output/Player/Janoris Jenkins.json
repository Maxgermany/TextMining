   "comment":"Janoris Jenkins, who recorded 2 pick-sixes last week, and took it back for a touchdown, though I thought it was obvious that he was down short of the goal line. Kaepernick did not have a good aerial performance. He went 21-of-32 for 208 yards and was responsible for a safety when he ran too far back in the pocket and heaved a pass that didn't reach the line of scrimmage. He wasn't bad, by any means, but he barely took any deep shots, which is curious because his ability to hit long passes - along with his scrambling strength - is what separates him from "

   "comment":"Janoris Jenkins when the ball barely scraped the ground. Lindley and the Cardinals escaped this game with a win to preserve the No. 1 seed in the NFC for the time being, but they won't be able to beat competent teams with this type of quarterbacking. It's possible that Arizona won't win another contest this year because Lindley is that bad.    The Cardinals were able to prevail in this contest with tough defense and a strong running game. Kerwynn Williams and Stepfan Taylor were inexplicably effective, rushing for 75 and 61 yards, respectively on a near-equal share of 29 carries. The 136 yards on the ground made absolutely no sense, as the Rams had limited 4 of their previous 5 opponents to 66 rushing yards or fewer. Marginal talents like Williams and Taylor shouldn't be gaining nearly 5 yards per carry, but that's exactly what happened Thursday night.    As good as Arizona's ground attack was, the defense was so much better. The Cardinals made Shaun Hill look completely inept, while offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's predictable offense was an absolute failure. The Rams couldn't keep drives alive, going just 4-of-15 on third down. There were so many instances in which they had just 1 yard to go, but gave up and punted. That was the story of the game for them, as they moved the ball to the Arizona 1-yard line in the 4.h quarter, but had to settle for a field goal. The Rams, otherwise, made mistakes and blew opportunities. They committed their first error in the opening quarter when Tre Mason lost a fumble, setting up the Cardinals with a short field goal. They were flagged for offensive pass interference twice. They dropped 2 interceptions. They had a chance to pounce on a Kerwynn Williams fumble, but let Jared Veldheer get the ball. They nearly had some picks themselves, but the Cardinals couldn't convert either. Shaun Hill, meanwhile, was an abomination. He went 20-of-39 for 229 yards and an interception on the final play of the game. That pick wasn't his fault, but as mentioned, he could've had several others. He had so many inaccurate passes, including at the very end, when he overthrew Stedman Bailey for a first down, and he went on a streak in which he completed just 5 of 14 attempts. St. Louis had 5 consecutive 3.and-outs in the second half.    Tre Mason was a huge disappointment. He wasn't expected to have a strong outing against the Cardinals' ferocious run defense, but he had just 2 quality runs, gaining 33 yards on 13 carries. The fumble hurt, as it gave Arizona 3 points and ultimately forced the Rams to kick a field goal on the 1-yard line; they could've gone for it to take a 10-9 advantage, otherwise.    Another player who really struggled was Jared Cook. The Cardinals had been poor against tight ends all year, yet he managed just 3 catches (8 targets) for 22 yards. He had 2 receptions wiped out by offensive pass interference, but he failed to reel in a decent catch late in the game because he was able to get just 1 foot inbounds.    The Rams' leading receiver was Bailey, who logged 5 catches for 74 yards. Kenny Britt (5-65) wasn't too far behind him.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, made errors themselves. They had 3 penalties on their first 2 drives that forced punts. Stanton threw behind an open John Brown on a third down. He did the same thing later on a pass headed for Kerwynn Williams. And, as mentioned, Arizona nearly had 3 turnovers, but the Rams couldn't capitalize.    Stanton had a mixed game. He missed some open receivers, but he connected on a pretty, 49-yard rainbow to Michael Floyd (2-55), who later drew a 36-yard pass interference flag on Janoris Jenkins. Stanton also made a nifty move where he avoided a couple of sacks and found "

   "comment":"Janoris Jenkins. Rodney McLeod scooped up the loose ball and ran 20 yards for the quick score. The next offensive possession for Cleveland had a similar result, as William Hayes recorded a strip-sack off the right side that was recovered by Akeem Ayers. That spotted the Rams 3 more points. Cleveland responded with a field goal drive that was aided by some Ram penalties. In the second quarter, St. Louis started moving the ball with Gurley and some short passes from Foles, but Donte Whitner forced a fumble from Jared Cook that was recovered by Cleveland. Aside from Gurley, the offenses were largely ineffective, and the Rams took a 10-3 lead into the third quarter. Cleveland started better in the second half with a 27-yard pass to Gary Barnidge and a 22-yard run by Robert Turbin. The drive stalled out for a 44-yard field goal. St. Louis answered with a screen to Tavon Austin for 11 yards. He had a great block on the next play to help spring Gurley for a 48-yard run. The drive was killed by a sack from Randy Starks, and Greg Zuerlein missed a 35-yard field goal. Barnidge climbed the ladder to make a 33-yard reception down the middle of the field. A Joe Thomas holding on Robert Quinn took away a great 36-yard catch by Travis Benjamin, and once again, Cleveland punted away after starting a drive well. Foles threw a beautiful 41-yard pass to Kenny Britt to the Browns' 1-yard line. Gurley finished the drive with his first NFL touchdown. In the 4.h quarter, the Rams' defense struck again. T.J. McDonald dislodged the ball from Benjamin, while Nick Fairley recovered the ball. Hilariously, Fairley ran the wrong direction with the fumble for a loss of 5 yards on his return, but at least, he secured the turnover. The St. Louis offense moved the ball from midfield before Gurley charged through 3 tackles from 16 yards out for the final score of the game. The Rams' defense did the rest. William Hayes beat right tackle Mitchell Schwartz to strip McCown of the ball, and Eugene Sims recovered the fumble. After McCown was pummeled by St. Louis' defense, Johnny Manziel came in for the final drive and moved the Browns about 30 yards before Cleveland stalled out.    Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards on 19 carries with 2 touchdowns. His combination of power and speed is tremendous.    Nick Foles completed 15-of-23 passes for 163 yards, while Tavon Austin led the Rams' receivers with 43 yards on 4 receptions.    Josh McCown completed 26-of-32 pass for 270 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and 2 fumbles. He actually didn't play poorly, but his offensive line was destroyed by the Rams.    St. Louis' run defense has been vulnerable this year, but shut down the Cleveland ground attack. Robert Turbin had 30 yards on 5 carries.    Cleveland was led through the air by tight end Gary Barnidge. He had 6 receptions for 101 yards. Running back Duke Johnson (7-73) and Travis Benjamin (4-47) were the other top targets.    The Rams' defensive line was just tremendous. Aaron Donald embarrassed Joel Bitonio on number of plays. Robert Quinn, William Hayes, Janoris Jenkins and Mark Barron all had good games for St."

Stafford could've posted a better stat line - Golden Tate ran a bad route to negate a completion of 25 yards, and Eric Ebron dropped a pass in the red zone - but he didn't play his best game.    Perhaps the most important play of this contest occurred at the end of a seemingly successful Detroit drive. Following Tate's long catch, the Lions fed the ball to Zenner, who rushed inside the New York 5-yard line. However, he fumbled, and the Giants recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. Zenner didn't get much work on the ground (3-12), though he did catch 4 passes for 52 yards. "
