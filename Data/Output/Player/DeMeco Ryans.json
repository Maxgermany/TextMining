Griffin actually had a chance to tie the game, as he reached the end zone with less than a minute remaining in regulation, but he was once again under pressure, forcing an incredibly dumb throw in which he heaved the ball off his back foot. The pass was easily intercepted, ending the game.    "

He caught fire after intermission, however, misfiring on just 2 of 12 attempted passes. He finished 20-of-30 for 250 yards, 1 touchdown and the pair of interceptions. Brees made a number of key conversions on third-and-long.    While Brees thrived after intermission, the running game was a constant for the Saints throughout. They bulldozed what was billed to be a strong Philadelphia run defense for 185 rushing yards, as their offensive line pushed around the Eagles' defensive front. "

   "comment":"Ryans. The stud inside linebacker tore his Achilles and will be out for the season. The more-prominent player to go down was Nick Foles, who broke his collarbone. Foles was not off to a good start. He was 10-of-13 for 124 yards and had a touchdown, but he threw a pick-six because of a poor decision and took some bad sacks. One of those sacks resulted in a brutal hit, prompting Foles to walk off into the locker room, where he was diagnosed with his broken collarbone. Mark Sanchez entered the game and instantly drove down the field for a touchdown. He heaved a 52-yard bomb to Jeremy Maclin and then found Jordan Matthews for an 11-yard score. Sanchez did a good job of moving the chains for most of the afternoon, though he did make some mistakes. He threw 2 interceptions, although 1 wasn't his fault because it went right off Josh Huff's hands. However, the second pick was bad, as Sanchez tried to force the issue. He also had another potential interception heaved right at the defender. Having said that, Sanchez wasn't any worse than Foles was, finishing 15-of-22 for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns and the 2 picks. His numbers could've been much better, but Darren Sproles had a bad drop on what looked like a potential long gain.    Both Foles and Sanchez threw 1 score each to Maclin, who once again put together a huge outing. He snagged 6 of his team-leading 7 targets for 158 yards and the 2 touchdowns. As mentioned, Matthews (3-40) reeled in Sanchez's other score. Riley Cooper (2-26) once again did very little.    LeSean McCoy had a somewhat disappointing fantasy outing. He managed to eclipse the century mark, gaining 117 yards on 23 carries. However, he had a touchdown vultured by Chris Polk (8-50), while many of the targets went to Sproles, who caught 4 balls for 46 receiving yards, doing a good job of slipping out of poor Houston tackles all afternoon. McCoy was able to manage just 2 receptions for 6 additional yards.    Foles and Ryans weren't the only major players injured this game. Houston corners "
