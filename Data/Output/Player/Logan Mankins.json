  "comment":"Logan Mankins left the game in the second quarter with a knee injury - but McCown deserves a large amount of the blame for either holding on to the ball too long or doing stupid things like lofting careless passes while falling to the ground. McCown did have a nifty 13-yard scramble in the 4.h quarter to put his team in the red zone, but he also lost a fumble due to poor pocket awareness.    Tampa's inability to run the ball hurt McCown.
