   "comment":"Rainey, cost his team a victory by fumbling on the team's real final offensive drive.    As you can imagine, Vincent Jackson was hurt by McCown's ineptitude. Jackson hauled in 4 balls for just 36 yards. Mike Evans outgained him by the minimal amount (5-37), though he had a touchdown wiped out because the officials ruled that he stepped out of the back of the end zone.    As mentioned, Derek Anderson was infinitely superior to McCown. A sober Anderson went 24-of-34 for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Cam Newton watched from the sideline while he wasn't running into the huddle during TV timeouts. Anderson made just 2 mistakes in this contest. The first was missing Greg Olsen for a touchdown in the second half. The other was hurling a ball that should have been intercepted at the end of the 4.h quarter. Safety Dashon Goldson inexplicably had the ball sail through his hands. Had he caught it, there was a great chance he would've run the ball back for 6. The Buccaneers did force a punt, but Rainey fumbled on the ensuing possession, effectively ending the game. It helped Anderson's cause that he had a superior receiver to throw to. "

   "comment":"Rainey screw-up on a kick return. Rainey fielded a kickoff at the 3-yard line and inexplicably fell out of bounds. That put the Giants in a horrible field position and forced a quick punt, which the Packers turned into a score. It also obviously helped that Rodgers was on fire in the second half. His final numbers were 25-of-40 for 362 yards and 4 touchdowns. However, prior to the Hail Mary, he was only 10-of-21 for 113 yards and a score. That means that his numbers in the second half, plus the final play prior to the break looked like this: 15-of-19, 249 yards and 3 touchdowns. There was simply nothing the Giants could do about that. Sure, they were missing "
