   "comment":"Keenan Robinson and Kerrigan played well.    Finally, Washington's special teams were a mess. Not only did that unit have the blocked punt for a touchdown, but it also committed a hilarious play on a punt return where a Redskins blocker rocked his own punt returner out of bounds to cancel out a return with plenty of room to run.

Keenum managed to drive deep into New York territory twice after that, but sailed a horrible ball into double coverage, which was picked off. He had another interception, but ",
