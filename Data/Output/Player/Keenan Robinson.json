Not only did that unit have the blocked punt for a touchdown, but it also committed a hilarious play on a punt return where a Redskins blocker rocked his own punt returner out of bounds to cancel out a return with plenty of room to run.

However, the turnovers stopped coming in, as New York took much better care of the football in the second half.
