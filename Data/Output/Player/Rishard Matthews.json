   "comment":"Matthews, who raced down the field for a 48-yard gain. Tannehill was lucky it wasn't intercepted, but it set up a field goal for Miami. Robinson kept coming as he went up over a defensive back to haul in a 52-yard bomb from Bortles. That led to a field goal for the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Bortles took off on a 26-yard run to convert a third down. He finished the drive by finding Robinson, who was running wide open down the middle of the field, for a 46-yard touchdown. Robinson burned safety Walt Aikens on a double-move to get wide open. Miami answered with 19- and 26-yard completions to tight end Jordan Cameron. On third-and-goal, Tannehill scrambled before finding running back Damian Williams for a score. Just before the half, the Dolphins missed a 42-yard field goal, and the Jaguars completed a couple of passes before Jason Myers made a 58-yard field goal to give Jacksonville a 20-13 lead. To start the third quarter, Tannehill hit Jarvis Landry in the deep middle for a 36-yard gain. A play later, Landry took a run for 29 yards. A few other gains moved the ball to the 5-yard line before Tannehill threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jake Stoneburner to tie the game at 20. After that score, both defenses hunkered down and forced a string of punts. The Jaguars came close to the winning score with 3 minutes remaining when Jared Odrick beat Miami left tackle replacement Jason Fox for a blind-side strip-sack. Fox recovered the fumble at the 1-yard line, but that play still set up the Dolphins to end up punting. Jacksonville put together a drive to move into field goal range that was led by a 19-yard pass to Allen Hurns, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on Olivier Vernon, and some runs by T.J. Yeldon. That set up a 28-yard field goal by Myers to take the lead with less than a minute remaining. The Dolphins had 1 chance with 40 seconds remaining, but they went 4.and-out as the Jacksonville defense slammed the door. Linebacker Telvin Smith broke up Miami's pass on 4.h-and-1 to clinch Jacksonville's first win of the 2015 season.    Ryan Tannehill completed 30-of-44 passes for 359 yards with 2 scores. His play wasn't as sparkling as the numbers suggest, but he was the only offense Miami had.    The Dolphins had no rushing attack to speak of as Lamar Miller was held to 14 yards on 10 carries. Miami's rushing attack was putrid, though it should be noted that Miller was hindered by an ankle injury. Miller is expected to bounce back, so you can buy him low from a disappointed fantasy owner.    Rishard Matthews led the Dolphins' receivers with 6 catches for 115 yards. A fluky performance? Perhaps, but with Jordan Cameron getting hurt, "

   "comment":"Matthews in stride on a slant, and he took off for 53 yards to pay dirt. Shortly later, Jarvis Landry broke off a 50-yard touchdown reception. He ran an out route to the sideline before slashing all the way across the field while veering downfield to dart into the end zone. Lamar Miller was up next to gash the Texans' defense with a 29-yard run. A few plays later, Tannehill hooked up with Landry for a 10-yard touchdown on a crossing route. Tannehill added his 4.h touchdown pass of the half with a 54-yard screen pass to Miller. He ran untouched into the end zone. If that wasn't bad enough, Texans tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz bobbled an easy catch, and Reshad Jones caught the deflection with a quick return of 23-yards for a touchdown. Under 3 minutes before the half, Lamar Miller ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run. Miami took a 41-0 lead into the locker room. Obviously, the second half was all garbage time. The Texans produced a fumble from the Dolphins' Damian Williams, and that set up a 7-yard touchdown pass to Arian Foster. Shortly later, Foster added another touchdown on a short run and Nate Washington caught a 27-yard score. Miami then tacked on a 53-yard field goal, and Washington had another short touchdown catch to conclude the scoring.    Ryan Tannehill dominated Houston. He was 18-of-19 for 282 yards with 4 touchdowns. It was an easy day at the office for Tannehill. Miami seemed to have the perfect play call throughout the first half.    Lamar Miller was awesome. He ripped off 175 yards on 14 carries with 1 touchdown rushing. He added 3 receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. All of this occurred in the first half. The Texans were incapable of defending Miller.    Jarvis Landry led Miami through the air with 5 catches for 83 yards and 2 scores. Rishard Matthews (3-75-1) also was impressive.    "

   "comment":"Matthews, giving the Titans a quick score and the lead, which Tenessee would never relinquish. Mariota did a great job of moving the chains the entire afternoon; he was 7-of-13 on third-down conversions, as he absolutely murdered the Browns on several third-and-long situations. He constantly fired toward Kendall Wright, who beat Williams and safety Derrick Kindred like a rented mule the entire contest. Mariota finished 17-of-24 for 284 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception to go along with 64 rushing yards on 7 attempts. By my count, Mariota threw only 2 poor passes on the afternoon. One was a dangerous heave into heavy traffic in the first half. The second was the pick, which was a late throw down the middle that was made when Mariota was off-balance. He made a similar pass at Houston, but it's a positive that Mariota limited his mistakes in this contest.    As mentioned, Mariota targeted Kendall Wright heavily. Wright looked like his former self, and if you were somehow asleep over the past several years, you may have assumed that he has performed this way the entire time. Wright caught 8 of his 9 targets for 133 yards and a touchdown, as no 1 on the Browns could cover him with Joe Haden out of the lineup. Rishard Matthews (3-70) and Anthony Fasano caught Mariota's other touchdowns, while Delanie Walker was limited to just 1 catch (21 yards)."

   "comment":"Matthews lost a fumble inside the 5-yard line. This allowed the Chiefs to score a touchdown on the next possession with the help of a long Jeremy Maclin catch. Mariota was then strip-sacked in his own territory, and then he followed that up with an underthrow that was snatched in the air with 1 hand by Kansas City's Ron Parker. At that point in the game, it appeared as though the Titans were going to shoot themselves in the foot enough to ensure a crucial loss. However, they showed resilience and never quit. Despite wasting all of their timeouts - they ran out of stoppages with 7 minutes remaining - they were able to mount a comeback. They scored what appeared to be a game-tying touchdown, but went for 2 and failed to convert. Following a Kansas City punt, the Titans were able to put themselves into field-goal range to get the unlikely victory.    Considering the extremely cold temperatures in Kansas City, the better running game was expected to win. Thus, it's no wonder that the Titans prevailed despite all of their early blunders. They have the superior ground attack, and their run defense is better than what the Chiefs have in that regard. That proved to be the case in this matchup, as DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry combined for nearly 150 rushing yards. Murray had double the amount of carries, 18-9, and he outgained Henry, 89-58, but Henry scored 2 touchdowns. Murray was a big factor in the passing attack, catching 5 balls for 52 yards.    Marcus Mariota had his skeptics entering this afternoon, as this was the coldest game the native Hawaiian would ever start in his football career. Considering the conditions - as well as Kansas City's pass rush - the second-year signal-caller performed relatively well, outside of the 2 aforementioned mistakes. Mariota finished 19-of-33 for 241 yards and the pick. He hit a big play in the early going on a flea-flicker, firing a downfield pass to Matthews for 46 yards. Mariota was a bit lucky the pass didn't get picked off, as it was thrown into double coverage. He did a great job of leading his team on a pair of 4.h-quarter drives to win a crucial game that allowed the Titans to keep the tie with the Texans atop the AFC South.    Speaking of Matthews, he managed to lead the team in receiving yards, accumulating 105 yards on 4 catches. He did more than make up for his early fumble inside the Kansas City 5-yard line. Outside of Matthews, only 4 Titans caught passes: "

   "comment":"Matthews downfield on a slight overthrow after the receiver beat Telvin Smith; Mariota then threw wide of Delanie Walker for a substantial gain; after that, Mariota was almost picked by Jalen Ramsey with a late throw across the middle of the field. Ramsey would eventually get his turnover when he snatched a Cassel pick-six.    The Titans couldn't move the chains because the tough Jacksonville run defense prevented DeMarco Murray (14-42) and Derrick Henry (4-13) from doing anything. Mariota didn't scramble much either, running just twice for 3 yards.    Thanks to the struggles of Mariota and Cassel, no Titans player had more than 50 receiving yards. Harry Douglas (5-48) and Tajae Sharpe (3-48) led the way, while Matthews (3-31) and Walker (3-23) caught touchdowns.    Moving on to the victors, teams typically rally around a new coach, and that's exactly what the Jaguars did with Doug Marrone replacing the utterly incompetent Gus Bradley. The Jaguars played with a tremendous amount of effort, while the Titans, fresh off emotional, difficult victories versus the Broncos and Chiefs, appeared to be sleepwalking, taking this game for granted. As a result, Jacksonville had its best performance of the season, finally displaying the potential the Jaguar truthers have been clamoring about all of these years.    "

   "comment":"Matthews, who secured 4 of the 7 balls thrown his way for 70 yards and a touchdown. Matthews' sole blemish dropped pass in the second half.    Murray, who also fits under the category of banged-up Tennessee players, missed some action in this game with an injury, though he returned to the field in the second half. Despite this, Murray had more carries than Henry, 9-8. Unsurprisingly, Henry generated more yardage than Henry, 26-19. Henry, who scored a touchdown, needs to get more work than Murray because he's just better at this stage of their careers. Still, neither had much running room against a Baltimore defense that has been better against ground attacks with "

   "comment":"Matthews committed a terrible drop, and Corey Davis fumbled the ball into the end zone, which resulted in a touchback.    I mentioned earlier that Murray found the end zone on the initial drive. He actually scored thrice. He picked up 42 yards and 2 scores on the ground. He also caught 4 passes for 30 receiving yards and his third touchdown. Derrick Henry was more effective on the ground (11-52), which wasn't a surprise because Murray came into the game with an injury. It's unclear why Tennessee gave Murray so much work; it wouldn't been a better strategy to allow him to heal. Instead, Murray looked sluggish and risked further injury.    Matthews, who had the aforementioned dropped touchdown, was second on the team with 50 receiving yards on 5 catches. However, his drop not only took 7 points off the board; Tennessee didn't even get any points on the drive because of a missed field goal. "
