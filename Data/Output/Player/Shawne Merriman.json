   "comment":"Merriman also have a solid performance despite playing with a shredded knee? As you can tell by Carolina's offensive output, not at all. Merriman rotated in and out of the lineup, and manged only 1 tackle. The Chargers couldn't contain the Panthers, much like they struggled to stop the Charlie Frye-led Seahawks in the preseason. Hey, I have the Broncos winning the division, so even though San Diego lost, the team performed better than I expected them to, given that Rivers and Gates looked sharp.    As for Carolina's skill players, "

   "comment":"Merriman entered this contest without a sack. I guess playing the Raiders was the medicine he needed because he sacked Russell twice.    The Chargers, who out-gained the Raiders, 346-180, have now won 13 in a row against Oakland. As a reference, the last time the Raiders beat San Diego, Rich Gannon, Tyrone Wheatley, Charlie Garner, Jerry Rice and Tim Brown were their offensive stars. That's right, Oakland fans - your team actually had talent at 1 point.   "
