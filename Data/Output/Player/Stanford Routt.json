   "comment":"Stanford Routt. A lot of time came off the clock, but the comeback was still in play after a well-executed onside kick was recovered. With the outcome really on the line, however, McCoy threw 3 straight incompletions, and the game was over. Obviously, the bigger picture is how the Raiders figure out their quarterback depth chart for the rest of the season assuming Campbell is gone. Boller is not going to carry a winning team, and rookie Terrelle Pryor is not even close to being able to appear in a game; much less start. Perhaps the easiest move would be to call free agent David Garrard, who has some success riding a running game, having led Jacksonville to the playoffs. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

With a timeout in their pocket, the Raiders were in good shape, but Palmer lost all pocket presence and was sacked again by Avril after what seemed like an eternity of trying to find an open receiver.

   "comment":"Stanford Routt stepped in front of a pass intended for Bowe, ending the march. Even though the Raiders did nothing on offense, their stud punter Lechler changed field position, putting Kansas City on its own 10-yard line. This was crucial because on the next drive Crennel rolled the dice trying to convert a 4th-and-1. Battle was stopped. Oakland took advantage of the short field, marching 30 yards to cash in an easy field goal for a 13-6 advantage. Early in the second quarter, Coach Jackson passed on trying to convert a 4th-and-1, electing instead to punt and play field position. Sometimes conservative works and gambling backfires. Still, with 2:57 remaining, I was tweeting that I expected the Chiefs to tie the game with a touchdown, adding to the legacy of tight finishes in this rivalry. Sure enough, Orton went to Bowe twice for 28 yards to set them up just shy of midfield. Then, "
