   "comment":"Browns for a very questionable pass interference on the Hail Mary, which I've never seen before. Stafford, meanwhile, was down with a left shoulder injury. Daunte Culpepper ran onto the field to take the snap, but Eric Mangina foolishly called a timeout. With the stoppage in play, Stafford was allowed to take the field again. On the final play of the game, he rolled out and found Brandon Pettigrew in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. Good job, officials and Mangina Lions!!    It'll be a shame if Stafford is out for a while because he just had a great performance, going 26-of-43 for 422 yards, 5 touchdowns and 2 picks. After that 5-interception debaclation at Seattle, Stafford has turned it around the past 2 weeks. The good news is that the injury was to his non-throwing shoulder.    Stafford's 5 scores all went to different targets: Calvin Johnson (7 catches, 161 yards), Brandon Pettigrew (6 catches, 72 yards), Aaron Brown, Will Heller and Kevin Smith."
