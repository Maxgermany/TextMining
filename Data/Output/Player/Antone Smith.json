   "comment":"Antone Smith fumble at its own 1-yard line, but following a 3.and-out, Hester did this thing and expanded the lead to 35-0. All the Tampa players could do was sit on the sidelines, staring vacantly into the distance.    Ryan finished 21-of-24 for 286 yards and 3 yards. He was pulled in the third quarter because the game was so out of hand. It was nice to see him so locked in after last week's loss. Sure, the Buccaneers were missing some very key personnel in Gerald McCoy, Michael Johnson and Mason Foster, but Ryan didn't have Roddy White's services. He also lost Harry Douglas (2 catches, 14 yards, TD) to an injury in the second quarter. Douglas walked to the locker room with a limp. With White out, Julio Jones was more productive than usual, catching 9 balls for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Not bad for 2.and-a-half quarters of work. Jones was the recipient of that third-and-17 heave that helped put this game away, but his best reception was a remarkable over-the-shoulder catch in the third quarter that turned out to be 40-yard score.    Aside from Hester's rushing touchdown, the Falcons scored twice on the ground with Steven Jackson (14-54) and Antone Smith (4-50) in garbage time. Jackson wasn't great or anything, but he didn't look like a slow plodder in this game. The offensive line was most responsible for his production, however, as it blasted open massive holes for him versus a depleted defense. Meanwhile, "
