   "comment":"Smith fumble at its own 1-yard line, but following a 3.and-out, Hester did this thing and expanded the lead to 35-0. All the Tampa players could do was sit on the sidelines, staring vacantly into the distance.    Ryan finished 21-of-24 for 286 yards and 3 yards. He was pulled in the third quarter because the game was so out of hand. It was nice to see him so locked in after last week's loss. Sure, the Buccaneers were missing some very key personnel in Gerald McCoy, Michael Johnson and Mason Foster, but Ryan didn't have Roddy White's services. He also lost Harry Douglas (2 catches, 14 yards, TD) to an injury in the second quarter. Douglas walked to the locker room with a limp. With White out, Julio Jones was more productive than usual, catching 9 balls for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Not bad for 2.and-a-half quarters of work. Jones was the recipient of that third-and-17 heave that helped put this game away, but his best reception was a remarkable over-the-shoulder catch in the third quarter that turned out to be 40-yard score.    Aside from Hester's rushing touchdown, the Falcons scored twice on the ground with Steven Jackson (14-54) and Antone Smith (4-50) in garbage time. Jackson wasn't great or anything, but he didn't look like a slow plodder in this game. The offensive line was most responsible for his production, however, as it blasted open massive holes for him versus a depleted defense. Meanwhile, "

   "comment":"Smith following that disastrous meltdown against the Lions in London? That seems like ages ago, because those very same Falcons are now in first place of the NFC South. They're just 4-6, but in the wake of this victory, as well as New Orleans' epically horrific showing against the Bengals, Atlanta has moved into a playoff spot. Things didn't begin smoothly for the Falcons, at least on offense. They had a sloppy red-zone possession in which Matt Ryan took a sack because his receivers couldn't get open for some reason. Ryan also missed some receivers, including Julio Jones twice - once for a potential big gain, and another time when he threw way too high on a receiver screen. However, Ryan ultimately got into a groove. He threw a touchdown to Roddy White and then led a game-winning field goal drive following an improbable Carolina comeback.    Ryan finished 31-of-45 for 268 yards and the touchdown to White, who caught 8 of his team-leading 12 targets for 75 yards. White outgained Jones, who finished with 6 grabs for 59 yards. As mentioned, Ryan had some issues connecting to his stud receiver. Jones should've had a bigger afternoon, and I'm sure he'll rebound soon.    Part of the problem for Atlanta's offense early on was that Steven Jackson was completely ineffective. Jackson mustered just 41 yards on 17 carries, and he didn't have a gain longer than 5 yards. It seemed like a wasted down every single time Jackson touched the football, and it's very puzzling as to why Devonta Freeman (6-28) and Antone Smith (1 touch) aren't getting more of a workload.    The Panthers, meanwhile, deserve credit for not quitting late. Things were going miserably for them early on, as they were down 16-3. "
