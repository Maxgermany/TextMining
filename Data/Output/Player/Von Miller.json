   "comment":"Von Miller then made his presence felt with a strip-sack that was recovered by Derek Wolfe at the Redskins' 24-yard line. That led to a field goal. The Broncos got the ball back and were driving for more points when E.J. Biggers dropped an interception, but Jordan Pugh caught the deflection. Griffin gave it right back 2 plays later as Pierre Garcon fell down and the pass was caught by Chris Harris. Denver put the game on ice with a Demaryius Thomas 35-yard touchdown on short pass. Griffin was hammered and had a pass flutter to Rahim Moore for his second interception. Manning gave it right back when DeAngelo Hall ripped the ball out of the hands of Thomas for an interception. Kirk Cousins came in to finish out the game and threw a pick-six to Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Shaun Philips added an interception in garbage time.    Manning finished completing 30-of-44 for 354 yards with 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.    Griffin was 15-of-30 for 132 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions. Jordan Reed (8-90) led the Washington receivers. Pierre Garcon (7-46) and Griffin came close to some long completions, but their timing was off - in part because of the Denver pass rush.    Terrence Knighton had a sack and a lot of pressures for the Broncos. Danny Trevathan picked up 10 tackles and a forced fumble. Von Miller also played well. Wolfe had a huge sack coming up the middle.    For the first 3 quarters, the Redskins' defense played pretty well. The defenders didn't get help from their offense when they needed it, and the game spiraled out of control. "

   "comment":"Von Miller was out, yet Denver sacked Rivers twice on the opening drive and 3 times on the first 2 possessions. Rivers, as a consequence, looked rattled early on. He was just 5-of-8 for only 20 yards in the first half. He was hot at the end though, as mentioned, so he was able to finish 18-of-27 for 217 yards and 2 touchdowns. 2. The Chargers seemed to suffer a billion concussions in this contest. Their defenders continuously hit each other. First, Jahleel Addae crashed into Manti Te'o and knocked him out. Reggie Walker then collided with Marcus Gilchrist, so the safety had to leave the game. Addae was then blasted by Melvin Ingram. Punter Mike Scifres also got hurt. 3. San Diego killed itself with unforced errors. I mentioned the dropped interception, but the most prominent issue had to do with being offsides. The Chargers were whistled for a whopping 5 neutral zone infraction penalties. They also had a missed field goal in which Nick Novak slipped on the turf, while backup tight end Ladarius Green dropped a long reception.    I mentioned Rivers' stats; it's also worth noting that he had a dropped interception on a pass thrown behind Keenan Allen. Both of Rivers' scores went to Allen, who had way more yardage than anyone else on the Chargers; he caught 6 balls for 142 yards and 2 touchdowns. Antonio Gates (2-10) barely did anything. <div class=dfpAdSlots> <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

The result was a more competitive battle in which the Panthers led by double digits at halftime. And yet, they still lost. The difference, once again, was Denver's defense. The Broncos' stop unit didn't fare all that well in the first half, but Wade Phillips made some tremendous adjustments at intermission. Following halftime, the Panthers gained just 123 net yards (210 beforehand), and Newton went just 7-of-16 for 83 yards and an interception in the final 2 quarters. He took some crushing hits. On 1 instance, he was down for a while on the sideline and appeared to be injured. On another, it seemed like he sustained a concussion, and Derek Anderson even began warming up. Newton stayed on the field, however, and even had the Panthers in a position to kick the game-winning field goal, but "

While Denver's defense nearly matched its offense's production, that doesn't mean that Siemian played poorly either. Siemian had a solid showing, going 22-of-33 for 266 yards. However, he did throw a careless interception that should've been returned for 6. but cornerback Darius Butler inexplicably fell down without being touched, sustaining some sort of mysterious injury on the play. Butler was yet another Indianapolis cornerback who was knocked out of the game, meaning the Colts now have 5 corners who are injured. That's completely absurd. Despite that ugly interception, Siemian did a decent job of managing the game with some accurate throws. He has done a solid job of replacing Peyton Manning thus far, looking like a poor-man's Alex Smith.    Only 1 Bronco generated more than 46 receiving yards, and that would be Demaryius Thomas, whose status was shaky heading into kickoff. Thomas dropped a pass, so his afternoon could've been even better. Emmanuel Sanders (3-39) couldn't get going with Siemian, though he was the recipient of a bogus call in the second half that ultimately led to a Denver field goal.

Anderson also had an amazing spin move to advance the chains on third down.    It's hard to say whether the Colts are worse off in the secondary or the offensive line. Indianapolis' blocking unit couldn't protect Luck at all, and the Colt quarterback barely completed half of his passes in the process. He finished 21-of-40 for only 197 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned 2 turnovers.
