   "comment":"Jermichael Finley dropped the ball on third down at the goal line. Atlanta went up 14-0 almost instantly and led at the half, 14-6. The Packers looked like they were in trouble. They couldn't stop the Falcons, while left tackle Chad Clifton was knocked out of the game with a leg injury. Aaron Rodgers seemed a bit discombobulated. He apparently didn't trust the protection and hurried some of his throws. And then the second half happened. Rodgers was on fire after the break, finishing 26-of-39 for 396 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dom Capers, meanwhile, made a great adjustment, switching to more man coverage to really slow down Matt Ryan. After starting 8-of-10, Ryan completed fewer than 50 percent of his attempts. He finished 18-of-32 for 167 yards, 1 score and 2 picks (1 interception was the result of a dropped Roddy White pass).    Rodgers has now maintained a quarterback rating of at least 111 in every single game this year. I don't need to tell you how amazing that is. What's also amazing is that a whopping 12 Packers caught a pass Sunday night. Leading the way were James Jones (5-140, TD), Greg Jennings (4-82, TD) and Jermichael Finley (4-67).    As for Ryan's targets, "

Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage. This included some red-zone ineptness in the second quarter. "
