They couldn't stop the Falcons, while left tackle Chad Clifton was knocked out of the game with a leg injury. Aaron Rodgers seemed a bit discombobulated. He apparently didn't trust the protection and hurried some of his throws. And then the second half happened. Rodgers was on fire after the break, finishing 26-of-39 for 396 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dom Capers, meanwhile, made a great adjustment, switching to more man coverage to really slow down Matt Ryan. After starting 8-of-10, Ryan completed fewer than 50 percent of his attempts. He finished 18-of-32 for 167 yards, 1 score and 2 picks (1 interception was the result of a dropped Roddy White pass).    Rodgers has now maintained a quarterback rating of at least 111 in every single game this year. I don't need to tell you how amazing that is. What's also amazing is that a whopping 12 Packers caught a pass Sunday night. Leading the way were James Jones (5-140, TD), Greg Jennings (4-82, TD) and Jermichael Finley (4-67).    As for Ryan's targets, "

   "comment":"Finley, who fell onto the goal line. New York answered when Manning tossed a 42-yard pass to Victor Cruz to set up a field goal. In the second quarter, each defense stepped up with some interceptions. Green Bay struck first as Clay Matthews jumped a pass in the flat and promptly returned the pick 38-yards for a touchdown. Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn then victimized Rodgers and that set up a short touchdown run from Brandon Jacobs. The Packers struck back as Rodgers put together a drive where he moved the ball with his arm and legs. He capped it by tossing an easy touchdown pass to Donald Driver. He was wide open because of busted coverage, and no defender was within 15 yards of him. Matthews put the Packers in position for more points on a sack-fumble of Manning that was recovered by teammate B.J. Raji. Mason Crosby missed a 43-yard field goal, but Green Bay was up 21-17 at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Rodgers out-executed the New York defense on another drive. He moved the ball down the field with some superb passes. To finish the series, Rodgers lofted in a 20-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1-handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1, 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2-point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

   "comment":"Finley. The athletic tight end beat his initial defender while Chiefs safety Sabby Piscitelli was late coming over the top (before being cut, Tampa Bay fans referred to him as Saba-stinko Suck-atelli). Piscitelli gets significant playing time, and needless to say, Kansas City is greatly missing injured safety Eric Berry. That pass set up a short touchdown toss from Rodgers to Donald Driver. The Chiefs answered with a field goal to take a 9-7 lead. Orton tossed a 39-yard pass to tight end Leonard Pope and a 17-yard pass to Jonathan Baldwin to set up the score. The Packers' offense continued to struggle even as Piscitelli dropped an interception. In the interim, Orton tossed a perfectly thrown corner route to Pope for a 33-yard gain to Green Bay's 2-yard line. The Packer defense came up with another stand to force yet a fourth field goal. Orton kept coming as the Green Bay pass rush was horrendous which gave the signal caller all day to throw the ball (and furthermore, not even be sacked). A big pass to tight end Anthony Becht set the Chiefs up at the 5-yard line, and Jackie Battle charged into the end zone. The Packers answered with a late fourth-quarter drive and a short touchdown run from Rodgers. Green Bay's onside-kick attempt failed, and Kansas City was able to run out the clock. Interim Chiefs head coach Romeo Crennel wants to be the permanent head coach, and he led a great performance for his resume. His defense played a superbly against the Packers' potent offense. Hali had 3 sacks and a forced fumble in a dominant performance. Rodgers was held to 17-of-35 for 235 yards and 1 touchdown. Finley (5-83) led the Packers in receiving while Ryan Grant ran for 66 yards on 12 carries."

   "comment":"Finley for a 2-yard touchdown. With Josh McCown on the other side, the Bears didn't seem to stand a chance. But that's why divisional rivalries are so fun. Chicago's offense moved the ball effectively with tough runs by Kahlil Bell, and short, accurate throws from McCown. The defense, meanwhile, buckled down and forced Green Bay into 3 consecutive 3-and-outs. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. The Bears killed themselves with stupid mistakes (penalties, missed field goal, 2 interceptions), while Rodgers caught fire, continuously torching beleaguered cornerback Zackary Bowman. Rodgers was ultimately pulled when the score was 35-10.    Rodgers went 21-of-29 for 283 yards and 5 touchdowns. He was sacked only once, which is key because of what happened in Kansas City last week. The Packers as a whole played a perfect game, committing no turnovers and zero penalties.    Rodgers' threw a pair of scores to Jordy Nelson (6-115) and James Jones (4-50). The fifth, as mentioned, went to Finley (3-20).    The Packers didn't really try to run the ball at all.

Aaron Rodgers went 21-of-33 for 243 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception (with 57 rushing yards). It was mediocre early - he overthrew an open Jordy Nelson for a deep touchdown - and it was ugly late, as Rodgers clearly missed both Benson and Finley. The offensive line was also an issue; the Colts constantly swarmed the backfield and managed to bring down Rodgers 5 times. "

Of course, Rodgers' outstanding performance is just 1 reason why the Packers were victorious. The other is Houston's unbelievable lack of discipline. The Texans gave Green Bay 14 free points because of a trio of dumb penalties. DeVier Posey was offside on a punt, which allowed Rodgers to find Nelson for a 41-yard score on the very next play. In the third quarter, a Mason Crosby field goal was wiped off the board because of a Connor Barwin leaping penalty. Houston stopped them again, but Danieal Manning hit a Packer in the head for an unsportsmanlike penalty. Rodgers then found Nelson for another score.    Nelson had 3 of Rodgers' 6 touchdowns. He finished with 9 catches for 121 yards. Jones found the end zone twice, while Tom Crabtree had the sixth score. Randall Cobb (7-102) had a nice performance without crossing the goal line, while Finley (2-12) sucked yet again.    "
