   "comment":"Jermichael Finley, who fell onto the goal line. New York answered when Manning tossed a 42-yard pass to Finley, who fell onto the goal line. New York answered when Manning tossed a 42-yard pass to Victor Cruz to set up a field goal. In the second quarter, each defense stepped up with some interceptions. Green Bay struck first as Clay Matthews jumped a pass in the flat and promptly returned the pick 38-yards for a touchdown. Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn then victimized Rodgers and that set up a short touchdown run from Brandon Jacobs. The Packers struck back as Rodgers put together a drive where he moved the ball with his arm and legs. He capped it by tossing an easy touchdown pass to Donald Driver. He was wide open because of busted coverage, and no defender was within 15 yards of him. Matthews put the Packers in position for more points on a sack-fumble of Manning that was recovered by teammate B.J. Raji. Mason Crosby missed a 43-yard field goal, but Green Bay was up 21-17 at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Rodgers out-executed the New York defense on another drive. He moved the ball down the field with some superb passes. To finish the series, Rodgers lofted in a 20-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, who beat Prince Amukamara on an excellent route. Manning answered with a 51-yard bomb to wide out Hakeem Nicks, who made a tough catch over a defender. A bit later, he made a phenomenal 1.handed catch while running to the back corner of the end zone on a fade route. A nice drive by Manning then led to a field goal from Lawrence Tynes, and the Giants found themselves trailing by only 1. 28-27. The defenses stiffened and forced some punts. Eventually, the Packers were too hard to contain. Rodgers completed a 21-yard gain to Jordy Nelson, who made a miraculous catch, getting his feet down before going out of bounds at the New York's 10-yard line. Rodgers added to the lead with a touchdown toss to Driver. The Giants responded with a outstanding drive by Manning. He moved the ball down the field and threw a short touchdown pass to Nicks. New York then ran the ball in for a 2.point conversion to tie the game at 35 with 58 seconds remaining. Manning left too much time on the clock, however, as Rodgers put the ball in field goal range with good gains to Finley and Nelson. Cosby nailed a 31-yard field goal on the final play of the game. The Packers are now 12-0 with the No. 1 seed in the NFC essentially clinched. The Giants fall to 6-6, but they played tough against the defending champs. Rodgers went 28-of-46 for 369 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for 32 yards. Jennings caught 4 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Nelson also had 94 yards, but on 4 catches. Manning was 23-of-40 for 347 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception. Cruz led the Giants with 119 yards on 7 receptions. Nicks caught 7 passes for 88 yards and 2 scores. Jacobs ran for 59 yards on 8 carries.   "

   "comment":"Jermichael Finley. The athletic tight end beat his initial defender while Chiefs safety Finley. The athletic tight end beat his initial defender while Chiefs safety Sabby Piscitelli was late coming over the top (before being cut, Tampa Bay fans referred to him as Saba-stinko Suck-atelli). Piscitelli gets significant playing time, and needless to say, Kansas City is greatly missing injured safety Eric Berry. That pass set up a short touchdown toss from Rodgers to Donald Driver. The Chiefs answered with a field goal to take a 9-7 lead. Orton tossed a 39-yard pass to tight end Leonard Pope and a 17-yard pass to Jonathan Baldwin to set up the score. The Packers' offense continued to struggle even as Piscitelli dropped an interception. In the interim, Orton tossed a perfectly thrown corner route to Pope for a 33-yard gain to Green Bay's 2-yard line. The Packer defense came up with another stand to force yet a 4.h field goal. Orton kept coming as the Green Bay pass rush was horrendous which gave the signal caller all day to throw the ball (and furthermore, not even be sacked). A big pass to tight end Anthony Becht set the Chiefs up at the 5-yard line, and Jackie Battle charged into the end zone. The Packers answered with a late 4.h-quarter drive and a short touchdown run from Rodgers. Green Bay's onside-kick attempt failed, and Kansas City was able to run out the clock. Interim Chiefs head coach Romeo Crennel wants to be the permanent head coach, and he led a great performance for his resume. His defense played a superbly against the Packers' potent offense. Hali had 3 sacks and a forced fumble in a dominant performance. Rodgers was held to 17-of-35 for 235 yards and 1 touchdown. Finley (5-83) led the Packers in receiving while Ryan Grant ran for 66 yards on 12 carries."

But that's why divisional rivalries are so fun. Chicago's offense moved the ball effectively with tough runs by Kahlil Bell, and short, accurate throws from McCown. The defense, meanwhile, buckled down and forced Green Bay into 3 consecutive 3.and-outs. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. The Bears killed themselves with stupid mistakes (penalties, missed field goal, 2 interceptions), while Rodgers caught fire, continuously torching beleaguered cornerback Zackary Bowman. Rodgers was ultimately pulled when the score was 35-10.    Rodgers went 21-of-29 for 283 yards and 5 touchdowns. He was sacked only once, which is key because of what happened in Kansas City last week. The Packers as a whole played a perfect game, committing no turnovers and zero penalties.    Rodgers' threw a pair of scores to Jordy Nelson (6-115) and James Jones (4-50). The fifth, as mentioned, went to Finley (3-20).    The Packers didn't really try to run the ball at all.

Drops plagued the Packers in their loss to the Chiefs, and that issue festered once again. - Aaron Rodgers missed a wide-open Jennings for a touchdown on the opening drive. The Packers would have to settle for a field goal. - John Kuhn lost a fumble in Giants' territory during the second quarter. - Rodgers then lost a fumble of his own in New York territory on the opening drive of the third quarter. - Rodgers had a wide-open Finley on a third down with 13 minutes to go, but missed him. He was sacked on the following play, which turned the ball over on downs. - Grant fumbled the ball away down 10 in the 4.h quarter. Chase Blackburn returned it inside the Green Bay 5-yard line. Eli Manning threw the game-sealing touchdown on the very next play to give his team a 30-13 lead.    Another Packer gaffe was a Jennings' lost fumble on the second drive. It was initially ruled a fumble, but then the officials discussed it and said he was down by contact. Tom Coughlin challenged the play because it was pretty apparent that Jennings did in fact fumble. FOX announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were even speculating on where the ball would be spotted. However, official Bill Leavy ruled that Jennings was down and offered no explanation. The Packers maintained possession and would go on to score a touchdown on the drive. If you're not familiar with Leavy, he's the inept/crooked ref who botched/fixed the Steelers-Seahawks Super Bowl. I don't know how the hell he's still permitted to officiate playoff games. He needs to be fired because allowing him to work another game would be completely irresponsible. He's either bought or just completely awful at his job.    The Packers also screwed themselves defensively. They barely got any pressure on Manning, while their tackling efforts were atrocious. I don't have enough fingers to count how many tackles they missed. It really hurt them when Hakeem Nicks caught an intermediate pass and was able to elude several pitiful defenders to score a 66-yard touchdown. That wasn't even the craziest Nicks score. Manning launched a Hail Mary on the final play of the first half, and New York Nicks came down with it in the end zone. The Packers covered the Hail Mary very poorly - almost as if they had no idea it was coming. Nicks finished with 7 grabs for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns. Mario Manningham (3-31) also scored. Victor Cruz (5-74) was also a factor.    The quarterback throwing the ball to these guys was absolutely incredible. Manning went 21-of-33 for 330 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. He had no pressure in his face, as mentioned, but what he did on third down was amazing. The Giants were 8-of-16 on third downs, thanks to his clutch throws.    On the other side, Rodgers had good numbers (26-of-46, 264 yards, 2 TDs, INT) despite all of those aforementioned drops. With a non-existent rushing attack, he picked up 66 yards on 7 scrambles, most of which came on third down.    One Packer who did not have any drops was "

Of course, Rodgers' outstanding performance is just 1 reason why the Packers were victorious. The other is Houston's unbelievable lack of discipline. The Texans gave Green Bay 14 free points because of a trio of dumb penalties. DeVier Posey was offside on a punt, which allowed Rodgers to find Nelson for a 41-yard score on the very next play. In the third quarter, a Mason Crosby field goal was wiped off the board because of a Connor Barwin leaping penalty. Houston stopped them again, but Danieal Manning hit a Packer in the head for an unsportsmanlike penalty. Rodgers then found Nelson for another score.    Nelson had 3 of Rodgers' 6 touchdowns. He finished with 9 catches for 121 yards. Jones found the end zone twice, while Tom Crabtree had the 6.h score.

Despite Joe Flacco's decent line - 20-of-34, 342 yards, 2 touchdowns - the crowd booed the offense for most of the afternoon. The Ravens had so many plays of zero or negative yardage. This included some red-zone ineptness in the second quarter. "
