Tannehill had some accuracy issues at times throughout the afternoon - his overall numbers were 24-of-35 for 236 yards, 2 touchdowns, a lost fumble and an ugly interception thrown off his back foot - but he was sharp when it mattered most. The Falcons helped Miami clinch an improbable victory with mistakes. "

Tannehill held on to the ball for an eternity, and he's very fortunate that Parkey missed the ensuing field goal that would've won the game for Cleveland. It just goes to show that stats can be very misleading sometimes. Despite the blunders I mentioned earlier, Tannehill did a good job of moving his team down the field in overtime. He had Miami in field goal range, thanks to a catch by "
