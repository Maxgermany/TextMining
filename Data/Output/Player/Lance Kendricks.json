   "comment":"Kendricks. However, after 2 Jackson runs created a third-down situation, Clemens was intercepted by Tarrell Brown. Smith wasted no time finishing this second-consecutive drive and putting San Francisco on top, completing 2 passes to Michael Crabtree (9-92, 2 TDs) to cover the 34 yards and make it 14-7. Cadillac Williams substituted in for Jackson on the next drive for St. Louis, but again, the team couldn't move the ball, so it flipped back to the 49ers. Having started at their own 33-yard line, which on this day was par for the course, San Francisco executed 2 short runs, which Smith followed by hitting Vernon Davis (8-118) for a gain of 44. However, the red-zone woes that have haunted this offense all year showed up when Smith was sacked, threw incomplete and threw a give up completion to Crabtree. Akers, who now owns the records for field goals made and attempted in a single season, converted to make it 17-7. The 49ers defense was starting to take over, and forced consecutive quick punts sandwiched around their own 3.and-out. Although head coach Jim Harbaugh insisted that his team would not rest anyone, Frank Gore (7-9) was clearly not part of the equation due to an exhausting season of wear and tear. Two runs from Kendall Hunter for a total of 19 yards helped put San Francisco in plus territory, and a completion to Davis made it an easy field goal opportunity for Akers who put the 49ers up 20-7 at halftime when the Rams failed on their final desperation 2.minute drive. To its credit, St. Louis came out firing in the second half. Jackson ripped off a 27-yard run, but the drive stalled. The field position was changed at least, and San Francisco had to punt after a weak ensuing posession.The Rams responded with big gains to Kendricks and Lloyd, keying a drive that resulted in a 49-yard field goal from Josh Brown, trimming the 49ers' lead to 20-10."

   "comment":"Kendricks had the ball hit him right in the numbers as he was standing in the end zone. Still, Keenum was horrible enough that any competent coach would've made a change, yet Fisher stuck with the ineffective veteran.    As for the Panthers, they continue to win following their 1-5 start. They're now 3-5, though there are still some concerns. Their secondary would've given up some big gains if the Rams had a competent quarterback. The offensive line, meanwhile, was getting pushed round by Los Angeles' stalwart front. The Panthers gained just 244 net yards and averaged a putrid 3.9 yards per play.    Cam Newton finished 20-of-32 for 225 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball 7 times, but the Rams were prepared for his scrambles, as he was limited to just 16 yards on the ground. Newton made a big stink about not getting any personal-foul calls, and that continued to be the case. The whistles were silent even though there appeared to be 1 occasion in which he should've drawn a flag, as Mark Barron smashed into him with a helmet-to-helmet hit.    Only 3 Panthers caught more than 2 passes. Kelvin Benjamin led the way with 5 grabs for 76 yards. Greg Olsen (5-52) found the end zone, while Ted Ginn reeled in 5 passes for 40 yards. Ed Dickson (2-17) dropped a pass.    The Panthers couldn't find any running room for Jonathan Stewart, who was limited to 42 yards on 15 carries. Carolina simply couldn't push around Aaron Donald and the Rams' great defensive line.    Moving back to the Rams, they also struggled to run the ball, as Todd Gurley managed only 48 yards on 12 attempts, most of which came on an 18-yard burst. Gurley continued to be a factor in the passing game; he caught 4 passes for 26 receiving yards.    Despite his horrible drop, Kendricks paced the Rams with 7 catches for 90 yards. "

   "comment":"Kendricks on a low throw. At the very end of the game, Goff showed absolutely no urgency. Starting around his own 40-yard line, Goff threw just a 7.yard pass in the middle of the field and then walked to the line of scrimmage despite there being about just 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Jeff Fisher had to bail out his rookie quarterback with a timeout. After 2 incompletions that weren't even close, Goff attempted a Hail Mary on the final snap, but threw the ball into the end zone before any of his teammates could get there. Goff finished 17-of-31 for only 134 yards. I'd give him a C for this performance. He did some good things, and the heavy rain prevented him from completing anything downfield. However, he had accuracy issues at times, and the lack of both awareness and urgency was alarming. I don't understand how any NFL quarterback can throw a short pass over the middle and then walk to the line of scrimmage when there's less than half a minute remaining in regulation.    As for the Dolphins, I still have no idea how they won this game. They literally did nothing all afternoon. Of their first 11 offensive drives, 10 resulted in a punt, while the other finished with a Ryan Tannehill interception. However, following a Greg Zuelein missed field goal without 5 minutes remaining, the Dolphins inexplicably caught fire. Ryan Tannehill led 2 touchdown drives with the help of some horrible Los Angeles penalties, including a ridiculous Aaron Donald helmet-to-helmet cheap shot. Tannehill's second score was to DeVante Parker, which was the decisive touchdown. Tannehill finished 24-of-34 or 172 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception, which was a deep shot into the end zone from midfield. Tannehill, despite the 10 incompletions, had a very rough afternoon. He threw some ugly passes and easily could've been picked off 3 times. Unfortunately for the Rams, T.J. McDonald and Mark Barron were guilty of drops. McDonald's bobble ruined what would've been the easiest interception of his career, as the pass sailed right to him. Tannehill also took 4 sacks, but was hit hard on so many occasions that it's a minor miracle that he survived the game without sustaining an injury.    Tannehill's touchdowns went to Parker (8-79) and Jarvis Landry (5-28). Parker was a monster down the stretch, while Landry suffered an injury on the final drive.    Jay Ajayi posted 77 yards on 16 carries despite missing 2 of his best offensive linemen. However, that's misleading because most of Ajayi's yardage came on 1 36-yard burst. Ajayi couldn't find any room otherwise against Los Angeles' stout front.    Ajayi just barely outgained Todd Gurley, who tallied 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. As with Ajayi, a big chunk of Gurley's yardage came on 1 attempt, a 24-yarder that happened to be a first-quarter touchdown. The Dolphins stacked the line of scrimmage, much like every other team this year, daring the Los Angeles quarterback to beat them. Goff, like Case Keenum, couldn't get the job done to open up some running room for his stud running back.    No Ram accumulated more than 50 receiving yards. Britt led the way with 5 grabs for 43 yards, though he did draw a pass-interference flag on third down near midfield. Kendricks was next (4-38), but he lost a fumble in his own territory when Kiko Alonso stripped the ball out of his arms."

   "comment":"Kendricks led the Rams in receiving with a meager 36 yards.    Todd Gurley was expected to have a huge game versus the 49ers' horrible rush defense, but that never materialized. Gurley finished with just 67 yards on 23 carries. Gurley did manage to score, but he didn't have much blocking, and even when he did, he failed to show the same burst he possessed as a rookie. The FOX announcers commented about this as well. Gurley's inability to pick up chunks of yardage is 1 of the reasons why the Rams failed to hold on to their lead.    The other primary reason for this was that the Rams had yet another epic collapse. We've seen this before, as this contest mirrored the Rams-Dolphins affair from back in Week 11. The Rams led the entire game, and Miami had been doing nothing, but the defense had a meltdown, surrendering 2 touchdowns in a matter of minutes. That's exactly what happened in this game, as the 49ers roared back from down 21-7 to take a lead following a 2.point conversion. Colin Kaepernick was brilliant on the final 2 possessions, but I have to think that it had more to do with the Rams collapsing because Kaepernick really struggled for most of the afternoon. Some of that was his offensive line's inability to block, but Kaepernick also had some pretty poor moments. He floated an interception on a high throw in the early going, leading to a Rams touchdown on a Tavon Austin run. Kaepernick then had his tight end open for a sizable gain, but didn't pull the trigger for some reason. Later, he overthrew "
