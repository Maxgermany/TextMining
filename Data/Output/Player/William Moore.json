The sky is the limit for him, as well as the Patriots, who will have Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski back in the next couple of weeks.    New England's other receivers of note include Julian Edelman (7-118), who did all of his damage in the second half, and Aaron Dobson (1-10) who left the game in the middle of the third quarter with an injury.    The Patriots ran the ball well against Atlanta's skeleton-crew defense that was missing Asante Samuel, as well as linebackers Akeem Dent and Paul Worrilow (both of whom left the game in the second half). Stevan Ridley gained 53 yards on 11 carries, while LeGarrette Blount (9-64) broke free for a 47-yard score.    The Falcons, meanwhile, can blame this loss on themselves. They made numerous errors in this contest, including: - Left tackle Sam Baker ruined a drive in the first half with 2 penalties (holding, face mask). He would leave the game with an injury a little bit later. - The Falcons went for it on a fourth-and-2 inside the red zone in the middle of the second quarter. A field goal would've made a huge difference later on, though it's always difficult to know what would've happened. - Julio Jones dropped a big gain. He missed some time with a leg injury, but managed to finish with solid stats (6 catches, 108 yards). - Dent was whistled for a penalty that gave New England a first down on what would've otherwise been a punt attempt. The Patriots would go on to score a touchdown on that drive. - Atlanta surrendered a third-and-19. The team couldn't get any sort of pressure on Brady, who found Thompkins for a 26-yard completion. On top of that, the Patriots got 15 yards for a Moore hit to the helmet. - Roddy White was whistled for offensive pass interference on Talib in the red zone. - Talib came up with an interception when "
