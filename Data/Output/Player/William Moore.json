  "comment":"William Moore, going 27-of-35 for 360 yards. Atlanta was doing a good job of pressuring him early on, especially deep in its own territory, which is why Pittsburgh had to settle for early field goals instead of touchdowns. That allowed the Falcons to hang around, but Roethlisberger was able to convert enough first downs on the final possession to keep the ball away from Atlanta.    Roethlisberger didn't throw any touchdowns, but he nearly had 1 when ",
