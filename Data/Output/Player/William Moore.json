As a result of all of this, the Seahawks scored on 7 of their first 8 offensive possessions. Atlanta's skeleton-crew defense simply had no answer for them.    Conversely, the Falcons could neither pass protect nor run block, which is why their offense was limited to 3 points for most of the afternoon. "
