When the Bengals were driving down the field for a potential game-winning or tying score, they had a third-and-one on New York's 14 with 26 seconds left on a running clock. Instead of hurrying up to get a first down and a touchdown, the Bengals took their time and finally snapped the ball with 12 seconds remaining. They got the first down, but there were only 6 seconds remaining. Thus, they were forced into the field goal. They consequently went into overtime and lost.    Congratulations to the Bengals though. They played hard for the first time all year and were nearly awarded a victory. Good job, guys.

As you might expect, Brees spread his touchdowns around. The 4 scores went to Marques Colston (8 catches, 168 yards), Lance Moore (6-78), Robert Meachem (2-70) and Jeremy Shockey (4-37).    Pierre Thomas and Mike Bell split their carries evenly, with each guy getting 15 attempts. Thomas predictably out-rushed Bell, 72-34. However, Bell scored a touchdown. Thomas also had a goal-line carry, but failed to convert.    As for New York's running back rotation, Ahmad Bradshaw actually had more carries (10) than Jacobs (7). That was because Jacobs missed a good portion of this game with a stinger. Jacobs' 7 rushes went for 33 yards. Bradshaw's 10 attempts turned into 48 yards and a touchdown.    Hakeem Nicks led the Giants in receptions (5) and yards (114). He also scored a 37-yard touchdown from David Carr in garbage time. All of Nicks' targets came in the second half, but many of them were with Manning under center. Meanwhile, both Steve Smith (44 yards) and Mario Manningham (50 yards, TD) caught 4 balls."

   "comment":"Steve Smith (5-43). Kevin Boss caught a pass, but left the game with a neck injury.    The Giants' ground game did nothing in the first half; at the break, Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs had 6 and 2 yards, respectively. That changed in the second half, as Bradshaw finished with 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts, while Jacobs tallied 44 yards on 12 rushes.    Speaking of running the ball - or a lack thereof - Carolina's dual backfield had just 21 carries compared to Matt Moore's 33 attempts. This is simply unacceptable, considering that the game was pretty close for 3 quarters. DeAngelo Williams managed 62 yards on 16 attempts, while Jonathan Stewart carried the ball only 5 times for 12 yards. I don't understand why Stewart touched the ball only 5 times. The coaching staff should be embarrassed - especially considering how crappy Matt Moore was. Moore went 14-of-33 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and 2 fumbles. His first interception was particularly ugly, as he lobbed the ball into quadruple coverage in the end zone. Moore could have easily tossed a 4.h interception, but the Giants dropped it in the second quarter. Unfortunately for Moore (and perhaps fortunately for the Panthers), Moore suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. Jimmy Clausen could start in Week 2.    Carolina's Steve Smith is definitely healthy. Despite shoddy quarterback play, Smith had 5 grabs for 75 yards and a score.   "

   "comment":"Steve Smith (5-43). Kevin Boss caught a pass, but left the game with a neck injury.    The Giants' ground game did nothing in the first half; at the break, Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs had 6 and 2 yards, respectively. That changed in the second half, as Bradshaw finished with 76 yards and a touchdown on 20 attempts, while Jacobs tallied 44 yards on 12 rushes.    Speaking of running the ball - or a lack thereof - Carolina's dual backfield had just 21 carries compared to Matt Moore's 33 attempts. This is simply unacceptable, considering that the game was pretty close for 3 quarters. DeAngelo Williams managed 62 yards on 16 attempts, while Jonathan Stewart carried the ball only 5 times for 12 yards. I don't understand why Stewart touched the ball only 5 times. The coaching staff should be embarrassed - especially considering how crappy Matt Moore was. Moore went 14-of-33 for 182 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 picks and 2 fumbles. His first interception was particularly ugly, as he lobbed the ball into quadruple coverage in the end zone. Moore could have easily tossed a 4.h interception, but the Giants dropped it in the second quarter. Unfortunately for Moore (and perhaps fortunately for the Panthers), Moore suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter. Jimmy Clausen could start in Week 2.    Carolina's Steve Smith is definitely healthy. Despite shoddy quarterback play, Smith had 5 grabs for 75 yards and a score.   "

Later on, Clawesome led the Panthers all the way down to the Cleveland 24-yard line in just 59 seconds after starting from his own 5. Unfortunately, John Kasay doinked the ball off the left up-right on what would have been a game-winning 42-yard field goal. As mentioned, however, there was some Clawful. He made some really poor throws (his interception was horrible), displayed shoddy pocket presence and should have thrown a couple of more picks. His receivers bailed him out with some great catches, but to be fair, his offensive line didn't give him much time.    Jonathan Stewart is back! Though Mike Goodson started and received 22 touches (14 carries, 55 rush yards, 8 catches, 81 rec. yards, TD), Stewart totaled 98 yards on 12 carries. However, Steve Smith (2-33) didn't do much.   "

   "comment":"Steve Smith on a crossing route for a touchdown. New York got a field goal before time ran out and Philadelphia took a 10-3 lead into the locker room. The third quarter saw more of the same - the Eagles' defensive line was whipping the Giants' line. Manning was under constant duress and the run blocking was terrible. New York had its 8. punt halfway through the 4.h quarter. Philadelphia started a promising drive, but Young threw a ball up for grabs in the back of the end zone and Ross came down with the interception. After trading more punts, the Giants finally got something going early in the 4.h quarter. Manning threw a deep ball for "

   "comment":"Steve Smith for a 26-yard touchdown, beating top cornerback Johnathan Joseph. After another Carolina touchdown, Owen Daniels dropped a routine catch past the first-down marker on a 3rd-and-7. T.J. Yates then had an awful interception on the next drive The Panthers, meanwhile, went up 21-0 on a crazy Fumblerooski play that caught the Texans completely unawares.    Houston's defense sucked the entire afternoon, but I'm not sure if it's because this game meant nothing to them, or if it was because Phillips was missing. Cam Newton basically did what he wanted, finishing 13-of-23 for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had 55 rushing yards on 7 scrambles. The Texans brought him down just twice.    DeAngelo Williams (15-61, TD) and Jonathan Stewart (11-43) combined to rush for about 4 yards per carry. Prior to this contest, the Texans hadn't allowed more than 100 rushing yards to an opponent since Week 6.    Newton's scores went to Steve Smith (5-82) and Jeremy Shockey (2-35)."

   "comment":"Steve Smith was hit late similarly on Carolina's opening possession, yet no flag was thrown. - The 49ers were whistled for a defensive hold on the next drive in which Luke Kuechly barely touched the opponent. - Captain Munnerlyn was flagged for an unnecessary roughness for headbutting a Panther. This was a questionable penalty, but the thing that made this an absolutely horrific call was that Anquan Boldin wasn't whistled for the same exact thing right before San Francisco scored its first touchdown at the end of the opening half. - As Mike Pereira pointed out, the 49ers had 12 men in the huddle prior to that touchdown, yet Cheffers allowed them to take a player off the field. This is illegal, and San Francisco should've moved backward 5 yards, which would've probably forced a field goal, given that the team didn't have much time remaining on the clock.    Given that the Panthers were battling the unstoppable combination of Jim Harbaugh and the officials, it's understandable that some of the players would get deflated. This, however, does not excuse Cam Newton sulking on the sideline. He showed terrible body language, and even though a comeback was possible down 23-10 with 8 minutes remaining, it was obvious that the 49ers would come away with the victory. Newton had a horrific second half. After going 8-of-10 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (the pass thrown behind Brandon LaFell) in the first half, Newton was just 7-of-12 for 72 yards and a pick (overthrow into double coverage) after the break, subtracting a garbage-time 59-yard flip to Ted Ginn. His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission. Frank Gore had a 7-17 line heading into the break, but he finished with 84 yards on 17 carries. As mentioned, Carolina simply ran out of gas because it knew it had to overcome a physical team and biased officiating. Colin Kaepernick, meanwhile, attempted only 4 passes after the break, but completed all of them for a total of 75 yards. He struggled initially - he was nearly pick-sixed in the opening quarter - so his final numbers were just 15-of-28 for 196 yards and a passing touchdown to Vernon Davis. Kaepernick also ran in a score, as he picked up 15 yards on the ground on 8 scrambles.    Kaepernick often targeted Anquan Boldin, who snatched 8 passes for 136 yards. The catch of the game, however, came from Michael Crabtree (3-26), who made a leaping grab for 20 yards in the second quarter. Davis, meanwhile, had just 1 catch for 1 yard, but he did reel in Kaepernick's sole aerial touchdown by somehow dragging his feet inbounds as he was falling out of the end zone.    Some stats/notes for the Panthers: - "

   "comment":"Steve Smith, but he was off the mark for the most part. It didn't help him that the offensive line couldn't pass protect or run block, or do anything correctly, but Flacco looked like 1 of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for most of this contest. Flacco ended up 35-of-62 for 345 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. That stat line is misleading, though Flacco did get into a rhythm in the second half. However, he screwed up on numerous occasions and took unnecessary sacks. A sack actually ended the game, but the play that most sticks out occurred just prior to intermission. With limited time remaining on the clock, Flacco scrambled to avoid pressure. The coaches yelled at him to throw the ball away, but he ran around like an idiot instead. Time ultimately ran out, as Baltimore screwed up a chance to kick a field goal.    Flacco's sole score went to Steve Smith, who found the end zone on an 80-yard touchdown where he muscled defenders away. Smith finished with 7 grabs for 118 yards, though those numbers are bogus because most of them came on 1 play. Smith was highly inefficient for most of the afternoon.    "

The Raven backs combined for 154 yards on 29 carries despite Bernard Pierce's absence. Cleveland did have a big defensive stand where they stopped both Baltimore runners, but it ultimately did not matter because the visitor prevailed.    Brian Hoyer played well in this loss. He misfired just 6 times, going 19-of-25 for 290 yards and a touchdown. He had a stupid moment where he threw what briefly looked like a second score, but was flagged for an illegal forward pass because he was 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Hoyer had another pass that was wiped out by penalty when he hit Johnny Manziel - on a trick play in which Manziel pretended to go to the sideline to talk to Kyle Shanahan - for a big gain. However, the play was nullified by an illegal shift.    Hoyer's sole score went to Miles Austin (6-51), but his main target was Andrew Hawkins, who reeled in 7 of 10 targets for 87 yards. This was despite Jordan Cameron's return to the lineup. Cameron had just 1 catch for 23 yards, but made it count, as it came on a second-and-20 that resulted in a scoring drive. Cameron also drew a pass interference in the end zone on that very same possession.    The Browns had their 2 backs split carries. Terrance West (12-36) started, but was outgained by Isaiah Crowell (11-55). Both scored touchdowns.    As mentioned, the Ravens had so much success on the ground. Justin Forsett was expected to start with Pierce missing in action, but he received just 11 carries compared to 18 that went to Lorenzo Taliaferro. Both looked good, with Taliaferro outgaining Forsett, 91-63. The former found the end zone.    Joe Flacco had a devastating afternoon; not that he played poorly or anything, but because he lost 1 of his favorite targets, Dennis Pitta, who was carted off when his leg gave out on him. He wasn't contacted; he just collapsed. Pitta was later diagonsed with a dislocated hip - the same 1 that caused him to miss most of 2013. Pitta might be done for the season. Flacco still managed to persevere, finishing 19-of-31 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. It must be noted that he converted on just 8 of 16 attempts following intermission when he didn't have Pitta at his disposal. However, he made that clutch completion to Steve Smith at the very end, which allowed Tucker to ice this game.    Steve Smith was once again Baltimore's leading receiver. He caught 5 passes for 101 yards. "

   "comment":"Steve Smith said there would be blood and guts on the field as he tried to get revenge on his former team for releasing him this past offseason. Smith's prediction came to fruition, as Carolina came out of this contest absolutely battered and humiliated. Smith made his presence known right away when he caught Joe Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore. He played lethargically in 2013 and simply looked done as a result. The Panthers made the right move by getting rid of him based on his performance this past season.    The Panthers, meanwhile, were bludgeoned quite literally. Greg Olsen limped off early, and then DeAngelo Williams followed him. I've always said that the toughest thing NFL coaches have to do is making in-game adjustments to injuries to their high-impact players. The Panthers couldn't do anything once Williams left the field. With Jonathan Stewart also out, Carolina had no choice but to turn to scrubs like Darrin Reaves and Taurean Poole. Reaves couldn't do anything on the ground with his 12 carries for 26 yards, while Poole lost a fumble near midfield in the second half. Cam Newton was also beaten to a pulp. He didn't leave the game until it got out of hand, but he was constantly hit and harassed. His offensive line couldn't do anything to protect him, as Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to Kelvin Benjamin, who caught 5 balls for 76 yards, though most of that came during garbage time in the second half. Benjamin nearly secured a second score, but after replay, the officials ruled that his toe was out of bounds. Benjamin had some drops and was also whistled for an offensive pass interference, which knocked Carolina out of field goal range on what looked like a promising opening drive.    Carolina's defense was equally disappointing, as it surrendered big play after big play throughout the afternoon. The team had major problems tackling, while the defensive interior was easily pushed around by Baltimore's front. The Ravens basically had anything they wanted in the middle, which would explain how Justin Forsett (14-66, TD) and Lorenzo Taliaferro (15-58, TD) combined for 124 yards on the ground. Forsett also logged 3 catches for 31 receiving yards. Taliaferro, meanwhile, racked up his yardage in garbage time. Bernard Pierce was nowhere to be seen despite being probable.    Joe Flacco also had an easy afternoon. He had zero pressure in his face throughout despite Eugene Monroe's absence, allowing him to go 22-of-31 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, 2 of the scores went to Steve Smith. The other was thrown to "

   "comment":"Steve Smith dropped a touchdown, which was followed by a Joe Flacco interception when he threw the ball up for grabs in Smith's direction. Baltimore picked things up after that, however. Smith went nuts, as he perhaps had some motivation for revenge, given that he used to go against Brent Grimes twice per year when both players were in the NFC South. With Torrey Smith banged up - he didn't do anything in this contest, aside from serving the role as a decoy - Steve Smith hauled in 7 of a team-high 11 targets for 70 yards and a touchdown. His best catch came along the sideline when he impressively got both feet inbounds.    Joe Flacco was nearly perfect in terms of completion percentage, going 25-of-33 for 269 yards, 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) and the aforementioned interception. He misfired just thrice following intermission, and 1 of the incompletions was a play that was initially ruled a lost fumble inside the red zone. The Ravens were able to maintain possession following a replay review, and "

   "comment":"Steve Smith, but in the end, Dalton and Green were too dominant for Smith to overcome.    The Bengals got on the board first when Dalton connected with Marvin Jones along the sideline for 32 yards. In the red zone, the Ravens hurt themselves as Courtney Upshaw dropped an interception and a penalty on Will Hill gave the Bengals a first down. Dalton finished the drive by diving into the end zone after a 7-yard run. Ravens answered with a drive that was led by a Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith. After the 2-minute warning, the Bengals were set up for a 4.h-and-1 that needed a half yard. Marvin Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by Chris Carter moved the ball to the Bengals' 23-yard line. The Cincinnati defense tightened and forced a short field goal to cut Cincinnati's lead to 14-10. The Ravens took the lead midway through the 4.h quarter when Elvis Dumervil beat Eifert around the corner to get a blind-side strip-sack on Dalton. Linebacker C.J. Mosley scooped up the loose ball and ran it 41 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 17-14 lead. The Bengals answered in tremendous fashion. Dalton hit Green down the seam to around midfield. He broke a tackle from Smith and maintained his feet to run 80 yards for a touchdown. It was a coverage bust as safety Kendrick Lewis was lined up at corner and Will Hill was caught out of position downfield. Baltimore moved back into Cincinnati territory thanks to completions to Smith. The old veteran beat the bigger cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick for a contested catch on a 16-yard touchdown to give the Ravens a 24-21 lead with just under 4 minutes remaining. At this point, the defenses looked gassed and incapable of covering. Dalton hit a 19-yard completion to Mohamed Sanu, and then, Jones caught a 31-yard pass over Kyle Arrington to the Ravens' 7-yard line. Dalton went back to his money-man with a touchdown pass to Green against Smith. Cincinnati's defense finally got a stop to clinch the win for the Bengals.    Andy Dalton completed 20-of-32 passes for 383 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for a touchdown. That yardage total was a career high for Dalton.    A.J. Green also set a new career high with 227 yards through the air on 10 receptions with 2 scores. Green was awesome, and the Ravens were completely incapable of covering him.    The Bengals' ground game was disappointing from a fantasy perspective as Gio Bernard (13-49) and Jeremy Hill (12-21) did the platoon approach that kept either from having a good game.    Even worse than the Cincinnati duo, Ravens running back Justin Forsett continued to disappoint his fantasy owners. He ran for only 13 yards on 10 carries.    Joe Flacco completed 32-of-49 for 362 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Steve Smith looked like vintage Carolina version as he totaled 13 receptions or 186 yards and 2 touchdowns.   "

   "comment":"Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but Justin Tucker slipped on the field goal attempt and it hit off the upright no good. San Francisco took advantage again of the Ravens' weak secondary as Kaepernick laid out a pretty 51-yard bomb that Boldin made a superb catch to Baltimore's 25-yard line. A few plays later, Quinton Patton got wide open in the end zone after Shareece Wright fell down, and Kaepernick hit him for a 21-yard score. A missed 2.point attempt had the 49ers' lead at 25-13. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Ravens weren't quite done as they drove down the field. On 4.h-and-goal, Kamar Aiken made a leaping catch for a score. Baltimore got the ball back with a little over a minute remaining, and needing to go 80 yards, but the 49ers' defense came up with a stop led by Eric Reid breaking up a pass in the end zone on the final play of the game.    Kaepernick was 16-of-27 for 340 yards with 2 touchdowns. He threw the ball best when he scrambled out of the pocket. Don't expect similar performances going forward, as Baltimore's secondary has given up big outings to all quarterbacks.    Baltimore's run defense held Carlos Hyde to 55 yards on 21 carries. Hyde appeared to injure his ankle at 1 point, but remained in the game.    Anquan Boldin had 5 receptions for 102 yards. Torrey Smith (3-96) and Quinton Patton (2-38) caught Kaepernick's touchdowns. Most of Smith's production came on his score.    Joe Flacco was 33-of-53 for 343 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 ugly interceptions.    Ravens running back Justin Forsett had 62 yards on 17 carries with 7 receptions for 39 yards. Even though he was questionable prior to kickoff, Baltimore didn't use him enough.    Steve Smith led the Ravens through the air with 137 yards on 7 receptions. Not bad for someone who told reporters that he wouldn't be able to play earlier in the week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "

Flacco, however, was nearly perfect otherwise following intermission, as his second-half numbers were 13-of-17 for 163 yards, 3 touchdowns and that pick. The offense went into a quick tempo, and Flacco's throws were mostly precise, though Cleveland's atrocious defense made things very easy for him.    While Flacco's 3 touchdowns all went to different players, they mostly had a common theme: An offensive lineman sustained an injury following 2 of his scores. Guard Alex Lewis had to be carted into the locker room, but X-rays were negative. Center Jeremy Zuttah was down on the field for a while after the next score, but he didn't miss a snap. Flacco's touchdowns went to Breshad Perriman (3-64), Steve Smith (5-60) and some guy named Darren Waller (2-14)."

The Eagles were able to score a touchdown in the second quarter because Flacco lost a fumble on a third down deep inside his own territory. The Eagles took over at the Baltimore 10 and quickly found the end zone. Later, Flacco's interception in the red zone gave the Eagles a chance to tie; otherwise, even a field goal would've put the game out of reach. It's unclear if a receiver ran the wrong route on the play, but still, why take a risk when a short kick would've guaranteed a victory?    It's discouraging, but we're back to square 1 with the Baltimore running game. "

   "comment":"Steve Smith told the media that this would be his final game, so the logical assumption was that the Ravens would put forth a great deal of effort so that the great receiver could have a proper farewell. That was not the case, as Baltimore didn't try hard whatsoever. The lack of character of this team was pretty telling that they didn't really seem to give a damn that their potential Hall of Fame teammate would be walking away forever. That's how they played, anyway. Where to start? Well, the defense was awful. The Bengals had a skeleton-crew offense on the field in this game, missing A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert. This didn't matter, as Cincinnati moved the chains with complete ease. "
