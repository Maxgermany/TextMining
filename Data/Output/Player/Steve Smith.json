Carr really struggled, going 5-of-13 for 67 yards and a horrible interception that led to Carolina's game-winning field goal.    San Francisco went up 7-0 quickly, and it appeared as though Carolina wouldn't have much of a chance. However, the 49ers just stopped scoring, and Alex Smith (9-19, 129 yards, TD) wasn't very good after that first drive. He'll have an MRI on Monday, but told the media he will travel to London with the team to take on Denver.    "

Unfortunately, John Kasay doinked the ball off the left up-right on what would have been a game-winning 42-yard field goal. As mentioned, however, there was some Clawful.

   "comment":"Steve Smith (8 touches for 112 yards) totaling 57 yards, 1 being a creative run. A touchdown pass to Smith (8 touches for 112 yards) totaling 57 yards, 1 being a creative run. A touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey tied it up at 7 early in the second quarter. A flat possession by the Vikings followed. It was highlighted by Percy Harvin and Captain Munnerlyn, who had a terrific game, scuffling on the Panthers' sideline. It looked like Carolina might be starting to take over when Newton hit Greg Olsen on a beautiful 39-yard touchdown pass down the middle when he beat Husain Abdullah who probably wishes he had gotten safety help. Looking to get even, Minnesota drove right down the field, but at the end of a third-down conversion, Harvin had the ball stripped from his new friend Munnerlyn. Carolina worked its way out of the poor field position only to watch Allen get a different part of the sack/fumble action, this time leaving the recovery for Chad Greenway. At this point, Peterson (21 carries for 86 yards, 1 TD) was getting stood up in the running game, so the Vikings smartly threw to him twice for a quick 39 yards and the tying touchdown as the half pretty much expired. Once again, Carolina's offense got on the move, not even getting to third down until it was inside the Minnesota 30-yard line. Newton's 23-yard scamper was the highlight, and he capped the march by hitting Smith for a 22-yard scoring pass to put the Panthers up 21-14. After an exchange of 3.and-out possessions, Minnesota unleashed "

   "comment":"Steve Smith (5-52) is aging. Smith hold. He also saw Fred Jackson (12-30; 4-23) steal a touchdown from him at the goal line.    The Panthers ran the ball pretty well. They were able to move the chains down the field and set up what looked like a front-door field goal late in regulation. DeAngelo Williams tallied 85 yards on 22 attempts. Having said that, 1 Carolina player who once again didn't run the ball enough was Cam Newton, who had just 4 scrambles for 15 rushing yards. It seems like Newton wants to be a pocket passer who rushes as a last resort, but Newton is just doing what opposing defensive coordinators want. If he doesn't use his legs, he's so much easier to defend. Newton finished 21-of-38 for 229 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception on a miscommunication. The numbers don't look that bad, but he missed a number of receivers downfield. He's just not the same quarterback who finished the 2012 campaign on a hot streak. He's struggling without former offensive coordinator, Rob Chudzinski. It wouldn't hurt if the Panthers found a No. 2 wideout for Newton. Ted Ginn caught a touchdown - a play that should've never happened because the Panthers were able to retain possession when Buffalo held on a 4th-and-18 - but he's not a reliable receiver. Steve Smith (5-52) is aging. "

Smith, however, was able to rebound with a big catch after that, finishing with 6 grabs for 63 yards. LaFell (4-48) was the only other Panther with more than 2 catches, as Smith made his return in this game, but wasn't much of a factor. He wasn't seen on the field in the early going, and ultimately finished with about 12 snaps.    Cam Newton had a rough start to this game. He completed just 1 of his first 7 attempts - a 5-yarder - and was responsible for an ugly sequence that went: delay of game, timeout, interception because of bad mechanics. Newton also saw a potential second interception fall out of Navorro Bowman's hands, but that seemed to spark him because he was solid after that. The drive in which Bowman screwed up culminated with the only a touchdown of the game, a 27-yard DeAngelo Williams score.

Smith missed several open receivers, with his most blatant misfire being toward Smith didn't look completely incompetent as many expected him to because he was battling a top defense on the road. Despite all of this, Carolina essentially won by 17 points, with a New York garbage-time, backdoor score making this a 10-point affair. That speaks volumes about the disparity between these 2 teams. Carolina didn't seem to take the Jets seriously. It bypassed field goals when those made sense, which drew the ire of Joe Namath on Twitter, while many of the players didn't show much urgency. Of course, you can't exactly blame the Panthers for being a bit lethargic; they were playing a non-conference opponent with a losing record in between battles against the arch-rival Saints. This game simply didn't mean as much as next week's battle against New Orleans.    Cam Newton went 16-of-24 for 273 yards and a touchdown along with 7 scrambles for only 12 rushing yards. Newton was chased down and was wincing in pain on a tackle at the end of the second quarter, so perhaps that's why he didn't run very much. Newton's passing yardage is impressive, but 72 yards came on a DeAngelo Williams screen that was turned into Newton's sole score. Williams sprinted toward the end zone, as David Harris looked like he was running in slow motion as he was trying to chase him. Dee Milliner was also at fault, being unable to get off his block.    In addition to his 72-yard receiving touchdown, Williams also had 81 rushing yards on 15 carries. That's the good news. The bad news is that Williams saw Mike Tolbert (12-18, TD) steal his goal-line carries yet again.    Greg Olsen led Carolina in receiving with 5 catches for 88 yards. Steve Smith, meanwhile, didn't do very much, hauling in 3 receptions for 20 yards.    As for the Jets, I mentioned that Smith didn't look completely incompetent, but he wasn't any good either.

   "comment":"Steve Smith was hit late similarly on Carolina's opening possession, yet no flag was thrown. - The 49ers were whistled for a defensive hold on the next drive in which Luke Kuechly barely touched the opponent. - Captain Munnerlyn was flagged for an unnecessary roughness for headbutting a Panther. This was a questionable penalty, but the thing that made this an absolutely horrific call was that Anquan Boldin wasn't whistled for the same exact thing right before San Francisco scored its first touchdown at the end of the opening half. - As Mike Pereira pointed out, the 49ers had 12 men in the huddle prior to that touchdown, yet Cheffers allowed them to take a player off the field. This is illegal, and San Francisco should've moved backward 5 yards, which would've probably forced a field goal, given that the team didn't have much time remaining on the clock.    Given that the Panthers were battling the unstoppable combination of Jim Harbaugh and the officials, it's understandable that some of the players would get deflated. This, however, does not excuse Cam Newton sulking on the sideline. He showed terrible body language, and even though a comeback was possible down 23-10 with 8 minutes remaining, it was obvious that the 49ers would come away with the victory. Newton had a horrific second half. After going 8-of-10 for 136 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception (the pass thrown behind Brandon LaFell) in the first half, Newton was just 7-of-12 for 72 yards and a pick (overthrow into double coverage) after the break, subtracting a garbage-time 59-yard flip to Ted Ginn. His final numbers were 16-of-25 for 267 yards, 1 touchdown to Steve Smith and the 2 picks. He also rushed for 54 yards on 10 scrambles.    It's difficult to take this victory seriously for the 49ers. They're definitely 1 of the league's best teams, but this contest would've been much more interesting had the officials been unbiased. Still, the offense was extremely sharp in the second half, scoring 10 points on their first 2 drives and converting 4-of-5 third-down tries. The Panthers simply couldn't stop the run after intermission.

Not only is he a reliable pass-catcher; he's also to create for himself by making great jukes or managing to out-muscle defenders for extra yardage. His only blemish was a dropped pass. Steve Smith outgained Torrey Smith (1-10) by a wide margin, though the latter Smith drew a long pass interference to set up Baltimore with a first-and-goal inside the 5-yard line.    The Ravens were splitting touches with Smith inside the 5-yard line. Darrius Heyward-Bey - yes, he's still in the league - then held on a big gain on an end-round by Markus Wheaton. Roethlisberger followed that up by throwing way behind Justin Brown on a third down, which would've been a big play because Brown was wide open. The Steelers had multiple chances to get back into the game in the second half, but committed way too many personal foul penalties. One was bogus, but the infractions allowed the Ravens to register touchdowns, allowing them to put this contest away. The scores were to Owen Daniels, who was wide open on both occasions, thanks to blown coverages. You'd think Pittsburgh would've learned the second time, but its defense is so anemic that it can't really do anything correctly. The nail in the coffin was a Heath Miller lost fumble, setting up a Baltimore field goal to put the host up by 3 scores.    Aside from Pittsburgh constantly shooting itself in the foot, the greatest reason why Baltimore was able to prevail was because the Steelers' defense couldn't get off the field. The Ravens converted 25 first downs, as Joe Flacco went 21-of-29 for 166 yards and the 2 scores to Daniels. Pittsburgh failed to register a single sack against Flacco. Flacco's top option, besides Daniels (5-28), was Steve Smith, who registered 6 catches for 71 yards. Smith looked decrepit last year, but he's rejuvenated.

The Raven backs combined for 154 yards on 29 carries despite Bernard Pierce's absence. Cleveland did have a big defensive stand where they stopped both Baltimore runners, but it ultimately did not matter because the visitor prevailed.    Brian Hoyer played well in this loss. He misfired just 6 times, going 19-of-25 for 290 yards and a touchdown. He had a stupid moment where he threw what briefly looked like a second score, but was flagged for an illegal forward pass because he was 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Hoyer had another pass that was wiped out by penalty when he hit Johnny Manziel - on a trick play in which Manziel pretended to go to the sideline to talk to Kyle Shanahan - for a big gain. However, the play was nullified by an illegal shift.    Hoyer's sole score went to Miles Austin (6-51), but his main target was Andrew Hawkins, who reeled in 7 of 10 targets for 87 yards. This was despite Jordan Cameron's return to the lineup. Cameron had just 1 catch for 23 yards, but made it count, as it came on a second-and-20 that resulted in a scoring drive. Cameron also drew a pass interference in the end zone on that very same possession.    The Browns had their 2 backs split carries. Terrance West (12-36) started, but was outgained by Isaiah Crowell (11-55). Both scored touchdowns.    As mentioned, the Ravens had so much success on the ground. Justin Forsett was expected to start with Pierce missing in action, but he received just 11 carries compared to 18 that went to Lorenzo Taliaferro. Both looked good, with Taliaferro outgaining Forsett, 91-63. The former found the end zone.    Joe Flacco had a devastating afternoon; not that he played poorly or anything, but because he lost 1 of his favorite targets, Dennis Pitta, who was carted off when his leg gave out on him. He wasn't contacted; he just collapsed. Pitta was later diagonsed with a dislocated hip - the same 1 that caused him to miss most of 2013. Pitta might be done for the season. Flacco still managed to persevere, finishing 19-of-31 for 217 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that occurred because he released the ball as he was getting hit. It must be noted that he converted on just 8 of 16 attempts following intermission when he didn't have Pitta at his disposal.

   "comment":"Steve Smith said there would be blood and guts on the field as he tried to get revenge on his former team for releasing him this past offseason. Smith's prediction came to fruition, as Carolina came out of this contest absolutely battered and humiliated. Smith made his presence known right away when he caught Joe Flacco's first pass of ths game. He threw a punishing stiff-arm to pick up a 17-yard gain. Smith was then the recipient of 2 first-half touchdowns, both of which occurred under extremely fortunate circumstances. The first was actually targeted for Owen Daniels, but the tight end tipped the ball into the air, which landed right into Smith's arms. The second happened right after Flacco dropped the snap. He was able to pick the ball up before any Panther tackled him and managed to fire it right to Smith in the end zone. By halftime, Smith had 5 catches for 122 yards and the 2 touchdowns. He finished with 7 grabs for 139 yards. He's been awesome for Baltimore so far, but Smith only has himself to blame for not being in Carolina anymore. He played lethargically in 2013 and simply looked done as a result. The Panthers made the right move by getting rid of him based on his performance this past season.    The Panthers, meanwhile, were bludgeoned quite literally. Greg Olsen limped off early, and then DeAngelo Williams followed him. I've always said that the toughest thing NFL coaches have to do is making in-game adjustments to injuries to their high-impact players. The Panthers couldn't do anything once Williams left the field. With Jonathan Stewart also out, Carolina had no choice but to turn to scrubs like Darrin Reaves and Taurean Poole. Reaves couldn't do anything on the ground with his 12 carries for 26 yards, while Poole lost a fumble near midfield in the second half. Cam Newton was also beaten to a pulp. He didn't leave the game until it got out of hand, but he was constantly hit and harassed. His offensive line couldn't do anything to protect him, as Terrell Suggs was in the backfield all afternoon. Newton, who went 14-of-25 for 197 yards and a touchdown, once again was reluctant to scramble around. He only ran twice for 7 rushing yards. There was 1 play in particular that stood out. Newton bobbled a shotgun snap and scrambled left to avoid pressure. The old Newton would've tried to pick up the first down with his legs, but this battered version basically hobbled out of bounds. Carolina's front office only has itself to blame for this; the offensive line is a joke and looks pathetic trying to block for him.    Newton's sole touchdown went to Kelvin Benjamin, who caught 5 balls for 76 yards, though most of that came during garbage time in the second half. Benjamin nearly secured a second score, but after replay, the officials ruled that his toe was out of bounds. Benjamin had some drops and was also whistled for an offensive pass interference, which knocked Carolina out of field goal range on what looked like a promising opening drive.    Carolina's defense was equally disappointing, as it surrendered big play after big play throughout the afternoon. The team had major problems tackling, while the defensive interior was easily pushed around by Baltimore's front. The Ravens basically had anything they wanted in the middle, which would explain how Justin Forsett (14-66, TD) and Lorenzo Taliaferro (15-58, TD) combined for 124 yards on the ground. Forsett also logged 3 catches for 31 receiving yards. Taliaferro, meanwhile, racked up his yardage in garbage time. Bernard Pierce was nowhere to be seen despite being probable.    Joe Flacco also had an easy afternoon. He had zero pressure in his face throughout despite Eugene Monroe's absence, allowing him to go 22-of-31 for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns. As mentioned, 2 of the scores went to Steve Smith. The other was thrown to "

Meanwhile, Flacco was far worse than his counterpart. The numbers show it, as he went 17-of-34 for 195 yards and 2 interceptions. The first was horrible, as Flacco never saw linebacker Emmanuel Lamur. The second was a weird 1. as Torrey Smith appeared to have suffered a concussion and screwed up on the play. Flacco had some other near-picks, including 1 where a Cincinnati defender bobbled 1 of his passes in the first half. Having said that, this loss wasn't all on Flacco.

   "comment":"Steve Smith didn't do much (5-36), though he saw 8 targets go his way.    Forsett didn't nearly have as many rushing yards, as Pittsburgh's front did a great job of stuffing the run. Forsett mustered just 38 yards on 9 carries, but on the bright side, he received a goal-line carry late in the game. He didn't convert, but he was at least given an opportunity, which bodes well for the future. Smith out, Brown wreaked havoc on the opposition, accumulating a whopping 11 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown. He also drew a pass interference flag. Brown's score was a thing of beauty, as he got into space and made several Ravens miss.    The Steelers did not run the ball very well. LeGarrette Blount and Le'Veon Bell each had 10 carries for 23 and 20 yards, respectively. Bell made up for it with 5 catches for 38 receiving yards and a touchdown. Blount, meanwhile, had an eventful evening. He had a minimal gain on a short carry in the third quarter when Terrell Suggs made a horribly dirty hit, going for the back of the big back's knees. A fight ensued, and Suggs was whistled for a personal foul. Blount later drew another flag of the same sort of Elvis Dumervil, prompting the official to stop the game and threaten both coaches that they would eject players. This calmed everyone down until Raven tight end Crockett Gilmore spiked the ball after a touchdown that made the game 36-23 with 3 minutes remaining, prompting the crowd to chant Ravens suck! Ravens suck! And as if there wasn't enough bad blood, Pittsburgh ran up the score when Roethlisberger went play-action and hit Matt Spaeth for a touchdown, up 13 with just 2 minutes remaining. This incited yet another skirmish that resulted in more personal-foul flags. It was a classic Baltimore-Pittsburgh battle.    While Pittsburgh's offensive has made great leaps recently, the defense looked improved in this contest. The unit was able to put great pressure on Joe Flacco. It sacked him 4 times, but that number easily could've been twice as much. James Harrison, who was retired slightly more than a month ago, was a monster Sunday evening, registering 2 sacks. Unfortunately, the Steelers lost Ryan Shazier and Troy Polamalu to injuries. Flacco was able to compile some junk yardage to make his numbers look better - 30-of-45, 303 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception - but he struggled to complete half of his passes during meaningful action. In fact, he was just 9-of-17 going into halftime. Flacco simply had no time to throw; his pick came when he was under pressure. He heaved up a desperate pass that was picked off, and the Steelers capitalized with 1 of Roethlisberger's aerial scores.    With the pressure he was facing, Flacco had to constantly dump the ball off to Justin Forsett, who led the team with 67 receiving yards off 5 catches. Torrey Smith was next (4-63), and he snared 1 of Flacco's touchdowns. He also drew a pass interference. Meanwhile, "

Despite these blunders, the Chargers were still in position to win this game, thanks to terrific quarterbacking from Rivers, who looked healthy for the first time since the opening half of the Thursday night game at Denver. Rivers was able to drive his team down the field and into the end zone, thanks to shoddy coverage from the Baltimore secondary and a pair of shady calls by the officials. Cornerback Anthony Levine was whistled for a bogus pass interference in the end zone, and then there was a poor non-call for offensive pass interference on the decisive touchdown to Eddie Royal. Rivers finished 34-of-45 for 383 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was swarmed in the backfield at times, but he did a good job of dealing with the pressure. He even scrambled 4 times, lumbering for 19 additional yards on the ground.    The Chargers had 4 players tally more than 6 receiving yards, and all of them had huge outings. Royal, who caught the game-winning touchdown, had 9 grabs for 81 yards. Antonio Gates (7-83) was worked on early before the Ravens took him away from Will Hill. Malcom Floyd (3-85) missed some action with what appeared to be a concussion, but came back to make a great catch where he pinned the ball against his face mask. Keenan Allen (11-121) found the end zone twice.    Mathews, who had that key drop, didn't run very well, though he wasn't expected to against Baltimore's tough run defense. He gained just 38 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.    The Ravens, conversely, moved the ball well on the ground. Justin Forsett eclipsed the century mark again, accumulating 106 yards on 24 carries.    Rivers' late comeback spoiled a great performance from Joe Flacco, who went 19-of-31 for 225 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). He nearly had a pick early on a high throw, but was pretty much flawless otherwise.    Both of Rivers' touchdowns went to Torrey Smith, who led the team in both catches (6) and receiving yards (65).

He also hurt his team with a holding infraction and a drop. Mike Brown (5-66) led the Ravens in receiving, while Smith downfield, which drew a long pass-interference penalty. Still, this was an underwhelming performance from Flacco, who has been enjoying the best season of his career thus far.    A big reason why the Ravens struggled to move the chains was Justin Forsett's ineptitude. Gaining just 48 yards on 16 carries, Forsett had many poor runs after looking so brilliant last week. He's playing injured though, so perhaps that was a part of the reason why he hurt his fantasy owners.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy players, both Smiths failed to produce. "

   "comment":"Steve Smith, who ended the day with 16 targets, 10 receptions and 150 yards. Those numbers could have actually been better with just a couple better passes from Flacco, especially toward the end of the game with the score tied. Flacco had Smith open near the pylon late, and even though Smith made a nice catch, Flacco led him out of bounds and the Ravens had to settle for a field goal that put the game at 33-30 with 2:10 seconds left.    With just over 2 minutes remaining, Carr moved his team down the field with short passes and a little help from defensive end Smith and Carr put a post pattern right on the money for Cooper to waltz in for a 68-yard touchdown. That set the tone for an effective pass-first attack for the rest of the game.    Joe Flacco responded at the end of the first quarter with a touchdown pass to second-year tight end Crockett Gilmore, who went on to catch another touchdown, i.e. the Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert last week against the Raiders. That's 4 touchdowns given up by the Raiders' defense in just 2 games.    This back-and-forth scoring continued in the second half as Raiders running back Latavius Murray scored from 1 yard out and then Flacco and Gilmore responded quickly with a 9-yard touchdown pass. Add in a couple of field goals, and the score before halftime was knotted up at 20.    After halftime, the Raiders came out strong again with another field goal and a 26-yard touch strike to Michael Crabtree, who had his Raiders' breakout game with 9 receptions on 16 targets for 111 and a touchdown. He's no Amari Cooper in his skill level, but Crabtree made a lot of nice plays running the ball after the catch. It was a good sign that someone other than Cooper can put up big numbers in the receiving game.    After Crabtree's touchdown put the Raiders up by 10, the Ravens went to work scoring 13 unanswered points, with 2 field goals and a 7-yard touchdown run by Lorenzon Taliaferro. He is the no-doubt goal-line back now that he has returned from injury, but Justin Forsett still saw 19 touches, with 15 carries for 68 yards and 4 receptions for 12 yards.    The true engine for this Ravens team once again was Steve Smith, who ended the day with 16 targets, 10 receptions and 150 yards. Those numbers could have actually been better with just a couple better passes from Flacco, especially toward the end of the game with the score tied. Flacco had Smith open near the pylon late, and even though Smith made a nice catch, Flacco led him out of bounds and the Ravens had to settle for a field goal that put the game at 33-30 with 2:10 seconds left.

   "comment":"Steve Smith, but in the end, Dalton and Green were too dominant for Smith to overcome.    The Bengals got on the board first when Dalton connected with Marvin Jones along the sideline for 32 yards. In the red zone, the Ravens hurt themselves as Courtney Upshaw dropped an interception and a penalty on Will Hill gave the Bengals a first down. Dalton finished the drive by diving into the end zone after a 7-yard run. Ravens answered with a drive that was led by a Flacco hooking up for a 19-yard pass to tight end Crockett Gilmore. However, the self-inflicted wounds continued as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal. Cincinnati continued to work the Ravens' defense, as Dalton threw a bullet to Jones for a 16-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Dalton used A.J. Green to move the ball for points. Dalton to Green completed passes of 17, 31 and 14 yards at the expense of Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith. After the 2-minute warning, the Bengals were set up for a 4.h-and-1 that needed a half yard. Marvin Lewis decided to go for it, and on a broken play, Dalton threw a pass for Tyler Eifert who caught it over Smith and reached over the goal line. Smith's foot kicked the ball out as Eifert extended it over the goal line. At first, the play was called a touchdown, but upon review, it was ruled to be an incomplete on the decision that Eifert didn't maintain the catch. That limited the Bengals lead to 14-0 at the half. In the third quarter, Green made an incredible adjustment for a 47-yard gain. The Bengals looked like they were ready go in for more points, but Smith came back to pick off Dalton on a poorly thrown fade pass in the end zone. The Ravens finally got on the board in the third quarter. Flacco started moving the ball with passes to Smith. On a 4.h-and-5 at the 50, Flacco hit Smith on an out along the sideline. He shook 2 tackles and exploded down the field for a touchdown. On the next possession, a 20-yard completion to Smith got the Ravens across midfield and a roughing the passer penalty by Chris Carter moved the ball to the Bengals' 23-yard line. The Cincinnati defense tightened and forced a short field goal to cut Cincinnati's lead to 14-10. The Ravens took the lead midway through the 4.h quarter when Elvis Dumervil beat Eifert around the corner to get a blind-side strip-sack on Dalton. Linebacker C.J. Mosley scooped up the loose ball and ran it 41 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 17-14 lead. The Bengals answered in tremendous fashion. Dalton hit Green down the seam to around midfield. He broke a tackle from Smith and maintained his feet to run 80 yards for a touchdown. It was a coverage bust as safety Kendrick Lewis was lined up at corner and Will Hill was caught out of position downfield. Baltimore moved back into Cincinnati territory thanks to completions to Smith. The old veteran beat the bigger cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick for a contested catch on a 16-yard touchdown to give the Ravens a 24-21 lead with just under 4 minutes remaining. At this point, the defenses looked gassed and incapable of covering. Dalton hit a 19-yard completion to Mohamed Sanu, and then, Jones caught a 31-yard pass over Kyle Arrington to the Ravens' 7-yard line. Dalton went back to his money-man with a touchdown pass to Green against Smith. Cincinnati's defense finally got a stop to clinch the win for the Bengals.    Andy Dalton completed 20-of-32 passes for 383 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception. He also ran for a touchdown. That yardage total was a career high for Dalton.    A.J. Green also set a new career high with 227 yards through the air on 10 receptions with 2 scores. Green was awesome, and the Ravens were completely incapable of covering him.    The Bengals' ground game was disappointing from a fantasy perspective as Gio Bernard (13-49) and Jeremy Hill (12-21) did the platoon approach that kept either from having a good game.    Even worse than the Cincinnati duo, Ravens running back Justin Forsett continued to disappoint his fantasy owners. He ran for only 13 yards on 10 carries.    Joe Flacco completed 32-of-49 for 362 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.    Steve Smith looked like vintage Carolina version as he totaled 13 receptions or 186 yards and 2 touchdowns.   Smith, but in the end, Dalton and Green were too dominant for Smith to overcome.    The Bengals got on the board first when Dalton connected with "

   "comment":"Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but Justin Tucker slipped on the field goal attempt and it hit off the upright no good. San Francisco took advantage again of the Ravens' weak secondary as Kaepernick laid out a pretty 51-yard bomb that Boldin made a superb catch to Baltimore's 25-yard line. A few plays later, Quinton Patton got wide open in the end zone after Shareece Wright fell down, and Kaepernick hit him for a 21-yard score. A missed 2.point attempt had the 49ers' lead at 25-13. Midway through the 4.h quarter, the Ravens weren't quite done as they drove down the field. On 4.h-and-goal, Kamar Aiken made a leaping catch for a score. Baltimore got the ball back with a little over a minute remaining, and needing to go 80 yards, but the 49ers' defense came up with a stop led by Eric Reid breaking up a pass in the end zone on the final play of the game.    Kaepernick was 16-of-27 for 340 yards with 2 touchdowns. He threw the ball best when he scrambled out of the pocket. Don't expect similar performances going forward, as Baltimore's secondary has given up big outings to all quarterbacks.    Baltimore's run defense held Carlos Hyde to 55 yards on 21 carries. Hyde appeared to injure his ankle at 1 point, but remained in the game.    Anquan Boldin had 5 receptions for 102 yards. Torrey Smith (3-96) and Quinton Patton (2-38) caught Kaepernick's touchdowns. Most of Smith's production came on his score.    Joe Flacco was 33-of-53 for 343 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 ugly interceptions.    Ravens running back Justin Forsett had 62 yards on 17 carries with 7 receptions for 39 yards. Even though he was questionable prior to kickoff, Baltimore didn't use him enough.    Steve Smith led the Ravens through the air with 137 yards on 7 receptions. Not bad for someone who told reporters that he wouldn't be able to play earlier in the week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Smith burned new Raven Shareece Wright for a 76-yard touchdown. While he's struggled on some deep throws, Kaepernick threw that bomb perfectly. With the 49ers up 13-3, Flacco was picked off by forcing a pass to a covered receiver. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite cut in front of the ball, and that gave the 49ers another field goal. The Ravens answered with a field goal drive of their own. The 49ers took a 16-6 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Flacco threw an awful pass. It was late down the middle of the field, off his back foot, and up for grabs like a punt, and dropped in to San Francisco cornerback Kenneth Acker. A pop pass to Anquan Boldin led to a 27-yard gain and another Phil Dawson field goal. Acker found that Flacco giveth and taketh away, as Steve Smith got away with a push off of Acker for a 34-yard touchdown. Another Baltimore drive went into San Fran territory, but "

Overall, Roethlisberger finished 24-of-33 for 279 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 picks. If you don't feel like doing the math, Roethlisberger was 10-of-16 for 115 yards, 1 score and 2 interceptions entering the final frame. There were some things that weren't his fault, such as a long pass to Brown being negated by obvious offensive pass interference, but Roethlisberger was definitely to blame for his dual picks. The first was an overthrow in his own territory, while the second was telegraphed, allowing C.J. Mosley to jump the route. The interceptions led to 10 Baltimore points, but it easily could've been 14 had Kenny Waller not dropped a touchdown.    Speaking of Brown, he was quiet for most of the evening, but came up big on the final drive. He managed to convert 10 of his 11 targets for 96 yards and a touchdown. Roethlisberger also enjoyed throwing to Eli Rogers (4-84) and Jesse James (4-49). Xavier Grimble and Le'Veon Bell snatched Roethlisberger's other scores.    Bell caught 3 passes for 15 yards, but did most of his damage on the ground. He gashed the Ravens, who typically have a strong run defense, gaining 122 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries.    The Ravens, meanwhile, had a great performance from Joe Flacco. As with Roethlisberger, the Baltimore quarterback began slowly. He threw a Sam Bradford-type short pass on a third-and-6 on 1 occasion, and then he fired behind Dennis Pitta inside the 5-yard line. However, he caught fire before Roethlisberger managed to do so. He did this in the third quarter, and as a result, he managed to go 16-of-22 for 125 yards, 1 touchdown and a meaningless interception following intermission. Flacco's final numbers looked like this: 30-of-44, 262 yards, 1 touchdown and the pick. Flacco should've thrown a second score, but as mentioned, Waller was guilty of a drop in the end zone. The interception occurred on the final play of the game when Flacco was just trying to get something going downfield.    Flacco spread the ball around, targeting 4 players on 5 or more occasions. Steve Smith led the way in receiving, snatching all 7 balls thrown to him for 79 yards and a touchdown. Pitta also had a big game with 8 receptions for 75 yards. He was close to getting a touchdown at 1 point, but Flacco threw behind him near the goal line.    "

   "comment":"Steve Smith told the media that this would be his final game, so the logical assumption was that the Ravens would put forth a great deal of effort so that the great receiver could have a proper farewell. That was not the case, as Baltimore didn't try hard whatsoever. The lack of character of this team was pretty telling that they didn't really seem to give a damn that their potential Hall of Fame teammate would be walking away forever. That's how they played, anyway. Where to start? Well, the defense was awful. The Bengals had a skeleton-crew offense on the field in this game, missing A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert. This didn't matter, as Cincinnati moved the chains with complete ease. "
