      "comments": [" This was an absolutely crazy game. The Patriots looked like they were going to run away with a blowout, as they were up 7-0 and appeared to score a touchdown, though it was called back because the ball barely hit the ground on a near-Rob Gronkowski reception. Nevertheless, New England was up 10, and it didn't seem like the Chiefs would keep it close. In the end, one team won by 15, and its quarterback threw for 368 yards and four touchdowns - and it wasn't the Patriots and Tom Brady! Kansas City generated 537 yards of offense, most of which came on big chunk plays. We're used to the Chiefs dinking and dunking, but they were explosive in their season debut. Kareem Hunt and Tyreek Hill were both terrific, but something that needs to be discussed is how bad New England's defense was. I believe that to be the greatest factor. The Patriots simply didn't show up on that side of the ball. They had absolutely no pass rush for most of the evening, which wasn't a surprise because Derek Rivers suffered a season-ending injury several weeks ago. Meanwhile, Dont'a Hightower was knocked out with a knee, and the Patriots had no substitute for him. The Chiefs were unstoppable once Hightower left the field, and that's something New England will have to get used to if the star linebacker misses lots of action. The Patriots have absolutely nothing behind Hightower, save for some special-teams players who shouldn't be on the field on first, second or third down. That said, I don't want to take away anything from the Chiefs. They wouldn't have been as explosive had Hightower remained on the field the entire time, but they had a great game plan, and their offensive line opened up huge holes for their new running back. All Hunt did, by the way, was set a record for most yards from scrimmage for a running back making his NFL debut. Hunt dashed for 148 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, and he also caught all five of his targets for 98 receiving yards and two more scores. What's crazy is that Hunt had a 10-yard gain called back because of an unnecessary hold, so his night could've been even better. Amazingly, Hunt started poorly, fumbling on his first attempt after not doing that at all in his Toledo career. Hunt, however, shook it off and put his talents on display in front of a national audience.    Smith, as mentioned, had a ridiculous stat line of 28-of-35, 368 yards and four touchdowns. What's crazy is that Travis Kelce had just 40 of those yards (five catches), as the Patriots made sure to smother him with double teams. Smith, instead, took some shots downfield, connecting on deep passes to Hill and Hunt for 75 and 78 yards, respectively. He deserves great praise for an amazing game, as does Hill (7 catches, 133 yards), though he left the game late with an injury as well. That said, no one should get carried away with what happened tonight instead of overreacting like some people on TV (Tedy Bruschi called the offense limitless.) Smith had no sort of pass rush to deal with, and the Chiefs outscored the Patriots, 21-10, following Hightower's injury. New England's entire defensive game plan went to hell without Hightower.    I haven't discussed the other major injury yet, and it cast a dark cloud over Kansas City's victory. Eric Berry suffered a non-contact injury to his Achilles in the second half, and he couldn't put any pressure on his leg. He had to be carted into the locker room, and it doesn't look good for him. I gave the Chiefs a high for what Andy Reid called a torn Achilles after the game. It's such a shame, as Berry worked so hard to come back from his life-threatening condition a few years ago. Berry, who was instrumental in locking down Gronkowski, will sorely be missed. If there's a silver lining, however, it's that the injury occurred so early in the year that Berry could be 100 percent by the 2018 opener.    Speaking of Gronkowski, he caught just two of his six targets for 33 yards. As mentioned, he nearly scored a touchdown, but he couldn't get open versus Berry. I would buy low on Gronkowski for this reason. Perhaps his fantasy owner will panic, allowing you to obtain him for value.    The Patriots suffered an injury on offense as well. Danny Amendola - not Chris Hogan - was being used as Julian Edelman's replacement, as he caught six balls for 100 yards. His one blemish was a dropped pass on third down. Amendola, however, was concussed. He has 10 days to clear concussion protocol, but it's a reminder of how utterly fragile Amendola is. I think the Patriots are going to regret not keeping preseason stud Austin Carr, as he could slot right in for Amendola. Perhaps Hogan will do that; Hogan snared just one of his five targets for only eight yards.    I haven't gotten to Brady yet. His stat line was very uncharacteristic, as he went 16-of-36 for 267 yards. A chunk of that came on a 54-yard reception to Brandin Cooks, so if you take that away, Brady was just 15-of-35 for 213 yards. He tossed some ugly wobblers in this game, though he was on point with some of his other attempts. It was a very mixed performance, and it should've been better because he had great protection for most of the evening. That changed late when Justin Houston, who was terrific throughout, began dominating Marcus Cannon. However, Brady had time to exploit Kansas City's defense for the most part, as Cannon did a good job on Houston in the early going.    As for Cooks, he didn't have the best statistical debut, catching only three balls for 88 yards. Cooks, however, drew a deep pass interference to set up the Patriots at the Kansas City 1-yard line, which Mike Gillislee converted.    Speaking of Gillislee, he scored thrice, as he was the exclusive goal-line back. Gillislee gained just 45 yards on 15 carries, and he was stuffed on two fourth-and-1 attempts, but his fantasy owners can't complain about the three touchdowns. Rex Burkhead, meanwhile, gained 15 yards on just three attempts. He caught only one of his three targets for eight receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
