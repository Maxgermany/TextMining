      "comments": [" The Raiders needed a win in this game to save their season, and they sure did it in dramatic fashion. Kansas City led for most of the evening, including the entire fourth quarter. All 15 minutes of it. However, Oakland was given five chances to score at the very end because of a myriad of penalties, in what will go down as one of the craziest sequences we've seen in a long time. Oakland's final drive was epic. It looked like it would be over quickly, but Derek Carr completed a 12-yard pass to Jared Cook on a fourth-and-11. Carr then fired a deep pass to get out of a second-and-20. With the clock ticking down, he tossed a deep ball to Cook, which was ruled a touchdown with 18 seconds remaining. The play was changed because Cook was down at the half-yard line, and the Raiders lost time because of the stupid 10-second run-off rule. Undaunted, Carr threw a touchdown to Michael Crabtree, but Crabtree was called for offensive pass interference. The Raiders were pushed back to the 11-yard line, and Carr tossed an incomplete ball, but a defensive hold gave Oakland another chance. The same exact thing happened on the next play. Carr, finally, was able to connect with Crabtree in the end zone for the decisive score as time expired. Carr had a tremendous performance, especially considering his back injury. Carr could barely throw 10-yard passes last Sunday, so I didn't think he'd play well in this contest, considering it was just four days later. However, Carr was prolific, and the stats tell the whole story. He went 29-of-52 for 417 yards and three touchdowns. He had some errant throws, so he's not 100 percent, but he was obviously much better than he was on Sunday. At this rate, Carr should be completely healthy for next week's game in Buffalo.    Like Carr, Amari Cooper broke out of a slump to have a huge outing. Cooper, unlike Carr, wasn't injured, but he was dropping everything in sight prior to Thursday night. Cooper had two drops versus the Chiefs, but he snatched 11 of his 19 targets for a ridiculous 210 yards and two touchdowns. He also drew a deep pass interference. It was clear it was going to be Cooper's night when he hauled in a 45-yard touchdown bomb in the first quarter, pushing off the Kansas City defender in the process. It was an obvious pass interference call, and the officials even through a yellow flag, but they picked it up and mysteriously said there was no penalty even though there was an obvious infraction.    Cooper wasn't the only Raider in triple figures. Cook got there as well, catching six passes for 107 yards. Crabtree's yardage was meager - three receptions, 24 yards - but he had the most important catch of the night.    Marshawn Lynch was ejected in the second quarter. There was a scrum on the field following a late hit on Carr. Lynch ran off the bench and tried to pick a fight with someone. That someone happened to be an official, whom he inexplicably pushed. Lynch went into the locker room and quickly left the stadium. Lynch was barely doing anything for the Raiders anyway - two carries, nine yards - as DeAndre Washington and Jalen Richard were taking his touches. The Raiders might as well get rid of Lynch because he's not contributing anything positive, and it's clear that Oakland is better off without him.    Moving on to the Chiefs, their defense was a huge disappointment. They struggled versus the Steelers, as Pittsburgh would've scored way more than 19 points had Ben Roethlisberger been more accurate. In this game, Marcus Peters was torched, being called for a pass interference flag, and he was also guilty of a late hit on the quarterback. Meanwhile, Justin Houston was invisible in the second half. He put absolutely no pressure on Carr despite battling a backup right tackle. Houston had a nice strip-sack in the second quarter that was overturned by penalty, but he looked like a replacement-level player on Oakland's final drive. I never thought I'd say this, but Alex Smith really carried the Chiefs. He threw so many deep, accurate strikes, and his stat line reflected that. He went 25-of-36 for 342 yards and three touchdowns. Curiously, Smith didn't scramble at all.    Smith's touchdowns went to Tyreek Hill (6-125), Albert Wilson (1-63) and Travis Kelce (4-33). Hill torched David Amerson on his touchdown, while Kelce's stat line was a bit disappointing, considering the matchup. Meanwhile, Demarcus Robinson, a fourth-round pick from 2016, reeled in five of his eight targets for 69 yards. Robinson is very talented, as he fell two Aprils ago because he was suspended four times in Florida. He could be a big factor for the Chiefs down the stretch.    Another game, another 100-yard performance by Kareem Hunt. The rookie runner gained 87 yards on 18 carries, and he also caught four balls for 30 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
