      "comments": [" The Cowboys can be dominant offensively when they have their entire line intact. That was the case in this game, as elite left tackle Tyron Smith was in his second game back from injury, while All-Pro guard Zack Martin managed to clear concussion protocol after suffering a head injury on Thanksgiving. With the group together for the first time in nearly a month, the Cowboys were able to dominate Washington on the ground in the second half. They ate lots of time off the clock with a pair of long drives in which Alfred Morris seemingly gained eight or nine yards on every first-down try, giving Dak Prescott plenty of short-yardage opportunities. This was crucial for Dallas at the beginning of the second half. Prescott injured his thumb in the second quarter and even had X-rays taken. Prescott didn't miss a snap, but it wasn't clear if he was healthy. Some of his initial throws were off the mark, but he looked like his normal self by the final frame. When Prescott found Dez Bryant in the end zone, it was clear that he was just fine. This put the Cowboys up 24-7, and the game was over.    Prescott finished 11-of-22 for 102 yards and two touchdowns. The fantasy performance overall wasn't bad because of the two scores, but the completion percentage was a byproduct of the thumb injury and some jitters early in the evening. Prescott missed some early plays, but the Redskins failed to capitaize for reasons I'll discuss later.    Prescott's touchdowns went to Dez Bryant (5-61) and Jason Witten (1-8). Bryant became the franchise's all-time touchdown leader with the score. He spent some time yelling at no one in particular after getting the touchdown. Bryant also drew a pass-interference flag in the end zone. Bashaud Breeland simply couldn't cover Bryant, and the question needs to be asked why the hell the Redskins didn't use Josh Norman to shadow Dallas' only viable receiver.    Morris, as mentioned, couldn't be stopped in the second half. It was tough sledding in the early going, as he gained just 38 yards on 12 carries, but his final stat line illustrated how much he dominated after intermission. Morris finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 27 attempts. Dallas' offensive line simply dominated as the game progressed, and the exhausted Redskins had no answers for Morris.    Washington's problems stopping the run was just one of many reasons the team suffered its season-ending loss. The team made what seemed like countless errors throughout the opening half to put itself in a 17-0 hole that it couldn't crawl out of. There were four crucial mistakes that crushed the Redskins. The first was an interception by Kirk Cousins that was on Jamison Crowder; the receiver had the ball bounce off his hands and into safety Jeff Heath's. The Redskins would've had first-and-goal inside the Dallas 5-yard line, but the Cowboys came away with the turnover instead. The second was also Crowder's fault, as he fumbled a punt return to give Dallas possession in Washington territory. The third was when Cousins was strip-sacked to set up a Dallas field goal. The fourth was surrendering a punt return for a touchdown, which made the margin 17. The Redskins actually were outgaining the Cowboys at halftime and were averaging nearly two more yards per play, yet they were trailing by 10 because of all their blunders. They have no one but themselves to blame for this defeat.    Another big factor for the Redskins was the injury to right tackle Morgan Moses. The Redskins had their entire offensive line, save for their center and terrible left guard, on the field for this game, but Moses getting knocked out destroyed Washington's chances. That's because the Redskins had to use a backup to block DeMarcus Lawrence, who has been one of the top edge rushers in the league this year. Lawrence was the one who forced the aforementioned strip-sack on Cousins. Moses' absence forced Cousins into many short throws. Cousins had to dink and dunk too often far too often. He was able to make some nice throws, but it was telling that the Redskins had no faith in their ability to block the Cowboys when they settled for ineffective screens and swing passes on third-and-8s. Cousins finished 26-of-37 for 251 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. The first pick was Crowder's fault, while the second was a desperation throw, down 31-14 in the fourth quarter. Cousins did what he could, and he even had a brilliant play where he completed a 33-yard pass to Crowder while falling down, but the blocking simply didn't hold up.    Speaking of Crowder, he finished with five catches for 67 yards, trailing only Ryan Grant (5-76), who scored a touchdown, but also had a bad drop. It was a nice PPR performance from Crowder, but he killed his team with those two horrible mistakes. Josh Doctson, meanwhile, also found the end zone, catching three passes for 26 yards in the process. He dropped a pass as well. It's clear that the Redskins need a No. 1 wideout. Here are the .    Samaje Perine missed some drives because he was in concussion protocol, but he cleared it and was able to return to the field. It didn't really matter, as the Cowboys clamped down on him aside from one 15-yard burst. Perine mustered just 38 yards on 12 carries, but he was able to help out his PPR owners with three catches for 31 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
