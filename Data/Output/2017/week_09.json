      "comments": [" The Bills came into this game at 5-2, having high hopes of achieving another victory over the Jets to tie the Patriots for the lead in the AFC East. They were favored following a blowout victory over the Raiders four days ago, so their focus was going to be a big factor against a divisional opponent that has been playing close games for most of the year. As it turns out, their focus clearly wasn't there, and they underestimated the Jets, who took advantage of numerous Buffalo mistakes. While the Bills were responsible for some turnovers and numerous missed tackles, their greatest problem was pass protection. The Jets, who recorded only 11 sacks on the year heading into this game, racked up seven sacks on Tyrod Taylor, a mobile quarterback. Taylor took five sacks in the opening half alone, as the Jets interior defensive linemen beat up on the pedestrian Buffalo right guard. Taylor never had a chance to find his receivers consistently downfield, so it wouldn't have even mattered had Kelvin Benjamin been playing.    Taylor finished 29-of-40 for 285 yards and two passing touchdowns to go along with six scrambles for 35 rushing yards and a score on the ground. Stats can be misleading, however, and that's certainly the case in this situation. Taylor didn't play poorly, or anything; outside of a couple of dropped interceptions and a lost fumble late in the game, he did what he could. However, he just didn't have much of an opportunity to accomplish anything because of all the pressure he saw. Two of his touchdowns as well as a chunk of his yardage came in garbage time when the Jets were up 34-7.    What's truly amazing about this result is what LeSean McCoy didn't do. McCoy mustered only 25 yards on 12 carries, and about half of that yardage (13) came on one burst. The Jets had surrendered at least 119 rushing yards to five of eight opponents this year, yet all McCoy could generate was 25 yards. Don't blame McCoy, however, as the blocking just wasn't there. McCoy had an opportunity to score a touchdown in the early going, but Taylor threw wide of him.    The silver lining for the Bills is that rookie receiver Zay Jones has been a terrible disappointment thus far, but he thrived in this game. Jones caught six passes for 53 yards and a touchdown, with Tony Romo complimenting his route running. Jones appeared to suffer a brutal, non-contact knee injury in the opening half, but he returned to the field shortly afterward. Elsewhere, Deonte Thompson led Buffalo in receiving with seven catches for 81 yards and a touchdown. Most of this came in garbage time, however. Jordan Matthews (6-46), meanwhile, lost a fumble in the second quarter. Nick O'Leary (4-51) also coughed up the ball, doing so in Jets territory.    On the other side of the ball, Buffalo's horrible tackling was most apparent on a 51-yard Bilal Powell run in the third quarter. Powell made a great cut after he stopped on a dime, but Buffalo still had an opportunity to bring him down without him sprinting downfield. Matt Forte later was able to benefit from a missed tackle as well, scoring a touchdown because of a Lorenzo Alexander whiff. Despite the long run, Forte outgained Powell, 77-74, doing so on five more carries (14-9). Eli McGuire was also mixed in for some reason, though he was far less effective (13-30). Forte also caught four passes, but didn't do much with them, generating 19 receiving yards.    Josh McCown had an efficient performance, going 14-of-20 for 140 yards and two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing). McCown almost wanted to get off to a rough start, as he threw a pass right to cornerback Leonard Johnson. However, the Buffalo corner dropped what could've been the easiest interception of his life.    Only three Jets accumulated double-digit receiving yards: Robby Anderson (4-48), Jermaine Kearse (2-38) and Austin Seferian-Jenkins (2-20). Anderson scored a touchdown, while Seferian-Jenkins also found the end zone, but had the score negated by offensive pass interference. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
