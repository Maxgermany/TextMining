      "comments": [" When a bad team doesn't show up and the opponent has a ton to play for, results like this tend to happen. It was apparent from their early mental mistakes and missed tackles that the Dolphins weren't too keen on trying hard in this game, while Baltimore had to win to avoid a 3-5 record. The Ravens, as a consequence, demolished Miami in a lopsided affair that featured several dirty plays. The prominent instance of this occurred late in the first half when Joe Flacco scrambled and slid just shy of the first-down marker. Linebacker Kiko Alonso dived right at Flacco's head, delivering a forearm blow at his helmet. Flacco's helmet popped off, and he didn't look like he knew what planet he was on. A fight naturally ensued, and I have no idea how several players weren't ejected because of it. Better yet, I don't know why Alonso was allowed to keep playing. He blatantly tried to injure Flacco, and he was successful in doing so. I'd be shocked if he doesn't receive a suspension for what he did. Flacco was naturally knocked out for the rest of the game with a concussion. If there's a silver lining for the Ravens, it's that they have nine days off for Flacco to clear protocol before they battle the Titans. They'll need Flacco back, as Ryan Mallett is not a viable NFL quarterback. Mallett was just 3-of-7 for 20 yards and a touchdown in relief. Flacco, by the way, was 10-of-15 for 101 yards and a deep touchdown to Jeremy Maclin.    Speaking of Maclin, he led Baltimore with three catches for 53 yards and the score. The only other Ravens with double-digit receiving yards were Alex Collins (2-30) and Nick Boyle (4-29). Ben Watson (2-6) hauled in Mallett's touchdown.    The difference-maker for Baltimore's offense was Collins. Nicknamed the Irish Dancer by Tony Romo, Collins gained 113 yards on 18 carries. The Dolphins had no answer for him, though it didn't exactly look like they were trying too hard to bring him down. The effort was absolutely non-existent. Still, Collins should be added in all fantasy leagues.    Jay Ajayi was the superior running back talent entering this contest, and he looked like he was going to have a huge performance when he had a 21-yard burst on the opening drive. Instead, he was limited to just two rushing yards the rest of the evening. Ajayi finished with 23 yards on 13 carries, meaning he averaged .167 yards per carry if you exclude his 21-yard gain! Baltimore's run defense came to play with Brandon Williams back, and the Dolphins were lethargic. Some examples of Miami's lack of concentration was that the team was guilty of numerous pre-snap procedure penalties, including one on the very first play of the game. They had an illegal formation ruin their second third down of the evening. They also had 12 men on the field on Flacco's touchdown to Maclin, yet they still couldn't prevent a big play from happening.    Of course, the Dolphins didn't have much of a chance because of Matt Moore's atrocious play. Moore was 25-of-44 for only 176 yards and two pick-sixes. Both turnovers came in the fourth quarter. One was a great play by C.J. Mosley, while the second was a lazy, telegraphed throw toward the sideline that Jimmy Smith took back to the house. Moore's accuracy was terrible, as he missed numerous open receivers. His completions were mostly checkdowns, save for a nice, 28-yard touch pass to Kenny Stills. But that was about it. Moore looked so good in Sunday's comeback versus the Jets, but he was abysmal in this contest.    Stills led Miami with five catches for 65 yards. Jarvis Landry (5-33) and Leonte Carroo (6-48) were the only other Dolphins with more than 20 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
