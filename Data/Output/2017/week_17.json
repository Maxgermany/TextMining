      "comments": [" There were rumors heading into this game that this would be Jim Caldwell's last with the Lions. They didn't look like they were going to play hard for Caldwell in the early going, as they made numerous, careless blunders. The Lions were victimized by a surprise onside kick to start the game, which the Packers recovered. Green Bay kicked a field goal shortly afterward, though not on that same drive. Matthew Stafford then underthrew Kenny Golladay deep on the initial drive. The Lions, down 3-0, looked like they would either lose or barely squeak by, but they got their act together in the second quarter and dominated that game the rest of the way. It started when Stafford hit Marvin Jones with a 56-yard bomb to set up a field goal. The Packers then muffed a punt on their own 14, and Stafford found Jones two plays later to give Detroit a lead that it wouldn't relinquish. Thanks to another score in the second quarter, the Lions took a 20-3 lead into halftime.    Stafford finished 20-of-29 for 323 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught a two-point conversion on a trick play at the end of the game. Stafford had a slow start, but torched Green Bay's porous secondary mercilessly in the final three quarters. Stafford was a near-perfect 7-of-8 for 145 yards and a score following intermission. Green Bay will need to address its secondary this offseason, and I have them taking a cornerback in the second round of my .    Stafford's three touchdowns were thrown to his top three receivers: Tate (7-104), Jones (4-81) and Golladay (2-80). Tate also threw the aforementioned two-point conversion to Stafford, while Jones drew a defensive holding penalty near the goal line.    The Lions once again struggled to run the ball, as Tion Green was the team's leading rusher with 21 yards on nine carries. Ameer Abdullah (8-18) scored late in the game.    As for the Packers, their fans will be hoping that they never see Brett Hundley again. Hundley was a mess once again, giving Green Bay no chance to win. Remember the onside kick to begin the game? Hundley threw an interception on that drive, though that wasn't his fault. Jamaal Williams had the ball bounce off his hands, and into the arms of Jarrad Davis, who was beaten badly on the play. However, Hundley was to blame on several other poor plays. He lost a fumble in the red zone on a read-option, and then nearly took a safety on a grounding penalty. He followed that up by throwing a second pick. He looked like he was trying to toss the ball out of bounds, but Darius Slay made a terrific, tiptoe catch along the sideline. Hundley finished 14-of-24 for 172 yards, one touchdown and two picks. Most of that came in garbage time; Hundley was just 5-of-13 for 67 yards and an interception by halftime.    With Davante Adams and Jordy Nelson out, Trevor Davis was the leading receiver with three grabs for 56 yards. Randall Cobb (4-45) scored a late touchdown.    Jamaal Williams, responsible for Hundley's first interception, had a decent showing otherwise with 82 yards on 22 carries. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
