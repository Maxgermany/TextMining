      "comments": [" The Packers came into this game with numerous injury concerns. Both of their tackles were out, and they were also missing their best defensive lineman, Mike Daniels. The absences were a huge concern, as the Bears have a strong front seven and would surely be able to take advantage of the absences of David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga. In the end, Chicago never had a chance. Mike Glennon imploded, so despite the Packers generating just 260 yards, being outgained by the Bears in the process, they still posted 35 points in an easy blowout victory. Aaron Rodgers simply didn't have to do much, outside of making a few clutch throws to keep possessions alive. The Packers had just two lengthy drives that resulted in touchdowns, and one came via some impressive Ty Montgomery runs. Yet, Rodgers still was able to fire four scores thanks to a trio of Glennon turnovers. Rodgers' final numbers were 18-of-26 for 179 yards and the four touchdowns. The tackles impacted a couple of drives in the first half, but Chicago's pass rush as a whole was very underwhelming.    Montgomery, meanwhile, looked like he was going to have a huge game. He rushed for 28 yards on just five carries, as he was given the ball on five of Green Bay's initial seven plays. Unfortunately, Montgomery was knocked out of the contest with a rib injury. Montgomery was one of several Packer players who left the game. Jamaal Williams and Blake Martinez were also knocked out in the opening half, so a rookie named Aaron Jones had to handle the workload. Jones looked good, tallying 49 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. He's a big-time waiver-wire addition in fantasy this week if Montgomery and Williams miss time. Meanwhile, the most devastating injury occurred to Davante Adams, who took a violent hit to the helmet from Danny Trevathan. Adams had to be carted into the locker room on a stretcher. He caught two passes for 13 yards and a touchdown, though he would've scored a second time had a holding penalty not occurred. That hold actually contributed to his nasty hit, as it happened a couple of plays later.    Elsewhere in the receiving corps, Jordy Nelson caught two of Rodgers' touchdowns, logging four grabs for 75 yards. Randall Cobb (4-44) had the other. Martellus Bennett snatched six balls for 39 yards, but didn't reach the end zone.    Going back to the Bears, Glennon had some bright moments in this game, but he crushed his team with some abysmal mistakes. On his first drop-back, Glennon held the ball for an eternity, giving Clay Matthews enough time to strip-sack him, setting up Cobb's touchdown. Following a lengthy thunderstorm delay, Glennon fired a terrible pass, overshooting Markus Wheaton by a mile. Two plays later, Jones found the end zone. The exact same pass happened in the second half. A Glennon overthrow set up another Packer touchdown. Green Bay scored 21 points off Glennon's turnovers, which was exactly the margin of victory. Glennon gave this game away. Any other coach would've turned to Mitchell Trubisky. Most would've done so before this game. John Fox, however, is completely incompetent and is incapable of making logical decisions. He's coaching like it's 1995, and he believes he can win with just a running game. Trubisky would give the Bears some hope, despite the poor receiving corps, while Glennon isn't even a good fit for the offense, as Tony Romo repeatedly pointed out. Glennon finished 21-of-32 for 218 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions and a lost fumble. The Bears have extra time until their Monday Night Football affair, so they can prepare Trubisky to start. If Fox decides to keep Glennon as his quarterback, the Bears should part ways with him.    You'd think the Bears would've tried to establish the dynamic Tarik Cohen, as he's their best play-maker. For some reason, they didn't, as Cohen was given only four touches by the time the score was 35-7. It's like Chicago forgot he was on the roster. A smarter coaching staff would've designed plays for Cohen to get him into space, but Fox is completely overmatched. Cohen ended up with 24 rushing yards on six carries to go along with four catches for just as many receiving yards. Much of this came in garbage time; Cohen was barely a part of the offense when this game was still in doubt, which is inexcusable. Jordan Howard, meanwhile, managed 53 yards and a touchdown on 18 attempts.    The Bears didn't get much out of their receivers once again. Kendall Wright was the leader with 51 receiving yards and a touchdown on four catches. Deonte Thompson (5-44) and Josh Bellamy (3-36) were next on the list, while tight end Zach Miller snatched two balls for 45 yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
