      "comments": [" It's a shame that kickers matter so much in the NFL. I suppose this game is called <i>foot<\/i>ball, after all, but it's amazing how much of a difference kickers can make to determine the course of a game, or even a season. And the Buccaneers know that better than anyone. Tampa Bay has had major issues at kicker for years now. Robert Aguayo was cut, and the team appeared to have made an upgrade with Nick Folk, who converted a high percentage of his kicks with the Jets. Folk, however, struggled versus the Giants last week before drilling the game-winner, and his struggles continued Thursday night. He whiffed on all three of his field goal attempts. The first one wasn't on him, as it was from the mid-50s, but he then misfired from 49 and then 31. The latter kick was inexcusable. Had he converted the easy attempt, the Buccaneers may have won this game. It was a shame that the Buccaneers lost as a result of their kicker because their defense had a great game despite missing two starting linebackers and the top safety. Their pass rush was terrific, swarming Tom Brady and forcing him into his first interception of the year. Brady then lost a fumble in Tampa territory. The Buccaneers limited New England to just 19 points - three of which were the result of a failed onside kick to set up a Stephen Gostkowski field goal - but their kicker let them down.    Meanwhile, New England's defense showed much improvement, as the team didn't blow nearly as many coverages as it did versus Carolina. That said, Jameis Winston deserves the most blame for this loss after Folk. Winston missed numerous receivers for potential big gains. He was just off on some of his throws. On one instance, he overthrew an open DeSean Jackson for a touchdown. On another, he had a potential interception thrown into double coverage that was dropped. Winston was excellent in the fourth quarter, nearly leading his team back from a 16-7 deficit, but time just ran out. Winston finished 26-of-46 for 334 yards and a touchdown. He didn't have a poor performance, but it was an underwhelming one. Winston's ball placement was erratic, and this is something that needs to improve if he wants to take the next step.    Doug Martin provided the Buccaneers with a huge spark. Playing his first game of the season, Martin muscled his way for 74 yards on just 13 carries. He also scored a touchdown. He was a breath of life for a dead rushing attack. He should receive a larger workload going forward.    Mike Evans didn't have a great stat line, catching five balls for only 49 yards. Jackson led the Buccaneers in receiving (5-106), while Cameron Brate (5-68) caught Winston's sole touchdown. Brate should've had a second score, but he dropped the ball in the end zone.    As for the Patriots, it was odd to see Brady turn the ball over twice, especially against a defense missing two starters. Brady went 30-of-40 for 303 yards, one touchdown and an interception, which was an overthrow. Brady's pass protection was horrible, as Tony Romo frequently pointed out that Nate Solder is dealing with an injury. Robert Ayers dominated the line of scrimmage.    Brady's sole score went to Chris Hogan, who caught eight of his 11 targets for 74 yards and a touchdown. Brandin Cooks (5-85), led the team in receiving, though he dropped a pass on third down. He, Hogan, Danny Amendola (8-77) and James White (7-57) were the only Patriots who registered more than 10 receiving yards. Dwayne Allen, meanwhile, didn't see a single target despite Rob Gronkowski's absence.    Dion Lewis outgained Mike Gillislee, 53-53, though Gillislee had five more carries. Most of Lewis' output came on a 31-yard burst. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
