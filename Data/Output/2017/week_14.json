      "comments": [" New Orleans-Atlanta battles are often close games, and that was the case in this iteration. The Falcons, desperate for a victory to avoid 7-6, managed to get the win in an ugly contest that featured numerous Saints getting hurt. Alvin Kamara was the primary New Orleans player who was knocked out. Kamara caught a 23-yard pass on the opening drive, but suffered a concussion a couple of plays later. Kamara left the field and never returned. That dramatically changed the course of this game, as the Saints struggled to move the ball. They held possession for only 20 of the 55 minutes following Kamara's concussion, converting just 3-of-10 third downs without their best player. The offense, as noted on multiple occasions by Cris Collinsworth, is built around Kamara, so New Orleans' game plan completely changed once the Rookie of the Year favorite suffered a head injury. The Saints also saw several defensive players get hurt, including defensive back Kenny Vaccaro and defensive end Trey Hendrickson. Left guard Senio Kelemete was also concussed. The Saints had to use their third-string left guard to protect Drew Brees, yet they were still in position to potentially win at the very end. They had possession in the red zone in a 20-17 deficit, but Brees threw an inexplicable interception on a forced throw into the end zone, snatched by linebacker Deion Jones, who made numerous outstanding plays throughout the night.    The Falcons, meanwhile, were very fortunate to prevail. They caught breaks with the injuries and the odd interception, and they managed to win despite some horrible decisions by Matt Ryan. Last year's MVP threw three interceptions. One wasn't his fault - the ball bounced off Austin Hooper's hands - but the other two certainly were. He forced a throw to Julio Jones at the end of the opening half to ruin a chance for three points, and then he underthrew Jones in the end zone. Ryan, who was responsible for some terrible clock management at the end of the opening half, robbed his team of at least six points. Ryan finished 15-of-27 for 221 yards, one touchdown and the three picks. He was almost intercepted on two other occasions, but the potential picks were dropped. Ryan made some great passes to help his team convert 26 first downs, and he was 7-of-12 on third down, but the mistakes nearly ended up costing the Falcons this game, and their season.    Despite Marshon Lattimore's return, Julio Jones caught five balls for 98 yards. Lattimore won some battles, but couldn't keep Jones from going off. Jones, in addition to what he posted in the box score, also drew a defensive hold. Ryan's sole touchdown went to Mohamed Sanu (6-83).    Devonta Freeman nearly hit the century mark, gaining 91 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. He would've hit triple digits had a long run of his not been wiped out by a hold. All in all, he ran well, considering that left guard Andy Levitre was out.    Going back to the Saints, Brees posted good numbers - 26-of-35, 271 yards, two touchdowns and an interception - but that final stat killed the team. Additionally, Sean Payton helped seal the loss by running onto the field when the Falcons were draining the clock. He was flagged for a 15-yard penalty, and that allowed Atlanta to kneel down. Earlier, the Saints had an illegal formation on a field-goal try right before halftime, and the clock ran out as a consequence. This was a very sloppy game by the Saints.    With Kamara out for all but one drive, Mark Ingram handled the entire workload. He didn't have much success on the ground - 12 carries, 49 yards - but he helped his PPR owners with four catches for 43 receiving yards.    The only Saint with more receiving yards than Ingram happened to be Michael Thomas. Despite battling Desmond Trufant, Thomas caught 10 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown. Trufant broke up a touchdown to Thomas in the opening quarter, and he poked Thomas in the eye on the final drive of the game. Thomas didn't miss much action, but Brees didn't throw the ball to him after that. Thomas' best play was a 16-yard diving catch on the sideline at the beginning of the second quarter. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
