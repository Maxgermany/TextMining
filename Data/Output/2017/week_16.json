      "comments": [" The Ravens knew they'd make the playoffs if they were to beat the Colts and Bengals in their final two games of the regular season. Indianapolis came into this contest with just three victories, but did not roll over. In fact, the Colts had a chance to tie the game at the end of regulation, but Baltimore's defense stood tall after a blocked punt, securing its ninth victory of the season. It seems like the Ravens should feel good about winning, but this game was disconcerting for their potential January success. That's because Joe Flacco played poorly. The numbers don't indicate that - he went 29-of-38 for 237 yards and two touchdowns - but the stats don't tell the whole story. Flacco should've been able to help the Ravens score more than just 23 points against one of the worst defenses in the NFL, but he made several mistakes. He whiffed on an open receiver in the red zone, missed Alex Collins in the flat, and took a horrible, 17-yard sack. Granted, the conditions were rainy and windy, but Flacco should've been able to be more productive against an atrocious secondary missing top cornerback Rashaan Melvin.    With Flacco struggling, no receiver really stood out. Mike Wallace led the way with four catches for 60 yards, while Ben Watson had five grabs for 40 yards. Watson fantasy owners - i.e. me - were robbed when Maxx Williams vultured a touchdown in the second half.    The Colts have a solid run defense because of Johnathan Hankins, so that would explain why Alex Collins was limited to just 51 yards on 18 carries. Danny Woodhead, meanwhile, contributed in the passing game, catching five balls for 33 receiving yards.    As for the Colts, Jacoby Brissett had his own struggles. He didn't turn the ball over, but easily could have. On one drive in the fourth quarter, he missed on a wide-open target and was nearly intercepted. He kept the drive alive with a scramble on fourth down, but he had an overthrown pass that was dropped by Eric Weddle, who was disappointed in himself for botching such an easy chance at a pick. Brissett finished 16-of-33 for 215 yards and a touchdown. He made some nice throws, and three of his incompletions were dropped, but he had some accuracy issues at times. Brissett had more pass protection than he's used to, and that helped the Colts hang around in this game.    T.Y. Hilton took advantage of Jimmy Smith's absence, catching six passes for 100 yards. He dropped a pass, but made up for it with a great sideline grab. Jack Doyle (5-41) was next on the receiving list.    Frank Gore ran well against a stout ground defense, pushing forward for 68 yards on 17 carries. Next week could be his final game as a starter - I have the Colts taking Saquon Barkley in my - and he'll eventually find his way into the Hall of Fame despite the hate Rich Eisen received on Twitter for saying so. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
