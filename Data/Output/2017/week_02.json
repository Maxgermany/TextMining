      "comments": [" Both of these teams have incredibly tough matchups next week (Texans at Patriots; Bengals at Packers), so a victory here was needed to avoid a sure 0-3 start. The Texans prevailed, while the Bengals became the first team in NFL history to play its first two games of the season at home without scoring a touchdown since the 1939 Philadelphia Eagles. It's no surprise that Cincinnati is struggling so much offensively. The team lost its two top offensive linemen, Andrew Whitworth and Kevin Zeitler, to free agency this offseason. As a result, they have what could be the worst blocking unit in the NFL. Andy Dalton didn't have many opportunities behind a horrific offensive line, so the Bengals had to adjust by making him release the ball much more quickly. This only helped marginally, as the Bengals accumulated 143 net yards in the second half. Dalton finished 20-of-35 for 224 yards. The numbers don't look terrible, but that adjective is exactly how I would describe the Bengal quarterback. Dalton was under duress quite a bit, but he had some chances to hit throws, and his inaccuracy killed him. Dalton had open receivers for big gains on a few occasions, but misfired very poorly. The awful line play is the primary culprit for Cincinnati, but Dalton is the clear No. 2 on the blame list.    Deshaun Watson, meanwhile, had similar problems. Because of Duane Brown's holdout, Watson was pressured very frequently. Like Dalton, Watson didn't take advantage of the few opportunities he had, at least early in the game. Watson missed a wide-open Braxton Miller when Pacman Jones slipped in coverage, and then he had a pick-six that was dropped. Watson then held on to the ball too long on one occasion, and was absolutely flattened by Geno Atkins. I was wondering if Watkins had suffered a concussion, but he scampered for a brilliant 49-yard touchdown immediately afterward. It was a breath-taking play that had the announcers comparing it to Michael Jordon's athletic ability, referencing what Watson's college coach said of him. Watson's second half was nondescript until the penultimate offensive drive. Bill O'Brien suddenly had trust in Watson even though the Texans were pinned in their own territory. Rather than trying to run out the clock, O'Brien had Watson drop back to pass repeatedly, and it paid off big time. Watson had some clutch completions to DeAndre Hopkins, setting up a field goal to ice the victory. Watson was 4-of-6 for 31 yards with an 11-yard scramble on that possession, allowing Houston to kick a 42-yard field goal to go up four. Watson, who went 15-of-24 for 125 yards, led the team in rushing, gaining 67 yards and a touchdown on five scrambles. Lamar Miller (18-61) and D'Onta Foreman (12-40) struggled to find running room, so they'll also benefit whenever Brown returns to action.    Despite being paired with a rookie quarterback who doesn't get protection, DeAndre Hopkins had a solid stat line, catching seven balls for 73 yards. Hopkins also drew two pass interference flags, meaning he has five in total through two games this season.    The Texans came into this game with numerous injuries, and they added more to that list. They lost two cornerbacks, Johnathan Joseph and Kevin Johnson to shoulder and knee problems, respectively. This is the last thing Houston needed with an impending battle against the Patriots.    The other stud receiver in this game, A.J. Green, hauled in five balls for 67 yards. Like Hopkins, he's suffering from the offensive line's poor play as well. The difference is that he's paired with a veteran signal-caller. Dalton really needs to step up because he's playing like crap. Elsewhere, Tyler Eifert also had a disappointing stat line with three grabs for 42 yards. Eifert appeared to score a touchdown, but he stepped out of bounds, so there was an illegal touching penalty. Eifert was knocked out of the game in the second half with some sort of injury. As for John Ross, he didn't catch a pass in his debut, and he also fumbled on his only touch.    The silver lining for the Bengals is that Marvin Lewis finally appears to be transitioning toward Joe Mixon. The rookie runner seemed to get the majority of the workload toward the end of the game. He finished with the most carries on Cincinnati, as his nine attempts went for 36 yards. Mixon, who made J.J. Watt miss on an impressive 7-yard burst, was much better than Jeremy Hill (6-17) and Giovani Bernard (5-10), both of whom were stuffed on short-yardage opportunities, though Hill converted a try on the next play with an impressive leap. Bernard (2 catches, 16 rec. yards) dropped a pass. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
