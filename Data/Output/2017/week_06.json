      "comments": [" The prophetic Tony Romo said that teams in games like this can stick around and win if they don't turn the ball over, and the give-aways certainly turned out to be the difference in this contest. The Eagles were guilty of just one turnover in the early going, but Carolina's three give-aways proved to be more costly. The Panthers were up, 10-3, in the second quarter, and it didn't look like the Eagles were going to accomplish much offensively because of Lane Johnson's absence. Carson Wentz came into this contest with just a 2-8 record without his elite right tackle, as opposed to 9-2 with Johnson. Things looked dicey for Wentz in the early going, as Julius Peppers beat Johnson's backup for a strip-sack. It was Peppers' 150th-career sack, making him one sack shy of fourth place, all time. The Panthers recovered, and though they didn't score off the turnover, they looked like the better team in the opening quarter-and-a-half. The Eagles simply couldn't do much because of immense pressure on the right side. As mentioned, Carolina maintained a touchdown lead in the second frame, but things began unraveling for them. It started when Cam Newton threw his first interception of the evening. Newton couldn't step into his throw because Fletcher Cox, making his return from injury, pushed guard Trai Turner into his quarterback. This forced an errant pass that was picked off deep in Carolina territory. The Eagles capitalized with a Wentz touchdown to Zach Ertz, immediately following a Luke Kuechly concussion. Kuechly was lost for the entire game, and that had a profound impact on this result. The Eagles were so much more effective offensively following halftime, gaining 188 yards compared to 122 in the opening two quarters, and their yards-per-play average rose to 5.2 compared to the 4.3 figure they maintained at halftime. Meanwhile, the Panthers continued to turn the ball over. Newton had a second pick that bounced off Jonathan Stewart's hands. A third interception sailed over the head of Kelvin Benjamin when Newton was trying a desperation comeback late in the fourth quarter.    Wentz finished 16-of-30 for 222 yards and three touchdowns. He had his aforementioned early struggles, but caught fire with Kuechly off the field. He did a great job of converting third-and-long situations again, including a third-and-10 connection in which he stepped up in the pocket amid pressure. This ultimately led to a touchdown. Wentz's only real error, aside from his lost fumble, was not seeing an open Nelson Agholor to convert a first down to ice the game. Luckily for him, the defense did a great job on Newton.    Ertz had a tough matchup going into this game, as Carolina is excellent against tight ends. That changed with Kuechly out, as Ertz was able to score twice. He caught two balls for 18 yards. The other touchdown was caught by Agholor (4-55). Alshon Jeffery, meanwhile, finally had an easy matchup. He hauled in four balls for 71 yards, leading the team with 10 targets.    The Eagles ran the ball well for the most part; LeGarrette Blount did a good job of moving the pile and getting yards after contact. He mustered 67 yards on 14 carries. He also found the end zone on a two-point conversion.    As for the Panthers, Newton struggled with the three turnovers, as his offensive line couldn't hold up against Philadelphia's elite defensive front. Cox's return had a major impact, and Newton frequently found himself under duress even though the Eagles seldom blitzed. Newton went 28-of-52 for only 239 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. Fortunately for his fantasy owners, Newton was able to scramble 11 times for 71 yards and a touchdown on the ground.    Christian McCaffrey was a big part of the passing offense, catching 10 passes for 56 receiving yards and Newton's sole aerial touchdown. However, he didn't do much on the ground, getting four carries for eight yards. Still, he was way more effective than Jonathan Stewart, who somehow had minus-4 yards on eight attempts on top of his drop that resulted in an interception. Stewart was hit in the backfield almost every single time he touched the ball, and it seemed like a wasted down every time the Panthers tried to involve him. Carolina needs to move away from Stewart, as he's slowing down the offense. Perhaps the coaching staff will figure that out with the extra time off this upcoming week.    Benjamin nearly hit the century mark, catching nine balls for 99 yards. He would have gotten there had he not dropped a pass in the second half. Benjamin was the only Panther non-running back to be productive, as Ed Dickson (4-36) and Devin Funchess (3-36) disappointed. On one instance, Dickson appeared as though he'd convert a first down, but linebacker Nigel Bradham had a tremendous hit to stop him dead in his tracks. Bradham had an unbelievable performance, as he was all over the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
