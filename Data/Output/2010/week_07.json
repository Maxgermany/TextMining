      "comments": [" At 4 p.m. Sunday, I tweeted (), Dolphins-Steelers game is fixed. No question about it. It certainly appeared that way. Ben Roethlisberger ran the ball in for a game-winning touchdown, but fumbled prior to crossing the goal line. Even though Miami clearly recovered the ball, official Gene Steratore inexplicably stated that he couldn't tell who came up with it, thus giving the Steelers the ball at the half-yard line. With an extra possession, Pittsburgh kicked the decisive field goal. There's no denying that Steratore made a very crooked call - and it was even more shady that it took him 10 minutes to decide what to do - but Dolphins fans can't complain too much because their team blew way too many opportunities, so it's not like they didn't have a chance to win. Miami obtained the ball twice in the red zone off Pittsburgh turnovers in the first half. They couldn't get into the end zone, settling for a pair of field goals. In fact, the Dolphins kicked five times, all from 40 yards or closer. Dan Carpenter was perfect on all of his tries.    The Dolphins were simply too conservative, and I don't know why. Chad Henne was a solid 23-of-36 for 257 yards and a touchdown. Running the ball didn't work; Ricky Williams was OK (11-48), but Ronnie Brown couldn't do anything (9-14). At one point, Miami inexplicably opted to run the ball in a short-yardage situation with Brown over Lousaka Polite, and were unsuccessful.    Ben Roethlisberger fumbled three times, but was otherwise pretty sharp, going 19-of-27 for 302 yards and a pair of touchdowns to Hines Ward (7-131) and Mike Wallace (2-53).    Miami did a great job shutting down the run, particularly in the red zone; Rashard Mendenhall had just 37 yards on 15 carries.    Bad news for the Steelers: Star defensive end Aaron Smith tore his triceps and is out for the year.   "],
