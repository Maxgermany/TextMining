      "comments": [" This may sound odd considering the score, but this outcome could have been a lot uglier. The Ravens outgained the Panthers 258-93 in the first half, but weren't able to put the game away because of their red zone struggles. In their first two trips to the red area, they had to settle for a field goal after an odd play call on 3rd-and-goal on the 5-yard line (a Ray Rice run) and then fumbled the ball away on the ensuing trip. It wasn't better after intermission. On Baltimore's first possession, Derrick Mason tripped on his route on third down, forcing the Ravens into yet another short field goal. Fortunately for the Ravens, they were able to cover the enormous 12-point spread with two fourth-quarter pick-sixes.    The Panthers were simply overmatched, as they started their fourth-string quarterback and running back. Brian St. Pierre, who was a stay-at-home dad last week, went 13-of-28 for 173 yards, one touchdown and the aforementioned pick-sixes. He also should have thrown several more interceptions (Terrell Suggs missed an easy one.) Most of St. Pierre's yardage came on one 88-yard touchdown to David Gettis.    Poor Steve Smith had just four catches for 46 yards. He's wasting away on this miserable Carolina team.    Mike Goodson once again posted great fantasy numbers, rushing for 120 yards on 22 carries.    Joe Flacco was amazing, going 24-of-33 for 301 yards and a touchdown. At halftime, he was 16-of-18 for 213 yards and the score; it's a shame the Panthers couldn't keep up because Flacco could have posted career numbers.    Ray Rice didn't have great rushing numbers (19-65), but collected 131 total yards and a score.   "],
