      "comments": [" I called Mike Shanahan the dumbest coach in the NFL for benching Donovan McNabb in favor of Rex Grossman. Yum, yum, crow, NOM NOM NOM NOM. Grossman, known as a turnover machine throughout his career, certainly lived up to that reputation at Dallas almost immediately, lobbing an ugly interception off his back foot in the first quarter. Grossman later fumbled on a strip sack, and the Cowboys eventually established a 30-14 lead through three quarters. I don't know what happened to change things, but Grossman was on fire in the final 15 minutes. He finished 25-of-43 for 322 yards, four touchdowns and two picks, and it's hard to imagine that McNabb could have out-performed him. Shanahan got the most out of a sub-par Jake Plummer in Denver, and he may just be able to work his magic with Grossman in Washington. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.    Two of Grossman's touchdowns went to Santana Moss (8-72). It's good to know that Moss isn't dead in the fantasy realm just yet.    The Redskins didn't get a chance to run the ball much because they were down early, but Ryan Torain performed well in his limited action. Torain totaled 53 yards on 11 carries. Torain also caught five balls for 48 receiving yards and a touchdown.    While Grossman was prolific in the fourth quarter, Jon Kitna was exceptional throughout. Kitna went 25-of-37 for 305 yards and two touchdowns to Jason Witten (10-140) and Miles Austin-Jones (3-38). Kitna also had a third potential touchdown that was dropped by Sam Hurd.    With Marion Barber out, Felix Jones (12-70) and Tashard Choice (15-53) split successful carries against Washington's anemic defense.   "],
