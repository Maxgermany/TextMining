      "comments": [" People are going to see that Carson Palmer went 25-of-36 for 371 yards and two touchdowns, and assume that he's magically back to 2005 form. He's not. He's still floating balls, demonstrating no arm strength, looking slow and failing to read the blitz. He also fumbled twice. His production was more of Terrell Owens (10 catches, 222 yards, TD) abusing Cleveland's secondary. Palmer was able to show nice touch on a couple of fades to Owens, as he seemed to realize that Owens is in fact his better receiver; not Chad Ochocinco. As for Ochocinco, he had three grabs for 59 yards. He committed an offensive pass-interference penalty on Cincinnati's final drive. He's just not the same guy he was last year, and I'd like to blame his lack of focus during the offseason. Next time, don't film multiple crap $10 reality TV shows.    I have to wonder why Cedric Benson had just 15 carries (for 60 yards). The score was only 13-10 at halftime, so it's not like this game was out of hand and the Bengals had to throw.    Seneca Wallace was 18-of-30 for 184 yards, one touchdown and an interception, but was the superior quarterback in this matchup. Wallace will never be a legitimate long-term starter, but I like his pocket presence and mobility.    Peyton Hillis once again impressive for Cleveland. Tasked with going up against a solid Bengals defense, Hillis still managed 102 rushing yards and a touchdown on 27 carries.   "],
