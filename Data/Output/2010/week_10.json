      "comments": [" The Bills couldn't win this season. The Lions had dropped 24 consecutive road games going into this contest. This was destined to be a tie. Fortunately for Buffalo fans, that wasn't the case because Shaun Hill lobbed a pass way out of the end zone on a two-point conversion attempt with 14 seconds remaining in regulation. So, congratulations, Bills! You're one win away from ensuring that Andrew Luck won't be your franchise quarterback!    Ryan Fitzpatrick, Buffalo's beloved signal-caller, went 12-of-24 for 146 yards and a touchdown at a rainy Orchard Park. Lee Evans and Steve Johnson combined for just five catches.    Fred Jackson did it all. It seemed like every five minutes, NFL.com would have a Big Play Alert highlighting a long Jackson gain. Jackson rushed for 133 yards on 25 carries, and also caught six balls for 37 receiving yards. He scored twice.    Hill once again posted great fantasy numbers. He went 29-of-50 for 323 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Those stats are a farce, however, as Hill was erratic all afternoon. He had some passes dropped, but should have also tossed a couple more picks.    Calvin Johnson had 10 grabs for 128 yards and a score. Jahvid Best, meanwhile, struggled despite battling a putrid Buffalo defense. Best gained just 35 yards on 17 attempts.    Detroit played a really sloppy game and didn't seem interested at all. The Lions committed a whopping six penalties in the first nine minutes of the game, and continuously shot itself in the foot the entire afternoon.   "],
