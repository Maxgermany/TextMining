      "comments": [" I'm going out on a limb here, but this battle between an old decrepit quarterback and a young signal-caller making his first start is not going to be re-aired on NFL Network anytime soon. Starting with the young guy, Jimmy Clausen was 16-of-33 for 188 yards and a costly interception inside the red zone. The biggest problem for Clausen was that he and center Ryan Kalil just couldn't get on the same page. There were three botched snaps, and the Panthers lost two of them. Carolina had only two first downs in the opening half. Still, despite Clausen's struggles, the Panthers were driving down the field for a potential game-winning touchdown in the middle of the fourth quarter. However, Jonathan Stewart (8 carries, 13 yards) was guilty of an ugly fumble, which the Bengals recovered. Cincinnati scored a touchdown a couple of plays later to ice this contest.    As with Joe Flacco last week, Clausen had zero time to throw in this game. Because of this, Steve Smith managed only three receptions for 22 yards.    DeAngelo Williams rushed 10 times for 64 yards. Stewart had a score in addition to his fumble. On the bright side, Mike Goodson didn't get a single carry; John Fox must have read our interview in the <b> <\/b>.    As for Carson Palmer, he had another ugly game, going 19-of-37 for 195 yards, one touchdown and two ugly interceptions. Neither Terrell Owens (4 catches, 42 yards) nor Chad Ochocinco (4-34) could do much.    Jermaine Gresham actually paced the Bengals in receiving with four grabs for 59 yards. The other rookie, Jordan Shipley, had three catches for 37 yards.    Cedric Benson was easily Cincinnati's most effective offensive player, gaining 81 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. He also had another receiving score.   "],
