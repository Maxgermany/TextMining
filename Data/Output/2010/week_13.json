      "comments": [" If the Packers advance deep into the playoffs, they may look back at this victory as the turning point of their season. Yes, the 49ers suck, but that's irrelevant; the important thing is that Green Bay may have found its running game. Rookie James Starks, a talented back out of Buffalo who hasn't been able to play because of injuries, rushed for 73 yards on 18 carries. Those may not be overly impressive numbers at first glance, but they are when you consider that the 49ers ranked third against the run going into this weekend. Pick up Starks immediately.    With Starks running well, everything was clicking for the Packers. Aaron Rodgers went 21-of-30 for 298 yards and three touchdowns, connecting on multiple deep throws to Greg Jennings (6-122, 2 TDs) and Donald Driver (4-73, TD). Driver's 61-yard score was especially impressive, as he broke three tackles and found the end zone to really open up this game.    The 49ers had the chance to draft Rodgers back in 2005, so if watching him thrive was bad enough, San Francisco fans had to endure Troy Smith's anemic quarterbacking. Smith went 10-of-25 for 194 yards, one touchdown and an interception, but should have been picked a couple of other times and was unbelievably inept in the red zone. Most of Smith's yardage came on a 66-yard touchdown to Vernon Davis (4-126, TD) on a missed tackle. Davis has to be happy in the wake of his first solid outing in a long time, but the 49ers will need to address the quarterback position this offseason because Smith certainly isn't the answer.    With Frank Gore out for the year, Anthony Dixon and Brian Westbrook each saw nine carries for 33 and 31 yards, respectively. Dixon caught one pass; he was one of only four 49ers who logged at least one reception.    Jeff Jersey Shore Reed - yes, THAT Jeff Reed - was 3-of-3 for 44 yards for the 49ers. I still can't believe it.   "],
