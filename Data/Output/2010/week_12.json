      "comments": [" I'll forever remember this game as the battle of two players who shouldn't have been on the field. Roy Williams and Reggie Bush seemed to take turns killing their team, with Williams ultimately prevailing (i.e. being responsible for his team's loss.) Bush didn't seem ready for live game action. On his first play, the football hit him right on the helmet on an attempted throw. Bush later dropped an easy pass on third down that would have set the Saints up on a first-and-goal. Afterward, Bush fumbled a punt return, setting up the Cowboys with a short field and a subsequent touchdown. Williams, meanwhile, dropped a pass, but was ultimately responsible for the loss. He took a long completion deep into New Orleans territory, but fumbled the ball away. The Saints scored the winning touchdown on the next possession. One has to wonder why Williams continues to see so many snaps.    Jon Kitna actually had to go to Williams (5-83) early and often because the Saints made sure Dez Bryant wouldn't beat them. New Orleans doubled Bryant on every play. The stud rookie consequently caught no passes. Miles Austin-Jones, meanwhile, had just three receptions for 25 yards, but had a 60-yard touchdown on an end-around.    I talked about the crappy players, but Drew Brees ultimately stole the show with a brilliant 89-yard drive in 1:08 to win the game. Brees went 23-of-39 for 352 yards, one touchdown and an interception. After a great start to open up a 17-0 advantage, Brees cooled off until his final possession, allowing Dallas to come back and obtain an unlikely cover.    Robert Meachem caught just one pass for 55 yards, but it was the big play to put the Saints into scoring position on the final drive. Marques Colston, meanwhile, had six grabs for 105 yards.    The Cowboys fumbled a whopping seven times in this game. Though they recovered six of them, it made me wonder if the Ghost of Wade Phillips was coaching his old team again. Dallas was back to its old tricks - playing well but screwing itself with dumb mistakes.   "],
