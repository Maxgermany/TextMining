      "comments": [" There is no reason this game should have been close in the second half. The Falcons went up 14-0 right away, and led 17-0 at intermission. However, they let the Panthers hang around, thanks to extremely conservative play-calling by Mike Mularkey. Once the Panthers scored to make it 17-7, Atlanta began running the no-huddle offense to perfection, scoring almost instantly.    I said this contest shouldn't have been close because Atlanta really dominated the matchup. At the end of the first half, the Falcons had the net yardage advantage, 202-33. The Panthers had just two first downs at that point, and the furthest they advanced on the field was their own 36-yard line. Fail.    Carolina's offense was miserable. The offensive line refused to block for Jimmy Clawful, as the Falcons dominated the trenches (5 sacks). When Clawful did have time in the pocket, he was wildly inaccurate, going 14-of-24 for 107 yards and an interception. Worst of all, the play-calling was very predictable and unimaginative. On one key third down inside the red zone, Clawful's primary receiver on a play was Gary Barnidge, who was double covered. Gary freaking Barnidge - and Atlanta knew it was coming. The good news for Panther fans? You can start buying your Andrew Luck jerseys!    Carolina was able to run the ball well in the second half; Jonathan Stewart finished with 133 yards on 18 attempts, while Mike Goodson mustered 70 yards and a nifty touchdown on nine attempts.    Speaking of running the ball, Michael Turner compiled 112 yards and three touchdowns on 28 attempts. The Panthers showed no interest in tackling at times, and it seems as though they have given up on the completely inept John Fox.    Ryan disappointed his fantasy owners, going 20-of-34 for 227 yards, one touchdown and an interception. He just didn't need to air it out because his team was up big almost instantly.   "],
