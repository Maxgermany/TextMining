      "comments": [" Last week, the Broncos were able to capitalize on Tennessee's mistakes and careless penalties to earn their second victory of the year. This week, it was Denver that shot itself in the foot and didn't give itself a chance to win. The Broncos fumbled a kickoff to give Baltimore three free points, and committed seven penalties - in the first half alone. One infraction (pass interference) gave the Ravens the ball on the 1-yard line. Two negated long plays. Two put Denver in third-and-long. Thanks to all of these penalties (they finished with 10), Baltimore was able to establish a 17-0 lead. And you don't come back against the Ravens down 17.    Kyle Orton still managed to piece together a great statistical performance, going 23-of-38 for 314 yards and two touchdowns. However, the problems persist - Denver continued to struggle in the red zone.    Brandon Lloyd caught both of Orton's touchdowns and finished with five grabs for 135 yards. He was second in the NFL in receiving yardage coming into this weekend, and it appears as though he'll be first come Tuesday. This is amazing because Lloyd was essentially out of the league prior to this season.    Without Knowshon Moreno, the Broncos predictably struggled to run the ball. Laurence Maroney's six carries went for 27 yards. Correll Buckhalter wasted five attempts for 13 yards.    While Denver couldn't move the ball on the ground, the Ravens were very successful in doing so. Ray Rice scored twice - his first of this game was also his first on the year - and finished with 133 yards on 27 attempts. Willis McGahee, meanwhile, totaled 67 yards and a score on 10 rushes. Even Joe Flacco scrambled for 20 yards and a touchdown.    Flacco was a solid 14-of-25 for 196 yards. He did his best work on third down, keeping drives alive in the second half. Baltimore was 7-of-13 on third downs.    Rookie tight end Ed Dickson led the Ravens with 58 receiving yards, but all of that came on one reception. Anquan Boldin had just one catch for eight yards, as he struggled to break free from Champ Bailey.   "],
