      "comments": [" The Ravens won this game by converting third downs. In the live in-games thread on the forum, I wrote, Baltimore must be 500/500 in converting third downs outside of the red zone. Overall, they were 6-of-13, but most of those failed attempts occurred deep in Miami territory. The Dolphins' red-zone struggles into this contest were well-documented. I guess the Ravens watched too much Miami tape because they were anemic close to the goal line as well. Baltimore had a whopping seven trips into the red zone, and managed just one touchdown (19 points overall). The team was guilty of multiple sacks, penalties and botched field goals.    Of course, Miami had its issues in the red zone as well. Most notably, Chad Henne missed a wide-open Anthony Fasano in the end zone on 3rd-and-goal at the 1-yard line. And unlike the past two weeks, Dan Carpenter whiffed on a field goal.    Joe Flacco was prolific in this game (20-27, 266, 2 TDs), but the guy who made things happen was Ray Rice, who registered 180 total yards (83 rushing, 97 receiving). Unfortunately for Rice owners, Willis McGahee vultured a touchdown on a 32-yard first-quarter reception. Derrick Mason (4-42) had Flacco's other score. Anquan Boldin (2-28) didn't do much statistically.    Chad Henne made some nice throws in this game, but was his usual erratic self; he went 22-of-34 for 231 yards and three interceptions, though one of the picks wasn't his fault because Brian Hartline fell down. Henne fumbled twice as well.    Brandon Marshall had five catches for only 30 yards. Hartline (4-85) and Davone Bess (5-50) both had bigger fantasy outings.    The Dolphins ran the ball just 11 times with their running backs, as they were behind throughout. Ricky Williams (2-1) did nothing, but Ronnie Brown (9-59, TD) was effective. I'll never understand why Lousaka Polite didn't get the ball on the aforementioned 3rd-and-goal at the 1.    The amusing thing to come out of this game was a fight between Channing Crowder and LeRon McClain. During a heated exchange, Crowder was seen wiping his face and later claimed that McClain spit on him. Said Crowder after the game, Y'all can write it down - the [expletive] punk Le'Ron McClain spit in my face. Keep writing - he spit in my face, and that's why I got mad. The refs told me they didn't see nothing, they didn't see the spit hit my face.   "],
