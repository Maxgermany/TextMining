      "comments": [" It's pretty hilarious how pathetic Buffalo's offense is. Here are some fun numbers: - At one point, Trent Edwards was 4-of-7 for 8 yards. When he hit his next pass, I posted the following on the forum, Trent Edwards has hit double-digit passing yards!!! - The Bills had just nine first downs in this game. - Buffalo was 3-of-14 on third downs (as a comparison, Miami was 8-of-18). - The Bills had only 72 yards on their first nine possessions. - Of Buffalo's first seven possessions, five were three-and-outs. - This one is from LeeLee: The Bills have 76 yards of offense after 3 quarters. Three NFL teams have had single plays longer than that today.    Edwards finished 18-of-34 for 139 yards and a touchdown. His refusal to throw the ball downfield - even at the end of the game when he had no choice - is really disturbing. He cannot be allowed to start any longer.    C.J. Spiller's numbers made him look like a ninth-round pick rather than a No. 9 overall selection. He rushed for just six yards on seven attempts, and also chipped in with four receptions for eight receiving yards. Spiller took numerous losses, as his offensive line couldn't open up any lanes for him. No surprise there.    I'll have time to bash the Bills even further for the next 16 weeks. As for the Dolphins, they were nearly as anemic on offense, especially in the second half, where they had only 37 yards on their first four possessions.    Chad Henne was just 21-of-34 for 182 yards. As in the preseason, Henne continued to be plagued by drops, as Brandon Marshall had a 40-yard reception fall out of his hands. Marshall had a solid PPR performance overall, snagging eight receptions for 53 yards. Davone Bess, meanwhile, had six grabs for 51 yards.    Miami was able to win this contest by gashing Buffalo on the ground yet again; Ronnie Brown had 65 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries, while Ricky Williams totaled 62 yards on 18 attempts.   "],
