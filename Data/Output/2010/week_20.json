   "comments":" I thought the strength of the Jets was supposed to be their defense. If they were going to lose, it was going to be on Mark Sanchez, right? I don't know what happened to New York's stop unit in the first half. Even though the defense held Ben Roethlisberger to 7-of-14 passing for 96 yards and an interception prior to intermission, it could not stop the Steelers. Rashard Mendenhall trampled the Jets for 121 yards on 27 carries. Isaac Redman, meanwhile, chipped in with 27 yards on just 4 attempts. Rex Ryan's defense showed no interest in tackling. It was pathetic. The Steelers actually had more points (24) by halftime than New York ran plays (22).    The Jets were better in the second half - perhaps because Maurkice Pouncey injured his ankle - allowing Mark Sanchez to nearly engineer a miraculous comeback. Sanchez went 20-of-33 for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was ultimately betrayed by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's slow and shoddy play-calling inside the red zone. I really have no idea why LaDainian Tomlinson got the ball on the most important play of the game. On 4th-and-goal at the 1-yard line of a 24-10 contest, Schottenheimer called for a Tomlinson carry. Tomlinson was predictably stuffed at the goal line. He gained just 16 yards on 9 carries, while Shonn Greene generated 52 yards on the same amount of attempts. It's almost as if Todd Haley kidnapped Schottenheimer and took over the play-calling.    Having said all that, Sanchez shouldn't have been in that position to begin with. I can't get over how bad New York's defense was. As I wrote in the forums, The Steelers haven't looked this good against any playoff team all year. I don't get it. The Jets simply didn't have an answer for Roethlisberger's scrambling. Big Ben's passing numbers were hardly impressive (10-of-19, 133 yards, 2 INTs), but he evaded enough pass rushers in the backfield and picked up a few key first downs (and a touchdown) to keep the ball out of Sanchez's hands.

      "comment":"Roethlisberger to 7-of-14 passing for 96 yards and an interception prior to intermission, it could not stop the Steelers. Rashard Mendenhall trampled the Jets for 121 yards on 27 carries. Isaac Redman, meanwhile, chipped in with 27 yards on just 4 attempts. Rex Ryan's defense showed no interest in tackling. It was pathetic. The Steelers actually had more points (24) by halftime than New York ran plays (22).    The Jets were better in the second half - perhaps because Maurkice Pouncey injured his ankle - allowing Mark Sanchez to nearly engineer a miraculous comeback. Sanchez went 20-of-33 for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was ultimately betrayed by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's slow and shoddy play-calling inside the red zone. I really have no idea why LaDainian Tomlinson got the ball on the most important play of the game. On 4th-and-goal at the 1-yard line of a 24-10 contest, Schottenheimer called for a Tomlinson carry. Tomlinson was predictably stuffed at the goal line. He gained just 16 yards on 9 carries, while Shonn Greene generated 52 yards on the same amount of attempts. It's almost as if Todd Haley kidnapped Schottenheimer and took over the play-calling.    Having said all that, Sanchez shouldn't have been in that position to begin with. I can't get over how bad New York's defense was. As I wrote in the forums, The Steelers haven't looked this good against any playoff team all year. I don't get it. The Jets simply didn't have an answer for Roethlisberger's scrambling. Big Ben's passing numbers were hardly impressive (10-of-19, 133 yards, 2 INTs), but he evaded enough pass rushers in the backfield and picked up a few key first downs (and a touchdown) to keep the ball out of Sanchez's hands.
