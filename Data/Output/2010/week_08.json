      "comments": [" If the Dolphins had a crappy kicker, they might be winless right now. They once again struggled in the red zone thanks to player ineptness (Ronnie Brown drop) and poor play-calling (short pass on 3rd-and-8; run on 3rd-and-6). However, Carpenter was able to salvage this victory on a 5-of-5 afternoon, including a 54-yard bomb.    Miami's offense was solid otherwise, generating 354 net yards. Chad Henne went 24-of-37 for 217 yards and an interception. Three of his receivers had five or more catches: Brandon Marshall (5-64), Davone Bess (7-53) and Brian Hartline (5-53).    The Dolphins ran the ball really well; Brown had 61 yards on 16 carries, while Ricky Williams mustered 47 yards on nine attempts.    The Bengals' offense was actually really impressive on its opening drive, but fizzled out afterward. In fact, they didn't achieve a first down in between the 2:45 mark of the second quarter and the 11:10 mark of the fourth quarter. As you might guess, this was yet another poor afternoon from Carson Palmer. Palmer went 17-of-38 for only 156 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Palmer's second score was bogus; Dolphins safety Chris Clemons had a routine interception, but tipped it up twice and into the hands of Terrell Owens.    Speaking of Owens, he had both of Palmer's scores along with five receptions for 65 yards. Chad Ochocinco, meanwhile, disappointed yet again with three grabs for 34 yards.   "],
