      "comments": [" Marvin Lewis told the media that he planned on playing his starters in this contest because his teams suffered two blowouts after he sat his first-stringers in meaningless Week 17 contests. Well, Lewis kept his word - well, sort of. Andy Dalton, A.J. Green and company were on the field for just a half before giving way to Bruce Gradkowski. The Ravens, meanwhile, used Joe Flacco and Ray Rice for about two-thirds of the first quarter. Thus, I'm not going to delve much into this game.    Dalton went 10-of-15 for 78 yards and a touchdown to Marvin Jones (5-45, TD). Green caught two balls for 26 yards. BenJarvus Green-Ellis sat out.    For the Ravens, Flacco went 4-of-8 for 34 yards. He didn't have Anquan Boldin at his disposal. Ray Rice rushed three times for five yards.    Bernard Pierce handled most of the workload with Rice sitting out. He gained 89 yards on 22 carries.    One injury worth noting: Baltimore fullback Vonta Leach went down on the second play, but John Harbaugh said he'll be fine for next week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
