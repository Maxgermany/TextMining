      "comments": [" This was an impressive duel between teams that love to screw themselves over with mistakes. It went back and forth, as both squads tried their best to top the other to see who could commit the worst blunder. Here's how this chess match went: Cowboys: Tony Romo missed Miles Austin-Jones for an easy touchdown in the first quarter. Panthers: Cam Newton was picked in the end zone as he was getting hit later in the opening quarter. Cowboys: Austin-Jones lost a fumble in Carolina territory in the second quarter. Panthers: Newton overthrew Jonathan Stewart in the end zone later in the period. Cowboys: Doug Free was whistled for a false start on a 3rd-and-4 in Carolina territory after halftime. Dallas consequently failed to convert in longer yardage. Panthers: Carolina did the same thing in a 3rd-and-10. Cowboys: Jay Ratliff's personal foul and Brandon Carr's defensive holding helped the Panthers score a touchdown. Dez Bryant then dropped a score of his own. Panthers: The Panthers committed a strange personal foul penalty as Dallas was running the clock out. This gave the Cowboys a first down, allowing them to run off more time. This also let them kick a field goal, which covered the spread. The FOX announcers were befuddled by this infraction, and so was I. It was almost as if the officials wanted to make sure that Dallas would win by more than a field goal.    As for the actual players, both quarterbacks performed relatively well despite getting nothing out of the running game. Romo went 24-of-34 for 227 yards and a touchdown to Austin-Jones (5-97). Newton, meanwhile, was 21-of-37 for 233 yards, one touchdown to Brandon LaFell (4-53) and the aforementioned pick. One thing that really bothers me is that Newton is barely running in the red zone. He did scramble six times for 64 yards, but none of this came deep in Dallas territory. After the game, a sullen Newton told the media that he's demanding change. I'm not sure what sort of change, but it appears as though he's defeated mentally.    Of the receivers who didn't score a touchdown, Steve Smith (7-83) was best. Jason Witten (6-44) was just OK. Dez Bryant (2-14), however, disappointed. He appeared to suffer a concussion but reentered the game and dropped a touchdown. This was a very disappointing outing, as Bryant continued to show the inconsistency that has plagued him throughout his career thus far.    As mentioned, both running games were sluggish. Felix Jones, expected to gash Carolina's poor defense, gained just 44 yards on 15 carries. Jonathan Stewart, meanwhile, ran for 35 yards on only 10 attempts. DeAngelo Williams (2-4) was nowhere to be seen.    Two potentially major injuries for the Cowboys: Phil Costa, who has been out most of the year, seemed to break his ankle in the second quarter. He was carted off the field. Sean Lee later left the game with a sprained toe, but he told the media he expects to play next week. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
