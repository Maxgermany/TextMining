   "comments":" The Cowboys have been the dumbest team in football for years, but they've always come through on Thanksgiving under Tony Romo. That, apparently, is not the case any longer, as Dallas has now reached a new all-time low in stupidity. Things started innocently enough. Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged 7 times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly Cole Beasley (7-68). Miles Austin-Jones didn't catch a single pass because he left the game with a hip injury. He'll have an MRI on Friday.    The Cowboys struggled to run the ball, as Felix Jones gained just 14 yards on just 6 carries. Conversely, Alfred Morris trampled Dallas' pathetic front, collecting 113 yards and a touchdown on 24 attempts.    As for the Washington receivers, Pierre Garcon looked completely healthy for the first time since Week 1. He notched 5 receptions for a team-leading 93 yards and a touchdown. Aldrick Robinson, Santana Moss (4-42) and Niles Paul had the other scores. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

      "comment":"Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, 2 Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged 7 times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for 2 reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to 7 twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for 3 quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, 3 touchdowns and the aforementioned 2 interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly Cole Beasley (7-68)."

   "comments":" Best Thanksgiving ever - not only did most of us get dinner and dessert, we also were able to enjoy a comedy show to cap off the evening. The Jets are a complete joke. New England scored 3 touchdowns in 52 seconds during the second quarter. Following a Tom Brady score, Mark Sanchez, who earlier tossed an ugly interception in the red zone, scrambled, inexplicably ran into his own guard and fumbled. The Patriots picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Joe McKnight had a fumble pop into the air, which was brought back for 6. A 56-yard Brady-to-Julian Edelman touchdown later, and New England was suddenly up 35-0. The frustrated crowd continuously chanted Te-bow for the rest of the evening, but Rex Ryan didn't listen to his fans' wishes. He stuck with Mark Sanchez, who padded his numbers against a prevent Patriot defense. His final numbers were 26-of-36 for a fraudulent 301 yards, 1 garbage-time touchdown and the aforementioned pick. Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps. That's the story the Jets are spinning, anyway. I'd like to know why Tebow was active if he couldn't take the field. I think Ryan is full of crap. </i>    Tom Brady, meanwhile, went 18-of-28 for 323 yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing). He missed a couple of deep throws in the third quarter that had him frustrated, but was otherwise flawless. He was totally dialed in, as he was on a mission to prove that his offense could score without Rob Gronkowski.    Outside of Wes Welker (7-71, TD), no Patriot had more than 3 receptions. Shane Vereen (2-91) and Edelman (2-64) collected the other scores, while Brandon Lloyd (3-26) disappointed yet again.    New England once again ran the ball very well. Stevan Ridley mustered 97 yards and a touchdown on just 21 carries. Vereen chipped in with 42 yards on 10 attempts.    The star for the Patriots' defense was the usually beleaguered Steven Gregory. The safety picked off Sanchez in the first quarter and then scored on Sanchez's aforementioned fumble.    The only Jets' offensive-skill player worth mentioning is Shonn Greene, who ran effectively when this game was close. He had just 14 carries, but was able to gain 71 yards. The New York receivers piled up their yardage when the Patriots' defense played softly with a huge lead. Jeremy Kerley led the way with 7 catches for 86 yards.    If there's 1 glaring concern for New England, it's Stephen Gostkowski, who has been shaky at times this year. He pushed a try wide left from just 39 yards out.   ",

Ryan's refusal to use Tebow was most apparent when the Jets had a 4.h-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the third quarter. They ran the ball and were stuffed. Tebow is such a great goal-line runner, so why not use him there? Even if Ryan doesn't want to unseat Sanchez as the starter, he's hurting his team by not using his top short-yardage option. Ryan has been an unbelievable moron this season, and he completely deserves his terrible 4-7 record. <i> NOTE: It was later revealed that Tebow had a rib injury, which is why he didn't play any snaps.

   "comments":" When Bears' offensive coordinator Mike Tice was asked earlier in the week if Jay Cutler would play, he replied, God, I hope so. It's easy to see why. With Cutler back under center, Chicago's offense was actually functional. It accumulated 296 total net yards and converted 11-of-19 third downs. Cutler was solid, going 23-of-31 for 188 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He could have enjoyed a better fantasy day had the Vikings been able to keep up. Instead, it was 25-3 by halftime, so Cutler threw for just 71 yards after intermission.    As you might expect, Cutler targeted Brandon Marshall almost exclusively. Marshall caught a whopping 12 balls for 92 yards. In fact, the only other Bear wideout with more than 1 reception was Earl Bennett (4-45).    Chicago pretty much played a clean game. The team had just 1 penalty in the first half. The only blemish was Matt Forte, who lost a fumble on the offense's first play of the contest. This led to Minnesota's sole score prior to intermission. Forte later lost another fumble that was taken back for a touchdown, but the play was reviewed and overturned. Unfortunately, Forte limped off the field during that sequence of events. Michael Bush, however, picked up the slack and mustered 60 yards and 2 touchdowns on 21 attempts. Forte wasn't the only prominent Bear who left this contest with an injury. Devin Hester suffered a concussion. Lance Briggs was in a walking boot, but reports indicate that he's OK.    As for the Vikings' rushing attack, Adrian Peterson gained 108 yards on 18 carries. He just wasn't as effective because Minnesota had to abandon the running game in the wake of trailing big early.    Christian Ponder struggled without Percy Harvin, going 22-of-43 for just 159 yards, 1 touchdown and an ugly interception on an overthrow. Ponder suffered through some drops, including a crucial 1 by Jerome Simpson on third down when the team took an early trip into the red zone, but was largely ineffective.    Ponder threw his sole score to Kyle Rudolph (5-55), who suffered a concussion in the 4.h quarter (along with Harrison Smith). Jarius Wright, meanwhile, led the team with 7 receptions, playing in Harvin's slot position. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

   "comments":" I'd say the Bengals could have sleepwalked through this game and still won it, but that's exactly what Oakland did. For the third week in a row, the Raiders have shown absolutely no effort on the football field. They've been outscored in their previous 3 games by a score of 127-47. Believe it or not, this is only the 13th time since 1989 that a team has lost by 21-plus in 3 straight contests. Oakland's futility has frustrated 1 of the players who is actually trying hard. Following a blown call that negated a defensive touchdown, Lamarr Houston slammed Andy Dalton to the ground after a play was ruled dead in the 4.h quarter. This bothered Cincinnati left tackle Andrew Whitworth, who then headbutted Houston. The 2 teams started fighting, and the ultra-lazy Tommy Kelly, who apparently was bored with football and wanted a change of pace with his life, took off his helmet for no apparent reason. All 3 players were ejected.    The Raiders went down early, training 21-0, thanks to a career-long 48-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis burst - a sure sign that a defense has thrown in the towel. Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage. It also must be mentioned that Dalton was able to convert 9-of-15 third downs.    Two of Dalton's scores went to Mohamed Sanu, who led the team with 5 receptions for 29 yards. The other was thrown to Jermaine Gresham (4-41). A.J. Green didn't find the end zone, but still had a big day, catching 3 passes for 111 yards.   ",

Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage.

Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Green-Ellis burst - a sure sign that a defense has thrown in the towel. Oakland was trying to spark a comeback by going for it on 4.h down near midfield toward the end of the second quarter, but fullback Owen Schmitt was stuffed at the line of scrimmage. So, with all of the Raiders' offensive firepower, they opted to go with Schmitt? Really?    Carson Palmer went 19-of-34 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception that was the result of a tipped pass. His offensive line couldn't block Cincinnati's defensive front. He was sacked 4 times, including 1 that resulted in a lost fumble.    The offensive star for Oakland was once again Marcel Reece, who rushed for 74 yards on 15 carries to go along with 4 catches for 29 receiving yards. The only 1 to find the end zone was Denarius Moore, whose 20-yard score was his only reception of the afternoon.    Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.    Andy Dalton went 16-of-30 for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns - slightly disappointing numbers considering the quality of competition - but it's worth noting that he had just 59 passing yards after halftime as a result of his team's huge early advantage.

Green-Ellis had a rare great performance, rushing for 129 yards on 19 carries. Most of his yardage came on 2 long gains of 48 and 39 yards, both of which qualified as career-long runs. He also scored once, but missed out on other touchdowns. He was tackled inside the 2-yard line on 4 occasions in this contest.

   "comments":" Good teams missing their starting quarterback are usually very sharp. They hit hard, block well, force turnovers, and most of all, take care of the football. I'm beginning to think that the Steelers are not a good football team because for the second week in a row, they've been sloppy without Ben Roethlisberger. I still can't believe it, but Pittsburgh committed 8 turnovers in this game. EIGHT turnovers. Only 12 teams have had as many give-aways since 1989. It gave Pittsburgh no chance, as teams that have been guilty of 7 or more turnovers since 1989 are just 1-51. All of their running backs coughed it up: - Rashard Mendenhall lost a fumble in the first quarter, which led to a Cleveland field goal. - Isaac Redman lost a fumble in the second quarter deep in his own territory, which led to a Cleveland touchdown. - Jonathan Dwyer lost a fumble at the end of the first half, but the Browns couldn't take advantage of it. - Chris Rainey lost a fumble with 2:36 remaining in the game near midfield, ruining a potential game-winning drive. - Mendenhall and Rainey both fumbled on another occasion, but Cleveland did not recover. These weren't the only mistakes the Steelers made. They had 9 penalties, 1 of which was a ticky-tack hold that negated a 33-yard Heath Miller reception. Meanwhile, Mike Wallace had the ball pop out of his hands and into the arms of a Cleveland player. This was 1 of 3 interceptions that Charlie Batch threw. Batch went 20-of-34 for 199 yards and the 3 picks. He had some very ugly passes, but wasn't as bad as some media members are making him out to be. Had he gotten some help from his teammates, he may have pulled off a victory.    Batch's preferred targets were Emmanuel Sanders (5-75), Heath Miller (6-63) and Rainey (4-15). Wallace caught 1 pass for 9 yards, which was the final play of the game. He was thrown to 8 times.    Plaxico Burress, who was signed this week, didn't catch a pass, but drew a pass-interference flag on Sheldon Brown in the end zone.    It would've been difficult to believe heading into this game, but Pittsburgh's leading rusher (Dwyer) had 19 yards. Mendenhall gained just 6 yards on 4 attempts. The Steelers have to upgrade this position after the season.    As for the victor, Brandon Weeden had an up-and-down game. He went 17-of-26 for 158 yards, 1 touchdown and a pick-six. Weeden spent most of the first half throwing short of the chains on third down and was nearly intercepted on several occasions, but did a good job of converting the opportunities that the sloppy Steelers gave him. However, Weeden suffered a concussion late in the 4.h quarter.    Weeden's touchdown went to Jordan Cameron (2-12). His top targets were Josh Gordon (4-60) and Trent Richardson (4-27). Richardson also rushed for 85 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries - numbers that aren't that bad considering the defense he was battling. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

These weren't the only mistakes the Steelers made. They had 9 penalties, 1 of which was a ticky-tack hold that negated a 33-yard Heath Miller reception. Meanwhile, Mike Wallace had the ball pop out of his hands and into the arms of a Cleveland player. This was 1 of 3 interceptions that Charlie Batch threw. Batch went 20-of-34 for 199 yards and the 3 picks. He had some very ugly passes, but wasn't as bad as some media members are making him out to be. Had he gotten some help from his teammates, he may have pulled off a victory.    Batch's preferred targets were Emmanuel Sanders (5-75), Heath Miller (6-63) and Rainey (4-15). Wallace caught 1 pass for 9 yards, which was the final play of the game. He was thrown to 8 times.    Plaxico Burress, who was signed this week, didn't catch a pass, but drew a pass-interference flag on Sheldon Brown in the end zone.    It would've been difficult to believe heading into this game, but Pittsburgh's leading rusher (Dwyer) had 19 yards. Mendenhall gained just 6 yards on 4 attempts. The Steelers have to upgrade this position after the season.    As for the victor, "

   "comments":" Andrew Luck has been the primary reason why the Colts are in prime position for a playoff berth. Well, Luck wasn't at his best in this contest, but Indianapolis still prevailed because his teammates stepped up. Rookie receiver TY Hilton keeps improving every week. Though he caught only 3 passes, he was instrumental in this victory because he scored once as a receiver and on another occasion as a punt-returner. Hilton actually became the first player in franchise history to find the end zone in both situations in the same game. The defense was also great, especially on third down, holding Buffalo to just 4-of-13 conversions. The Bills were also just 1-of-3 in their red-zone trips. Emerging inside linebacker Jerrell Freeman recorded a whopping 16 tackles and a sack. Robert Mathis also had a sack, while Tom Zbikowski appeared to have a big interception in his own territory, but was stripped of the ball while foolishly attempting to stiff-arm an offensive player from behind. And of course, there was Reggie Wayne, who was the only Colt to haul in more than 3 passes. He had 8 catches for 102 yards with recovering head coach Chuck Pagano looking down from the owner's box. Wayne's only blemish was a tipped ball that resulted in an interception.    As mentioned, Luck wasn't at his best. He went 20-of-37 for 240 yards, 1 touchdown and the aforementioned pick. He was 8-of-16 on third down, so that is encouraging.    The Colts couldn't run the ball very well. Vick Ballard (13-41) and Donald Brown (10-26) split their touches almost evenly.    Buffalo lost, but the silver lining is that Chan Gailey actually utilized C.J. Spiller much more often than Fred Jackson. Spiller (14-107) had almost double the carries compared to Jackson (6-16) and predictably was much more effective. Each had 1 catch.    Ryan Fitzpatrick was just 17-of-33 for 180 yards, 1 touchdown and an interception. He was nearly picked off a couple of other times. He was also terrible in the red zone, just as he was against the Dolphins last Thursday night.    The only Bill to have more than 2 receptions was Stevie Johnson, who had 6 grabs for 106 yards. Backup tight end Lee Smith caught Fitzpatrick's only score.   ",

      "comment":"Andrew Luck has been the primary reason why the Colts are in prime position for a playoff berth. Well, Luck wasn't at his best in this contest, but Indianapolis still prevailed because his teammates stepped up. Rookie receiver TY Hilton keeps improving every week. Though he caught only 3 passes, he was instrumental in this victory because he scored once as a receiver and on another occasion as a punt-returner. Hilton actually became the first player in franchise history to find the end zone in both situations in the same game. The defense was also great, especially on third down, holding Buffalo to just 4-of-13 conversions. The Bills were also just 1-of-3 in their red-zone trips. Emerging inside linebacker "

   "comments":" You really have to wonder where this Jacksonville team would be if the portion of the front office that actually believed in Blaine Gabbert going into this season (which includes general manager Gene Smith) wasn't so stubborn in sticking with Gabbert for 2.and-a-half months. The Jaguars have looked so much better with Chad Henne the past 2 weeks, nearly taking down the once-beaten Texans and then beating a competent divisional rival as a home underdog. Henne went 17-of-26 for 261 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception that really wasn't his fault because his pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Henne was at his best on third down, converting 7-of-14 attempts.    Henne looked toward Cecil Shorts (4-105, TD), Justin Blackmon (5-62, TD) and Marcedes Lewis (4-56) almost exclusively, as they were the only Jacksonville players with more than 1 reception.    Jalen Parmele was expected to start after handling the majority of the workload last week, but that didn't appear to be the case on the box score. Rashad Jennings handled most of the carries , gaining 43 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts. Parmele received just 8 tries (45 yards) because he hurt his leg early in the first quarter. He reentered the game later, but aggravated the injury in the 4.h quarter. He limped off the field and may not be able to play next week.    As for the other runner, Chris Johnson gained 80 yards on 21 carries. He didn't play very well aside from a 31-yard burst in the second half. He was more 10.ative than usual, even losing 11 yards on 1 play in the third quarter.    CJ2K's inability to run the ball hurt Tennessee deep in Jacksonville territory where the offense continuously bogged down. The Titans had to settle for way too many field goals. Rob Bironas missed a kick from 42 yards.    Jake Locker's receivers betrayed him in the red zone. Nate Washington appeared to score a touchdown in the third quarter, but was bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds. Later, Damian Williams had a second foot out of the end zone by a couple of inches. Had Locker's wideouts stepped up, the quarterback could have enjoyed a better day. He finished 23-of-40 for 261 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.    Kenny Britt caught Locker's touchdown, but it came late when Tennessee was down by 2 possessions. He had just 3 grabs for 25 yards. Washington (4-54) and Kendall Wright (5-48) were the leading receivers.   ",

   "comments":" What is it with Romeo Crennel and these impossible to win games? He defeated the perfect Packers last year and nearly took down the Steelers as a big underdog on Monday night a couple of weeks ago. The Broncos came into this contest as double-digit road favorites, but struggled to put the Chiefs away. They were even trailing in the third quarter, but eventually got their act together. The Broncos had 3 problems in this game. The first was their inability to stop the run. The combination of Jamaal Charles (23-107), Dexter McCluster and Shaun Draughn rushed for 143 yards on 27 carries. Denver hadn't given up more than 90 yards on the ground to an opponent since Week 5, so perhaps this was just an aberration. The second was the offensive line. For the second week in a row, it could not protect Peyton Manning. The Chiefs had just 2 sacks - both by Justin Houston - but they put heavy pressure on Manning the entire afternoon. In fact, Manning had to be tested for a concussion during halftime, but he was cleared to play. The third issue was Matt Prater, who whiffed from 47 and 33 yards. The first is understandable, but the latter kick, which hit an upright, perhaps thwarted the all-important cover. Prater was 15-of-17 heading into this contest, so this is likely just another aberration.    Manning had a solid day despite all of the pressure in his face. He went 22-of-37 for 285 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. The pick was an uncharacteristic poor decision on Manning's part, as he threw the ball downfield into double coverage.    Manning's touchdowns went to Demaryius Thomas (4-82) and Jacob Tamme (4-48). Eric Decker (4-64), Brandon Stokley (4-62) and Knowshon Moreno (4-26) all tied with the 2 scorers for the team's reception lead with 4.    Speaking of Moreno, he made the surprise start over Ronnie Hillman. He was effective, rushing for 85 yards on 20 carries. Hillman, for whatever reason, was given just 3 attempts for 9 yards. John Fox's disdain for rookie running backs is getting ridiculous.    As for the Chiefs, Brady Quinn started the game well, but struggled mightily after halftime. His numbers in the second half are laughable: 4-of-14 for just 38 yards and an interception (on a Hail Mary). At 1 point late in the contest, Quinn tossed a weak pass into the dirt and was booed heavily by the crowd. It's still unclear why Ricky Stanzi isn't getting a chance. Quinn's final numbers were 13-of-25 for 126 yards and the pick. Dwayne Bowe (4-41) was his leading receiver. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

   "comments":" Both quarterbacks were struggling early on, so the most amusing aspect of this contest occurred when the sprinkler system suddenly came on. It was so bizarre. There was a stoppage in the game, allowing me to tweet (): Someone please tell the Buffalo Wild Wings employee to stop messing with the Dolphins-Seahawks game. The water system was eventually shut off, allowing the 2 rookie quarterbacks to explode with very strong second-half efforts. Russell Wilson, despite the loss, was the most impressive of the 2. He went 21-of-27 for 224 yards and a pair of touchdowns. There was 1 drive in the third quarter where Wilson appeared to be sandwiched in between 2 defenders. He scrambled backward and found his target past the first-down marker. Later on the possession, Wilson ducked out of an attempted sack and scrambled for a 20-yard gain. Ryan Tannehill, meanwhile, finished 18-of-26 for 253 yards, 1 touchdown and an awful interception. He actually threw a second pick that was even worse where he foolishly heaved the ball way across his body, but he was bailed out with an Earl Thomas helmet-to-helmet penalty. However, Tannehill performed very well otherwise, leading his team on scoring drives of 82, 80 and 65 yards in the 4.h quarter.    Tannehill's top targets were Davone Bess (7-129) and Charles Clay (6-84, TD). Brian Hartline had just 2 receptions for 17 yards.    Reggie Bush and Daniel Thomas (9-60) both scored. Bush looked great for the first time in quite a while, gaining 87 yards on just 14 carries. It's the first time Bush rushed for more than 67 yards since Week 2.    The Seahawks shockingly didn't run the ball well, which was the difference in this game with both rookie quarterbacks shining. Marshawn Lynch mustered just 46 yards on 19 attempts.    Seattle's leading receivers were Golden Tate (4-56) and Sidney Rice (3-49). Anthony McCoy (2-23) caught the touchdown.    The Seahawks received terrible news after this game. Adam Schefter reported that starting corners Richard Sherman and Brandon Browner, both of whom are playing on a Pro Bowl level, might be suspended for 4 games for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.

   "comments":" <i> EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Web site contributor Matt McGuire sent me the following text: Watching out secondary makes me feel like someone is kicking me in the balls on every defensive drive of every game. </i>    The young Bucs stepped up and played the big boys tough, but the Falcons pulled out another close victory. With that being said, Atlanta was lucky to get this win. The Falcons had a series of mistakes of pathetic execution to almost give the game away. They won, but it was in far from convincing fashion. Here is a breakdown of the plays that should've earned Atlanta its second loss: Asante Samuel dropped 2 interceptions. One was an easy catch, but the ball fell right through his hands. The second dropped pick allowed the Bucs to try for a field goal for a 4.h quarter lead, but Connor Barth missed the 56-yard kick. The list continues: Matt Bryant shanked a 22-yard field goal on the last play before halftime; Matt Ryan threw a dumb interception to Ronde Barber, and Ryan blew a read for a sack-fumble in Atlanta territory; Julio Jones dropped a short touchdown pass. Bryant then missed a 48-yarder to give Tampa Bay 1 more shot at stealing the win with a Hail Mary attempt (Editor's Note: and a push).    Both offenses moved the ball all afternoon. The Bucs' first drive was pure domination as Doug Martin (21-50) scored a short touchdown to give Tampa Bay a 7-3 lead. Atlanta answered with a drive through the air as Ryan connected to Tony Gonzalez (6-62) for some key conversions. The drive ended with a short score from Jacquizz Rodgers. The Buccaneers pulled out a gadget play with Mike Williams (3-28) throwing a 28-yard pass to Vincent Jackson (5-96) to set up a Tampa Bay field goal. The Bucs had some blown opportunities of their own. Freeman missed a wide open Jackson and Williams in the end zone in the third quarter. Tampa Bay took a 13-10 lead, but it lasted only a few seconds as Ryan dropped in a beautiful 80-yard touchdown pass to Jones (6-147). The Bucs took the lead on the first play of the 4.h quarter with Martin plunging into the end zone. Tampa Bay's defense came up with a big play as E.J. Biggers had a sack-fumble on Ryan that was recovered by the Bucs. The play was completely Ryan's fault as he didn't diagnosis the free blitzer and held onto the ball too long. That led to another Barth field goal and a 23-17 Tampa Bay lead. Atlanta won the game on a short touchdown run by the decrepit Michael Turner (13-17).    Jacquizz Rodgers came up huge for the Falcons. He had 2 splash plays to help set up the game-winning touchdown run in the 4.h quarter. Rodgers got the drive started with a 42-yard kick return and then added a 32-yard reception to move the ball deep into the Buccaneers' territory. Atlanta should've given the majority of Turner's carries to Rodgers (10-49 on the ground, 2-30 in the air), since he was giving Tampa Bay's defense problems. Ryan completed 26-of-32 passes for 353 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Freeman was 19-of-30 for 256 yards but left points on the field. Tiquan Underwood (5-77) and Dallas Clark (4-65) contributed nicely for the Bucs.   ",

   "comments":" I'm too mad to write about this game. The Chargers were robbed, the Charger fans were robbed and those who bet on the Chargers were robbed. San Diego won this game, but inept official Gene Steratore blew it with what will go down as 1 of the worst calls in NFL history. The Chargers had the Ravens on the ropes. Baltimore was faced with a 4th-and-29 on the final drive in regulation. Joe Flacco couldn't find anyone downfield, so he just gave up, checking the ball down to Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Justin Tucker hit a field goal to send it to overtime. The Chargers punted twice because of a trio of drops. A pass interference was called on San Diego despite a ball being uncatchable. Torrey Smith made an amazing catch on a third down. And then Tucker made the decisive kick.    The Ravens clearly should have lost this game, as they never had a lead. However, I'll give credit to Rice (22 carries, 97 rush yards; 8 catches, 67 rec. yards) for that play, Joe Flacco (30-of-51, 355 yards, TD) for being a masterful 12-of-24 on third downs and Smith (7-144) for making that amazing 31-yard grab to set up Tucker for the game-winning kick.    One other thing on the Ravens: Bernard Pollard was flagged for a helmet-to-helmet penalty, which is significant because Ed Reed was initially suspended for this contest for too many of those infractions. If the NFL wants to make an example of someone, it should be Pollard; it seems like he has 1 of these dirty hits every single week.    Philip Rivers, meanwhile, went 23-of-36 for 228 yards. Most of his incompletions were throw-aways, as he was pressured all afternoon, getting sacked 6 times. Consequently, he was a horrendous 3-of-15 on third down. On the bright side, he was careful with the football, avoiding a turnover for just the third time all season.    As with his offensive line, Rivers' receivers let him down. There were several drops, particularly 3 in overtime. Antonio Gates (2-13) couldn't get open. Danario Alexander (5-74), who had a couple of drops, was also whistled for offensive pass interference.    Ryan Mathews was solid, rushing for 72 yards on 19 carries. You have to wonder why he wasn't given the ball more considering that San Diego led throughout.   ",

      "comment":"Philip Rivers, meanwhile, went 23-of-36 for 228 yards. Most of his incompletions were throw-aways, as he was pressured all afternoon, getting sacked 6 times. Consequently, he was a horrendous 3-of-15 on third down. On the bright side, he was careful with the football, avoiding a turnover for just the third time all season.    As with his offensive line, Rivers' receivers let him down. There were several drops, particularly 3 in overtime. "

      "comment":"Joe Flacco couldn't find anyone downfield, so he just gave up, checking the ball down to Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Justin Tucker hit a field goal to send it to overtime. The Chargers punted twice because of a trio of drops. A pass interference was called on San Diego despite a ball being uncatchable. Torrey Smith made an amazing catch on a third down. And then Tucker made the decisive kick.    The Ravens clearly should have lost this game, as they never had a lead. However, I'll give credit to Rice (22 carries, 97 rush yards; 8 catches, 67 rec. yards) for that play, Joe Flacco (30-of-51, 355 yards, TD) for being a masterful 12-of-24 on third downs and Smith (7-144) for making that amazing 31-yard grab to set up Tucker for the game-winning kick.    One other thing on the Ravens: "

      "comment":"Ray Rice. Rice made an incredible effort to run for what appeared to be a 30-yard gain for a shocking first down. The play was reviewed, however, and showed that his knee was down exactly at the 35-yard line. Steratore, who initially placed the ball at the 33-yard line, moved it back to the 33.5-yard line. That still gave the Ravens a first down, however, as the first-down marker was at the 34. There's just 1 problem with this - and it's that Rice is not 10 feet tall. If Rice's knee was down at the 35 and the ball was moved to the 33.5, that would mean that there are 1.5 yards separating Rice's knees and arms (as @hreneti pointed out). That would be 4.5 feet. Rice stands at just 5-8, and that's from his feet to his head; not his knees to his arms. Thus, it's physically impossible for Rice to have converted the first down. Of course, simple math isn't needed to determine that because the ball's shadow was shown just past the 35-yard line. Steratore should have placed the ball at the 34.5-yard line. That much is obvious. So, why did Steratore deliberately give Baltimore a favorable spot? He was probably just caught up the moment and didn't want to deny Rice's great effort. This play will be shown on highlight reels for years to come, but it'll always be tainted because Steratore screwed up. Steratore is like the anti-Jim Joyce. Perhaps he was just too scared of being vilified like Joyce was. As this occurred, it was clear that San Diego had no chance to win this game. Rice.

   "comments":" So, I don't think Ryan Lindley is going to be favored again anytime soon. Though Lindley played well at the beginning of this contest, what he did in the second half can be described as some of the worst quarterbacking of the year. Lindley's final numbers don't look that bad (31-of-52, 312 yards) if you ignore the 4 interceptions, but he was just 14-of-28 for 129 yards and 3 interceptions after the break, as Jeff Fisher made terrific adjustments at halftime. Lindley telegraphed a pick-six, tossed an interception when he didn't see a safety and then aired out another pick off his back foot returned for a touchdown (both by rookie Janoris Jenkins). He also overthrew Larry Fitzgerald for a long gain on 1 occasion and then was booed off the field when he hilariously heaved the ball toward some Cardinal players standing on the sideline amid no pressure. As I wrote last week, Lindley just doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL. John Skelton wasn't very good beforehand, but it was irresponsible for Ken Whisenhunt to bench him in favor of someone who is just too overmatched to play on this level.    Meanwhile, Sam Bradford completed just 8 passes on 17 attempts, but for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was brutal, as Bradford unnecessarily forced the issue into double coverage in the end zone, but he was great otherwise despite dealing with heavy pressure early on. Bradford had several long completions of 38, 37, 37, 25 and 22 yards. Three of those went to Chris Givens (5-115, TD).    The Rams were also effective in terms of moving the chains on the ground. Steven Jackson once again handled most of the workload, rushing for 139 yards on 24 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, Chris Wells scored twice, but was otherwise pretty pedestrian. He gained 48 yards on 17 carries.    Speaking of pedestrian, Larry Fitzgerald's numbers were once again awful; he caught 3 balls for 31 yards. He's dealing with bracket coverage, and the Cardinals just don't have the quarterback to deliver the football to him. Lindley spent most of the time throwing to Andre Roberts (9-92) and Rob Housler (8-82).   ",

      "comment":"Larry Fitzgerald for a long gain on 1 occasion and then was booed off the field when he hilariously heaved the ball toward some Cardinal players standing on the sideline amid no pressure. As I wrote last week, Lindley just doesn't look like he belongs in the NFL. John Skelton wasn't very good beforehand, but it was irresponsible for Ken Whisenhunt to bench him in favor of someone who is just too overmatched to play on this level.    Meanwhile, Sam Bradford completed just 8 passes on 17 attempts, but for 205 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception was brutal, as Bradford unnecessarily forced the issue into double coverage in the end zone, but he was great otherwise despite dealing with heavy pressure early on. Bradford had several long completions of 38, 37, 37, 25 and 22 yards. Three of those went to Chris Givens (5-115, TD).    The Rams were also effective in terms of moving the chains on the ground. Steven Jackson once again handled most of the workload, rushing for 139 yards on 24 carries.    As for Arizona's ground attack, Chris Wells scored twice, but was otherwise pretty pedestrian. He gained 48 yards on 17 carries.    Speaking of pedestrian, Larry Fitzgerald's numbers were once again awful; he caught 3 balls for 31 yards. He's dealing with bracket coverage, and the Cardinals just don't have the quarterback to deliver the football to him.

   "comments":" <i> EDITOR'S NOTE: It's tough to win in the Superdome, which makes Colin Kaepernick's victory here remarkable. Of course, another first-year starting quarterback won in New Orleans as well. If only Robert Griffin had the 49ers' defense behind him. </i>    There are 2 big takeaways from this game. One, the 49ers defense can dominate anybody in the NFL on any given day. Two, Colin Kaepernick is definitely entrenched as the starting quarterback. The San Francisco defense flexed its muscles and played physically dominant football. The 49ers were a violent unit that laid a beat down on the Saints, despite New Orleans having 1 of the best offenses in the NFL. San Francisco's front 7 pounded Drew Brees and a finesse offensive line. The signal-caller was sacked repeatedly and was constantly under pressure. Kaepernick, meanwhile, played well overall, completing 16-of-25 passes for 231 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception while running for 27 yards and a score on 6 carries. San Francisco is a different team and more dangerous on offense with Kaepernick at quarterback instead of Alex Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by Dashon Goldson. Colston deflected the ball into the air and Donte Whitner snatched it. He returned the pick 42 yards for a touchdown and a 28-14 lead. Brees connected on a 43-yarder to Lance Moore (3-61) and then finished the drive with a short scoring pass to Jed Collins. That was it for New Orleans as the San Francisco defense slammed the door in impressive fashion in the 4.h quarter.    Brees completed 26-of-41 passes for 267 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Darren Sproles (7-65) led the Saints in receiving, and they had a non-existent running game on the 49ers.    The 49ers defense had a great group effort. Four players recorded sacks: Aldon Smith (1.5), Justin Smith (1.5), Patrick Willis (.5) and Ahmad Brooks (1.5). Willis had 10 tackles with the secondary stepping up against New Orleans' passing weapons.    On the same play, Hunter and wide receiver Kyle Williams sustained knee injuries and were carted into the locker room together. It looked serious for both players.    Defensive tackle Brodrick Bunkley was ejected for kicking a 49er lineman on the ground. He may be suspended.   ",

He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by Dashon Goldson."

      "comment":"Aldon Smith (1.5), Justin Smith (1.5), Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson.

Colston deflected the ball into the air and Donte Whitner snatched it. He returned the pick 42 yards for a touchdown and a 28-14 lead. Brees connected on a 43-yarder to Lance Moore (3-61) and then finished the drive with a short scoring pass to Jed Collins. That was it for New Orleans as the San Francisco defense slammed the door in impressive fashion in the 4.h quarter.    Brees completed 26-of-41 passes for 267 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Darren Sproles (7-65) led the Saints in receiving, and they had a non-existent running game on the 49ers.    The 49ers defense had a great group effort. Four players recorded sacks: Aldon Smith (1.5), Justin Smith (1.5), Smith. The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack.

The veteran is a nice insurance policy as a backup, but this is the first-year starting quarterback's team now. Kaepernick got going early with a short pass to Mario Manningham (5-69), who turned that into a 40-yard gain as he jetted down the sideline while weaving through defenders. The next play went to Manningham again for 13 yards, and then Kaepernick ran the ball into the end zone from 7 yards out. Brees answered with a 33-yard gainer to Joseph Morgan on a diving catch. Brees finished the drive with a short touchdown pass to David Thomas (4-24). A muffed punt by Ted Ginn led to Brees taking the lead with a great catch by Marques Colston (4-36) for a 10-yard score. It looked like the Saints were in control when Kaepernick made a rookie mistake after a fumbled snap. He picked up the ball and threw it into double coverage for an interception to Patrick Robinson. He forced the throw and never saw the underneath defender. However, Brees gave it right back with an interception to Ahmad Brooks that was returned 50 yards for a touchdown. Kaepernick hit Delani Walker (3-81) for a 45-yard pass in the third quarter. Kendall Hunter (4-28) picked up 21 yards to set up a short touchdown toss to Frank Gore. Following that, the 49ers' defense opened up a can on the Saints. Justin Smith planted Drew Brees hard into the turf for a sack. Brees threw high for Colston a play later, and the wideout was dumped on the ground head first by "

   "comments":" Whoa. Whoa for both teams. The Giants looked unbelievably impressive following a much-needed bye. The Packers, meanwhile, suffered some records in futility for the Aaron Rodgers regime. This is the first time Rodgers has ever scored 10 or fewer points in a loss. It's also the first time he's ever suffered a defeat of more than 22 points. When it comes down to it, New York was dominant in the trenches on both sides of the football. The offensive line overpowered Green Bay's front, blasting open huge holes for Andre Brown (13-64, TD) and Ahmad Bradshaw (10-58, TD). It also blocked well for Eli Manning, who was sacked only once. Meanwhile, the Packers' linemen couldn't block the Giants whatsoever. Rodgers was constantly under pressure, getting sacked 5 times. Mathias Kiwanuka recorded 2 sacks, while Osi Umenyiora, who registered a sack and a forced fumble, showed signs of life for the first time all season. Having a healthy Antrel Rolle was also a major boost. Rodgers ended up 14-of-25 for 219 yards, an early touchdown to Jordy Nelson (2-71) who beat Corey Webster for a 61-yard score, an interception and a lost fumble. Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.    Only 3 Packer non-running backs made receptions: Nelson, Jermichael Finley (3-51) and Randall Cobb (4-39). Finley dropped a pass, but he showed great awareness by running from out of the screen and catching a ball that was tipped in the air.    Going back to Manning, he displayed no remnants of a tired arm that plagued him prior to the bye. Save for an ugly overthrow in the end zone on the opening drive, Manning was pretty much flawless, going 16-of-30 for 249 yards and 3 touchdowns.    Manning's scores went to Hakeem Nicks (5-77), Victor Cruz (3-36) and Rueben Randle (2-26). Cruz dropped a couple of passes, so he'll need to shore that up in December and beyond.    Unfortunately for the Giants, this victory came at a price. Andre Brown broke his fibula and could be out for the rest of the year. Safety Kenny Phillips, meanwhile, hurt his knee.   ",

Because he was rattled all afternoon, he couldn't get any rhythm going.    The lack of a ground attack hurt Rodgers as well. James Starks (8-35) was the leading rusher, while Alex Green gained 30 yards on 10 attempts. The Packers had a couple of nice runs, but they were both brought back by holding infractions. I nearly wrote Ahman Green instead of Alex Green, by the way. It's safe to say that a young Ahman Green would be a huge boost for this struggling Green Bay squad.    Only 3 Packer non-running backs made receptions: Nelson, Jermichael Finley (3-51) and Randall Cobb (4-39)."
