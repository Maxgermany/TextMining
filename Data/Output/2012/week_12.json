      "comments": [" The Cowboys have been the dumbest team in football for years, but they've always come through on Thanksgiving under Tony Romo. That, apparently, is not the case any longer, as Dallas has now reached a new all-time low in stupidity. Things started innocently enough. Jason Witten false started on the opening drive in the red zone, eliminating their chances of scoring a touchdown. They at least kicked a field goal on that possession; a false start by Doug Free and an inexplicable delay of game on the next play completely derailed the next drive. Washington wasn't doing anything offensively in the first quarter, so Dallas could have established an early lead and eliminate the opposing running game. They instead squandered their opportunities, and Robert Griffin eventually figured things out beginning in the second period. The Cowboys blew crucial coverages, permitting Griffin to torch them deep repeatedly. And just like that, the Redskins established a 28-3 lead by halftime. The Cowboys, in the meantime, continued to shoot themselves in the foot. There were the usual pre-snap penalties, two Tony Romo interceptions, a Dez Bryant lost fumble in Washington territory and a Bryant dropped touchdown. Dallas was flagged seven times in the first 40 minutes of the game.    I don't want to be completely negative about Dallas for two reasons. The first is that I want to credit Griffin, who was absolutely amazing. He went 20-of-28 for 311 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. He was even better than those numbers indicate because Mike Shanahan took the air out of the ball with his team nursing a lead of 20-plus in the second half. When the Cowboys attempted to make a comeback, Griffin made enough clutch throws to move the chains and set up a field goal, which iced the game. Second, the Cowboys could have packed it in, but they made a tremendous comeback. They brought it back down to seven twice, but couldn't stop Griffin when it counted most.    Tony Romo had to throw the ball 62 times because his team was down for three quarters. He went 37-of-62 for 441 yards, three touchdowns and the aforementioned two interceptions. He mainly targeted Bryant (8-145, 2 TDs), Jason Witten (9-74) and surprisingly Cole Beasley (7-68). Miles Austin-Jones didn't catch a single pass because he left the game with a hip injury. He'll have an MRI on Friday.    The Cowboys struggled to run the ball, as Felix Jones gained just 14 yards on just six carries. Conversely, Alfred Morris trampled Dallas' pathetic front, collecting 113 yards and a touchdown on 24 attempts.    As for the Washington receivers, Pierre Garcon looked completely healthy for the first time since Week 1. He notched five receptions for a team-leading 93 yards and a touchdown. Aldrick Robinson, Santana Moss (4-42) and Niles Paul had the other scores. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
