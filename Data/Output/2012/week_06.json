      "comments": [" Matt Ryan had the matchup of a lifetime against the Raiders. Everyone has been throwing successfully on an Oakland defense missing its starting cornerbacks. There was no way Ryan wasn't going to pass for at least 300 yards and four touchdowns. Well, I guess that's why Chris Berman invented the saying, That's why they play the games. Ryan, who had just three interceptions entering this contest, tossed three picks in the first half alone. Though the first two were his fault - he was hit as he heaved the third one - pass protection was the main culprit. The Raiders, who have struggled getting to the quarterback all season, somehow put good pressure on Ryan. It really looked like the Falcons were going to lose. Ryan couldn't really get anything going for the most part (24-of-37, 249 yards, TD, 3 INTs), especially in the red zone where his team squandered several opportunities. The Raiders, who were gashing the Falcons on the ground all afternoon, decided to throw the ball for some strange reason inside the Atlanta 30-yard line with only a few minutes remaining. Carson Palmer was pick-sixed by Asante Samuel, which gave the Falcons a touchdown lead. The Raiders would tie it up, but left too much time on the clock for Ryan, who engineered a 43-yard drive in just 39 seconds, setting up Matt Bryant's decisive 55-yard field goal.    It was a shame for Palmer because he had a great game outside of that pick-six. He went 23-of-33 for 353 yards, one touchdown and that interception. He nearly threw a second score, but tight end Brandon Myers dropped the ball. Darren McFadden was stuffed at the goal-line on the next play, which completely ruined the Raiders' end-zone opportunity.    Palmer's sole aerial score went to Denarius Moore, who found the end zone because linebacker Mike Peterson whiffed badly on a routine tackle. Moore led the team with five catches for 104 yards.    As mentioned, Oakland had its way on the ground. McFadden had just 70 yards and a score on 27 carries (along with a lost fumble), but Mike Goodson did most of the damage, picking up 59 yards on just four attempts. Darrius Heyward-Bey also had 20 yards on an end-around.    As for Atlanta's rushing attack, Michael Turner once again looked like he was running in quicksand, gaining just 33 yards on 11 carries.    Ryan's only touchdown went to Roddy White (6-72). Both Julio Jones (4-63) and Tony Gonzalez (4-42) disappointed their fantasy owners. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
