      "comments": [" Despite all of the Bountygate dramas and suspensions, it's still hard to believe the Saints are now 0-2. They were favored in both contests, yet they've been greatly outplayed by a wide margin. Weird penalties and uncharacteristic drops plagued the Saints last week, but those issues seemed to be resolved at Carolina. The defense, however, has been the consistent problem. The Redskins and Panthers have combined for 75 points in the two games. The blitzes have been ineffective, while the coverages have often busted. It doesn't help that the Saints have an injury-plagued secondary, which is forcing them to use inept cornerback Corey White. As a result, Cam Newton had a monstrous performance, as he desperately needed to rebound from last week's debaclation. Newton finished 14-of-20 for 253 yards and a passing touchdown to go along with 71 rushing yards (13 scrambles) and another score on the ground. His only blemish was a lost fumble. He also nearly tossed a pick to Patrick Robinson on an underthrow in the beginning of the third quarter. The Panthers showed some option in this contest; Newton picked up 40 yards on such a play on the second drive. The option backfired later though, as the aforementioned fumble occurred on a 4th-and-1 inside the red zone. Perhaps Newton's most important throw early on was a 35-yarder to Steve Smith on a 3rd-and-15 in the first half, though he later hit him with a 66-yard bomb, thanks to a blown coverage. Smith finished with three catches for 104 yards.    Based on what happened last week, it was amazing how well Carolina ran the ball. Then again, the Saints did make Alfred Morris look like the second coming of Clinton Portis last week. DeAngelo Williams (14 carries, 69 yards) and Jonathan Stewart (11-51) both gashed New Orleans. Mike Tolbert vultured a touchdown, but Stewart made up for it on a 17-yard receiving score on a prior possession.    As for Drew Brees, he did what he could considering that the Panthers constantly applied heavy pressure on him, easily beating both of his inept tackles. He finished 31-of-49 for 325 yards, two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) and a pair of interceptions. One pick wasn't his fault - it was a desperation heave as time was running out - but the other one was an uncharacteristic late toss over the middle as he was scrambling to his right. It was taken back for six.    Brees' lone aerial score went to Jimmy Graham, who hauled in seven passes for 71 yards. The leading receiver was Darren Sproles, who snagged 13 balls for 128 yards. It was nice to see the Saints involve Sproles more frequently after he had just five touches last week.    Pierre Thomas had a big game with numerous tough runs. He rushed for 110 yards on just nine carries also chipped in with four receptions for 33 more yards through the air. Thomas was tackled at the 1-yard line on one occasion, but checked himself out of the game to see Mark Ingram (16-53) find the end zone. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
