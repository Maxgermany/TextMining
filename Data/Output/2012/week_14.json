      "comments": [" Jeff Fisher told his team that it would have a chance at a playoff push with a victory in Buffalo. Both teams would actually been given life with a victory; because the Bengals and Steelers both lost, the Bills, at 6-7, would have been just one game back. Buffalo led throughout most of the afternoon, but the Rams prevailed thanks to an 84-yard, game-winning touchdown in the final few minutes. It's a borderline miracle that St. Louis was able to pull out this win - or at least it would have seemed that way early on because Sam Bradford didn't appear to have a chance. He was 5-of-17 for 37 yards and an interception in the opening half. The Bills were getting tons of pressure on him, which forced a number of errant throws. He deserves credit, however, for the aforementioned decisive drive. The key play was a 4th-and-1 conversion to Austin Pettis for nine yards, though the wideout needed to make a spectacular catch because the ball was thrown behind him.    Bradford's final numbers looked like this: 19-of-39 for 209 yards, one touchdown and a pick that would have gone back for six, but was nullified by a hold. His score went to Brandon Gibson (6-100). Danny Amendola was inactive, while Chris Givens (3-25) couldn't produce much because Bradford was inaccurate for most of the afternoon.    Steven Jackson had an OK outing, gaining 64 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. Buffalo's defense has improved against the rush since the bye, so this was a good effort from Jackson.    As for the Bills, Chan Gailey deserves to be fired for this latest defeat. His best player, C.J. Spiller, touched the ball just eight times and wasn't given an opportunity of any sort inside the red zone. He had 37 yards on seven carries to go along with a 15-yard reception. He was so much better than Fred Jackson; it wasn't even close. Jackson mustered only 14 yards on nine attempts, which included a lost fumble deep in St. Louis territory. Jackson ultimately suffered a knee injury that reportedly doesn't look good. I don't understand what the hell Gailey was thinking; his refusal to involve Spiller in this offense has cost his team multiple victories. It's bad enough to do it once or twice, but this has occurred at least half-a-dozen times already this season. He has to be axed because he clearly can't learn from his mistakes.    Despite holding a lead throughout, the Bills attempted 33 passes to just 16 runs. That's smart. Ryan Fitzpatrick was economical though, going 25-of-33 for 247 yards, one touchdown and an interception. He spent most of the afternoon dinking and dunking, however, because the Rams were able to apply consistent pressure. Rookie defensive tackle Michael Brockers dominated the line of scrimmage, registering 1.5 sacks (all in the first quarter) and a forced fumble.    Fitzpatrick's two leading receivers were Stevie Johnson (6-71) and Scott Chandler (5-71). Frustrated fantasy owners watched someone named Lee Smith catch Fitzpatrick's sole touchdown. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
