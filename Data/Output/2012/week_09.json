      "comments": [" It's funny how things can change in just a few weeks. The Bengals were once 3-1 and many were projecting them to challenge for the AFC North. Around the same time period, Denver lost to the Patriots by double digits, dropping to 2-3. The consensus was that Peyton Manning's arm was shot and that the Broncos would struggle to get into the playoffs because the Chargers were on fire. Well, I think we know where both teams currently stand. Manning, the hottest quarterback in the NFL entering this weekend, picked the Bengals apart despite the fact that Cincinnati strongly believed it had a solid game plan against him based on the success the defense had in its previous meeting. The Bengals were apparently dead wrong. Manning was pretty much flawless, going 27-of-35 for 291 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. The picks were his first since the opening half of Week 6. The first wasn't really his fault; Eric Decker stopped short on his route. The second was pretty bad, as Manning heaved an inaccurate ball from his own end zone. However, he rebounded with consecutive touchdown drives after that. Manning could have put together an even better performance had his supporting cast not let him down. I already mentioned Decker's blunder on the first pick; the Broncos dropped several passes early on. Decker was also responsible for an offensive pass interference penalty.    Despite the mistakes, Decker still had a monstrous fantasy performance, catching eight balls for 99 yards and two touchdowns. The other score went to Joel Dreessen (4-38).    Manning's supporting cast endured a couple of injuries. Demaryius Thomas (6-77) limped off the field in the first half, but was able to reenter the contest, drawing a long pass interference penalty late in the game. Meanwhile, Jacob Tamme (3-18) banged his elbow. He was fortunate though, as he was able to get back on the field.    The Broncos didn't rush the ball very well. Willis McGahee (23-66) had a couple of good runs, especially late when the team was trying to salt the game away, but Cincinnati did a good job overall of containing him.    As for the Bengals, Andy Dalton's stats were impressive; he went 26-of-42 for 299 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Dalton made several terrific throws, but could have been picked a couple more times, so he had a mixed outing.    Dalton's sole score went to A.J. Green, who had an impressive performance against Champ Bailey, catching seven balls for 99 yards. Jermaine Gresham (6-108) was the team's leading receiver.    BenJarvus Green-Ellis was his usual, mediocre self, gaining 56 yards on 17 attempts. He didn't have a single rush longer than six yards, but he was able to salvage his fantasy day with a goal-line touchdown. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
