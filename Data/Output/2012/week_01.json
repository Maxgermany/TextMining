      "comments": [" I tweeted this (), Just got a text from an Eagles' fan: 'We, the people, want Nick Foles.' I think he was speaking for many Philadelphians because QB Dog Killer was absolutely atrocious. He tossed four interceptions, all of which looked like they came from a rookie. One was thrown way late across his body. Another was forced into double coverage. The third was a weird, off-balanced, side-armed pass. The thing that hurts most is that QBDK had running room and may have picked up a first down on the ground. He would have scrambled prior to his contract, but it now appears as though he's mailing it in. QBDK finished 29-of-56 for 317 yards, two touchdowns and the aforementioned four interceptions; the final one being a pick-six that was tossed into double coverage. The second score won the game at the very end, but it almost didn't happen because Browns' rookie linebacker L.J. Fort dropped a possible interception on the prior play.    For those who want Foles to take over for the rapidly declining QBDK, I'd suggest that the Eagles wait until they fix the issues with their offensive line. QBDK didn't have any time to throw in this contest. Part of the problem was his inability to read blitzes, but the linemen were constantly overwhelmed by the Cleveland pass-rushers.    The offensive line affected LeSean McCoy as well. He rushed for 110 yards on 20 carries, but had numerous gains called back because of penalties. He did lose a fumble, however.    The only reason the Eagles won this game is because the Browns couldn't do anything on offense. Cleveland was outgained, 456-210. Of course, this was to be expected, given that they were the fourth team in the past 44 years to start a rookie quarterback and a rookie running back in the same backfield in the first game of the season. Brandon Weeden was absolutely awful. His stat line (12-of-35, 118 yards, four interceptions) is pretty indicative of how he performed. Actually, his numbers could have been a lot worse because the Eagles dropped three potential picks. Weeden, who played like he was drunker than Derek Anderson, simply doesn't look like an NFL quarterback. Perhaps he'll improve as he ages and matures.    As for the other rookie, Trent Richardson simply could not find any running room. He gained just 39 yards on 19 carries. He blew up Kurt Coleman on one run; the crash knocked Coleman's helmet right off. I'm sure you'll see that hit on <i>SportsCenter<\/i>.    Greg Little didn't catch a single pass. He was targeted five times, but two of the balls were picked off (one was Little's fault). Little can be dropped because Weeden appears to be complete garbage.    The Browns are a mess, but we knew that already. The bigger story in this game is how bad the Eagles looked. Their offensive line can't block, while their quarterback, who barely scrambles anymore, is just as inept against the blitz as ever. Philadelphia will be lucky to have a winning record this year. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
