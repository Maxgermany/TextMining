   "comments":" You have to feel for the Vikings. They fought so valiantly during their magical December run to reach the playoffs, but they lost all hope when their starting quarterback was ruled out of the first postseason game just hours prior to kickoff. Christian Ponder's elbow, which took a hit in Week 17, hadn't recovered as well as the coaching staff had hoped, so Leslie Frazier announced that he would be going with Joe Webb instead. Webb would become the first quarterback in NFL history to start a playoff game without attempting a single pass during the regular season. Webb looked decent early on. He led the Vikings down the field for 3 points, with a key play of his coming on a 17-yard scramble where he somehow eluded 5 Green Bay defenders positioned like this (thanks to e-mailer David L.):   ",

   "comments":" Red-zone offense. That's what this game came down to. This contest was evenly matched, with Baltimore edging out Indianapolis in yardage, 427-414. The Colts had more first downs (25-17) and won the time of possession by more than 16 minutes. But while Indianapolis moved the chains efficiently all afternoon, the offense completely bogged down once it advanced deep into Baltimore territory. Take a look at the following miscues: - Andrew Luck lost a fumble in the first quarter. - Luck took a bad sack in the second quarter, ruining a good-looking drive. - Luck had Reggie Wayne open for a potential touchdown, but missed him. - Donnie Avery dropped a catchable ball, and then Adam Vinatieri followed that up with a missed kick from 40 yards. - Dwayne Allen slipped on third down. Luck's next pass was tipped and picked on 4th-and-1. - Vick Ballard also had a drop.    I don't want to completely discredit Baltimore's defense for stiffening in the red zone, but this was mostly about the Colts showing inexperience and screwing up. Despite the 9 points allowed and Ray Lewis playing his final home game in his Hall-of-Fame career, the Ravens did not look good defensively, and they're going to be in deep trouble next week against Peyton Manning, who routinely torches them. But watching Lewis do his pre-game (and post-game) dance was great. Seeing him during live action? Not as great, as he inexplicably dropped a gimme interception. He did manage to lead the team with 13 tackles, however.    With the defense reeling, Joe Flacco made enough plays to lead the team to victory. He barely completed half of his passes (12-of-23) and got away with 2 dropped Vontae Davis interceptions early on, but he threw for 282 yards and 2 touchdowns, torching any Colt corner not named Davis. Flacco converted 8 passes of 18 yards or more, though his second-longest completion, a 47-yarder to Ray Rice, was all on the running back, who took a short screen down to the 2-yard line. Vonta Leach punched the ball into the end zone 1 play later to break a 3-3 tie in the second quarter.    Rice had a forgettable game otherwise. He was outgained by Bernard Pierce on the ground, 103-70. More importantly, he coughed up 2 fumbles in Indianapolis territory.    Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, was the star skill-position player for the Ravens. He caught 5 balls for 145 yards and a touchdown, with his only blemish being an offensive pass interference in the third quarter. Flacco's other score went to Dennis Pitta (2-27). As for Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.    Wayne naturally was Luck's top target, snagging 9 balls for 114 yards. TY Hilton also had a decent performance, catching 8 passes for 66 yards, though he dropped a key reception.    The Colts ran on the Ravens successfully, as most teams have this year. Vick Ballard tallied 91 yards on 22 carries.    The officiating was terrible in this contest. There were 4 blown calls in the first quarter alone. Mike Carey's crew whistled the Colts for a terrible pass interference, then incorrectly ruled who recovered the ball on Rice's first fumble. The ensuing drive saw 2 missed face mask penalties. Later on, Carey failed to blow a play dead when Baltimore had 12 men on the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

      "comment":"Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.    Wayne naturally was Luck's top target, snagging 9 balls for 114 yards. TY Hilton also had a decent performance, catching 8 passes for 66 yards, though he dropped a key reception.    The Colts ran on the Ravens successfully, as most teams have this year. Vick Ballard tallied 91 yards on 22 carries.    The officiating was terrible in this contest. There were 4 blown calls in the first quarter alone. Mike Carey's crew whistled the Colts for a terrible pass interference, then incorrectly ruled who recovered the ball on Rice's first fumble. The ensuing drive saw 2 missed face mask penalties. Later on, Carey failed to blow a play dead when Baltimore had 12 men on the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.

Luck's next pass was tipped and picked on 4th-and-1. - Vick Ballard also had a drop.    I don't want to completely discredit Baltimore's defense for stiffening in the red zone, but this was mostly about the Colts showing inexperience and screwing up. Despite the 9 points allowed and Ray Lewis playing his final home game in his Hall-of-Fame career, the Ravens did not look good defensively, and they're going to be in deep trouble next week against Peyton Manning, who routinely torches them. But watching Lewis do his pre-game (and post-game) dance was great. Seeing him during live action? Not as great, as he inexplicably dropped a gimme interception. He did manage to lead the team with 13 tackles, however.    With the defense reeling, Joe Flacco made enough plays to lead the team to victory. He barely completed half of his passes (12-of-23) and got away with 2 dropped Vontae Davis interceptions early on, but he threw for 282 yards and 2 touchdowns, torching any Colt corner not named Davis. Flacco converted 8 passes of 18 yards or more, though his second-longest completion, a 47-yarder to Ray Rice, was all on the running back, who took a short screen down to the 2-yard line. Vonta Leach punched the ball into the end zone 1 play later to break a 3-3 tie in the second quarter.    Rice had a forgettable game otherwise. He was outgained by Bernard Pierce on the ground, 103-70. More importantly, he coughed up 2 fumbles in Indianapolis territory.    Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, was the star skill-position player for the Ravens. He caught 5 balls for 145 yards and a touchdown, with his only blemish being an offensive pass interference in the third quarter. Flacco's other score went to Dennis Pitta (2-27). As for Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries. The problem for him, aside from the miscues I referenced earlier, was all of the pressure he had in his face throughout the afternoon. His offensive line didn't have much of a chance against Baltimore's front. Fixing his blocking will be paramount for the front office this upcoming offseason.

      "comment":"Vick Ballard also had a drop.    I don't want to completely discredit Baltimore's defense for stiffening in the red zone, but this was mostly about the Colts showing inexperience and screwing up. Despite the 9 points allowed and Ray Lewis playing his final home game in his Hall-of-Fame career, the Ravens did not look good defensively, and they're going to be in deep trouble next week against Peyton Manning, who routinely torches them. But watching Lewis do his pre-game (and post-game) dance was great. Seeing him during live action? Not as great, as he inexplicably dropped a gimme interception. He did manage to lead the team with 13 tackles, however.    With the defense reeling, Joe Flacco made enough plays to lead the team to victory. He barely completed half of his passes (12-of-23) and got away with 2 dropped Vontae Davis interceptions early on, but he threw for 282 yards and 2 touchdowns, torching any Colt corner not named Davis. Flacco converted 8 passes of 18 yards or more, though his second-longest completion, a 47-yarder to Ray Rice, was all on the running back, who took a short screen down to the 2-yard line. Vonta Leach punched the ball into the end zone 1 play later to break a 3-3 tie in the second quarter.    Rice had a forgettable game otherwise. He was outgained by Bernard Pierce on the ground, 103-70. More importantly, he coughed up 2 fumbles in Indianapolis territory.    Anquan Boldin, meanwhile, was the star skill-position player for the Ravens. He caught 5 balls for 145 yards and a touchdown, with his only blemish being an offensive pass interference in the third quarter. Flacco's other score went to Dennis Pitta (2-27). As for Torrey Smith, he didn't have a great statistical outing (2-31), but he was a key blocker on 2 of the Ravens' touchdowns.    Going back to the Colts, Luck went 28-of-54 for 288 yards and the aforementioned pick. He also scrambled 4 times for 35 additional yards. He was solid on third down, converting 9-of-20 tries.

   "comments":" Ah, what could have been. The Redskins jumped out to a 14-0 lead and were completely dominating this game. They looked like they were well on their way to winning this matchup by double digits, but Robert Griffin suffered an injury to his problematic right knee on the play prior to throwing his second touchdown of the evening. It didn't appear to be a big concern at the time because Washington was up by double digits, but it soon became apparent that the Redskins wouldn't be able to score the rest of the way. Griffin was completely immobilized following the injury. On 1 occasion, when he somehow gained 9 yards on the ground - 1 of only 2 scrambles of his following that second score - it looked like he was doing so on 1 leg. But you can just look at the statistics: Griffin before the knee injury: 6-of-9, 68 yards, 2 touchdowns Griffin after the knee injury: 4-of-10, 16 yards, 1 interception, 1 lost fumble It was disastrous. Griffin's condition worsened as the game progressed. He couldn't do anything, Because he couldn't plant his foot, his passes became incredibly inaccurate, and he was lucky to get away with not throwing several picks. He was also way too hesitant in the pocket. He eventually took a nasty hit in the 4.h quarter and then completely collapsed trying to scoop up a botched snap. He had to be helped off the field and was replaced by Kirk Cousins, who didn't look like he was prepared to play (3-of-10, 31 yards). Still though, Mike Shanahan should have went to Cousins earlier because Griffin couldn't move. Shanahan looked like a fool after the game. He said, We wouldn't have played Robert if we thought there was further risk to his LCL. Huh... that's interesting. You'd think that Griffin would have been at risk when, I don't know, he couldn't plant his foot or run around. But I'm not a head coach with a lifetime supply of spray tan.    Washington outgained the Seahawks in the first quarter, 129-9, but then were beaten in yardage the rest of the evening, 371-74. With Griffin no longer a running threat, the Seahawks could focus more on Alfred Morris. The rookie runner gained 49 yards in the 2 drives prior to Griffin's injury, but managed only 31 after that.    The Seahawks don't deserve as much credit as they're getting from the media because this could have easily been a Washington blowout, but they still should get some praise for taking advantage of the situation. The key play of the game was when they were driving, down 14-3 in the second quarter. Russell Wilson fumbled, but Marshawn Lynch scooped it up and ran for a long gain. Had it gone the other way, the Redskins would have been up 21-3. Instead, Lynch's awareness set up Seattle's first touchdown of the contest. Both Wilson and Lynch were awesome. The former went 15-of-26 for 187 yards and a touchdown (stats that could have been better if it weren't for some drops) as well as 67 rushing yards on 8 scrambles. Lynch, meanwhile, gained 132 yards and a score on 20 carries. His only blemish looked like a big 1 - he uncharacteristically fumbled at the 1-yard line, but made up for it with a 27-yard touchdown in the 4.h quarter.    Wilson's leading receiver was Zach Miller, who had 4 grabs for 48 yards. He had an amazing effort on his first reception. He caught a pass and willed his way past the first-down marker. Had he failed to reach it, the Seahawks would have punted down 14-0, and would have been in absolutely terrible shape had Griffin not re-injured his knee.    Two defenders of note: For the Redskins, Reed Doughty played the game of his life, registering 12 tackles and 2 sacks. As for Seattle's Chris Clemons, the dynamic pass-rusher hurt his knee, but the good news is that he walked off the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",
