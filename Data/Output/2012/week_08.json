      "comments": [" The Bears were favored by only 7.5 points in this game, which seemed like a no-brainer to some people. How could they not beat the struggling Panthers by more than one touchdown? Well, I was scared that the rib injury Cutler sustained Monday night could play a factor. Cutler was never in danger of missing this game - he was listed as probable - but I wrote that it was a strong possibility that he would struggle in this contest because he would be playing hurt. Well, Cutler did indeed struggle, and it was quite apparent that he wasn't 100 percent right away when he took an early, deep shot to Brandon Marshall. It wasn't a good decision to begin with because Marshall triple covered, but the ball was terribly underthrown. Having said that, Cutler's sore ribs weren't the only issue. Chicago's offensive line simply couldn't block Carolina's defensive front. Cutler was sacked thrice in the first quarter and six times overall. Greg Hardy had three of those sacks, while Charles Johnson collected two. Johnson also stripped Cutler twice. As a consequence, Cutler started the game just 4-of-9 for 40 yards and an interception... But something clicked in the second half. Perhaps Cutler felt better or maybe Mike Tice made the proper adjustments, but Cutler went 15-of-19 for 146 yards and a touchdown after that slow start, giving him solid final numbers (19-of-28, 186 yards, TD, INT). He was picked off on a two-point conversion attempt, but those can't be returned in the NFL for some strange reason.    Cutler's lone score went to Kellen Davis (1-12), while Brandon Marshall (9-98) was obviously targeted the most.    Matt Forte caught the second-most passes from Cutler, catching five balls for 24 yards. He also rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown on 15 attempts.    As for the Panthers, Cam Newton had a very mixed game. He did a great job of engineering scoring drives. He threw for 314 yards, completing 20-of-39 attempts in the process. He also tallied 37 rushing yards on five attempts. However, there was some bad Newton as well. He tossed two picks. One was a pick-six that was more Steve Smith's fault, but the other was a stupid decision where he heaved the ball as he was in the grasp of a defender. He also struggled in the red zone again and fumbled near the goal line. He was very fortunate that receiver Louis Murphy scooped the ball up in the end zone. Newton then jogged off the field, prompting the FOX announcers to chide him for doing so instead of running to Murphy and thanking him.    Newton's top target was Smith, who hauled in seven passes for 118 yards. He still hasn't scored a touchdown, but he had a chance. He blew his opportunity by dropping a ball in the end zone.    The Panthers told the media that they would try to have Jonathan Stewart run out of more normal formations, and they did just that. They weren't successful, however, as Stewart managed just 42 yards on 17 carries. Having said that, Carolina battled a tough Chicago defense, so maybe Stewart will have more luck next week at Washington. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
