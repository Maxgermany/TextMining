      "comments": [" The ESPN analysts on <i>Sunday NFL Countdown<\/i> were discussing the Chuck Pagano leukemia-related absence prior to this game. They pointed out that teams usually perform well when players suffer some sort of tragedy (like Brett Favre, Torrey Smith, etc.), but the same doesn't apply to head coaches because they're just too important in terms of game planning and making adjustments. I actually agreed with that, picking the Packers to cover for two units. Well, everyone was wrong. Sort of, but I'll get to that later. The Colts won for their head coach. Reggie Wayne, the only person to visit the quarantined Pagano, had the game of his life, catching 13 balls for 212 yards and a touchdown. Wayne, who has known Pagano the longest - Pagano recruited him to Miami - made sure his team won for his coach, telling Pagano that he would be back next week with the game ball. Wayne made several incredible plays, including an amazing, one-handed divinggrab.    Andrew Luck went 31-of-55 for 362 yards, three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) and an interception. He was amazing in the fourth quarter, especially given that he was really roughed up early on. The Packers swarmed the backfield and constantly hit him fiercely in the first half - at least prior to B.J. Raji's ankle injury. As a result, Luck struggled in the beginning of the game, nearly tossing numerous picks. There was good fortune on his side, however, and things opened up for him in the second half. Green Bay's secondary had no chance.    The Colts were also very lucky on the other side of the ball. In addition to Raji leaving the game, the Packers lost Cedric Benson and Jermichael Finley to leg and shoulder maladies, respectively. That's why Green Bay scored just six second-half points after tallying 21 in the first half. The Packers led 21-3 at the break, and you have to wonder if they would've held on to that advantage if they didn't lose three key players to injuries.    Aaron Rodgers went 21-of-33 for 243 yards, three touchdowns and an interception (with 57 rushing yards). It was mediocre early - he overthrew an open Jordy Nelson for a deep touchdown - and it was ugly late, as Rodgers clearly missed both Benson and Finley. The offensive line was also an issue; the Colts constantly swarmed the backfield and managed to bring down Rodgers five times. Dwight Freeney, who had a sack, made a huge impact in his return to the lineup.    Two of Rodgers' scores went to James Jones (4-46). The other was thrown to Randall Cobb (4-82). Jordy Nelson did nothing (2-29), but should have caught that aforementioned deep pass.    Meanwhile, Luck's aerial second touchdown went to Dwayne Allen (4-38). Luck nearly had a third to Donnie Avery (3-22) but just missed him.    The Colts ran the ball well because Raji was out for half the game. Donald Brown gained 84 yards on just 17 attempts. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
