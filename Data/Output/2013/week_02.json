      "comments": [" If you weren't able to watch this game because you don't have NFL Network, consider yourself very fortunate. This was one of the most excruciating three-and-a-half hours of football I've ever seen. It's not just that both offenses performed poorly in a low-scoring affair; it's that they weren't even functional. Both teams, especially the Patriots, couldn't do basic things. Catching the football should not be that difficult, yet all of the New England wideouts, save for Julian Edelman, dropped passes all evening. Kenbrell Thompkins (2-47) was bad - he ran a wrong route in the end zone during the second quarter and then dropped a touchdown just prior to halftime - but Aaron Dobson looked like the worst receiver in NFL history. I'm not exaggerating at all. Dobson caught three balls for 56 yards and a touchdown, but that's a very deceiving stat line. He dropped at least five passes. There was one occasion in which he wasn't even looking back for the football. He glanced at Tom Brady at the very last second, which caused a key drop. Dobson continuously screwed up, but Brady inexplicably kept going back to him. I didn't understand the logic behind that. Stevan Ridley was benched for one fumble last week, so why wasn't Dobson taken out of the game after his third, fourth or fifth drop? With Dobson and Thompkins playing so poorly, Brady seemed so out of sync. He spent the entire first half yelling at his teammates, but he just seemed defeated after intermission. He failed to complete 50 percent of his passes for the first time in a game since Week 15, 2009, going 19-of-39 for 185 yards and a touchdown. The score came on the first drive of the contest - an 81-yard possession. The Patriots mustered just 151 yards the rest of the way, compared to 318 for the Jets. They were just 4-of-18 on third down and managed just moved the chains nine times in this entire contest. The Patriots will be better eventually, but they'll need Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola back. And who knows when they'll be available? In the meantime, all Brady will have to work with is Edelman (13-78), who was the lone bright spot for New England's offense - and even he wasn't flawless; he appeared to lose a fumble, but the call was reversed. I'm not sure what Bill Belichick can do in the short term. I joked on Twitter (): #Patriots should play Alfonzo Dennard at receiver. Better than Dobson. Well, it wasn't really a joke. It's kind of the truth. The most telling moment for New England came just prior to halftime. The team was on the New York 25-yard line. The Patriots were faced a third down with 11 seconds and one timeout remaining. Instead of taking a shot at the end zone, as Brady normally would, he ran to the middle of the field and took a knee to give his kicker an easier field goal. Stephen Gostkowski whiffed in karmic fashion.    I brought up the Dennard tweet earlier because he caught a key interception from Geno Smith in the red zone. Aqib Talib, meanwhile, picked him off twice. Smith did some nice things in this contest, but there was more bad than good. He finished 15-of-35 for 214 yards and the three picks. He also had a 16-yard scramble. Smith endured many of the same issues Tom Brady faced. His receivers just let him down. Stephen Hill lost a fumble and dropped a pass. Clyde Gates, who was on the field because Jeremy Kerley was out, couldn't control a second-quarter touchdown. He let the ball fall through his hands on a couple of other occasions. Still though, at least the Patriots didn't turn the ball over. Smith committed the three interceptions - two of which were terrible - and also missed some open receivers. He still has a long way to go.    As with Edelman and the Patriots, there was one positive in the Jets' receiving corps. Santonio Holmes actually looked like a functional receiver. He caught three balls for 51 yards. He's not nearly the same player he once was - he's not playing on all of the snaps - but he's at least turning into a dependable, veteran wideout for Smith.    The Jets actually ran the ball well and probably should've stuck with the ground game throughout the contest. Chris Ivory looked quick, gaining 52 yards on 12 carries. Bilal Powell (13-48, TD) also showed well. Meanwhile, Rildey gained just 40 yards on 16 attempts. I guess the silver lining is that he didn't fumble.    Two New York linemen were ejected at the end of this contest. D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Willie Colon were tossed for throwing punches after Talib's game-sealing interception. Losing them would be devastating for the Jets' chances next week, should they be suspended. New York plays the Bills, so Ferguson's potential replacement would be responsible for blocking Mario Williams.   "],
