      "comments": [" The Broncos look scary good. Good as in teams have to be watching them and thinking, how the hell are we going to stop this offense? scary good. All Peyton Manning did in the season opener was throw for seven touchdowns - the first quarterback to do so since 1969. Manning was 27-of-42 for 462 yards and the seven scores. He started a bit slowly - he blamed it on the 50-minute delay in a post-game interview - but he eventually was absolutely lethal with his plethora of weapons. Manning definitely made sure to showcase his new toys. Tom Brady had to be watching with envy as Wes Welker hauled in nine grabs for 67 yards and two touchdowns. Welker dropped a pass and muffed a punt to give Baltimore an easy score, but the positives outweighed those two negatives. Meanwhile, super-athletic Julius Thomas snagged five balls for 110 yards and a pair of end-zone trips of his own. Thomas was my No. 9 , so I was definitely not surprised to see him go off like this. He has all the potential in the world, and to top it off, he blocked pretty well in this contest. Make Thomas a priority pick-up if he's available in your league.    As for Manning's other targets, Demaryius Thomas had a pretty nice line (5-161-2), but most of that came late. Stud corner Lardarius Webb was on him in the first half, but the Ravens finally decided to put Webb on Welker. Eric Decker, meanwhile, had a rough outing (2-32). He had several drops, including one potential touchdown. He also was guilty of a fumble and an offensive pass interference. Fantasy owners of his should be a bit concerned, but shouldn't panic quite yet.    Speaking of fantasy, Montee Ball... the guy is a Big Ten plodder who can't pass protect. He's not going to be on the field very much unless the Broncos are blowing teams out. I'm not sure if he's worth a roster spot unless you're in a deep league. I'd still keep him around, but it seems as though Knowshon Moreno (9-28; 3-37) will get the majority of the touches.    As for the Ravens, they really had a shot to win this game. That may sound silly if you're just looking at the box score, but they were up 17-14 (would've been 21-14 had Dallas Clark not dropped a touchdown) and could have challenged an obvious incompletion to retain possession in the middle of the third quarter. John Harbaugh opted not to throw the red flag, to the chagrin of both announcers, which led to a Denver touchdown on the same drive. Following a blocked punt, the Broncos suddenly were up 35-17 and never looked back. One other thing that hurt Baltimore was the loss of right tackle Michael Oher. The Ravens had to replace Mr. Blind Side with a fifth-round rookie named Ricky Wagner, who predictably struggled. The edge Baltimore had in pass protection with Von Miller out was suddenly lost. Oher's absence played a huge role in Denver's victory. Shaun Phillips (2.5 sacks, forced fumble) went nuts.    The Ravens also killed themselves with drops. The Broncos had their fair share, as mentioned, but it seemed like every drive of Baltimore's featured a drop by one of the two tight ends. Dallas Clark and Ed Dickson were just awful. Clark caught seven balls for 87 yards, but he looked super slow and inept. His aforementioned dropped touchdown was huge. Dickson (1-13) was just as bad. Joe Flacco still managed to go 34-of-62 for 362 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions, including one that should've been a pick-six. However, the defender, Danny Trevathan, pulled a DeSean Jackson and dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line. Adding injury to insult, stud linebacker Wesley Woodyard was injured on the play, but he would be fine. Flacco's initial pick helped set up Manning's first touchdown of the night.    Torrey Smith didn't have the huge outing he enjoyed during the playoff victory, but he did catch four balls for 92 yards, including an impressive one-handed grab where the defender grabbed hold of his arm. Marlon Brown, an undrafted rookie out of Georga, caught four passes for 65 yards and a score. He was on the field because Jacoby Jones was injured during a special-teams incident in the first half. Jones' absence was also big because Flacco had to rely more on Clark, Dickson and Brandon Stokley.    Ray Rice and Bernard Pierce split carries almost evenly (12-36, TD; 9-22), but Rice acted like the PPR stud that he is, catching eight balls for 35 yards.    One last thing I'd like to emphaize - and I said this in my - is that the Broncos are not 22 points better than Baltimore. If the two teams played this game 100 times, most of the results wouldn't be double-digit blowouts. A series of unfortunate events did the Ravens in, so they looked much worse than they really are. As a consequence, they could be a good bet on team going forward.   "],
