      "comments": [" The Giants are now 0-6. Let that sink in for a second. The Giants are 0-6. What happened to this team? They won the Super Bowl two years ago and just barely missed the playoffs last season. New York inexplicably got depleted of talent so quickly, particularly in the back seven and the offensive line. Thanks to the latter unit allowing so much pressure, Eli Manning had thrown 12 interceptions heading into this contest. Manning didn't have much of a pass rush to deal with in this game, but it almost seemed like he was expecting to get hit early on. As a result, he fired his 13th pick of the year right away, though the Bears didn't score any points despite taking over in the red zone (Marc Trestman foolishly opted to go for it on fourth-and-2, and Brandon Marshall proceeded to drop the ball). Manning's 14th interception, which was returned for six, came on the very next drive. While the first of the game was his fault, the second was the result of a miscommunication between Manning and his receiver. The 15th pick, which occurred on New York's final offensive drive of the evening, was a slight overthrow. Manning is now on pace to heave 40 interceptions this year. The single-season record is held by George Blanda, who tossed the ball to the other team 42 times for the Houston Oilers in 1962. Aside from the three give-aways, Manning looked very sharp. That sounds silly considering the amount of turnovers, but as an example, Manning went 8-of-9 for 132 yards and a touchdown for the duration of the opening half following the second pick. Manning's final numbers were 14-of-26 for 239 yards, one score and the three interceptions.    The silver lining in the Giants' loss is that the team was finally able to establish a solid ground attack. Brandon Jacobs was partying like it was 2007, as the big back registered 106 yards and two touchdowns on 22 attempts. Jacobs did this against a depleted defensive line that was missing Stephen Paea in addition to Henry Melton, but the big back broke lots of tackles and carried defenders around.    Hakeem Nicks (4-70) and Victor Cruz (4-68) tied for the team lead in receptions, but they both were guilty of crucial drops. Rueben Randle (3-75) had the lone aerial touchdown, but got away with what would've almost certainly been the biggest bone-headed move of the week. Randle went down untouched in the red zone. He slammed the ball down on the ground in frustration, which was really should've been ruled a fumble because Chicago alertly pounced on it. Trestman tried to challenge, but official John Parry incorrectly ruled that Randle gave himself up, which was very shady on his part. Randle absolutely did not give himself up.    As for the Bears, Jay Cutler had a terrific performance. He went 24-of-36 for 262 yards and two touchdowns. His receivers were constantly open, while he didn't have to deal with any pressure. Cutler didn't take a single sack; he was able to sit back in the pocket and dissect New York's secondary with ease on most plays. Cutler also scrambled thrice for 20 more yards. This is noteworthy because Giants' safety Will Hill, who was responsible for one of Marshall's scores, was penalized for tapping Cutler's helmet as the quarterback was sliding. Hill literally tapped his helmet - Mike Mayock quipped that it would barely be a legal stop in two-hand touch - yet Parry threw a flag for a personal foul. As I wrote on the forum, Football is no longer football if that's a penalty.    Both of Cutler's scores went to Brandon Marshall (9-87), who wore green shoes to promote mental-health awareness. This is against the league dress code, so Marshall will be fined for this. Marshall, in turn, said that he'll match the league fine with a donation. This is a cool move by Marshall, and it would be in Roger Goodell's best interest to eschew penalizing Marshall - especially during a month in which all players are encouraged (forced?) to wear pink. It's a bit hypocritical on Goodell's part if he allows the fine to stand.    Cutler's other targets didn't post big numbers. Matt Forte was just OK from a standard fantasy perspective, accumulating 67 rushing yards on 19 carries and 44 receiving yards off six receptions. Martellus Bennett, who was a game-time decision, caught six balls for 68 yards. Alshon Jeffery - or Alshon Jefferies, as Michael Irvin likes to call him - had just one reception for 27 yards.   "],
