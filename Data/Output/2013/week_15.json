      "comments": [" Remember when the Broncos looked so dominant at the beginning of the season? There was talk of 16-0 and the potential that the offense could break all sorts of records. They were extremely hot for a while, but they've suddenly lost grasp of homefield advantage in the AFC. In fact, with this loss, the Patriots are now in control of their own destiny for the No. 1 seed. Denver has issues on both sides of the ball. Beginning with the offense, Peyton Manning seemed to prove that he could win in cold weather when he was victorious last week, but a win over a horrible Tennessee team playing its third-consecutive road game in altitude was hardly impressive. The temperature was near-freezing in this contest, and yet Manning was much worse. His final numbers don't look bad - I'll get to those in a bit - but he was just 11-of-19 for only 137 yards with a couple of minutes remaining in the third quarter. Those are his true stats; everything he did after that could be considered garbage time, as San Diego suddenly went into a prevent. It must be noted that Manning didn't have Wes Welker at his disposal, but that's no excuse. He was still able to throw to Demaryius Thomas, Julius Thomas, Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, and that should be enough against a San Diego defense that has struggled for most of the season (though it has performed better the past three weeks). Manning spent an absurd amount of time targeting Andre Caldwell, which turned out to be a huge mistake. Caldwell caught both of Manning's touchdowns and led the team in receiving (6-59), but he made numerous unforced errors. Caldwell dropped a pass and didn't read a back-shoulder opportunity correctly. He also was targeted on a near-interception because he couldn't separate from the corner who was covering him. It was perplexing to see Manning utilize Caldwell so frequently, but Manning does tend to do dumb crap in these inexplicable December and January losses in the cold. It's like his brain freezes up, or something. And I don't even know why Caldwell was on the fied to begin with. Jacob Tamme did fine in the slot when Welker went down last week, so why not just use him?    Thanks to junk time, Manning was able to save his fantasy owners by finishing 27-of-41 for 289 yards, two touchdowns and an interception that occurred because he was hit as he released the football. His scores were the 46th and 47th of his season, putting him four away from breaking Tom Brady's single-season record.    The Broncos were hurt by a lacking ground attack, which has to be highly discouraging for them because they've attempted to establish one to counter this type of cold weather. Moreno had just 19 yards on eight carries, while Montee Ball lost a yard on three tries.    As mentioned, Caldwell was the one who found the end zone on both occasions, leaving Demaryius Thomas (4-45), Julius Thomas (4-49) and Decker (2-42) with meager numbers.    Denver's defense, meanwhile, couldn't do anything right. This includes... - Stopping the run. Ryan Mathews trampled his opponent, gaining 127 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. The Broncos couldn't bring him down when San Diego was bleeding the clock. The Chargers, as a result, were keeping the ball away from Manning. - Containing Philip Rivers. San Diego's fiery quarterback didn't post great stats (12-of-20, 166 yards, two touchdowns), but he made some incredible, clutch throws to keep the chains moving. Both of his scores went to Keenan Allen (2-29). - Refraining from committing dumb penalties. The Broncos were so undisciplined that John Fox needs to be embarrassed right now. A couple of senseless infractions kept drives alive for the Chargers throughout the entire contest. The most egregious call was a neutral zone penalty on a punt that gave San Diego a free first down.   "],
