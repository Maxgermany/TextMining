      "comments": [" The Lions have a knack for shooting themselves in the foot and ruining potential victories. They blew two games versus Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay heading into this important matchup. They figured to be more focused against a divisional opponent, but the same blunders persisted. Consider all of these early mistakes that made it seem like they would lose their 10th-consecutive Thanksgiving game: - Detroit's first red-zone trip came at the end of a great opening drive. However, Reggie Bush fumbled there, thanks to a Clay Matthews strip. Bush vowed not to fumble again after coughing up the ball at Pittsburgh. So much for that. - The second try in the red zone also failed, though the Lions at least got a field goal out of it. Brandon Pettigrew committed a false start on second down and then proceeded to drop a touchdown. Pettigrew, who shouldn't have been playing in the first place, finished with one catch for six yards. - Sam Martin booted the ball out of bounds on a kickoff, setting up a Mason Crosby 54-yard field goal after James Jones made a brilliant 16-yard reception. - Matthew Stafford was strip-sixed when Nick Perry beat Riley Reiff. - Stafford was picked off by Tramon Williams in Green Bay territory. As Stafford and company walked off the field, the crowd booed furiously. At that point in the game, the Packers were up 10-3 despite not doing anything on offense. Had they maintained any sort of competent scoring attack, they probably would've beaten the mistake-prone Lions. But Matt Flynn was the quarterback, so Green Bay ultimately had no chance. This game was so lopsided that by the time Detroit made this a 40-10 affair, it had outgained the Packers, 563-56. That's just mind-boggling. As a reference, no team since 1989 (as far back as my data goes) has outgained its opponent by 507 yards or more. Green Bay secured some garbage yardage to keep itself from setting a dubious historical mark.    After some early mistakes, Stafford was pretty sharp. He went 22-of-35 for 330 yards, three touchdowns, two picks and the lost fumble. His completion percentage should have been even better; he endured a handful of drops from his receivers, two of which were Calvin Johnson's fault.    Speaking of Megatron, he caught six balls for 101 yards and one of Stafford's three scores. The others were secured by Kevin Ogletree and Jeremy Ross.    Both Detroit running backs found the end zone as well. Bush atoned for the lost fumble, compiling 117 rushing yards and a touchdown on 20 carries to go along with five catches for 65 receiving yards. Joique Bell, meanwhile, gained 94 yards and a score on the ground on 19 attempts.    The Lions made some mistakes after their initial blunders. Stafford tossed that second pick - an end-zone shot in which Sam Shields covered Megatron extremely well - while Martin placed a second kickoff out of bounds. David Akers also inexplicably whiffed on a 31-yard field goal at the end of the first half. Again, these errors didn't matter because Green Bay's offense couldn't do anything. Flynn was awful. He went 10-of-20 for 139 yards and an interception, but that doesn't tell the whole story. He had another pick dropped and lost two fumbles. He also took a safety in the third quarter. I must note that Flynn had no chance. Detroit's monstrous defensive front dominated Green Bay's offensive line. Flynn was sacked seven times through three quarters, including the safety by Ndamukong Suh, who had a very strong outing. Ezekiel Ansah was also great, mustering two sacks in the first half. It didn't help that center Evan Dietrich-Smith left the game in the second quarter, but Green Bay couldn't block the Lions even when he was in the lineup. The Packers couldn't get anything going on the ground either. Eddie Lacy had zero running lanes, as he was able to generate just 16 yards on 10 carries. He also had just two catches for 23 receiving yards. He dropped a screen pass, though the game was out of hand at that point.    James Jones led the Packers in receiving with three catches for 79 yards, though his long gain (56 yards) came at the very end in garbage time. Jordy Nelson (2-14) disappointed his fantasy owners. He had a long gain that was nullified by offsetting penalties.   "],
