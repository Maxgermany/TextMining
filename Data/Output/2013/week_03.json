      "comments": [" Philadelphia fans packed Lincoln Financial Field to cheer Andy Reid in his return to Philadelphia and Donovan McNabb during his jersey retirement. Both Reid and McNabb received standing ovations, but that's all the celebrating the Eagles' faithful would do throughout the evening. The early cheers turned into loud boos, as Philadelphia struggled in all areas: - The Eagles' supposed up-tempo offense was pretty sluggish against the Chiefs. They committed five turnovers, including a pick-six in the first quarter that the quarterback telegraphed. QBDK would end up going 13-of-30 for 201 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions (the second was thrown behind Riley Cooper). He showed flashes of brilliance; he had a 61-yard scramble in the first quarter, lofted a 22-yard rainbow to Jason Avant into the end zone as he was getting hit, and hit DeSean Jackson (3-62) with a 40-yard bomb downfield. However, QBDK was pretty pedestrian overall. Many of his passes were way behind his receivers. He used poor mechanics on his attempts and was occasionally guilty of throwing late over the middle. Worst of all, he was banged up at the end. He didn't look like he could move very well in the fourth quarter. The final hit, which resulted in a strip-sack, had him limping off the field. Nick Foles was seen warming up, but the Chiefs took possession and killed the clock. It's a shame for LeSean McCoy that his teammates ruined another outstanding performance. McCoy rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. There was a scary moment in the second quarter when McCoy fell and clutched his knee, screaming in pain. It seemed like his season would be over, but McCoy somehow returned to the field after halftime. - Philadelphia's defense was awful once again. I can't even count how many missed tackles the team was guilty of in this contest. The Chiefs converted multiple third-and-15ish situations with short passes to Donnie Avery. In fact, Kansas City ran the same place twice, yet Billy Davis' unit wasn't prepared for it. That's inexcusable. The Chiefs would've scored way more than 26 points had they not made errors themselves. They bogged down in the red zone and dropped four passes in the first quarter alone. The offensive line was also guilty of several illegal formations. I'm not sure why the Chiefs continuously had issues lining up, but their inability to do so disrupted some of their drives. I don't want to take anything away from Alex Smith though. He once again seldom looked downfield, but he didn't really need to. He went 22-of-35 for 273 yards. He was clutch on a long drive in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs had the ball on their own 5-yard line with 10 minutes remaining, but he took them into field goal range while bleeding seven minutes off the clock. Smith spent the entire night dumping the ball off to Avery and Jamaal Charles. Both were awesome; the former caught seven passes for 141 yards. Charles, meanwhile, rushed for 92 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries and matched Avery's seven catches for 80 receiving yards. Smith didn't go to Dwayne Bowe as much. Bowe caught only one pass for four yards. He was guilty of two drops. - The Eagles also struggled on special teams. They surrendered a 57-yard kickoff return to Quintin Demps to open the game. Damaris Johnson then muffed a punt, setting up a Kansas City field goal.    Two defenders of note for Kansas City: Justin Houston will get all of the headlines with 4.5 sacks and a forced fumble (QBDK was sacked six times overall), but second-year nose tackle Dontari Poe was equally dominant. He crahsed into Philadelphia's backfield on so many instances and made life difficult for QBDK. Poe is making a strong bid to be a Pro Bowler this year.   "],
