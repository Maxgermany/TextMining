      "comments": [" It figures that a game taking place on Halloween would feature horrifying mistakes, a quarterback costume change and the third walk-off safety in NFL overtime history. Both teams tried their hardest to blow this game. Andy Dalton, in particular, was pretty brutal despite being named the AFC October NFL Player of the Month. In fact, Marshall Faulk said after the game, In the spirit of Halloween, that was Matt Schaub dressed up as Andy Dalton. Dalton's completion percentage and yardage - 32-of-53 for 338 yards - don't look too bad, but he missed too many open receivers in this contest. He converted quality throws, including some clutch passes on third down, but his turnovers were costly. He opened with a lost fumble on a strip-sack deep in his own territory. He then went on to throw three interceptions. The second one occurred in the red zone; it was behind his intended receiver on an out, which Brent Grimes took 94 yards back for a score. Only one of the picks wasn't Dalton's fault - the third one was a drop by Mohamed Sanu that popped into the arms of a Miami defender. Sanu was dreadful - more on that later - but Dalton took a sack on what was the decisive safety when Cameron Wake (3 sacks) beat struggling guard Kevin Zeitler. Despite the loss, the Bengals are still in good shape, record-wise. They fell behind the Patriots and Colts, and are now the No. 4 seed in the AFC, but they still maintain a big lead in the division. Unfortunately, this game was quite costly in that Geno Atkins tore his ACL. Atkins is one of the top defensive players in the NFL, and he will sorely be missed going forward.    A.J. Green and Giovani Bernard carried Cincinnati's offense. Green caught 11 passes for 128 yards despite going up against Grimes. His only mistake was dropping a pass on third down that would've moved the chains. Bernard, meanwhile, rushed for 79 yards and two touchdowns on just nine carries to go along with four catches for 25 receiving yards. One of Bernard's scores, a 35-yarder, was unbelievable. If you didn't catch it on <i>SportsCenter<\/i>, make sure you do; Bernard broke out of three tackles, including one sure one by Grimes, and then reversed field. He then sprinted forward and juked several more Dolphins - including Grimes again - and somersaulted into the end zone. It was absolutely breathtaking. But staying with Bernard, I have an issue with how Cincinnati used him. It's inexcusable that Bernard received nine carries when BenJarvus Green-Ellis was given 21 attempts (72 yards). Green-Ellis should be getting a third of the rushes; not the other way around. I'm not sure why Cincinnati feels the need to use lesser talents over players who are much more skilled. This is also the case with Sanu and Marvin Jones. Sanu stinks. He caught six balls for 62 yards, but had multiple drops, including one that resulted in a touchdown. Jones is much more explosive. He caught four balls for 66 yards, but had a 50-yard touchdown wiped out by a stupid hold by Jermaine Gresham. It's funny because the Dolphins have the same issue. Lamar Miller (16-105) was far more effective than Daniel Thomas (12-38) - though he did fumble after a 41-yard inside the Cincinnati 10-yard line - yet the latter eats into way too many of Miller's carries. Thomas was stuffed on two third-and-short situations in this contest. It's puzzling why Miami insists on using him there. Sure, he's heavier, but Miller is a much better runner. He would unquestionably have more luck in terms of moving the chains.    It looked like it was going to be a long night for Ryan Tannehill early on when he was sacked on the first drive. Tannehill entered the game leading the NFL in sacks taken, but he was brought down only three times. It almost certainly would've been a higher total had Atkins not been knocked out in the second quarter, but the offensive line looked better as a whole despite the strange absence of Jonathan Martin. As a result of improved pass protection, Tannehill let the ball hit the ground only eight times. He finished 20-of-28 for 208 yards. Most importantly, he didn't turn the ball over.    Tannehill's top target was Mike Wallace (6-82), who drew a 38-yard pass interference on Terence Newman in overtime. Brian Hartline (3-39), meanwhile, was involved in three very sketchy calls. The first was offensive pass interference in which he barely touched the cornerback. The second was a non-defensive pass interference in which Hartline was mugged. As this happened, I posted the following in the live in-game thread: Haha holy ****, and that Hartline offensive pass interference warranted a flag? The third set up Miami in field-goal range for the game-tying kick at the end of regulation. Hartline made a great, 21-yard diving catch along the sideline, but replay seemed to show that his second foot never landed inbounds. The play was never reviewed.    I mentioned that both teams tried to blow this game. Miami's mistakes were Miller's lost fumble and an errant chip-shot, 34-yard field goal by kicker Caleb Sturgis. The Dolphins also blew another 14-point lead because the defenders struggled to tackle in the second half, but that could've been the result of being on the field for about 13 consecutive minutes of game action.    Brad Nessler with his weekly gaffe: In the past, Greg Little was Mr. Dependable, and Jay Feely transformed into Jim Feely. This week, Koa Misi suddenly became Koa Misa. The NFL Network spent some time showing pictures of kids in Halloween costumes in between action. I thought this was a horrible decision. A better choice would've been displaying pictures of slutty chicks in their Halloween outfits.   "],
