      "comments": [" The Cardinals have a habit of upsetting teams at home. Detroit and Carolina confidently marched into Arizona this season as favorites, yet they both came away with losses. The Seahawks, however, proved that they're just way too good to fall into a trap like this. They dominated this contest, and the final score isn't indicative of how much of a blowout this really was. By the time the score was 34-16, Seattle had Arizona outgained, 336-119. The scary thing is that the Seahawks will only get better once Russell Okung and Percy Harvin back from injury. The offensive line is a concern right now - the team allowed three sacks, two of which came from John Abraham - but Russell Wilson continued to get out of trouble and elude tacklers with his elite mobility. Wilson scrambled eight times for 29 rushing yards to go along with his great passing numbers, 18-of-29 for 235 yards and three touchdowns. Wilson's only issue in this contest was failing to han on to the football. He fumbled thrice, losing possession on two occasions. This will all be fixed with upgraded pass protection. Okung will make a huge difference.    Wilson's three touchdowns went to different players, which is not a surprise because he always spreads the ball around. Sidney Rice (3-50), Zach Miller (5-40) and Kellen Davis all found the end zone. Rice's touchdown was the best of them all, as Wilson found him downfield for a 31-yarder on a broken play in which he was scrambling out of the pocket toward the right sideline. Golden Tate didn't score, but he managed to snag four catches for 77 yards, which was impressive considering he had to battle Patrick Peterson. It's worth noting though that Peterson injured his fingers on a special-teams play. Peterson was removed from punt returns after that, but stayed in the game on defense.    The Seahawks had great success running the ball, as Marshawn Lynch was in full Beast Mode, blasting through big holes and shedding tackles with ease. Lynch gained 91 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Lynch appeared to score on a second occasion on a run in which he actually pulled off Darnell Dockett's helmet, but the officials ruled that he was on the ground just prior to crossing the goal line.    The Cardinals, meanwhile, didn't have nearly as much success on the ground. Rashard Mendenhall, proving that he's the worst starting running back in the NFL, mustered only 22 yards on 13 carries. He rewarded anyone who started him in fantasy with a 3-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Mendenhall is trash, and I have no idea why Arizona is wasting its time with him. Every time he touches the ball, it's a waste. Granted, he didn't have good running lanes, but there were a few instances in this contest that he had some room, and a superior running back would've picked up much more yardage. The weird thing is that the Cardinals actually do have a better back. His name is Andre Ellington, but the coaching staff apparently forgot that he was on the roster. Ellington touched the ball five times the entire evening (3 carries, 3 yards; 2 catches, 10 rec. yards), which is just mind-boggling. Aside from Larry Fitzgerald, who is struggling with a hamstring problem right now, Ellington is the most explosive play-maker on offense. It's such terrible coaching that he didn't have at least 15 touches; let alone six. I can't believe how dumb Arizona's game plan was.    Something else that was completely idiotic was asking Carson Palmer to repeatedly take seven-step drops throughout the entire evening. Palmer doesn't have the appropriate protection to do so, and Seattle's pass rush is just too good. It seemed like Palmer was sacked every single time he dropped back in the pocket. The Seahawks got to him seven times. Palmer went 30-of-45 for 258 yards and one touchdown, which isn't bad, but he threw his trademark two interceptions. The first was on an underthrow to Fitzgerald that was tipped. The second, which came as Palmer was hit, was nearly returned for a score by Brandon Browner, who inexplicably fell down at the 1-yard line. Lynch punched it in one play later. Palmer simply can't function behind this offensive line. For the Cardinals to improve in terms of being offensively consistent, they need to keep Palmer in shotgun on most plays, and they need to involve Ellington as much as possible. I don't care how small he is; Ellington must touch the ball 20 times. Perhaps a better game plan will keep Palmer more interested. He looked like he quit at the end, simply throwing away a pass on fourth down because he was under pressure. He also fumbled earlier because he held the ball carelessly, but the ball trickled out of bounds.    Michael Floyd led the Cardinals with six catches for 71 yards. Fitzgerald struggled with his injury (2-17), but he had two excellent blocks, one of which knocked Richard Sherman off his cleats.    One final note on the game itself: The Cardinals were playing at home, but so many Seattle fans flooded the stadium. The NFL Network crew remarked afterward that they had never seen so many visiting fans in one stadium.    Two Brad Nessler gaffes: Nessler, who called Greg Little Mr. Dependable and then screwed up the name of a woman who died of breast cancer two weeks ago, called Rashad Johnson Rashard Johnson. That one wasn't as bad as referring to Jay Feely as Jim Feely. It's clear by now that Nessler mails in these Thursday night games. You could almost say that Palmer puts forth a better effort.   "],
