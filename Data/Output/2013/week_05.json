      "comments": [" The Cleveland sports scene has endured many hardships over the years. The Indians lost in the fake baseball playoffs on Wednesday, but this was the Browns' night. This was their chance to take the AFC North lead with a 3-2 record, thanks to a new, promising quarterback. But because the Browns are the Browns and Cleveland is Cleveland, Brian Hoyer (2-of-4, 25 yards) suffered what appeared to be a torn ACL on an awkward slide during the second drive of the game. Adding insult to injury, the tackling player, Kiko Alonso, wasn't even whistled for a blatant helmet-to-helmet hit. It's as if the sports gods looked down and said, Cleveland, you must suffer, so we're taking all hope away from you again. Brandon Weeden entered the game to a chorus of boos. The jeers grew louder with each ugly incompletion. Weeden, who holds the ball way too long, took some unnecessary sacks as well. Weeden started poorly, but got more and more comfortable as the game progressed. He did well to convert multiple third downs in the second quarter to lead his team down the field for a touchdown. Weeden was even better in the second half, going 7-of-12 for 129 yards and a score after the break. He had some throws that made me go yeeesh, but he impressed me at times. His main highlight was a beautiful 37-yard rainbow to Josh Gordon for a touchdown. Weeden finished 13-of-24 for 197 yards and that score. Of course, the Browns wouldn't have won this game without Travis Benjamin. He had a 57-yard punt return in the first quarter to set up a field goal. He then took back a punt for a touchdown. The Bills were too terrified to kick it to him after that, so they had some short attempts to give Cleveland good field position. As it turned out, the Browns had more yardage on punt returns in the first half than net yardage on offense.    The Browns weren't the only team to lose their starting quarterback. E.J. Manuel banged his knee while going out of bounds in the third quarter. He walked off on his own power, and it appeared as though he'd be able to reenter the game, but Manuel eventually limped off into the locker room. Manuel finished 11-of-20 for 129 yards. Not included in this was a 29-yard pass interference on the opening drive. Manuel threw well when he had a clean pocket, but his accuracy issues were prevalent when he couldn't set his feet. He's incredibly inconsistent, but at least the talent is there. Rookie Jeff Tuel stepped in under center when Manuel exited the contest. Tuel impressed in the preseason, but he was horrendous in his professional debut. His numbers - 8-of-20 for 80 yards and a pick-six - don't illustrate how bad he was. His lacking arm strength was extremely apparent, as his throws wobbled and fell short of his intended targets. He wasn't accurate in the slightest. Worst of all, he was constantly whining and complaining to his teammates, the coaching staff and the officials.    More injury woes for the Bills: Stevie Johnson had the aforementioned 29-yard pass interference and then caught two balls for 19 yards, but he aggravated his hamstring in the second quarter and left the game or good. Rookie wideout Robert Woods led the team with five catches and 64 receiving yards.    Both of Buffalo's running backs were iffy to play in this game, but they posted solid fantasy numbers. Most of C.J. Spiller's 66 yards (on eight carries) came on a 54-yard touchdown to open the second half. Barkevious Mingo couldn't get off a block, and then T.J. Ward missed a tackle to help spring Spiller into the end zone. Fred Jackson was the better player once again, rushing for 53 yards and two touchdowns on 17 attempts. He also caught four balls for 40 receiving yards.    It's hard to believe, but Willis McGahee was the leading rusher in this contest. He had just one solid run, which would explain his meager YPC (26 carries, 72 yards). However, he scored a touchdown, so those who started him as a bye-week filler were happy.    Gordon, who also scored, paced the Browns with 86 receiving yards off four catches. He had what seemed like a devastating drop on the opening drive that could have been a 90-yard touchdown. Gordon later dropped another pass, but at least he wasn't Greg Little (3-71), who foolishly took two kickoffs out of the back of his own end zone. He fumbled one of the attempts, but Cleveland luckily recovered. Jordan Cameron was a disappointment (3-36). He was targeted once in the end zone, but Weeden overthrew him.    Browns' stud defense Desmond Bryant was yet another player who was knocked out of this game. He went to the hospital with shortness of breath, so hopefully he'll be OK.    There was some stupid stuff in this game: 1. The NFL officials now have pink flags. I know it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but pink flags are just way too much. It's a dumb idea that needs to go away. Not everything needs to be pink. We get it. 2. Bills' coach Doug Marrone appeared to challenge illegal contact in the first half. Yeah, I didn't understand it either. There was illegal contact in the end zone that gave Cleveland a first down. Marrone threw his flag, and the official had to announce that the Bills were charged with a timeout on a non-reviewable play. I have no idea what Marrone was trying to do. 3. Why didn't the Browns go for two after the pick-six? The touchdown made it 37-24 with about 1:50 remaining. Going for two would've made it a 14-point game. I know it ultimately didn't even come close to mattering, but this poor type of game management could come back to haunt Cleveland in the future. 4. NFL Network play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler doesn't know about any of the football players. I'm serious. He's said some weird stuff this year, this week called Greg Little Mr. Dependable. I thought I was hearing things, but couldn't rewind the game because my DVR wasn't functioning at the time. However, multiple forum members confirmed this. How the hell is Little worth the title of Mr. Dependable? He's been benched several times because of drops and fumbles. He's the opposite of dependable. Why in the world would Nessler call him that then? Is he just completely clueless, or is he trolling us? Also, Nessler said, We lost a valuable employee to breast cancer last summer, Natalie Parker. That's nice of him to say that, but her name flashed on the screen as Natalie Packer. Nessler obviously never even said a single word to her if he screwed up her name like that, so why would he say she's a valuable employee? How would he know she's valuable? Does he even know what she did? I'm just shocked he didn't just refer to her as Ms. Dependable.   "],
