      "comments": [" This game seemed like it would be a lopsided affair on two occasions. The first occurred right away on the very first drive. Christian Ponder took a sack because he held on to the ball too long, and then he threw an interception on the very next play by carelessly lofting a pass into double coverage. The Redskins took over and scored easily, so it appeared as though Minnesota wouldn't have a chance. The Vikings scored a couple of touchdowns after that, but the Redskins eventually led 27-14 in the third quarter. Minnesota's defense looked completely helpless. Washington receivers were open on seemingly every play, as the Vikings' injury-ridden secondary blew tons of assignments. So, with that in mind, I have no idea how Minnesota managed to turn the tide. The pass rush suddenly came alive out of nowhere and smothered Robert Griffin, holding Washington completely scoreless after that. The offense, meanwhile, got enough against the Redskins' poor defense to eventually take the lead and hang on despite a furious final drive by the Redskins that culminated with drops by Jordan Reed, Pierre Garcon and Santana Moss in the end zone.    Ponder, despite the dubious first possession, had a pretty solid outing. He let the ball hit the ground just three times, going 17-of-21 for 174 yards, two touchdowns and the aforementioned pick. He was going up against a putrid defense, but the fact remains that he played very well after the ugly interception. Ponder also had a 14-yard scramble that appeared to be another score, but replay showed that the ball was fumbled and dribbled out of bounds just short of the goal line. Unfortunately, Ponder suffered an injury on the dive and had to leave the game. Matt Cassel - not Josh Freeman - took over for Ponder and also looked decent, completing 4-of-6 passes for 47 yards. Ponder hit a key throw that allowed Minnesota to bleed out the clock.    The Redskins couldn't exactly concentrate on Ponder (or Cassel) because they had to worry about wrapping up Adrian Peterson. The stud back didn't have a great YPC - he gained 75 yards on 20 carries - but he scored twice and ran really tough, dragging defenders with him on multiple occasions.    John Carlson had a big game for Minnesota. Taking over for the injured Kyle Rudolph, Carlson led the Vikings with seven catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. Cordarrelle Patterson also scored, as he caught both of his passes (for 22 yards) on a single drive. Meanwhile, Greg Jennings struggled yet again with three catches for only 18 yards.    As for Girffin, he went 24-of-37 for 281 yards and three touchdowns, along with seven scrambles for 44 rushing yards. He was masterful until the middle of the third quarter; at one point, he was 18-of-24 for 221 yards and the three scores. He was particularly lethal on third down, converting nine of 16 tries, including a third-and-15 to Garcon. However, Griffin finished just 6-of-13 for 60 yards because the Minnesota pressure got to him. Kevin Williams dominated the interior of the line of scrimmage, collecting 2.5 sacks.    Griffin's scores went to Garcon (7-119), Reed (6-62) and Logan Paulsen.    Alfred Morris had a nice night running the ball. His fantasy owners will be disappointed that he didn't find the end zone, but he rushed for 139 yards on 26 carries. He actually received a goal-line carry, but couldn't convert.    Time for the weekly Brad Nessler gaffe! Greg Little was once known as Mr. Dependable. Jay Feely has been Jim Feely. Last week, Koa Misi became Koa Misa. This Thursday, Nessler commented that one of the punters kicked it high into the Minneapolis sky. Yeah, I'm sure the ball looked beautiful in the Minneapolis night sky - considering that the Vikings play in a dome.   "],
