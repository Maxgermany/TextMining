      "comments": [" Did the Dolphins know that there was a game going on this week? After all, they had just won their Super Bowl by knocking off the Patriots last Sunday, so perhaps they believed the season was over because they triumphed in the Big Game. It certainly looked that way, as Miami put forth very little effort in this AFC East battle. The Dolphins, as they have all season, played down to their competition, allowing Buffalo to come away with a shutout victory. Miami's offense mustered just 103 net yards of offense and a laughable six first downs. The issue was that the offensive line was completely overwhelmed by Buffalo's stout front (minus Marcell Dareus) in terms of both run blocking and pass protection. Ryan Tannehill never had a chance. He was sacked on third down on the team's two opening drives. He then was sacked on multiple third downs in most of the ensuing possessions, and he was ultimately brought down behind the line of scrimmage a whopping seven times. When Tannehill wasn't being pinned down, he had to throw the ball away under pressure. He took seven sacks, but it felt like 700 sacks, as Miami's offensive line completely embarrassed itself. Tannehill deserves some of the blame, however, as he was inaccurate all afternoon. He was eventually benched in favor of Matt Moore, who threw an interception right away. Tannehill came back in and then was yanked again, and Moore went on to toss another pick at the very end. Tannehill went 10-of-27 for 82 yards, while Moore finished 2-of-6 for 53 yards and two interceptions.    With Tannehill being held to fewer than 100 passing yards, it's actually surprising that a Dolphin receiver managed to eclipse the 50-yard barrier. That was Brian Hartline (2-53), but only because of a garbage-time catch. Mike Wallace (4-38) was next on the box score.    I mentioned that the Dolphins also had problems running the ball. Daniel Thomas received most of the workload, but mustered just six yards on nine carries. He repeatedly screwed up in pass protection, so I have no idea what Miami was thinking by sticking with him. Lamar Miller was more successful on his touches, but inexplicably received only three totes for eight yards.    As for Buffalo, Thad Lewis completed his sweep of the Dolphins. He got the job done, but left some points off the board with a few mistakes. For example, he threw an interception because he threw off his back foot while under pressure. He also missed receiver Chris Hogan, who was wide open for a touchdown in the first half. Still though, Lewis was solid otherwise. He went 15-of-25 for 193 yards and the pick. He also showed some mobility, picking up 13 rushing yards. Lewis did all of this without three of his receivers. Stevie Johnson was out because of a death in the family. Robert Woods, who caught three balls for 70 yards, was ejected for throwing a punch. Marquise Goodwin, meanwhile, was knocked out with a knee injury.    Buffalo had much more success running the ball. Fred Jackson had his first huge performance in quite a while, generating 111 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. C.J. Spiller (20-77) didn't have as much luck, and he even was guilty of a bone-headed play at the end of the first half when he ran out of bounds as the Bills were trying to run out the clock. It appeared as though he gave a gift three points to the opposition, but the Dolphins were just too inept offensively to take advantage of that blunder.   "],
