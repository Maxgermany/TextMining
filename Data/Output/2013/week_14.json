      "comments": [" Many were calling this the Teddy Bridgewater Bowl, but this game had playoff implications. What, you don't believe me? It's true. Both teams were actually still alive in the playoff hunt prior to kickoff. Here's what each team needed to do to reach the postseason (thanks to Scott S. for some help with this): <b> Jaguars: <\/b> Week 14: Raiders beat Jets Steelers beat Dolphins Vikings beat Ravens Titans lose one of Week 14 to Broncos or Week 15 to Cardinals Giants beat Chargers Week 15: Broncos beat Chargers Browns lose one of Week 15 to Bears or Week 16 to Jets Patriots beat Dolphins Jaguars beat Bills Titans lose one of Week 14 to Broncos or Week 15 to Cardinals (already mentioned) Steelers lose one of Week 15 to Bengals or Week 16 to Packers Lions beat Ravens Week 16: Bills beat Dolphins Browns lose one of Week 15 to Bears or Week 16 to Jets (already mentioned) Jaguars beat Titans Chargers beat Raiders Steelers lose one of Week 15 to Bengals or Week 16 to Packers (already mentioned) Patriots beat Ravens Week 17: Jaguars beat Colts Dolphins beat Jets Browns beat Steelers Broncos beat Raiders (unless Chargers beat Chiefs) <b> Texans: <\/b> Week 14: <strike>Texans beat Jaguars<\/strike> Patriots beat Browns Raiders beat Jets Steelers beat Dolphins Bills lose one of Week 14 to Buccaneers, Week 15 to Jaguars or Week 17 to Patriots Vikings beat Ravens Titans lose one of Week 14 to Broncos or Week 15 to Cardinals Giants beat Chargers Week 15: Broncos beat Chargers Bears beat Browns Texans beat Colts Patriots beat Dolphins Bills lose one of Week 14 to Buccaneers, Week 15 to Jaguars or Week 17 to Patriots (already mentioned) Titans lose one of Week 14 to Broncos or Week 15 to Cardinals (already mentioned) Bengals beat Steelers Lions beat Ravens Week 16: Bills beat Dolphins Browns beat Jets Jaguars beat Titans Texans beat Broncos Packers beat Steelers Chargers beat Raiders Patriots beat Ravens Week 17: Bengals beat Ravens Texans beat Titans Jets beat Dolphins Bills lose one of Week 14 to Buccaneers, Week 15 to Jaguars or Week 17 to Patriots (already mentioned) Browns beat Steelers Broncos beat Raiders Chiefs beat Chargers Well, the Texans are out, but the Jaguars need just 19 more things to happen!    Jacksonville, continuing to ruin the future of its franchise, Reversed the Curse, as the team called it, winning at home for the first time since last November. It was a hollow, meaningless victory, however, that will have adverse effects going forward. The Jaguars may not even be able to get Brett Hundley now, as I had in the most recent version of my <b> <\/b>. The main problem for the Jaguars is the quarterback position. Chad Henne had a nice, opening drive, but he was pretty pedestrian after that. He went 12-of-27 for just 117 yards and two touchdowns. He took dumb sacks and heaved some awful throws, missing open receivers on several occasions, including Cecil Shorts deep downfield. He's just a mediocre backup at best, yet the Jaguars probably won't be able to find an upgrade over him next offseason, ensuring a losing record in 2014. The Texans, meanwhile, may have lost on the scoreboard, but they were the real winners Thursday night because they inched closer to landing Teddy Bridgewater, all while ensuing that one of their divisional rivals will be awful for years to come. Houston didn't even try early on; the team was whistled for 10 penalties in the opening half, including some dumb infractions like false starts, a DeAndre Hopkins punch personal foul, a kick-catch interference, an unsportsmanlike flag for a D.J. Swearinger taunt, and so on. However, Gary Kubiak did something incredibly stupid late in the game when he benched Case Keenum (16-of-29, 159 yards, TD, INT) in favor of Matt Schaub. The latter came in and nearly led the team to victory, which would've been disastrous. As my Las Vegas Hilton partner Matvei wrote in a text to me, After ruining the season, Matt Schaub is now making a bid to ruin the Texans draft pick. Keenum struggled with his accuracy throughout, but the Texans should have kept him in the game, not only to ensure defeat; but to also make sure that they know what they have in Keenum going forward. Playing Schaub was very pointless and almost extremely harmful. Schaub went 17-of-29 for 198 yards, one touchdown and a bad pick at the very end.    Some players stood out: - Andre Johnson had a big second half. Of his 13 catches, 11 came after intermission. He finished with 154 yards. - Both starting tight ends scored once. Garrett Graham hauled in eight passes for 73 yards. Marcedes Lewis had two grabs for 42 yards. - Maurice Jones-Drew, tallying 103 yards on 14 carries, suffered a hamstring injury in the fourth quarter. He told the NFL Network crew that he'd be ready for Buffalo in Week 15, but that could've been just standard player arrogance. - Ace Sanders threw a 21-yard touchdown to Jordan Todman, who also went down in the final period. He hurt his leg. - Cecil Shorts had just two catches for 13 yards, but he scored a touchdown. He also drew a long pass-interference flag and just missed out on a 50-yard touchdown because Henne overthrew him by a few inches.    I've made fun of Brad Nessler countless times. He has called Greg Little Mr. Dependable, Jay Feely Jim Feely and Koa Misi Koa Misa. He also said that the a punter in the Redskins-Vikings kicked the ball into the night sky even though they were playing in a dome. As for this week, I'll let e-mailer Joe B. handle it: <i>I know you love pointing out Brad Nessler's idiotic statements. Here's this week's edition in case you missed it: These two teams played two weeks ago, so you know they'll remember each other's names. Maybe Nessler needs to announce a game between the same two teams that he announced two weeks ago, since he has all kinds of problems knowing the players' names. I wonder who this Marcellus Lewis fellow is...<\/i> Indeed. He referred to Marcedes Lewis as Marcellus Lewis when the tight end caught his first-quarter touchdown. It's amazing how much money Nessler is stealing from the NFL Network, because he's absolutely mailing it in.   "],
