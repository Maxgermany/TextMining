      "comments": [" The Saints had the Seahawks and Panthers coming up after this contest, so they weren't exactly completely focused for this matchup. The Falcons, meanwhile, called this game Super Bowl Thursday and gave out flags with Rise Up written on them to all of the fans. With their season in the toilet, all Atlanta could hope for was to derail a potential New Orleans Super Bowl run. Giving the Saints their third loss would take them out of the running for homefield advantage, after all. Even though New Orleans was sleepwalking and Atlanta was trying extremely hard, the former still prevailed, albeit in ugly fashion.    The Saints had major issues stopping Atlanta's offense. The Falcons generated 355 net yards and 22 first downs (compared to 19 by New Orleans), and were successful on 6-of-12 third-down conversions. Matt Ryan, who has been extremely turnover-prone of late, was razor-sharp, letting the ball hit the ground just nine times as he completed 30-of-39 passes for 292 yards. He nearly had a touchdown, but one of his receivers was tackled inches short of the end zone on the opening drive. Ryan spent most of the night targeting beleaguered cornerback Corey White, who was starting in place of the injured Jabari Greer. Though he had a great game, he had two interceptions dropped and took some heat for sliding down four yards short of the end zone on third-and-goal. The crowd booed him, as it thought he had a chance to score. Ryan probably wouldn't have found the end zone, but a greater effort could've set up a fourth-and-goal situation inside the 2-yard line, so that negated a possible touchdown. Ryan was also betrayed by his offensive line (five sacks allowed) as well as one of his young receivers. He constantly threw to SMU rookie Darius Johnson, who caught six balls for 67 yards. Johnson had a brilliant first half, but dropped a big third-down pass in the third quarter that would've moved the chains and then lost a fumble inside the red zone during the early stages of the final period.    Ryan's usual suspects didn't do much. In fact, Tony Gonzalez didn't catch his first pass until around the 2-minute warning at the end of the opening half. Gonzalez finished with four grabs for 43 yards, while Roddy White was an even greater disappointment (2-24). Harry Douglas paced the team with nine catches for 79 yards.    The Falcons had a ton of success running the ball early in the game. Steven Jackson rushed for 37 yards and a touchdown on just nine carries in the opening half, but had a meager 7-26 line following intermission.    As for Drew Brees, he had one more misfire than Ryan, going 23-of-33 for 278 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Despite the completion percentage, Brees was unusually inaccurate, missing some throws he would usually hit. He also had a dropped interception in the end zone. Brees was hurt a bit by injuries, as Darren Sproles and Pro Bowl guard Jahri Evans were both of the lineup. Brees' scores went to Ben Watson and Jimmy Graham (5-100), who beat a safety on a double move. Upon reaching the end zone, Graham dunked the ball so hard that he made the uprights crooked in the process. There was 3-minute delay because someone had to straighten it out with a huge level. It was funny, but the officials probably should've flagged Graham with a delay-of-game penalty.    Pierre Thomas had a huge outing in the wake of Sproles' absence. He rushed for 73 yards on just 10 carries to go along with five catches for 57 receiving yards. His best play was an 18-yard burst on a second-and-17 in which he held off a defender with an extremely impressive stiff-arm.    On the flip side, Marques Colston struggled again. He had an underwhelming stat line - four catches, 40 yards - and he also disappointed his team with a drop deep in Atlanta territory.    I picked Saints' defensive end Cameron Jordan to reach the Pro Bowl - click here for my - and he definitely did not disappoint, recording 2.5 sacks. Akiem Hicks chipped in with 1.5 sacks. Speaking of the Saints' defensive line, there was a hit on Matt Ryan in the second quarter that resembled the controversial penalty that Brees took last week against the 49ers. This one was worse and it actually deserved a flag, as Ryan was hit in the helmet. Interestingly enough, no flag was thrown. What is it with the Saints and always benefiting from these sorts of hits?   "],
