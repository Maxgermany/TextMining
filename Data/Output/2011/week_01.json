      "comments": [" How about that new Falcon offense? Matt Ryan posted a ton of passing yards (319), but the scoring attack as a whole had major issues sustaining drives. Part of it was Atlanta's perennial struggles while playing outdoors. Part of it, of course, was Chicago's stellar defense. And I'd like to believe that part of it was Jim Cornelison's awesome rendition of the national anthem prior to kickoff. That really fired up the crowd, the players and even me. I was so pumped up that I actually stopped eating Cheetos for a few minutes. At any rate, Ryan went 31-of-47 for 319 yards and a pick, as he was playing in catch-up mode the whole game. Ryan was constantly harassed by Chicago's front - he was sacked five times and hit many times more - but because he threw the ball so much, he was able to hit four different targets five times: Tony Gonzalez (5-72), Julio Jones (5-71), Roddy White (8-61) and Jason Snelling (5-32).    Michael Turner gained 100 yards on only 10 carries. More than half of that came on a 53-yard scamper in which he was caught from behind by a Chicago defender, but Turner looked much healthier than he did last year.    Jay Cutler was prolific against the Falcons, going 22-of-32 for 312 yards, two touchdowns and a pick. Cutler did have issues with holding on to the ball too long on a couple of his four sacks, but otherwise put together a very strong performance.    The star of Chicago's offense was Matt Forte. He gained 68 rushing yards on 16 carries, and also had five catches for 90 receiving yards and a touchdown, evading seemingly slow Atlanta defenders with ease. Forte is going to have a huge year.    Excluding Forte, Roy Williams paced the Bears with four grabs for 55 yards. He left the game with a groin injury in the fourth quarter, allowing Johnny Knox to see more snaps. As for Earl Bennett, he had just two catches for 11 yards, but was targeted four times. No Chicago player was targeted more than five times.   "],
