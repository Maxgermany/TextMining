   "comments":" Cam Cameron obtained Ten Ginn with the ninth-overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, a selection that was viewed at the time as a major reach. Who would have thought that four-and-a-half years later, Cameron would be one of the scapegoats for one championship game loss, while Ginn's absence would be the reason for another championship defeat? Seriously, how big was Ginn's knee injury? If he's in the game, the 49ers don't muff a punt and fumble a return in overtime. You really have to feel for Kyle Williams. Unlike Billy Cundiff, Williams' main job isn't returning punts. He was in the game because Ginn was hurt. That doesn't excuse his two crucial mistakes that led to 10 New York points, but if you're comparing Williams to Cundiff, it's no contest. The kicker was more responsible.    This was a dead-even game otherwise. The total yardage was 319-319 at the end of regulation, and both squads would have been worthy NFC champions. The reason I picked the Giants, however, was that an even matchup like this would go to the team with the better quarterback. And Eli Manning was unquestionably the superior signal-caller. Manning went 32-of-58 for 316 yards and two touchdowns. That's an impressive stat line considering the immense pressure he was under. He seldom had time in the pocket and took six sacks (2.5 from Ray McDonald). San Francisco's defense definitely came to play. As for Alex Smith, he was 12-of-26 for 196 yards and two scores. He made a couple of great throws to Vernon Davis, but two things stick out to me. First, he had an open Kyle Williams downfield for a long touchdown in the second quarter, but overthrew him by about five yards. Second, Smith couldn't convert a third down to save his life. He was 1-of-13 in those situations, with the only positive result coming right at the very end of regulation when the Giants allowed him to complete a pass well short of the end zone. I don't want you to think that Smith is a lost cause or anything. He made great strides this year, and it wouldn't be fair to dismiss him because of this loss, especially after his late-game heroics versus New Orleans. He deserves a chance with more than one weapon to throw to. Vernon Davis was a monster again (3-112, 2 TDs), but no other Niner receiver or tight end did anything. Michael Crabtree caught one ball for three <strike>years</strike> yards.    Frank Gore had a really nice game. He rushed for 74 yards on just 16 carries, and chipped in with six catches for 45 receiving yards. Remember when I said this contest was evenly played? Well, Ahmad Bradshaw had the same amount of rushing yards and receptions (20-74; 6-52).    The star for the Giants was Victor Cruz, who had a whopping 10 grabs for 142 yards. All of his work came early though, and he didn't get a single reception in about 10 of the final drives. Hakeem Nicks (5-55) also played well, while Mario Manningham (1-17) and Bear Pascoe (1-6) caught Manning's touchdowns.   ",
