      "comments": [" (Editor's Note: Now there's the mediocre Kyle Orton we know and love! Where were these interceptions last week when I bet three units against him!?)    Having been to a few Chiefs-Raiders tilts in my lifetime, I know the rivalry is littered with thrilling finishes. Topping the list of games I have witnessed live would be the 1997 Week 2 Monday Night Football game won when Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac hit Andre Rison, who somehow got behind a defense in prevent mode, for a 33-yard touchdown to secure a 28-27 victory. That one didn't have playoff implications; this one did for both teams. Big plays often define big games, and the Raiders set the tone when Bryan McCann returned the opening kickoff 91 yards to the Chiefs' 14-yard line. Kansas City's defense stood up, however, and the run defense set a tone of its own. After Michael Bush picked up four yards on first down, he was stuffed on second down to force a passing situation. Bush (23-70) was contained all day and had a long run of just 11 yards. The Raiders' running game is totally different without Darren McFadden's speed on the outside to loosen up opposing defenses, and even quick rookie Taiwan Jones (out with a hamstring) might have helped. Instead, Palmer threw incomplete, and Sebastian Janikowski came in to put Oakland up 3-0 very early. On Kansas City's first possession, Thomas Jones went right up the middle for 22 yards on the second play from scrimmage. It was by far the longest run of the game by either team though, and after that, Jones (11-51) and Jackie Battle (14-56) combined for just 85 yards on 24 carries for a 3.54 yard average. In other words, both run defenses stepped up in what felt like a playoff game, albeit a wild card, atmosphere. Jones was stopped on the next play, and two incompletions later, the Chiefs were punting. At least Dustin Colquitt trapped the Raiders at their own 3-yard line. Oakland battled its way out of poor field position, but the always-entertaining Carson Palmer threw while being hit, and his pass went right at Derrick Johnson for the easy interception. Earlier in the drive, Johnson had fallen down to allow a 17-yard pickup by Bush on a screen, so it was a bit of redemption for him. Kansas City small-balled its way on the next drive toward the end zone after starting at the Raiders' 36. All eight plays were for gains, but none covered more than seven yards. The march stalled inside the 10, a familiar failure for this offense all season, and Ryan Succop tied the game at 3. After an exchange of punts took the game into the second quarter, Oakland had a very Oakland sequence. Starting the drive with a penalty for illegal formation was a sign of things to come, but was quickly erased by a 20-yard pickup to Denarius Moore (4-94, TD) whose presence in this offense has been sorely missed. The Raiders overcame another illegal formation penalty caused by using an extra offensive lineman when Brandon Carr was flagged for pass interference. After reaching the Chiefs' 36-yard line, Michael Bush was stoned on a 3rd-and-2. In field goal formation, holder/punter Shane Lechler passed to backup tight end Brandon Myers for an easy touchdown and an apparent 10-3 lead. Unfortunately, it came back because the play clock had expired. With an actual try after the delay penalty, Janikowski's 59-yard field goal attempt doinked off the crossbar, and I am pretty sure Hue Jackson wished he had an IV filled with Pepto Bismol. As hard-fought as this game was, mistakes were plentiful. Both teams had a pair of turnovers and were in double digits for penalties, combining for 180 penalty yards. Kansas City worked the great field position off the long missed field goal and were at the Oakland 13-yard line when Kyle Orton (21-of-36, 300 yards, TD, 2 INTs) was intercepted by Matt Giordano on third down, blowing a chance to take the lead. The long return of the pick set up the Raiders, but the Chiefs quickly forced third down, and Palmer (16-of-26, 237 yards, TD, 2 INTs) squandered a potential long field-goal attempt opportunity by tossing an interception to Javier Arenas. Starting at the two-minute warning, Kansas City again moved the ball with double-digit yardage passes to rookie wide receiver Jonathan Baldwin, Dwayne Bowe and tight end Leonard Pope. Let me backtrack for a moment though, because prior to the Pope gain, the Chiefs were at the the Raiders' 23-yard line. I was thinking field goal, but interim head coach Romeo Crennel was thinking touchdown. Orton threw incomplete and was flagged for grounding (loss of 11 yards). Flags for delay of game and false start seemingly put them out of scoring range, but the pass to Pope salvaged a Succop attempt. Richard Seymour blocked it and the game went to half at 3-3. Remember what I said about big plays? Early in the second half, Oakland's defense forced a quick punt and drove the Raiders drove their way towards midfield. A holding penalty backed them up, but Palmer went deep to Moore for a 61-yard touchdown that changed the complexion of the game. Staked to a 10-3 lead, Oakland's defense was in bend but don't break mode the rest of the afternoon, taking advantage of an offense unable to finish drives. Kansas City's next possession was highlighted by a 43-yard pass to Terrance Copper, who apparently is still in the league. Unfortunately, a first-and-goal from the 6-yard line led to another Succop field goal to make it 10-6. After the Chiefs' defense held, the offense again went to plus territory at the Oakland 35-yard line. Stanford Routt stepped in front of a pass intended for Bowe, ending the march. Even though the Raiders did nothing on offense, their stud punter Lechler changed field position, putting Kansas City on its own 10-yard line. This was crucial because on the next drive Crennel rolled the dice trying to convert a 4th-and-1. Battle was stopped. Oakland took advantage of the short field, marching 30 yards to cash in an easy field goal for a 13-6 advantage. Early in the second quarter, Coach Jackson passed on trying to convert a 4th-and-1, electing instead to punt and play field position. Sometimes conservative works and gambling backfires. Still, with 2:57 remaining, I was tweeting that I expected the Chiefs to tie the game with a touchdown, adding to the legacy of tight finishes in this rivalry. Sure enough, Orton went to Bowe twice for 28 yards to set them up just shy of midfield. Then, Dexter McCluster took a screen pass and almost scored. Giordano tackled him at the 3-yard line after a gain of 49. No matter, Bowe caught a touchdown pass on the next play. The final 1:01 was frenetic. Oakland's offense went three-and-out, allowing Kansas City another chance. Orton hit Bowe for 25 and Copper for 11 to set up a dramatic field goal-attempt from 49 yards out. The Raiders' defense looked stunned, and yet another collapse appeared imminent. There would be no icing timeout and Trevor Scott blocked the field goal to set up overtime. Lechler called tails to win the toss, with Seymour calling for the ball before the coin even hit the ground. On the first play from scrimmage, Palmer dropped a bomb to Darrius Heyward-Bey (4-70) who was quiet most of the day. A raucous crowd at Arrowhead Stadium was suddenly silent, much like the Oakland Coliseum when Grbac hit that pass to Rison back in 1997. After two Bush runs to set up the field-goal attempt, Janikowski kept the AFC West title hopes alive for the Raiders with the game-winning final score, 16-13.   "],
