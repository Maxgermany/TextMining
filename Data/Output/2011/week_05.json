      "comments": [" What the hell is going on this year? Seemingly no team can hold on to a lead - not even veteran squads that had Hall of Fame quarterbacks playing for them the year before. The Colts were up 17-0 in the first half. They tallied 291 total yards of offense. They had complete control of this contest, and it looked like the Chiefs had no chance. Pierre Garcon (5-125) torched Brandon Flowers constantly. He scored twice, including once from 63 yards.    It's amazing how everything changed after halftime. Kansas City outgained Indianapolis by nearly 100 yards after the break. Dwayne Bowe (7-128) suddenly became the receiver who couldn't be stopped. He and Steve Breaston (4-50) both scored twice. Indianapolis' rush defense was the culprit. Thomas Jones (10-55) was solid, but Jackie Battle was the one who really did the damage. Battle, who had just 155 career rushing yards entering this contest, ran for 119 yards on 19 carries. Todd Haley really loves him, so you'll definitely want to pick him up in your fantasy leagues.    As for the Colts' runners, Joseph Addai (6-19) left the game in the first quarter with a hamstring injury. Donald Brown (8-38) and Delone Carter (12-22, TD) split carries afterward. Carter had the goal-line carries, though on one play he hilariously tried to leap into the end zone from the 4-yard line. He wasn't even close.    Matt Cassel really deserves a lot of credit for this win. Now completely healthy off that ridiculous and unnecessary preseason rib injury, Cassel went 21-of-29 for 257 yards and four touchdowns.    Curtis Painter, meanwhile, was awesome in the first half (12-17, 237 yards, 2 Tds), but was just 3-of-10 for 40 yards after the break. He finished 15-of-27 for 277 yards and two scores.   "],
