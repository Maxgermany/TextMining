      "comments": [" (Editor's Note: The Bengals lost, but I think they proved that they are for real. They fell behind 14-0, but clawed their way back into the game. They had several chances to win this game, but a penalty and an interception did them in. I was impressed. Unfortunately, Leon Hall tore his Achillies' tendon. That blows.)    This AFC North grudge match featured the young upstart Bengals battling the veteran Steelers in a game that will have playoff implications in the AFC. Pittsburgh got it started well with their first drive, which featured Ben Roethlisberger hooking up with Mike Wallace for some good gains. Roethlisberger capped the drive when he bought some time and found Jerricho Cotchery open in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. The Steelers opened up a good lead later in the first quarter. Rashard Mendenhall got the drive going with a 26-yard catch after getting wide open. Wallace ran another good end around, and a pass to Heath Miller put the Steelers on the door step of the end zone. Mendenhall scored from two yards out. Down 14-0, Andy Dalton answered. He moved to his left and aired the ball out into the end zone. A.J. Green was in double coverage, but the big rookie jumped over the two defenders to make a great 36-yard touchdown catch. Green was injured on the play and that was his only reception of the game. He was on the field on the next Cincinnati possession and ran the ball for seven yards, but was favoring his knee. Pittsburgh's next possession saw the Bengals get opportunistic when cornerback Leon Hall intercepted a bobbled ball. That set up Cincinnati at the Steelers' 41-yard line. The Bengals had to settle for a 43-yard field goal from Mike Nugent. Just before halftime, the Steelers put together a good drive with Roethlisberger moving the ball through the air. He hit some big throws to Antonio Brown to move the ball into Cincinnati territory. A second touchdown pass to Cotchery was called back due to an offensive pass interference penalty on Miller. The Bengals' defensive line came through with their third sack of the first half on third down to force a field goal. Pittsburgh was up 17-10 at halftime. Unfortunately, Hall suffered a ruptured Achilles' tendon against the Steelers and will miss the rest of the season. It is a devastating injury for the Bengals. He went out of the game just before halftime. In the third quarter, Cincinnati moved the ball with some precision passes from Dalton. He connected with Jermaine Gresham and Colin Cochart for good gains to get inside the 10-yard line. Dalton finished the drive with a one-yard scoring pass to Gresham. Pittsburgh answered on their next possession for what would be the game-winning score. Roethlisberger threw the ball down the field with some short passes to his receivers. At the 9-yard line, Mendenhall made an impressive run where he shed two tackles to fall over the goal line for the score. After that both defenses shored up. Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons caught a deflected pass for an interception early in the fourth quarter. The Bengal defense played well also and totaled five sacks in the game. Late in the fourth quarter, Cincinnati was moving into Pittsburgh territory. The comeback attempt ended when cornerback William Gay saw a slant route coming in zone coverage and intercepted the pass around the Steelers' 20-yard line. Pittsburgh controlled the ball and ran the clock out. For the game, Roethlisberger completed 21-of-33 passes for 245 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Mendenhall ran for 44 yards on 16 carries with two scores. Brown led the Steelers in receiving with 86 yards on five receptions. Wallace caught five for 54 yards with two runs for 31 yards. Dalton played better than his numbers indicate. He was 15-of-30 for 170 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Benson had 57 yards on 15 carries. Andrew Hawkins led Cincinnati in receiving with 56 yards on five receptions.   "],
