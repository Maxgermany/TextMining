      "comments": [" Man, the Bills players must not like Ryan Fitzpatrick very much. Fitzpatrick was 9-of-21 for 101 yards and two interceptions in the first half - I'm listing those stats because the rest of his numbers were compiled in garbage time against a prevent defense - but he was not responsible whatsoever for those picks. Both popped out of his receivers' hands, with Brad Smith and David Nelson committing the errors. Last week, I sent Notre Dame receiver Michael Floyd to Buffalo in my <b> <\/b>. I think that selection will remain the same for a while.    Fitzpatrick was able to finish 20-of-39 for 209 yards and those two picks. His leading receivers were a tight end in Scott Chandler (5-71) and a running back in Fred Jackson (5-50). Steve Johnson, who was playing hurt, barely did anything (2-16).    Speaking of Jackson, he couldn't run the ball whatsoever against Miami's surging defense. Jackson rushed for 17 yards on seven carries.    While Buffalo's offense struggled - the team had just six first downs in the opening half - the Dolphins couldn't be stopped. They moved the chains 13 times prior to intermission, as Matt Moore was a sterling 14-of-20 for 160 yards and three touchdowns. Moore's progression from what we witnessed against the Jets in that Monday night contest to what we're seeing now is remarkable. The Dolphins are winning themselves out of the Robert Griffin, Matt Barkley and Landry Jones sweepstakes, but they won't need any of those quarterbacks if Moore keeps playing this way. Of course, this strategy didn't exactly work out for the Panthers a couple of years ago.    Moore's touchdowns went to Charles Clay (4-69), Davone Bess (2-25) and Anthony Fasano (2-8). Brandon Marshall made just one catch for five yards, but had a score wiped out after a booth review.    Reggie Bush also found the end zone. He and Daniel Thomas each had 15 carries, with the latter outgaining the former, 50-32.    Epic gambling moment: The Dolphins took a safety toward the end of the game after taking over on downs at their own 1-yard line. The seemingly insignificant two points would push the total (43).
