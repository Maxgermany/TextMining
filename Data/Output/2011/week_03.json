      "comments": [" It's a shame that the Panthers and Jaguars battle each other only once every four years because the showdown between Cam Newton and Blaine Gabbert was mostly ruined by rain. If you didn't catch any highlights of this contest, it was a torrential downpour for most of the afternoon. In fact, it was so bad that most of the Carolina fans fled the stadium. It was impossible to even see who had the ball. Despite the rain, Gabbert was able to hook up with Mike Thomas on a 36-yard touchdown as time expired in the first half. It was reminiscent of the David Garrard-to-Thomas Hail Mary, though Jacksonville didn't get the victory this time. Gabbert was pretty mediocre otherwise. He went 12-of-21 for 139 yards, one touchdown an interception and three fumbles. He did have his first pass - a nice, 13-yard completion to Jason Hill - wiped out because of a Eugene Monroe penalty. However, Gabbert's pocket presence was a big problem; he struggled with pressure and even took a safety. Most of his yardage came on screen passes to Jones-Drew.    Speaking of Jones-Drew, there's no doubt now that he's healthy; the Pro Bowl running back gained 122 yards on 24 carries to go along with three catches for 45 receiving yards.    The rain cleared up as the game progressed, and the Panthers were able to finally take the lead in the fourth quarter when Cam Newton hit Greg Olsen (7-57, TD) for a 16-yard touchdown. Newton had accuracy issues all afternoon, but you can't completely blame him because of the rain.    Two Panthers who also struggled: Steve Smith had just two catches for 15 yards, while DeAngelo Williams rushed for only 18 yards on 10 carries. I have no idea why the hell Carolina gave Williams that mega deal. He looks done, and there's no question that Jonathan Stewart is the better back. Stewart took his 10 attempts for 59 yards to go along with three catches for 26 receiving yards. He also had a 60-yard gain wiped out by a shady ruling that his elbow hit the ground.   "],
