      "comments": [" (Editor's Note: Matvei texted me when the Buccaneers scored what looked to be a backdoor cover touchdown: It's nice to have shady pass interference penalties go our way for once. Go Bucs! So much for that. Ugh, did the Saints really have to kick that frontdoor cover field goal? Why does something like this happen to me every week? Why God, why!?)    Saints cornerback Tracy Porter put a big hit on Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Williams, jarring the ball loose for an incompletion on one of the first plays from scrimmage. Both players were injured, with Porter having his head immobilized and carted off the field. After a missing field goal, New Orleans got on the board with a drive led by running back Darren Sproles. He started it with a 35-yard run up the middle of the Tampa Bay defense. On the next play, Sproles caught a swing pass for 15 yards. They finished the drive with Drew Brees throwing a fade pass to Lance Moore for a short touchdown. The next drive saw the Saints move the ball downfield quickly. They pounded the Buccaneers' run defense on the ground and set up a 21-yard screen pass to Sproles for a touchdown and a 14-0 lead. Just before halftime, Tampa Bay's offense got going. Freeman lofted a deep ball to wide receiver Dezmon Briscoe for a 46-yard gain. That set up a field goal to cut New Orleans' lead to 14-3. Brees led a quick-strike drive to get the three points back. In the third quarter, Brees was intercepted by veteran Ronde Barber on a dump off pass to Sproles. That set up the Buccaneers to get another field goal. It could have been more, but an idiotic late hit penalty by running back LeGarrette Blount put Tampa Bay in a 3rd-and-15. The Saints answered with a long drive to take a commanding lead. Running back Pierre Thomas charged through a few defenders to score a 9-yard touchdown run. Freeman later tried to mount a comeback for the Buccaneers. He led a field goal drive to start the fourth quarter, and after getting the ball back, he engineered a 77-yard drive for a touchdown. Freeman made a clutch third-down play to wide receiver Mike Williams and tossed a 5-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow in the back of the end zone to cap the drive. That cut the Saints' lead to 24-16 with five-and-half minutes left. New Orleans put the game away on their next possession when they drove down the field and kicked a field goal. Brees finished the afternoon 27-of-36 for 258 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Jimmy Graham led the Saints with six receptions for 78 yards. Sproles had 89 yards rushing and receiving with a touchdown reception. Freeman finished the game 27-of-37 for 267 yards and one touchdown. Blount ran for 72 yards on 13 carries. Williams paced Tampa Bay in receiving with six catches for 46 yards. The Buccaneers killed themselves with terrible gap integrity in run defense and horrible tackling. They also played very undisciplined football with a number of stupid, critical penalties.   "],
