      "comments": [" Blaine Gabbert just had no chance. Or at least he didn't appear to, for a while. The Jaguars, stricken with the NFL's worst passing offense, were going against the Steelers and their league-leading aerial defense. Gabbert was 6-of-14 for 33 yards in the opening half. He was sacked three times in the first 20 minutes alone (five times overall). The Jaguars as a whole mustered a pathetic 68 total yards prior to intermission. The Steelers? Just 315 total yards in the same span.    It's a miracle the Jaguars were down just two scores prior to the break. It could have been much, much worse. Ben Roethlisberger missed a wide-open Antonio Brown for a touchdown. Later, he overshot a streaking Emmanuel Sanders, who had the chance to haul in a long score. Following halftime, it just looked like Pittsburgh was sleepwalking. Gabbert was mired in a 2-of-12 for 1-yard stretch (seriously), so I guess the Steelers just assumed they were going to win easily. Give Jacksonville credit for coming back, but this contest was much more lopsided than the final score indicates.    Gabbert finished 12-of-26 for 109 yards and an 18-yard touchdown to Jason Hill in the third quarter in which the rookie quarterback actually looked shocked that he was able to complete the pass. Considering the defense he was going up against and his lacking receivers, the performance wasn't all that bad.    The Jaguars were able to run the ball well, rushing for 96 yards on 22 carries. The Steelers have had major issues stopping the rush this year.    Speaking of the running game, Rashard Mendenhall trampled Jacksonville's defense for 146 yards and a score on 23 carries. He actually looked like a competent back for the first time all year.    As for Ben Roethlisberger, he went 12-of-23 for 200 yards and a touchdown. As mentioned earlier, Big Ben missed on many opportunities. His stat line should have been much better.    Troy Polamalu suffered a head injury in the fourth quarter. His absence didn't impact Jacksonville's comeback, as he exited the contest when the score was 17-10. He's reportedly OK.   "],
