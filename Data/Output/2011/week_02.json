      "comments": [" It might be too soon for me to recap this game given the breakneck pace of the second half. Let's not jump ahead though. After a sluggish start for both offenses, I tweeted the passing numbers for the quarterbacks combined at the conclusion of the first quarter. Ryan Fitzpatrick and Jason Campbell were 6-of-13 for 32 yards, and the game was scoreless. Oakland got the running game going just enough to move the football with an occasional screen pass to Darren McFadden. It was nothing fancy, but drive after drive, they marched in for touchdowns in the second quarter. This was supposed to be a hangover game for them flying east on a short week following a late Monday Night Football appearance in Denver. Instead, they were up 21-3 at halftime aided by a missed field goal and turnover leading to a short touchdown drive. When the second half started, everything went back to analyst expectations coming in. Buffalo came out firing on offense and playing aggressive on defense. The offense scored touchdowns all five times they touched the ball after the break. The defense forced a fumble on Oakland's first possession and a quick punt on their second possession. By the fourth quarter, this was an old school AFL shootout with the teams exchanging touchdowns and the lead. Remember the passing stats from earlier? Well, in the final three quarters Fitzpatrick and Campbell combined to complete 45 out of 66 attempts for 565 yards and five touchdowns.    Campbell's numbers were solid. He completed almost 70 percent of his throws for 323 yards and a couple touchdowns. The interception was on a hail mary play the end the game, so ignore that. Campbell was dealing with some different wide receivers with Darrius Heyward-Bey, Louis Murphy and Jacoby Ford out. It turned out to be a blessing. Denarius Moore, a star of the preseason, caught five balls for 146 yards including a jaw-dropping 50-yard score down the middle with Leodis McKelvin and Gibril Wilson on him like two pieces of bread. Derek Hagan was also solid, catching five passes for 61 yards.    Unfortunately for the Raiders, their defense was not up to the task in the second half. When Fred Jackson and C.J. Spiller weren't breaking off big runs (19 rushes for 180 yards, 2 touchdowns) wide receivers Stevie Johnson and David Nelson were picking up first downs in the passing game (18 receptions for 179 yards, 2 touchdowns). Right now there are two people named Chris Johnson in the NFL. That might not be the case for long.    Another footnote of sorts is the poor kickoff returns by Oakland's Nick Miller, who repeatedly took the ball out of the end zone and failed to reach the 20. Ford was sorely missed in that area, and when he is healthy, Miller might be looking at a pink slip.   "],
