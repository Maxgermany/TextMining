      "comments": [" The Dallas Cowboys did their best impression of Texas A&amp;M on Sunday. They opened up a 17 point advantage and led 27-3 in the third quarter. At that point, the Lions started a furious comeback, and like the Aggies, the Cowboys had an epic meltdown. Detroit scored two defensive touchdowns and two Calvin Johnson end-zone grabs with a 51-yard field goal to steal a win from Dallas. It was the biggest collapse in a single game from the Cowboys in team history. The Lions played terribly in the first half, only to be out done by the Cowboys playing even worse football in the third and fourth quarter.    To start the game, Matthew Stafford threw an interception to Cowboys safety Gerald Sensabaugh. Stafford threw behind Calvin Johnson and the ball flew directly into the stomach of Sensabaugh. Early on, Stafford was struggling and was feeling consistent pressure from the Cowboys front. The normally accurate Stafford was throwing a lot of passes short and heaved a number of passes away rather than pushing the ball downfield. In the first half, the Lions offense produced only three points. Stafford was 9-of-23 for 88 yards and an interception. Javhid Best had 21 yards on only three carries in the first half. Megatron had three receptions for 38 yards with Brandon Pettigrew catching three balls for 20 yards.    Tony Romo was red hot in the first half. He hooked up with Dez Bryant for a 25-yard touchdown on Dallas first possession. Bryant caught the pass right over the head of Lions cornerback Chris Houston. Romo continued to drive that ball down the field on the Lions' second possession. The Cowboys offensive line was doing a very good job of blocking the Lion defensive line. Romo had time to throw, and they were getting some good runs out of Felix Jones and Tashard Choice. The Cowboys were stopped on the goal line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-goal. Jones was stuffed at the line by Lions linebacker Ashlee Palmer, and Detroit took over. Passing up on three points would come back to hurt the Cowboys. Romo attacked Houston again with a 44-yard pass to Laurent Robinson that got the Cowboys all the way to the Lions' 6-yard line. On the next play, Romo threw a pass up to Bryant who grabbed the ball and fought off cornerback Eric Wright in the front of the end zone. Following that, Romo led a field goal drive midway through the second quarter and just before halftime for a 20-3 halftime lead. Romo picked apart the Detroit defense, completing 19-of-24 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns. Jones ran for 37 yards on 10 carries. Robinson paced Dallas in receiving with four receptions for 85 yards. Bryant had two catches for 37 yards and two scores.    At the beginning of the third quarter, Romo didn't miss a beat as he moved the ball downfield and hit tight end Jason Witten for a one-yard touchdown. With the Lions up 27-3, Romo breathed some life into a Lion defense that was bleeding yards and points. Romo threw a terrible pass short of his receiver, and it was intercepted by Lions linebacker Bobby Carpenter. The former Cowboy first-round pick cut in front of a receiver around the 35-yard line. He zig-zagged his way downfield and returned the interception for a touchdown. The next possession was, as Yogi Berra would say, deja vu all over again. Romo threw a slant pass toward Robinson, but it was off the mark. Houston out-fought Robinson for the ball and made the interception. Houston raced down the sideline 56 yards and dodged a few potential tackles for a touchdown. Romo was aided by a dumb facemask penalty on Ndamukong Suh. The Lions kept Suh blocked for most of the game, but Suh hit Romo hard with a hand to the face of Romo. It turned an incompletion on a third down to a first down around midfield. Romo's next play was a 37-yard pass to Witten. That led to a field goal and a 30-17 lead. After the Lion defense got Stafford back in the game, he returned the favor in the fourth quarter when he finally got the ball into the end zone. Stafford threw a jump ball in the end zone for Johnson, and Megatron out leaped two defenders to come down with a 23-yard touchdown catch. After a three-and-out, the Lions moved the ball, but sloppy play and penalties forced Detroit to settle for a field goal to make it a three-point game. Detroit put up 10 more points to narrow it to 30-27. With just over four minutes remaining, Romo was pressured by Suh. He tossed a ball up for Witten that was short of his tight end. Linebacker Stephen Tulloch tipped the ball to himself and secured a huge interception for Detroit. The Lions made Romo pay and took the lead. Some good passes from Stafford to Johnson and hard runs by Best, moved the ball inside the 5-yard line. Stafford finished the drive with a fade pass to Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown toss. Romo didn't have a comeback in him, and Detroit improved to 4-0 for the first time since 1980. Dallas fell to 2-2.    Stafford ended the game 21-of-43 for 240 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Johnson had eight receptions for 96 yards and two scores. Pettigrew caught six for 64. Best ran for 47 yards on 11 carries.    Robinson led the Cowboys in receiving with seven receptions for 116 yards. Witten had seven catches for 94 yards with one score, while Bryant had three catches for 37 yards and two scores. Jones ran for 57 yards on 16 carries.    For the game, Romo finished 34-of-47 for 331 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions. The Lions could not have made their comeback win without Romo's two pick-sixes and final interception. It was a terrible meltdown performance from the Cowboys signal-caller. Romo turns 32 next April, so next offseason may be time for Dallas to think of the long-term future at the position. His performance against the Lions and Jets this season have to make them start pondering that.   "],
