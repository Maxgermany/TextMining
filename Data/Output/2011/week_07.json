      "comments": [" Crappy teams continue to struggle off byes. The Seahawks just had a week off and they just couldn't get anything going the entire contest. Here are some key lowlights: - Seattle had four penalties on the opening drive. Two were James Carpenter false starts. There was also a delay of game and a holding infraction. - The next drive saw an anemic Charlie Whitehurst (12-30, 97 yards, 1 INT) severely underthrow an open Ben Obomanu on third down. - Whitehurst was strip-sacked at the beginning of the second quarter, setting up the Browns for their first field goal. What also helped was that the Seahawks were offside on a 4th-and-3, giving Cleveland a free first down.    Given all that, it's a miracle that the Browns only pushed. They outgained Seattle, 298-137, and the Seahawks had just nine first downs. So, what happened? Matvei, who runs the section, described it perfectly: <i> That Seattle push was one for the ages. They have to both block a field goal and then commit a moronic headbutt that allowed the Browns to kneel rather than knick another field goal. That took five years off my life. <\/i>    Some noteworthy stats: - Leon Washington paced the Seahawks with 39 rushing yards. Marshawn Lynch was inactive after injuring himself in pre-game warmups. - Joe Haden limited Sidney Rice to just two catches on 38 yards. It's worth noting that Haden was not on Rice on his 38-yard reception. - Colt McCoy was a very pedestrian 20-of-35 for 178 yards and a pick, but he had some nice scrambles (8-31), including a 12-yarder in the fourth quarter in which he evaded numerous tacklers to pick up a first down. - Montario Hardesty had 33 carries with Peyton Hillis out, but managed only 95 yards. - Greg Little caught five balls, but had just 31 yards. Little's potential will continue to go unfulfilled with a limited McCoy under center.   "],
