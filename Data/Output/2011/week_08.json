      "comments": [" I'd really like to congratulate Jack Del Rio and offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter for coming up with the most amazing game plan of all time. Despite never trailing by more than a touchdown in the first three quarters, Del Rio and Koetter called 22 Blaine Gabbert passes compared to 13 Maurice Jones-Drew carries in that span. When you have one of the best running backs in the NFL and an extremely raw rookie quarterback, every defense is going to expect you to pound the rock. But Del Rio and Koetter outsmarted Houston. I'm obviously being facetious. Del Rio and Koetter once again proved that they are complete morons. Jones-Drew's 13 attempts went for a somewhat respectable 51 yards, while Gabbert once again was absolutely abysmal. The first-year signal-caller was a humiliating 10-of-30 for 97 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Whereas the other rookie quarterbacks are thriving, Gabbert still hasn't shown any signs that he can be a capable NFL starter.    Jones-Drew finished 63 yards and a score on 18 carries. He inexplicably wasn't used in the passing game either; he caught just one ball for 11 yards.    Marcedes Lewis led the Jaguars with four catches for 45 yards, but had a key holding penalty in Houston territory. Mike Thomas hauled in just three grabs for 24 yards.    Matt Schaub was obviously better than Gabbert, but only by default. He went 16-of-30 for 225 yards and a touchdown against Jacksonville's tough defense. He really missed Andre Johnson, but should have his No. 1 wideout back next week.    Jacksonville contained Schaub, but struggled against Houston's rushing attack. Both Arian Foster (33-112, TD) and Ben Tate (5-42) broke off big chunks of yardage at will, especially toward the end to set the Texans up with a field goal and a cheap cover. FML.   "],
