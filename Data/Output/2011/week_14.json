      "comments": [" Let's get through this abomination of a game quickly. The Colts had just four first downs and 59 total yards of offense through three quarters, as this contest was essentially over when Baltimore went up 17-0 in the first half. Indianapolis had a couple of chances to cover because of Baltimore turnovers in the fourth quarter, and like last week, Dan Orlovsky beat the spread - doing so on the final play of the game. Unlike the Patriots, the Ravens didn't decide to leave receivers wide open. They wanted to keep the Colts out of the end zone at all cost. In fact, the crowd was going nuts when their defense made a red-zone stand in the middle of the fourth quarter.    Joe Flacco went 23-of-31 for 227 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. He had a great game except for that pick, which was a poor decision in the red zone.    Flacco's score went to Torrey Smith (5-48), who was one of three Ravens to catch at least five balls. The others, as you may expect, were Ray Rice (6-46) and Anquan Boldin (5-57).    In terms of the ground attack, Ray Rice rushed for 103 yards and a touchdown on 26 attempts. Cam Cameron did a good job of feeding the ball to his best player. Of course, he needs to remember to do this in more important games going forward.    Orlovsky finished 17-of-37 for 136 yards, one touchdown and an interception, but he wasn't even as good as those poor stats indicate. Like last week, most of his yardage came in garbage time. He also fumbled thrice. Terrell Suggs, who forced all three of them, had three sacks as well.    The Colts split carries amongst their running backs, but none of them could do anything. Donald Brown led the team with nine attempts for 28 yards. Delone Carter (5-6) was barely over one YPC, but didn't fumble the ball this week. Joseph Addai (2-16) barely got any work.   "],
