      "comments": [" Don't be fooled by this score. It says the Bills lost by just six points, and those who may have caught the end probably saw the Bills fail at a failed onside kick attempt, which would've given them a chance to avoid an 0-2 start. However, this game was incredibly lopsided, as the Jets dominated Buffalo throughout the entire evening. The Bills managed to keep this game close thanks to a few plays. Tyrod Taylor hit two receivers for touchdowns of 84 and 71 yards, and the Bills also returned a Jalin Marshall fumble for a score in the third quarter. Erase those three semi-fluky instances, and the Bills would've gotten crushed. Buffalo has many issues. The defense is a major problem, thanks to all of the suspensions and injuries in the front seven. The Bills can't put any sort of pressure on the quarterback without sending the house, and this exposed both cornerbacks in this contest. Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby, both of whom are very talented, were torched mercilessly. Ryan Fitzpatrick was mostly unstoppable. If the Bills couldn't contain such a pedestrian quarterback, how are they going to deal with some of the better signal-callers in the NFL? Fitzpatrick finished 24-of-34 for 374 yards and a touchdown. This was one of the best performances of his career. He was so incredibly accurate, especially on third down. The Jets were 8-of-13 in those situations. Fitzpatrick is going to wilt when the weather gets cold, like he usually does, but he at least proved that he has mentally recovered from his horrific Week 17 showing from last year.    All three of Fitzpatrick's primary receivers caught six passes. Brandon Marshall led the way with 101 yards, though there was a scary instance in which he was tackled awkwardly and was taken into the locker room. He didn't miss much time, however. Meanwhile, Eric Decker and Quincy Enunwa accumulated 126 and 92 yards, respectively. Decker had a big gain nullified by a penalty, while Marshall dropped a long pass, though he did draw an interference flag on Darby. As for Enunwa, I listed him as an add in fantasy heading into Week 2, and I obviously stand by that after his performance at Buffalo. Big, fast and strong, Enunwa is sort of a flex wide receiver-tight end who has proven to be a matchup nightmare thus far. The Jets don't use a real tight end, so Enunwa is Fitzpatrick's No. 3 target. He could post huge numbers if either Marshall or Decker gets hurt.    Matt Forte rushed for an even 100 yards and three touchdowns. It was a terrific fantasy performance, but Forte accumulated those yards on 30 carries, so his 3.33 YPC isn't very impressive, though he did get stronger as the evening progress. Still, I think the Jets are making a huge mistake by giving him so many touches; turning 31 soon, Forte is going to be run into the ground soon, and I think he'll be ineffective down the stretch if this continues.    Moving back to the Bills, their offense is also problematic. Taylor, as mentioned, hit a couple of big plays, but was otherwise very mediocre. His final stat line of 18-of-30 for 297 yards, three touchdowns and an interception is very misleading. Take away those two deep throws, and Taylor would've gone 16-of-28 for only 142 yards, one garbage-time touchdown and an ugly pick in which he underthrew Sammy Watkins on a third-and-1. Taylor made a couple of nice scrambles for 15 and 10 yards, but he was guilty of numerous ugly throws throughout the evening. There was also horrible clock management on his part near the end, though some of that was Rex Ryan's fault. Speaking of Ryan, he also wasted a timeout when deciding to go for it on a fourth down in the final quarter. That timeout would've come in handy at the end of the game, when the Bills advanced to midfield, but ran out of time. It's hard to imagine Ryan keeping his job after this season. It's not completely his fault the Bills are 0-2 because of all the injuries in the front seven, but Ryan's abysmal game management, as well as his team's tendency to be incredibly sloppy, makes him a strong candidate to be let go after just two years. In fact, if the Bills continue to lose, it wouldn't surprise me if Ryan is axed during the team's Week 10 bye.    Taylor's long touchdowns were to Marquise Goodwin (2-112) and Greg Salas (4-89). Goodwin absolutely torched Darrelle Revis, who continued to look like one of the worst cornerbacks in the NFL. Sammy Watkins, meanwhile, played, but caught only two balls for 20 yards. Watkins did not look 100 percent. In fact, he failed to finish the game.    LeSean McCoy didn't do much on the ground, mustering only 59 yards on 15 carries. However, he caught four balls for 31 receiving yards. He also did well picking up the blitz.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how horrible Phil Simms was tonight. Simms, who still somehow has a job, didn't understand that a pass could be incomplete if a player landed out of bounds before maintaining full possession of the ball. He also said Fitzpatrick had no one to throw to on one instance, even though Forte was wide open down the middle of the field. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
