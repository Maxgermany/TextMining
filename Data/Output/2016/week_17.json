      "comments": [" Steve Smith told the media that this would be his final game, so the logical assumption was that the Ravens would put forth a great deal of effort so that the great receiver could have a proper farewell. That was not the case, as Baltimore didn't try hard whatsoever. The lack of character of this team was pretty telling that they didn't really seem to give a damn that their potential Hall of Fame teammate would be walking away forever. That's how they played, anyway. Where to start? Well, the defense was awful. The Bengals had a skeleton-crew offense on the field in this game, missing A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert. This didn't matter, as Cincinnati moved the chains with complete ease. Andy Dalton was able to shred the Jimmy Smith-less Baltimore secondary, going 18-of-28 for 226 yards and a touchdown. Not included in this was a drawn interference flag by Brandon LaFell in the end zone. Dalton was a perfect 6-of-6 for 59 yards and a score in the opening quarter. He constantly connected to Cody Core (4-82) and Brandon LaFell (7-67). Perhaps more embarrassing was Baltimore's inability to stop Rex Burkhead. The lumbering running back started in place of the injured Jeremy Hill, and he easily trampled the disinterested Ravens, gaining 119 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. Burkhead also had two catches for 25 yards.    Meanwhile, Baltimore's offense was also responsible for not giving Smith a great send-off, as the unit did stupid stuff throughout the afternoon. The team managed to move the chains on occasion, but constantly screwed up in the red zone. Joe Flacco fired an interception on a first-and-goal, telegraphing a horrible pass to Shawn Williams. The Ravens later went for it on a fourth-and-1 inside the red zone, but failed to convert. They were down 20-3 and needed two touchdowns and a field goal, so kicking would've made the most sense. This was evident when the Ravens had possession, down 20-10, with 5:40 remaining. Had they opted for the field goal, they would've been down just one score with the ball. John Harbaugh's brain fart was inexplicable.    As for the man of the hour, Smith had a pretty nondescript game. He caught three passes for 34 yards, and in typical Smith fashion, he got into a scuffle with a Cincinnati defender following a catch and a subsequent late push by Shawn Williams out of bounds. Congratulations to Smith on what has been a terrific career. He has finished seventh all time in receiving yards.    Flacco did at least play well in between the 20s. He finished 32-of-49 for 267 yards and an interception. However, this wasn't the first time he was guilty of red-zone blunders this year. This has been a constant problem for him, and it's something the Ravens need to address this offseason. Perhaps Flacco will be better in his second year back from hs ACL tear.    Kenneth Dixon had twice as many carries as Terrance West, which is a good sign that the Ravens recognize who the better talent at running back happens to be. Dixon gained 44 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. West (5-18) was stuffed on a third-and-1. Baltimore's decision to use West in that situation was perplexing, given that Dixon had move the sticks on a fourth-and-1 earlier on the same possession.    Dennis Pitta led the Ravens with 11 catches for 91 yards. Breshad Perriman (4-62) was next, thanks to a 39-yard burst that featured some horrible tackling efforts by the Bengals. It appeared as though Perriman scored, but replay review ruled it down at the 1-yard line, allowing Dixon to vulture the score. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
