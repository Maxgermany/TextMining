      "comments": [" No one really thought they were going to witness something monumental by watching this horrific AFC South matchup, but it appears as though we were all wrong. That's because this may have been Gus Bradley's final game as head coach of the Jaguars. A quick way to have a coach fired is to show very little effort during a game, especially one on national TV. That's exactly what the Jaguars did. They whiffed on tackles the entire evening, allowing Tennessee score on some huge plays they really shouldn't have. Between the lack of hustle and mental mistakes, it was quite evident that Bradley prepared his team poorly for this contest. Whether that's his fault or a symptom of Blake Bortles not taking his career seriously, it's inconsequential. Jacksonville's owner had already been attending meetings and reportedly contemplating a change. With an extended layoff until the next game, Shad Khan may decide to pull the trigger after watching his team absolutely humiliate itself on a national stage. The thing is, it may not matter. Bradley doesn't appear to be a good head coach, but I don't think he's the problem. All I heard about Bortles coming out of Central Florida was that he was a heavy partier, and there were rumblings that he hasn't taken his career seriously. It really shows, as he's regressed despite having some excellent offensive coaching aiding him. Bortles' passes were all over the place. The final stats don't show it - Bortles finished 33-of-54, 337 yards, three touchdowns - but he began the game 4-of-11 for 26 yards and was 8-of-16 for 64 yards in the opening half. The rest of his numbers came in garbage time as the Titans played a very soft prevent defense. As he had done masterfully last season, Bortles racked up a ton of yards, as well as three touchdowns, in meaningless action. The early-game numbers are very indicative of how poor Bortles was. He overthrew Allen Robinson a routine third-and-short conversion. His next third-down pass was nowhere near Robinson, who wasn't even looking for the ball. The Jaguars couldn't establish any sort of rhythm amid Bortles' struggles, mustering just 60 net yards in the opening half, averaging a laughable 2.7 yards per play. Tennessee was up 27-0 at the break.    Conversely, Marcus Mariota was excellent. It really is hard to say how great he would've been had the Jaguars actually shown up, but he shouldn't have to apologize for having a terrific performance. Mariota misfired on just four occasions, going 18-of-22 for 270 yards and two touchdowns. He didn't run much - three carries, 11 rushing yards - but he didn't need to, as Jacksonville's defense gave up big gains all evening. The Titans sputtered on their first drive because of a DeMarco Murray fumble on a dropped pitch, but Mariota led six consecutive scoring drives after that.    The Titans ran all over a Jacksonville defense missing Roy Miller, though I'm not sure if the big defensive tackle would've helped their poor tackling. Murray, aside from the fumble, was terrific, gaining 123 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. Murray missed some action with an injury, but he reentered the game following an extended absence. Derrick Henry looked great in relief, tallying 60 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts. He made some breath-taking cuts, as it's clear that Tennessee will have a strong rushing attack if Murray ever misses time. Henry also caught four balls for 37 yards.    Mariota did a good job of spreading the ball around, as four players caught exactly four passes on either four or five targets. Aside from Murray, those players were Kendall Wright (4-84), Delanie Walker (4-75) and Rishard Matthews (4-38). Wright and Matthews both found the end zone.    Going back to the Jaguars, Allen Robinson finally didn't post a disappointing stat line, though his six catches for 70 yards were very inefficient because he saw 15 targets. He and Bortles simply couldn't get on the same page until late in the game when the Titans stopped trying. Allen Hurns led the team with seven receptions for 98 yards and a touchdown, but he dropped a pass on a fourth-down attempt. Julius Thomas (3-28) also scored.    Sadly, Bortles led the Jaguars in rushing with 22 yards on four scrambles. T.J. Yeldon and Chris Ivory combined for only seven carries because the Jaguars trailed throughout. Ivory (4-6) was never going to do much, but Yeldon (3-20) at least looked pretty spry. Yeldon also caught four passes for 36 receiving yards.    Phil Simms quotes: I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about these, especially with this being Simms' final appearance on Thursday Night Football. On one hand, I'm thankful that we only have to hear him once per week going forward. On the other hand, I'll miss posting his ridiculous quotes. There were three bad ones this week: 1. Those errors are unexcusable. You mean, inexcusable, right Emmitt? I mean, Phil? 2. We talked to him last night. Not sure what he said. I kind of feel the same way after listening to Simms for three hours. 3. You know what's so great about winning? It's great. You know what's so great about listening to Phil Simms? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. My fiancee watched the game with me. She took note of some of these, and she eventually grew tired of listening to Simms. She said something that cracked me up: That guy who's talking is a douchebag. I couldn't have said it better myself. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
