      "comments": [" The narrative entering this game was that the Rams would play the Seahawks closely because they've had the edge in this divisional matchup in recent meetings, winning the previous three. And for a while, that appeared to be true. Seemingly fighting the officials and their horrible spotting of the football, Seattle sputtered offensively in the first quarter, entering the second frame in a scoreless tie. They managed an impressive touchdown drive in that quarter and turned a failed fake punt into a field goal, but were still stuck with just a 10-3 lead heading into intermission. They outgain the Rams by only 11 yards at that stage of the game, but they eventually got into a rhythm and generated 193 net yards following the break, pulling away with a 21-point victory. The Seahawks seemed way too interested in running the ball in the first half, and it simply didn't work. Thomas Rawls was swallowed up at the line of scrimmage by Aaron Donald, and Seattle, as a result, was constantly stuck in long-yardage situations. That changed after intermission, as the Seahawks opened things up aerially. This should've been the strategy in the first place, as the Rams had three missing defensive backs entering this contest and eventually lost a fourth. Russell Wilson consequently posted a terrific stat line. Wilson misfired just seven times, going 19-of-26 for 229 yards, three touchdowns and a late, careless interception. Wilson's sole mistake, save for that play, was earlier in the red zone, when he lofted an underthrown pass to Jimmy Graham. The ball appeared to be picked off, but it was ruled incomplete on the field and also upon a replay review. It should've been changed to an interception, and I'm saying this as someone who had a wager on the Seahawks. The officials were completely incompetent in this game, blowing numerous decisions and spots.    Rawls, meanwhile, managed just 34 yards on 21 carries. He had a nice, 12-yard burst in the second half, but couldn't find any running room otherwise. Rawls is a decent back, but the Seahawks will be thrilled to have C.J. Prosise back in the lineup soon.    Wilson's scores went to three different players: Tyler Lockett (7-130), Doug Baldwin (5-35) and Luke Willson (3-19). Jimmy Graham was a disappointment for his fantasy owners, catching only one pass for 31 yards. He was targeted on only one other occasion, and that was the aforementioned near-interception.    Before moving on to the Rams, a couple of injuries are noteworthy: Michael Bennett appeared to be knocked out with a concussion. This happened just one play after he was flagged 15 yards for twerking following a sack that would've forced fourth down. The play never should've happened, so it seems like Bennett was being penalized karmically for doing something a grown, big man should never do. Meanwhile, punter Jon Ryan was knocked out following a fake punt. The fake punt was a curious decision, as the Seahawks ran it from their own 27, up 24-3 with six minutes remaining in regulation. Many took issue with this, but I didn't mind it, as NFL teams should be encouraged to embarrass their divisional rivals. Meanwhile, Kam Chancellor left the game at one point, but only did so temporarily. Losing him would've been a massive blow for Seattle's playoff chances.    As for the Rams, this performance gave their few fans very little hope that Jared Goff could evolve into a franchise quarterback. Goff barely completed half of his passes, going 13-of-25 for only 135 yards. Goff was victimized by several drops, including a deep ball that should've been caught by Michael Thomas. Thus, Goff's stat line could've been much better despite the poor blocking. However, the other end of the spectrum needs to be considered as well. Goff had an interception dropped by Richard Sherman and missed numerous throws. He had Brian Quick wide open in the end zone on one occasion, but wasn't even close on his throw. Goff took numerous sacks because he held on to the ball too long, showing no pocket awareness. He also had a deer-in-the-headlights look far too often. Goff was ultimately knocked out of the game with a concussion when he was blasted by Richard Sherman on an attempted run into the end zone that wouldn't even count because of a penalty. Goff probably deserves a C- for this performance, so I guess he could've been much worse. Goff just doesn't look anywhere close to being ready to be called a franchise quarterback. This was the consensus of Goff heading into the 2016 NFL Draft, so it's still mind-boggling that the Rams used so many resources to acquire him. Goff probably should've been a second-round pick.    The Rams' miserable offensive line affected Todd Gurley as well. Gurley was limited to just 38 yards on 14 carries. He was blown up in the backfield far too often, as the Seahawks, like the other teams, were playing closer to the line of scrimmage because they didn't respect the Rams' passing game. Gurley was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 in the red zone in the opening quarter.    Just two Rams accumulated more than 20 receiving yards: Kenny Britt (4-50) and Brian Quick (3-46). <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
