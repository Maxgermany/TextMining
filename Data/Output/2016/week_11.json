      "comments": [" This has been the season from hell for the Panthers, and things just keep getting worse. Sure, they won to improve to 4-6, preserving their wild-card chances, but they sustained two key injuries in this contest that could make things even worse for them moving forward. Carolina had a healthy advantage in this contest, leading 23-3 in the third quarter. They established this 20-point margin via New Orleans mistakes (more on those later) and some solid offensive play. The key was the return of center Ryan Kalil, who had been out the past two games. However, Kalil was knocked out with a shoulder injury, and Carolina's offense sputtered after that. In fact, the Panthers mustered just one first down in the fourth quarter alone. Sadly, that wasn't even the most prominent injury that the Panthers sustained. Linebacker Luke Kuechly was tackled awkwardly with several minutes remaining. He was sobbing on the field and had to be carted off. It appeared as though there might have been some serious leg injury that could've ruined his career, but Kuechly was diagnosed with a concussion. It's unclear as to what was going on exactly, however, since Kuechly was extremely shaken and still had to be assisted into the locker room with a cart. He's missed multiple games because of a concussion in the past, so it's possible that he could be out for a while. The Panthers nearly lost this game despite establishing their huge lead. The Saints came charging back, shrinking the lead to 23-20. The Panthers were stuck with a third-and-10 deep in their own territory with about 2:30 remaining. A failed conversion would've given New Orleans plenty of time for a final drive to either win or force overtime - with no Kuechly on the field, by the way - but Cam Newton managed to connect with Kelvin Benjamin for an 18-yard gain to seal the victory. That was Carolina's only first down of the final frame.    Newton finished with underwhelming numbers, going 14-of-33 for 192 yards and a touchdown. It's noteworthy that Newton was especially awful after halftime; he was 6-of-14 for 58 yards following the break. Keep in mind that this occurred against New Orleans' putrid defense. Kalil's absence had that much of an impact.    Newton's sole touchdown was thrown to Ted Ginn, who impressively tapped his legs inbounds for a 40-yard completion right before halftime. Ginn nearly scored earlier, but was tackled at the 1-yard line. At any rate, this was his first touchdown of the season after scoring 10 times in 2015. Elsewhere, Benjamin led the Panthers in receiving yardage, catching three balls for 56 yards. He missed a couple of drives with a shoulder injury, but turned out to be OK. Greg Olsen (4-33) was a disappointment, considering the favorable matchup.    Jonathan Stewart had a couple of nice runs early on, but was stuffed at the line of scrimmage often, as the Saints have suddenly improved against the run with Sheldon Rankins back in the lineup. Stewart mustered just 31 yards on 18 carries, but he bailed out his fantasy owners with a touchdown.    Speaking of disappointing fantasy numbers for running backs, Mark Ingram managed only 28 yards on seven carries, but he played just slightly more than a half because he sustained a concussion. Tim Hightower took over and was much better. He gained 69 yards on the ground (12 carries) and also happened to be a big factor in the passing game, snatching eight receptions for 57 yards.    As for Drew Brees, he had a shaky start to this game. He lost a fumble on a third down of the opening drives because he held on to the ball too long. The Panthers turned the short field into three points, though it was nearly worse for the Saints because the Panthers were stuffed at the 1-yard line on an impressive goal-line stand by New Orleans. After that, Brees launched an inaccurate interception, which led to a Carolina touchdown. Those two give-aways, plus a blocked field goal at the end of the first half that was immediately followed by Ginn's touchdown, is pretty much why Carolina had such a big lead. New Orleans' three turnovers turned into 17 points for Carolina, and the Saints just didn't have enough time to come back from that. Brees shook off the early turnovers and finished strong, going 35-of-44 for 285 yards, two touchdowns and the interception. Two passes of his were dropped, one of which was in the end zone.    Michael Thomas ended up leading the Saints in receiving yardage, but that deserves an asterisk, as a 21-yard completion of his came on the last play of the game that was a failed Stanford Band-type attempt that never got going. Brandin Cooks (7-42) and Willie Snead (4-33) also disappointed on the stat sheet, with the latter dropping a potential score. Coby Fleener (3-17) and Brandon Coleman (1-9) caught the touchdowns. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
