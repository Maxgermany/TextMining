      "comments": [" Because of the nature of Thursday night games, and the pattern of the superior team prevailing, I was trying to figure out whether the Giants or Eagles were better heading into this contest. Given that the Giants were 10-4, and the Eagles were 5-9, common sense would've said the road team had the upper hand, but New York wouldn't have Janoris Jenkins and Jason Pierre-Paul, while Philadelphia would be getting Lane Johnson back from suspension and Darren Sproles returning from injury. As it turns out, we still don't have a clear answer. This was a tightly contested game that could've gone either way. The Eagles led throughout the entire evening, while the Giants won the yardage battle, 470-286. Yards per play was even, however, with New York edging out Philadelphia, 5.3-5.2, and the Giants had two opportunities to take the lead on consecutive fourth-quarter drives. New York has been one of the luckiest teams in the NFL this year, pulling out close victories against bad and mediocre opponents, so it appeared as though it would do that again. That would not be the case, however. On the first drive, guard John Jerry false started on a fourth-and-1, and the next pass fell incomplete to Sterling Shepard, though Nolan Carroll committed an uncalled pass-interference penalty. The next possession concluded with an Eli Manning interception thrown up for grabs.    Manning had a very mixed performance. He began the game 1-of-6 for only one yard and a pick-six in which he didn't see Malcolm Jenkins. Manning caught fire after that, as he seemed to figure out what the Eagles were doing defensively. He engineered some scoring drives, but his hot streak fizzled when he threw his second of three picks, as he telegraphed a throw that was snatched by Malcolm Jenkins. Manning finished 38-of-63, 356 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. It certainly wasn't a horrible showing, but his first two picks were absolute killers and allowed the Eagles to prevail. Manning is a weak spot on the Giants' roster as it stands, but he's not getting much help from his offensive line. That said, the blocking has been better with Justin Pugh on the field.    Despite facing constant double teams, Odell Beckham Jr. saw a whopping 20 targets. He snatched 11 of them for 150 yards. Beckham dropped a pass in the third quarter, but he should've caught a touchdown, as Manning overthrew him in the final frame. Shepard and Victor Cruz were targeted a ton as well, which isn't a surprise considering that Manning threw the ball 63 times. Shepard (7-61) hauled in Manning's sole touchdown, while Cruz caught eight balls for 84 yards.    The Giants ran better than expected once again, thanks in part to Pugh's return. Paul Perkins and Rashad Jennings combined for 112 rushing yards, as Perkins out-carried Jennings, 15-9, winning the yardage battle as well, 68-44.    Speaking of improved blocking, the Eagles were happy to welcome back Lane Johnson, who had been suspended when the team was 3-1. Philadelphia had gone 2-8 since, as missing its top offensive lineman certainly took its toll. Johnson made a big impact right away, as the Eagles ran behind him very successfully on the opening touchdown drive. I was perplexed that they shied away from that as the evening had progressed, but Johnson's presence allowed Carson Wentz to have better protection. Wentz saw some pressure, but wasn't sacked on a single occasion. Wentz finished 13-of-24 for 152 yards, one touchdown and an interception, which occurred when he danced around the pocket forever and then fired carelessly downfield. Wentz made some mistakes - he nearly had a second pick, but the ball was dropped - and had to leave the game for a bit because of a potential concussion, but he had a solid game overall. He was victimized by some drops, of course, while his best play occurred when he somehow ducked underneath two pass-rushers and scrambled for a first down. Philadelphia fans have to feel very optimistic about Wentz going forward. Wentz went through a rookie funk after beginning the year ablaze, but it's evident that the potential is there, and he'll have more success as long as Johnson stays on the field. Wentz is now 4-1 with Johnson blocking for him, with wins over the Giants and Steelers.    Sproles also returned, and he had a significant impact. He rushed for 40 yards and a touchdown on seven carries, and he also caught a pair of passes for 23 receiving yards. Ryan Mathews (18-46) was the team's leading rusher.    Though Agholor dropped a pass that disrupted an early drive, he led the team in receiving (2-47) and also caught a touchdown. Jordan Matthews, however, was only able to reel in two of his six targets for 12 yards. Zach Ertz (2-33) wasn't much better, which was a disappointment because he had such an easy matchup.    There was another controversial play regarding a quarterback slide. Contrary to the Monday night game, the defense was flagged for a penalty when Wentz slid forward. Eli Apple was the culprit. This call was completely bogus, as Apple attempted to pull up to avoid hitting Wentz, and he dived simultaneous to Wentz's slide. Most disagreed, but the Cam Newton hit Monday was legal. This was even less severe, so Apple shouldn't have been flagged. The penalty was crushing, as the Eagles scored on that drive. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
