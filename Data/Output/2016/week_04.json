      "comments": [" It definitely wasn't pretty, but the Bengals saved their season. They would've fallen to 1-3 with a defeat, but they managed to rise back up to .500 by beating the hapless, injury-ravaged Dolphins. The Bengals did a good job of moving the chains throughout the contest and controlling the clock in the process. They won the time of possession by about 16 minutes, with the Dolphins holding the ball for less than 22 minutes. Cincinnati managed to outgain Miami by 140 yards, and this margin would've been much greater had the Bengals been more efficient in the red zone, which has been a problem for them throughout the young season thus far. It's not too much of a concern, however, as Tyler Eifert figures to return next week. Eifert will help the red-zone offense immensely.    Andy Dalton had a solid showing, going 22-of-31 for 296 yards and a touchdown. It was an easy game for Dalton, who was able to pick apart Miami's horrific secondary, which benched Byron Maxwell prior to kickoff. A.J. Green torched Tony Lippett and Xavien Howard mercilessly, and all Dalton had to do was air the ball out to his dynamic receiver. The fact that Dalton threw just one touchdown is a disappointment, but he'll start firing more scores when Eifert returns. As for Green, he caught 10 passes for 173 yards and a touchdown, and his stats would've been even greater had the Dolphins kept up; the Bengals took the air out of the ball in the second half, throwing just nine times compared to 22 in the opening half. No one in Miami's secondary could cover Green, who caught strikes of 51 and 47 yards. Green's best catch was a diving 21-yarder. There was a scary moment in which Green began limping after taking an uncalled late hit out of bounds, but he appeared to be fine eventually.    Speaking of banged-up players, the Bengals lost guard Clint Boling in the second half, though he walked into the locker room on his own power. Jeremy Hill also left the game twice with shoulder issues. He gained 71 yards on 21 carries. He had some opportunities at the goal line, but couldn't convert. Giovani Bernard barely did anything on the ground in relief (10-18), but he did manage to catch three balls for 24 receiving yards.    Excluding Green and Bernard, only two other Bengals caught more than one pass: C.J. Uzomah (4-45) and Brandon LaFell (4-44). Promising rookie Tyler Boyd logged just a single reception for 10 yards.    The Dolphins, meanwhile, appeared as though they'd be able to make this a competitive matchup when Ryan Tannehill launched a 74-yard bomb to Kenny Stills, who torched Cincinnati's inept safety tandem. The speedy receiver made the deep catch this time and put his team up, 7-3. Miami, however, didn't score a single point after that. The primary issue for Miami was the state of the offensive line. The team was missing its starting left tackle and top two centers, and it showed. Tannehill had tons of pressure in his face, and despite throwing mostly short passes, he took five sacks, one of which resulted in a lost fumble. Things will improve for the Dolphins once they get Branden Albert and Mike Pouncey back from injury. Thanks to heavy pressure, Tannehill went just 15-of-25 for 189 yards, one touchdown and an atrocious interception in which he fired right to a Bengal defensive back. He nearly threw a pick-six off a deflection. The back-door push seemed to be there for Tannehill the entire fourth quarter, but the interception, some sacks and a Jarvis Landry drop on fourth down ruined three separate drives.    No Dolphin posted quality stats aside from Stills, who didn't log another reception outside of his deep bomb. Landry, who was guilty of the game-ending drop, snatched seven balls for 61 yards. DeVante Parker (2-20) was a non-factor.    The Dolphins rotated their running backs once again, with Jay Ajayi leading the way with six carries for 33 yards. Ajayi didn't log a single carry following the opening drive in the second half. Ajayi had some nice runs, so I'm not sure why he was taken off the field. Kenyan Drake (2-15), Damien Williams (2-9) and Isaiah Pead (3-5) barely did anything.    <b> Phil Simms Fun Time: <\/b> CBS still has Simms as its primary color analyst for some reason, so let's discuss some of the strange things he said during the telecast... It was an obvious but not obvious passing situation on second down. - I have no idea what this means. I guess we can say that this is an obvious but not obvious stupid quote from Simms. Maualuga gets a little rubbed on the inside. - I have to imagine Matt Millen was watching this telecast and began touching himself a little bit upon hearing this quote. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
