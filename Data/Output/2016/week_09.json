      "comments": [" This score might make it seem like the Falcons absolutely dominated this game, but that's definitely not true. Tampa got out to a quick lead and even led 14-13 late in the second quarter when the team sustained a horrible injury. Center Joe Hawley, who had been playing on a high level this season, hurt his knee and was quickly ruled out. The Buccaneers couldn't do anything offensively after that until late in garbage time when Atlanta played a lackadaisical prevent defense. Fatigue also played a factor in Tampa's demise. Both teams came in on short rest, of course, but the Buccaneers played a grueling overtime battle, and the defense was on the field for an extended period of time against the Raiders. They committed tons of penalties in the early going and then looked completely gassed in the second half. The Falcons were able to take full advantage. That's not to take anything away from Atlanta's offense, however. Matt Ryan was terrific, misfiring on just nine occasions. He finished 25-of-34 for 344 yards and four touchdowns. One of his incompletions was a Mohamed Sanu drop. Ryan was nearly flawless in the second half; his numbers following intermission were 14-of-16 for 173 yards and three scores. Tampa's horrific secondary, which was abused by Derek Carr this past Sunday, had no chance against Ryan, especially considering how tired they were.    Julio Jones caught only three passes in the first half, but he was unstoppable after intermission, finishing with eight grabs for 111 yards and a spectacular, leaping touchdown in which he was able to impressively tap his feet inbounds. Jones constantly beat the Buccaneers with in-cuts, as they just couldn't figure out how to stop it.    Ryan's other three touchdowns went to Austin Hooper (3-46), Levine Toilolo and Patrick DiMarco. Sanu made up for the early drop, finishing with five receptions for 74 yards. He also drew a pass-interference call in the end zone.    With Tevin Coleman out, Devonta Freeman handled most of the workload. He gained 77 yards on 17 carries, and he also caught two balls for 28 receiving yards. It wasn't the dominant performance his fantasy owners were hoping for, but the Buccaneers sell out against the run.    As for Tampa Bay, Hawley wasn't the only major injury the team sustained. Jameis Winston, for some strange reason, rolled out on a two-point conversion, down 40-20 in the fourth quarter. He was absolutely crushed, twisting around awkwardly. He looked like he was in severe pain, and he was knocked out for the evening. The good news is that Winston has 10 days to recover, but I don't understand why he would be doing that in such a circumstance. Winston had a decent game for the most part, going 23-of-37 for 261 yards and three touchdowns. He was very strong in the early going, but slowed down once Hawley left the field, and understandably so, given how important the center position is.    Mike Evans had a huge performance. It didn't begin well, as he dropped a pass, but he capped off the opening drive with a score. He was also guilty of two blatant offensive pass interference calls, but in between, he made a ridiculous, one-handed catch near the sideline as he was getting crushed by a defender. It was a reception that would've made Odell Beckham Jr. jealous. Evans hauled in 11 of his 17 targets for 150 yards and two touchdowns. It really helped that the Falcons lost Desmond Trufant to some sort of strange, non-contact injury in the second quarter.    Winston also threw touchdowns to Adam Humphries (5-46) and Cameron Brate (5-43). He was missing his new No. 2 receiver, Russell Shepard, who replaced Vincent Jackson a couple of weeks earlier.    Speaking of Tampa injuries, the top three running backs were injured, so Peyton Barner (11-31) and Antone Smith (5-25) shared the workload. Neither was particularly effective. Smith got hurt in the fourth quarter. It's unbelievable how many injuries to running backs this team has sustained.    I have to comment on how much of a relief it was to not have to listen to Phil Simms on a Thursday night. It did mean enduring the insufferable Bob Costas in the pre-game, but Simms is somehow worse. Hearing Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth was relieving, though I had to laugh whenever Michaels tried to pronounce Cecil Shorts. His best try was Sheshil Shortsh. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
