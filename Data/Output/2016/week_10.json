      "comments": [" The Ravens have assured themselves a share of first place in the AFC North with a victory over the Browns, but it's fair to say that we haven't learned anything about them. In fact, despite the three-touchdown victory, they were actually a bit underwhelming in this contest. Baltimore may have won 28-7, but the team trailed by a point in the third quarter. The offense was stagnant, but it seemed to start clicking all of a sudden. That's not really remarkable, however, given how poor Cleveland's defense has been this season. Every single team has scored at least 25 points against the Browns this season. This includes Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Jets (31) and Ryan Tannehill and the Dolphins (30). Cleveland has been especially poor in the second half of games, so it's not a surprise that the Ravens were able to dominate after intermission, especially when considering the immense coaching blunder Hue Jackson was guilty of, which I'll discuss later.    Joe Flacco finished 30-of-41 for 296 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. One of his picks was an overthrow toward Steve Smith, while the other was a horrible pass he telegraphed into the end zone while throwing late across his body, and Joe Haden read his eyes perfectly. Flacco, however, was nearly perfect otherwise following intermission, as his second-half numbers were 13-of-17 for 163 yards, three touchdowns and that pick. The offense went into a quick tempo, and Flacco's throws were mostly precise, though Cleveland's atrocious defense made things very easy for him.    While Flacco's three touchdowns all went to different players, they mostly had a common theme: An offensive lineman sustained an injury following two of his scores. Guard Alex Lewis had to be carted into the locker room, but X-rays were negative. Center Jeremy Zuttah was down on the field for a while after the next score, but he didn't miss a snap. Flacco's touchdowns went to Breshad Perriman (3-64), Steve Smith (5-60) and some guy named Darren Waller (2-14). Mike Wallace had a 23-yard spurt, but disappointed his fantasy owners overall, snatching just four balls for 59 yards.    I expected the Ravens to run the ball well against the Browns, but Terrance West managed just 65 yards on 21 carries versus his former team. Kenneth Dixon was much better, tallying 38 yards on six tries, with five of his six attempts coming in the second half. Dixon also caught five balls for 42 receiving yards. He needs to be used more down the stretch, as he's the best running back on the roster.    Moving on to the Browns, I've always defended Hue Jackson, as I liked what he accomplished in Oakland, and he had the Browns playing hard this year. What he did in this game proves that he doesn't have what it takes to be a head coach in the NFL. Rookie quarterback Cody Kessler had been playing somewhat well, as he stood 11-of-18 for 91 yards and a touchdown in slightly more than a half of action. His final snap in this contest occurred with a lead. The Ravens took over and managed to score a touchdown with a horrific non-call by incompetent official Jerome Boger on what should've been an intentional grounding on Flacco, who failed to get the ball past the line of scrimmage. The Ravens were leading only 13-7 at that point, and Cleveland was still well in the game. Considering that Kessler had not turned the ball over and wasn't performing poorly, no head coach with a clue would've benched him. But Jackson did. And the results were disastrous. Josh McCown's first drive featured an interception. His arm was hit by Terrell Suggs as he released the ball, but his throwing motion is slower than Kessler's. McCown's second possession featured a near-interception and then a fumble, which he was lucky to recover. On the third drive, McCown launched a careless interception into double coverage. He was guilty of a strip-sack on the fourth drive, as he showed zero awareness in the pocket. His fifth drive featured a tipped pass that was inches away from being a pick-six. McCown did not look ready to play, and the stats demonstrate it. He was 6-of-13 for 59 yards and two picks. He was infinitely worse than Kessler, and the Browns didn't have a chance to stay competitive with McCown under center. Again, it was a 13-7 contest when Jackson yanked a healthy Kessler. Perhaps Kessler would've been able to engineer some drives, and it's likely that he would've been more careful with the ball than McCown was. There's really no excuse for Jackson's abysmal decision-making, and if the Browns want to fire him as a result of this embarrassing performance, I couldn't blame them at all.    Only two Browns accumulated more than 25 receiving yards: Terrelle Pryor led the way with five grabs for 48 yards, while Isaiah Crowell caught three balls for 30 yards, though he did drop a pass. Corey Coleman, meanwhile, was a major disappointment, as he hauled in only three catches for 17 yards.    Speaking of Crowell, he didn't do much on the ground versus a stout run defense, tallying 23 yards on nine carries. Duke Johnson (2-6) was only a factor in the passing game, catching three passes for 25 receiving yards. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   "],
