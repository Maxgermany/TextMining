      "comments": [" Despite what the final score may say, this game looked like it would go Buffalo's way early on. The Bills led 10-6 at halftime, and the Texans' offense was having problems because Owen Daniels left with a knee sprain. Steve Slaton also fumbled again - his seventh of the year - forcing Gary Kubiak to bench him. Well, give the Texans credit for dominating the second half by a 25-0 margin. Ryan Moats, taking over for Slaton, came out of nowhere to rush for 126 yards and three touchdowns. Making things worse for Slaton owners, Moats easily converted multiple goal-line attempts.    With Slaton benched and Daniels out, it's surprising that Houston's receivers didn't step up with big numbers. Andre Johnson caught six balls for 63 yards, while Kevin Walter had four grabs for 29 yards.    Matt Schaub finished the game well; he went 10-of-12 for 129 yards in the second half, thanks in part to Aaron Schobel leaving the game with an injury. Overall, Schaub was 25-of-34 for 268 yards and two picks, but the big news here is that Jairus Byrd caught both interceptions. As a mere rookie, Byrd has seven picks.    Speaking of picks, Ryan Fitzpatrick also had a pair, finishing 15-of-23 for 117 yards. Fitzpatrick led the Bills to just nine first downs and was 2-of-10 on third-down conversions.    The only touchdown the Bills scored was a 29-yard end-around by Terrell Owens, helped by a great Lee Evans block. Owens finished with five grabs for 39 yards, while Evans caught two balls for 29 yards.    Houston's run defense continues to shine. The Texans struggled against the rush early in the year, but they've shut down the likes of Frank Gore and Cedric Benson recently. Marshawn Lynch and Fred Jackson had nine carries each for 43 and 28 yards, respectively.    Congratulations to the Texans, who are now 5-3. This looked like a trap game, but Houston overcame an early deficit to win. This is the first time in the Texans' franchise history that they're two games over .500 (outside of a 2-0 start in 2007). It's also the first time ever that they've won a contest when favored on the road. Unfortunately, this victory for Houston comes with some unfortunate news. Daniels will be out for the rest of the year with what seems to be a torn ACL.   "],
