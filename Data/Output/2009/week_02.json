   "comments":" Even if you're a Bears, Packers or Vikings fan, it's hard not to feel sorry for the Lions. Despite what the final score may say, this game was very close for 3 quarters, and Detroit even dominated the first half. The Lions had 11 of the initial 14 first downs, and were outgaining the Vikings in yardage, 150-113, at halftime. Unfortunately, an NFL game is 60 minutes. Matthew Stafford tossed 2 picks - 1 late over the middle - and the Lions forgot how to tackle on an Adrian Peterson 27-yard touchdown run.    Stafford finished 18-of-30 for 152 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had 5 grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching 4 balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out. Unfortunately, Detroit could not contain Peterson, who rushed for 92 yards and a score on just 15 carries. Of course, 1 has to wonder why Peterson got only 15 carries.    Two games and 2 touchdowns for Percy Harvin. Harvin caught 5 balls for 41 yards and the score. Bernard Berrian grabbed 6 balls for 46 yards.   ",

One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had 5 grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching 4 balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out. Unfortunately, Detroit could not contain Peterson, who rushed for 92 yards and a score on just 15 carries. Of course, 1 has to wonder why Peterson got only 15 carries.

   "comments":" This was an insane game in which a bunch of crazy things happened: - The Packers, down 7 with less than a minute remaining, recovered an onside kick. Aaron Rodgers (21-of-39, 261 yards, TD) drove the Packers down to Cincinnati's 10-yard line. Fortunately for the sanity of all Bengals fans, Green Bay ran out of time; Jermichael Finley (4 catches, 56 yards) committed a false start penalty with less than 10 seconds left. By rule, the game concluded with a 10-second runoff. - Bengals defensive end Antwan Odom had FIVE sacks. Packers left tackle Chad Clifton suffered an injury and had to go into the locker room for X-rays for his ankle. Right tackle Allen Barbre, meanwhile, was just as horrible as he was Sunday night. In total, Aaron Rodgers was sacked 6 times. - Cedric Benson (29 carries, 141 yards) gained 4.9 yards per rush! Yes - CEDRIC BENSON gained 4.9 yards per rush! - Chad Ochocinco (4 catches, 91 yards) caught a touchdown in the second half. Ochocinco kept his word and made a Lambeau Leap. However, there's a bit of an asterisk there, as Ochocinco leaped into the arms of 3 Cincinnati fans sitting in the front row. Scott Hanson of the NFL Red Zone called it the Bengal Bounce. - Believe it or not, the Bengals converted a 3rd-and-34 in this contest. Carson Palmer (15-of-23, 185 yards, 3 TDs, 2 INTs) passed to Daniel Coats for 25 yards. Coats fumbled the ball, which was picked up by Laveranues Coles, who gained the extra yardage.    Other notes: - Ryan Grant gained 46 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries. Cincinnati's defense is for real. - Donald Driver made a couple of impressive catches on Green Bay's final drives. He finished with 6 grabs for 99 yards and a score. - Greg Jennings failed to catch a single ball. He was targeted 5 times. - Chris Henry scored a touchdown, but it was his only reception (5 yards). He was targeted thrice. - Laveranues Coles was also targeted 3 times. He came up with 2 grabs for 9 yards and a touchdown.   ",

   "comments":" I'm not even going to talk about the Jaguars except for this - I've never seen a more lazy, slow and sluggish team this early in the year in my 10 years covering the NFL for this Web site. Jacksonville has already given up. I'll have more on this tomorrow.    Quick Jacksonville stats: David Garrard was 23-of-43 for 282 yards, 2 touchdowns, (most of that late in the game) a pick and 3 fumbles. Torry Holt had 6 catches for 65 yards. Mike Sims-Walker collected 6 receptions for 106 yards and a score. Maurice Jones-Drew managed 66 yards on just 13 carries (WTF?) and 4 catches for 17 more yards.    Now let's discuss a real team that actually showed up to play. Kurt Warner set an NFL record for completion percentage in game, going 24-of-26 for 243 yards and 2 scores. Warner looked like he was 50 years old last week, but he seemed rejuvenated on Sunday, though it should be noted that his longest completion was only 22 yards. It's amazing what playing a quitting team can do for you.    Chris Wells ran well in this game - 7 carries for 44 yards - but he fumbled twice and wasn't given the ball much late in the contest. Tim Hightower stole his touches, gaining 72 yards and a score on 15 attempts.    Anquan Boldin and Steve Breaston, who did nothing last week because of injuries, are finally healthy again. Boldin had 8 catches for 69 yards. Breaston managed 5 receptions for 83 yards. Larry Fitzgerald was the only wideout who caught a touchdown (4 catches, 34 yards). <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

      "comment":"Warner set an NFL record for completion percentage in game, going 24-of-26 for 243 yards and 2 scores. Warner looked like he was 50 years old last week, but he seemed rejuvenated on Sunday, though it should be noted that his longest completion was only 22 yards. It's amazing what playing a quitting team can do for you.    Chris Wells ran well in this game - 7 carries for 44 yards - but he fumbled twice and wasn't given the ball much late in the contest. "

   "comments":" The Raiders won, so I shouldn't criticize them too much. Actually... nah, I'll criticize. After all, Kansas City crushed Oakland in terms of yardage, 409-166. - I don't know why the Raiders aren't giving the ball to Michael Bush. Bush is easily the team's best runner, yet he had just 9 carries for 35 yards. Bush didn't even get his first attempt until 3 minutes into the second quarter. When Bush got the ball, he rushed 4 times for 14 yards and caught a 17-yard pass on 1 drive. The Raiders, as you might expect, scored their first points of the day (48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal) on that possession. - Until the last minutes of the contest, JaMarcus Russell was terrible. Before the final drive, he was 3-of-17 for 42 yards. Oakland fans must have celebrated when he notched his 4.h completion, but they were even more gleeful when he inexplicably led Oakland to a game-winning touchdown. Russell was 4-of-7 for 67 yards on the final sequence. - Darrius Heyward-Bey caught the first pass of his career, which was an 18-yarder. However, Heyward-Bey was targeted 6 times. It seemed like Russell was trying too hard to force him the ball. Coincidentally, the Raiders scored the winning touchdown after Heyward-Bey left the game with an injury.    If I'm to criticize the Raiders, I have to do the same to the Chiefs: - The Chiefs wasted 2 timeouts early in the first half. Late in the second quarter, Cassel threw a short pass (shocker) to a receiver who couldn't get out of bounds deep in Oakland territory. The Chiefs didn't have a timeout, so they couldn't stop the clock and the half expired. - Matt Cassel was 24-of-39 for 241 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 picks. Cassel began the game 11-of-20 for 75 yards (a YPA of less than 4). He opened things up in the second half, but that's when he tossed both interceptions.    I will give Todd Haley credit for being aggressive. In the first quarter, he went for it on 4.h down and attempted an onside kick a few minutes later. Unfortunately, it's tough to be too aggressive with a quarterback with no arm strength.    Larry Johnson had a lackluster day versus Oakland's stout front 7. gaining 78 yards on 24 carries.    Bobby Wade actually led the Chiefs wideouts in receptions with 6 for 72 yards. Dwayne Bowe had 5 catches for 56 yards and a touchdown. Bowe's 29-yard score came when Nnamdi Asomugha was out of the game with dehydration.   ",

   "comments":" The Jets talked all week, but the important thing is they backed it up. They didn't quite embarrass the Patriots, but they beat them up pretty soundly. Tom Brady didn't look right all game. He was constantly pressured and was frequently off-target on downfield shots. He also looked very uncomfortable and hesitant. Brady was an anemic 8-of-20 for 66 yards in the second half. It was so bad that Julian Edelman led the team in receptions. Edelman, playing in the slot in place of an injured Wes Welker, had 8 catches for 98 yards. Even Joey Galloway (5 catches for 53 yards) out-produced Randy Moss. Moss caught 4 balls for 24 yards, as he was completely shut down by Darrelle Revis. Aside from Nnamdi Asomugha, it's very clear that Revis is the top corner in the NFL.    Mark Sanchez didn't have pretty stats - he was 14-of-22 for 163 yards and a touchdown - but he once again did a great job moving the chains and avoiding turnovers. Sanchez was at his best when it counted; he was 11-of-17 for 148 yards and the score in the second half. Sanchez nearly had a second touchdown twice; Chansi Stuckey caught the ball with a foot out of bounds and then slipped a few plays later.    The Jets' skill-position players had equal touches. Leon Washington and Thomas Jones had 14 carries each for 58 and 54 yards, respectively. Washington will continue to take more of Jones' work. Meanwhile, both Jerricho Cotchery and Chansi Stuckey caught 4 balls for 87 and 37 yards.   ",

   "comments":" During the pre-game player introductions, Sheldon Brown came out of the tunnel wearing a Michael Myers mask. I don't think Brown expected that his own team would be murdered that afternoon.    The Eagles could not contain Drew Brees, and I'm not sure anyone can. Brees was 25-of-34 for 311 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick. Brees is now on pace to throw 72 touchdowns, which would beat Tom Brady's record by only 22.    Marques Colston dominated Philadelphia's secondary, catching 8 passes for 98 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jeremy Shockey chipped in with 4 grabs for 49 yards. Devery Henderson hauled in 3 balls for 71 yards. Unfortunately for Lance Moore owners, their guy didn't log a single catch.    Pierre Thomas was active, but didn't really do much. The Frenchman caught 1 pass for a loss of 4 yards. He didn't carry the ball at all. Instead, Mike Bell garnered 86 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts.    The big story going into this game was Donovan McNabb's rib injury. Kevin Kolb started and threw for 391 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a beautiful 71-yard bomb to DeSean Jackson. Unfortunately, he also tossed an ugly pick (he should have had more that were dropped) and took untimely sacks. He had 2 interceptions later in the game when the Saints up big. The Eagles didn't need a quarterback 3 years ago, so it's now apparent that their No. 1 selection in 2007 was an epic fail on all levels. It could be Jeff Garcia time in Week 3.    With a backup quarterback at the helm, Andy Reid did a poor job not getting the ball into the hands of Brian Westbrook. Westbrook had just 17 touches (52 rush yards, 14 receiving yards) out of 75 plays.    Jackson had the long touchdown and finished with 101 yards on 4 receptions, but he wasn't the Eagles' leading receiver. That was Brent Celek, who hauled in 8 grabs for 104 yards. Jason Avant, meanwhile, notched 7 catches for 79 yards and a score.    Sean Payton is now 9-2 against Andy Reid when he's coaching a winning team. <div class=dfpAdSlots>   ",

   "comments":" What a difference a week makes. Last Sunday, the Texans couldn't score a single offensive touchdown. This Sunday, they hung 34 on Tennessee's supposed great defense.    Matt Schaub was terrific, going 25-of-39 for 357 yards and 4 touchdowns. He did a great job moving the chains and helping the Texans win the time-of-possession battle by 9 minutes.    Andre Johnson, shut down by Darrelle Revis last week, exploded against the Titans, catching 10 balls for 149 yards and 2 touchdowns. In the past 2 seasons, the Texans are now 8-2 when Johnson accumulates at least 75 yards.    The only offensive blemish for the Titans was their inability to run the ball. Steve Slaton had at least 100 rushing yards in both meetings against Tennessee last year, but managed only 34 yards on 17 carries on Sunday.    Of course, a huge blemish for Houston was its defense, which gave up 3 huge plays to Chris Johnson early in the game. Johnson had scores of 57, 69 and 91 yards. The Texans looked like they had only 6 men on the field on the first 1. Johnson was uncovered when he was split out wide on the second. And the last was a long burst from Tennessee's 9 on a 3rd-and-10. Johnson finished with 197 rushing yards and 87 receiving yards, destroying all of his fantasy opposers.    Kerry Collins was an economical 21-of-33 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Nate Washington was his leading receiver with 4 catches for 36 yards and a score. Justin Gage and Kenny Britt caught 2 balls each.    There was a fight in this game in the 4.h quarter. On a Slaton run, 1 of the Texans ripped off Keith Bulluck's helmet. When players from both teams started pushing each other around, it looked like Bulluck spit on 1 of the Texans who was on the ground. There was a huge brawl on the sidelines, but both teams were given offsetting penalties. Jason Jones was kicked out of the game. I made a note during this fight: Even if the Texans lose, give them credit for showing grit and toughness on the road. Well, the Texans deserve major credit. Now they just have to get over the Indianapolis hump. The Titans, meanwhile, are 0-2. Once again, they could not get any pressure up the middle with their front 4. Albert Haynesworth is very missed.   ",

      "comment":"Slaton had at least 100 rushing yards in both meetings against Tennessee last year, but managed only 34 yards on 17 carries on Sunday.    Of course, a huge blemish for Houston was its defense, which gave up 3 huge plays to Chris Johnson early in the game. Johnson had scores of 57, 69 and 91 yards. The Texans looked like they had only 6 men on the field on the first 1. Johnson was uncovered when he was split out wide on the second. And the last was a long burst from Tennessee's 9 on a 3rd-and-10. Johnson finished with 197 rushing yards and 87 receiving yards, destroying all of his fantasy opposers.    Kerry Collins was an economical 21-of-33 for 216 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Nate Washington was his leading receiver with 4 catches for 36 yards and a score. Justin Gage and Kenny Britt caught 2 balls each.    There was a fight in this game in the 4.h quarter. On a Slaton run, 1 of the Texans ripped off Keith Bulluck's helmet."

   "comments":" The reason I didn't have the Redskins making the playoffs is because I don't trust them. Last year, they lost at home to a winless Rams team after 2 tough road victories. They once again didn't show up for this matchup, but at least they won this time.    Just as I don't trust the Redskins, the Redskins don't trust Jason Campbell (23-of-35, 242 yards). Jim Zorn once again took the ball out of Campbell's hands when it mattered most. For example, on 1 red-zone trip, Clinton Portis ran left guard for a loss and up the middle for no gain. On third down, Portis was given the ball and he threw an incompletion to Chris Cooley. Washington has yet to score 30 points under Zorn, and it's not hard to see why.    Zorn almost made a huge gaff in this game. Up 9-7 with 2 minutes remaining in regulation, Zorn went for it on 4th-and-1 on the St. Louis 5, eschewing a field goal. The Redskins failed, so all the Rams needed was a field goal to win. Fortunately for Washington, Marc Bulger couldn't convert a single first down.    Campbell needs to get the ball more to Santana Moss. Moss once again had a lackluster performance, catching just 3 balls for 35 yards. Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.    Two guys who didn't disappoint were Steven Jackson and Laurent Robinson. The former mustered 104 yards on 17 rushes, while the latter hauled in 6 balls for 54 yards and a touchdown.    Marc Bulger was a horrific 15-of-28 for 125 yards and a score, giving him a YPA of 4.5. There is no doubt that Bulger's starting days in the NFL are numbered.    Donnie Avery disappointed with 1 catch for 4 yards. It might be time to consider Robinson as the better fantasy option.   ",

      "comment":"Cooley. Washington has yet to score 30 points under Zorn, and it's not hard to see why.    Zorn almost made a huge gaff in this game. Up 9-7 with 2 minutes remaining in regulation, Zorn went for it on 4th-and-1 on the St. Louis 5, eschewing a field goal. The Redskins failed, so all the Rams needed was a field goal to win. Fortunately for Washington, Marc Bulger couldn't convert a single first down.    Campbell needs to get the ball more to Santana Moss. Moss once again had a lackluster performance, catching just 3 balls for 35 yards. Chris Cooley led the team with 7 receptions for 83 yards.    Clinton Portis ran well, gaining 79 yards on 19 carries. However, fantasy owners were expecting a lot more. There's no reason Portis should have received less than 25 attempts in this game. This was yet another of Zorn's errors.

   "comments":" This was billed as the Battle of the Teams That Fired Their Offensive Coordinators a Week Before the Season. Catchy title, I know. While the Bills have looked solid in 2 games, the Buccaneers have done a great job embarrassing themselves for the past 120 minutes.    There is no reason Byron Sandwich should be a starter in this league. Luke McCown out-performed Sandwich in the preseason (despite lesser stats), and now the Buccaneers are paying the price. Sandwich's numbers look nice (26-of-50, 296 yards, 3 TDs), but a lot of that was junk yardage late in the game. He tossed 2 ugly interceptions, including a pick-six while he was falling down to Donte Whitner.    With Antonio Bryant, Sandwich's favorite target was Kellen Winslow, who had 7 catches for 90 yards and a touchdown. Michael Clayton had just 2 receptions for 27 yards.    The Buccaneers couldn't run the ball because they were down early (get used to it, Tampa fans). Derrick Ward had 9 attempts for 32 yards, while Cadillac Williams gained only 9 yards on 7 rushes. Cadillac - not Ward - contributed with 7 receptions for 56 yards and a score.    Fred Jackson is a stud. He rushed for 163 yards on 28 carries against Tampa Bay's anemic defense. At this point, it would be a huge error on Dick Jauron's part to give Marshawn Lynch the starting job once he returns from his suspension.    Trent Edwards picked up where Tony Romo left off as he torched the Bucs' secondary, going 21-of-31 for 230 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick.    Amazingly, Edwards completed more passes to Derek Schouman than he did to Lee Evans and Terrell Owens combined. Schouman had 6 grabs for 62 yards; Owens hauled in 3 balls for 52 yards and a score; and Lee Evans had only a 32-yard touchdown. Owens was shut out early because he dropped a long bomb, but came back to score on a 43-yard reception.   ",

   "comments":" It's hard to believe, but the 49ers are alone atop of the NFC West. An outside observer may look at this and attribute San Francisco's victory to Matt Hasselbeck's injury, but San Francisco actually led 13-3 before he left the game. Speaking of Hasselbeck, he took a similar shot to the ribs that knocked Donovan McNabb out last week. Hasselbeck could be out a few games if he hurt his lower ribs.    But sticking with the 49ers, there was a great example of Mike Singletary ball in the second half. Singletary is all about pounding the rock, controlling the clock and playing tough defense. Beginning with 1:20 remaining in the third quarter, the 49ers maintained possession until the 6:58 mark of the 4.h quarter, as the drive concluded with a Joe Nedney field goal. San Francisco won the time-of-possession battle by 9 minutes.    The star for the 49ers was Frank Gore, who looked like he was going to break Adrian Peterson's single-game rushing record. Gore had 206 rushing yards just 12 seconds into the third quarter. Unfortunately, he carried the ball only 4 more times after that, as he left the contest with a minor injury.    Another efficient day for Shaun Hill, who was 19-of-26 for 144 yards. Hill once again did a great job moving the chains when necessary.    Because the 49ers are running such a conservative offense, their receivers aren't doing anything. Gore was the team's leading receiver with 5 catches for 39 yards. Isaac Bruce led the wideouts with 4 grabs for 35 yards. Josh Morgan failed to catch a single pass.    Julius Jones was an epic failure on the ground, rushing for just 11 yards on 8 carries. It's too bad Jones can't play the Rams every week. Meanwhile, Justin Forsett rushed for 35 yards on 5 attempts. Forsett is probably the better all-around running back even though he can't break a single tackle. Forsett chipped in with 6 receptions for 57 more yards.    T.J. Houshmandzadeh caught 4 balls for 62 yards. John Carlson had 6 grabs for 46 yards. Seattle's aerial attack was pretty much non-existent when the Backdoor Bandit took over.   ",

   "comments":" Jay Cutler deserves a ton of credit. A week after carelessly launching interceptions late across the middle of the field, Cutler was sharp and accurate against arguably the top defense in the league. Cutler went 27-of-38 for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns.    Amazingly, Cutler's top receiver wasn't Greg Olsen (3 catches, 41 yards), Earl Bennett (2-22) or Devin Hester (4-21). It was rookie Johnny Knox, who hauled in 6 grabs for 70 yards and a score. Knox was responsible for an interception last week, but he more than made up for that in this contest. On a team with no true No. 1 wideout, Knox could be emerging as that guy.    Matt Forte couldn't get anything against Pittsburgh's vaunted defense. Forte rushed for only 29 yards on 13 carries. Forte also chipped in with 5 receptions for 33 more yards. He'll play well when he's not going against a top-ranked stop unit.    Ben Roethlisberger was his usual self, going 23-of-35 for 221 yards, a score and a pick. Roethlisberger went to Santonio Holmes 5 times (83 yards) and Hines Ward 6 times (57 yards). Holmes had a key touchdown drop on Pittsburgh's final drive.    The Steelers once again couldn't run the ball. Willie Parker gained just 47 yards on 14 attempts. Rashard Mendenhall had a 39-yard rush, but didn't do anything outside of that. Mewelde Moore, meanwhile, was once again the man on third downs and in the 4.h quarter. Moore had 5 touches for 28 yards.    While the hero of this game was Cutler, the goat was clearly Jeff Reed. Reed missed 2 4.h-quarter field goals from 38 and 43 yards. When Robbie Gould knocked in the game-winner on Chicago's final drive, Reed seemed to be in tears on the sideline. I'm sure he wasn't crying, but it certainly looked like he was. Maybe it was the rain, right Jeff?   ",

   "comments":" Another loss and another game without an offensive touchdown for Cleveland. The Browns' 27-6 defeat at the hands of Denver marked the 7.h time in 8 contests that they've failed to score an offensive touchdown. This stat is probably more embarrassing than Detroit's 19-game losing streak.    I said last week that it might be time for the Brady Quinn era to come to an end. Well, I'm going to say it again, only this time without the might. Quinn is awful; he's a turnover machine (1 interception, 1 fumble) and he refuses to take any downfield shots. Furthermore, he led Cleveland to just 11 first downs. Derek Anderson is the better option despite his accuracy issues.    Braylon Edwards was the lone bright spot for Cleveland's offense, catching 6 balls for 92 yards. Jamal Lewis, meanwhile, mustered 38 yards on 14 carries. James Davis will have to be the starter once he's healthy again.    Kyle Orton is now 2-0, but he was brutally mediocre once again. Orton went 19-of-37 for 263 yards and a touchdown. All of his yardage came via the receivers after the catch.    Of course, Orton didn't really need to throw at all because the Browns couldn't stop the run. Correll Buckhalter rushed for 76 yards on 9 carries, including a 45-yard score in which Denver's offensive line blew open an enormous hole. Meanwhile, Knowshon Moreno collected 75 yards on 17 rushes and 22 more yards on 2 receptions. He'll continue to gain more work as we go on.    Brandon Stokley led the Broncos with 5 receptions for 70 yards. Jabar Gaffney (82 yards), Brandon Marshall (34) and Eddie Royal (20) all hauled in 3 catches.   ",

   "comments":" I've had the Ravens No. 2 in my <b> </b> for a few weeks now, and they didn't disappoint me with a victory here. Baltimore is 1 of the most underrated teams in the league because most casual football fans don't understand how potent their offense is. The Ravens went stride for stride with the high-flying Chargers, beating them in first downs, 22-20.    Joe Flacco wasn't great, but he was very solid, going 17-of-26 for 190 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. The interception wasn't his fault; a Chargers defender was offside and caused Flacco's pass to be errant. The official missed the call.    A frustrating day for Ray Rice owners. Rice rushed for 36 yards on 8 carries and chipped in with 5 receptions for 46 yards. The yardage wasn't bad, but Rice once again relinquished goal-line opportunities to Willis McGahee. McGahee gained 79 yards on 15 rushes and scored twice. Rice is the more talented player, but it's hard to argue with a team that's winning.    Kelley Washington was Baltimore's leading receiver with 4 catches for 58 yards and a touchdown. Derrick Mason had just 3 receptions for 31 yards. Mark Clayton did nothing (1 20-yard catch).    Despite not having LaDainian Tomlinson and a couple of his offensive linemen, Philip Rivers was brilliant, going 25-of-45 for 436 yards, 2 touchdowns and a pair of picks against Baltimore's prolific defense. Rivers did a great job shaking off the rust he had against Oakland.    Rivers' favorite target was Vincent Jackson, who snatched 6 balls for 141 yards and a touchdown. Chris Chambers did nothing again (2 rec., 30 yards).    Though the point total and the net yardage says otherwise, the Chargers really missed LaDainian Tomlinson. They had to kick field goals every time they reached the red zone because they couldn't run the ball. Sproles is a terrific weapon out of the backfield (7 catches, 124 receiving yards, TD) but he's a very poor inside runner. Sproles managed just 26 yards on 10 carries.   ",
