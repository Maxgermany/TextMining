      "comments": [" Even if you're a Bears, Packers or Vikings fan, it's hard not to feel sorry for the Lions. Despite what the final score may say, this game was very close for three quarters, and Detroit even dominated the first half. The Lions had 11 of the initial 14 first downs, and were outgaining the Vikings in yardage, 150-113, at halftime. Unfortunately, an NFL game is 60 minutes. Matthew Stafford tossed two picks - one late over the middle - and the Lions forgot how to tackle on an Adrian Peterson 27-yard touchdown run.    Stafford finished 18-of-30 for 152 yards, one touchdown and two picks. One of the interceptions came late when Stafford was trying to make a play, so it's hard to fault him for that. Stafford made some nice throws, so even though he played poorly late in the game, Lions fans should be encouraged.    Detroit was able to outgain the Vikings early by involving Kevin Smith and Calvin Johnson as much as possible. Smith touched the ball 26 times out of 66 plays (83 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards). Megatron, meanwhile, had five grabs for 51 yards and a touchdown.    Brandon Pettigrew also took part in the passing game, catching four balls for 40 yards.    Brett Favre's numbers look pretty, but it was hard to be impressed watching this game. Favre was 23-of-27 for 155 yards and two touchdowns. His YPA is 5.7, and that doesn't even tell the entire story. Favre should have thrown multiple interceptions. He launched what looked like a punt toward his target in the third quarter. If Anthony Henry had turned around, he would have caught an easy pick. A few plays later, Favre lollipopped the ball downfield and nearly tossed another interception. He also took too many sacks early on.    Favre has played the Lions and Browns thus far. Things are going to get a lot uglier when the opposing defense can actually take the run away and Adrian Peterson can't bail him out. Unfortunately, Detroit could not contain Peterson, who rushed for 92 yards and a score on just 15 carries. Of course, one has to wonder why Peterson got only 15 carries.    Two games and two touchdowns for Percy Harvin. Harvin caught five balls for 41 yards and the score. Bernard Berrian grabbed six balls for 46 yards.   "],
