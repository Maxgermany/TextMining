      "comments": [" Wow, the Cowboys are awesome! They're finally living up to expectations in December! They've finally turned it around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, OK. Last year, coincidentally in Week 15, the Cowboys triumphed in a game they weren't expected to win. They beat New York, 20-8, dominating both sides of the line of scrimmage, as Tony Romo was 20-of-30 for 244 yards and two touchdowns. Back then, everyone said the Cowboys had finally gotten over the hump. Even I was fooled. Dallas went on to lose their last two games by a combined score of 77-30. We all have a short memory. Anyone who thinks that the Cowboys have gotten over their annual December swoon is mistaken, or at least very premature in that judgment. I still say Dallas loses to Washington and Philadelphia to close out the year. Call me a hater or whatever, but I'm just calling it like I see it.    I will give credit where credit is due though, and Romo played extremely well. He was 22-of-34 for 312 yards and a touchdown. He didn't throw a pick, though Roman Harper dropped a possible interception.    Miles Austin-Jones made New Orleans' secondary look silly. He caught seven balls for 139 yards and a score. Jason Witten (5 catches, 44 yards) and Roy Williams (1-14) weren't as impressive.    Sedrick Ellis' absence was huge; without their dominant defensive tackle, the Saints could not stop Dallas' ground attack, as Marion Barber (17 carries, 62 yards, 2 TDs) and Felix Jones (14-58) ran right through New Orleans' front.    One huge area of concern for the Cowboys: With an opportunity to ice the game with a 24-yard field goal, the struggling Nick Folk bounced the ball off the right upright. That was Folk's league-leading 10th missed kick of the year.    The big story for the Saints - aside from them actually losing a game - was how poorly the offensive line played. Drew Brees was sacked four times, marking only the second time he took more than two sacks all year. DeMarcus Ware, playing just six days after suffering a very scary neck strain, made left tackle Jermon Bushrod look like a helpless child.    Some other uncharacteristic Saints numbers: - They had just one third-down conversion the entire game. They were 1-of-7 on third downs (compared to Dallas' 8-of-15). - They ran the ball just 11 times. The team's leading rusher was Reggie Bush, whose only carry went for 29 yards. - The first catch by a New Orleans wideout came at the 9:43 mark of the second quarter. - The Cowboys won the time-of-possession battle by 13 minutes.    With pressure in his face all night, Brees went 29-of-45 for 298 yards, one touchdown, an interception and two fumbles.    Despite Brees' struggles, four of his targets caught five or more passes: Marques Colston (86 yards), David Thomas (77), Pierre Thomas (50) and Robert Meachem (43). Lance Moore vultured away Brees' sole score on a receiver screen to the chagrin of Colston and Meachem owners everywhere.   "],
