      "comments": [" Two weeks ago, the Cardinals went on the road and beat the Giants. After that, they lost as massive favorites to the Panthers. Now, they once again traveled to a hostile environment and crushed the opposition. Good to see that Arizona solidified itself as the most schizophrenic team in the NFL.    Speaking of schizophrenic, one week after tossing five interceptions, Kurt Warner launched five touchdowns against Chicago's skeleton-crew defense. Warner finished 22-of-32 for 261 yards. Of course, things came pretty easy for Arizona's offense. Bears defensive tackle Tommie Harris punched Deuce Lutui a few plays into the game when the Arizona lineman was on the ground. Harris was promptly ejected. From then on, Chicago couldn't stop Arizona at all; the first time the Cardinals failed on third down was at the 7:50 mark of the third quarter. Believe it or not, this game was so out of hand that Matt Leinart replaced Warner. Leinart's only attempt was an interception. Warner replaced Leinart right after that.    With Anquan Boldin out, Larry Fitzgerald had a monstrous game, catching nine passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns. Steve Breaston chipped in with five grabs for 66 yards and a score.    The big thing for Arizona here is that the team was able to establish a great rushing attack. I know Harris was out, but the Cardinals often struggle to run the football against everyone. Tim Hightower and Chris Wells had similar numbers, combining for 18 carries and 149 rushing yards.    The Bears, meanwhile, couldn't do anything on the ground, though they ever had the opportunity. The Cardinals jumped out to a huge lead, so Matt Forte received just five carries (three in the first half) and turned them into 33 yards. Luckily for his fantasy owners, Forte also caught six balls for 74 more yards.    Jay Cutler obviously did all of the work and played fairly well, going 29-of-47 for 369 yards, three touchdowns and a pick. Cutler's offensive line once again let him down; he was sacked four times.    Cutler went to Earl Bennett most often, connecting with his former college teammate seven times for 93 yards (most of which came in junk time). Devin Hester had six legitimate catches for 94 yards. Greg Olsen, meanwhile, had all of Cutler's touchdowns, finishing with five receptions for 71 yards.   "],
