      "comments": [" Where did this come from? Where was the crappy quarterback we saw against the Eagles? Chris Redman, who was completely awful last year, somehow stole Matt Ryan's talents to go 23-of-34, 303 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Most of Redman's completions were of the dink-and-dunk variety, but he hit enough big plays to keep the Falcons in the game, including a 50-yard touchdown bomb to Michael Jenkins. I guess this reinforces the notion that you can never underestimate a fierce rivalry. This Falcons squad barely beat the Buccaneers and was crushed by the Eagles. With Redman under center, they shouldn't have been within 10 points of the Saints just based on talent. Instead, Atlanta actually out-gained New Orleans, 392-391.    Because most of Redman's attempts were short, neither Tony Gonzalez nor Roddy White managed much; Gonzalez had six catches for 50 yards, while White collected two receptions for 41 yards.    With no Michael Turner, Jason Snelling (10 carries, 37 yards) and Jerious Norwood (9-33) pretty much split carries. Helping his fantasy owners out, Snelling also caught four balls for 65 yards, including a 38-yard gain.    Drew Brees was brilliant once again, going 31-of-40 for 296 yards and three touchdowns. He absolutely torched the Falcons whenever they blitzed, and Atlanta forced the Saints into only one punt. The only other time New Orleans didn't score on a drive was when it attempted a dumb fake field goal up three with two minutes remaining in regulation.    Three Saints tied the team lead with six receptions: Marques Colston (54 yards, TD), Pierre Thomas (53) and Reggie Bush (46, 2 TDs). Robert Meachem and Jeremy Shockey also chipped in with four grabs for 57 and 46 yards, respectively.    With Mike Bell out, Thomas had the majority of the carries, but mustered only 47 yards on 13 attempts.   "],
