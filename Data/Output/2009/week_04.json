      "comments": [" Poor Browns. After scoring only one touchdown since November 2008, they were finally able to get on the board. Overcoming a 14-0 lead, they managed to hold a 20-14 advantage until Carson Palmer threw a game-tying touchdown to Chad Ochocinco with two minutes remaining (the extra point was blocked). The Bengals subsequently won with three seconds remaining in overtime.    This was a weird game. If Donovan McNabb were watching, he may have thought that the Browns and Bengals would take about 100 overtime periods to score; neither offense could anything. Earlier, Shaun Rogers managed to block two kicks: a field goal and an extra point to send it to overtime. And even earlier, it appeared as though Cleveland always had the ball. Starting on the last play of the first quarter, the Browns held possession for 17.5 of the next 27.5 minutes.    As you can probably surmise, Derek Anderson did a great job moving the chains in those two quarters. He was 26-of-48 for 269 yards, one touchdown and a pick. Anderson made a stupid throw into the end zone which resulted in an interception, but it was very evident that Cleveland's offense was actually a threat with him under center. He needs to be the starting quarterback going forward.    As great as Anderson played, it's hard to believe that Braylon Edwards failed to log a single reception. He did drop a pass, but it was refreshing to see some other Browns step up. Mohamed Massaquoi somehow caught eight balls for 148 yards. Steve Heiden and Jerome Harrison both snatched five receptions. Mike Furrey had four catches for 37 yards. Unfortunately, Kellen Winslow Jr.'s replacement, Robert Royal, had a pass hit him right on the helmet on Cleveland's final drive of regulation that would have given the team a huge first down.    Speaking of Jerome Harrison, Cleveland's new starting running back had 121 yards on 29 carries. He'll share time when Jamal Lewis comes back, but it's good to know that Cleveland has a viable option with James Davis on IR.    Carson Palmer wasn't on the field much in regulation, but thanks to overtime, he was able to pad his stats. He was 23-of-44 for 230 yards, two touchdowns and a pick. Palmer's best play was a clutch 15-yard scramble on fourth down in overtime that put Shayne Graham in position for the game-winning field goal.    Chad Ochocinco caught only three passes for 24 yards, but he hauled in both of Palmer's touchdowns. Meanwhile, Chris Henry, Andre Caldwell and Laveranues Coles all had two receptions.    Cedric Benson rushed for 74 yards on 18 carries. Again, Benson wasn't able to get many touches because the Browns controlled the clock for most of regulation.   "],
