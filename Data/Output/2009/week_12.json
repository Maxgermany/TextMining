      "comments": [" Things looked a bit grim for the Cowboys early on. Their run defense was being gashed by Justin Fargas. When they were on offense, they hit three big plays but immediately suffered penalties afterward (two holdings; one false start). Fortunately, Dallas was playing an inept Oakland team that couldn't consistently sustain drives. The Raiders didn't even cross midfield until there were nine minutes remaining in the third quarter. Laughably, an Oakland receiver didn't catch a pass until there were four seconds left in the first half.    Speaking of the Raider wideouts, Darrius Heyward-Bey somehow caught two passes for 21 yards and his first career touchdown. If Heyward-Bey didn't drop a pass early in the game, Al Davis would probably be planning a parade right now.    Bruce Gradkowski went 18-of-35 for only 200 yards and that score, but didn't turn the ball over, making him better than JaMarcus Russell. However, he had one throw on a long out where he weakly lofted a ball that was nearly picked off. That pass pretty much exemplified why Gradkowski is a career backup in this league. He has zero arm strength.    The aforementioned Fargas ran for 63 yards on 12 carries. He was very effective early in the contest, and one has to wonder why the Raiders wasted their time with Darren McFadden (6 rushes, 23 yards) and Michael Bush (3-8).    Meanwhile, everyone on the Cowboys ran pretty well. Marion Barber gained 61 yards on 14 carries. Felix Jones managed 68 yards on seven attempts, including a 46-yard touchdown. Tashard Choice ran thrice out of the Wildcat for 67 yards (one run for 66 yards).    Tony Romo was pretty accurate on all of his throws, going 18-of-29 for 309 yards and two touchdowns. There was no indication that he was struggling with the back injury he labored through last week.    Miles Austin-Jones torched Chris Johnson, catching seven balls for 145 yards and a score. Jason Witten also had a good game, grabbing five balls for 107 yards. Roy Williams, shut down by Nnamdi Asomugha, had only two catches for 15 yards and a touchdown.    The Raiders came close to scoring a touchdown near the end of the game which would have covered the spread. It was painful to watch, but thankfully, they ultimately failed. That kept Dallas' amazing streak alive of not allowing a touchdown in a Thanksgiving fourth quarter since 1998.   "],
