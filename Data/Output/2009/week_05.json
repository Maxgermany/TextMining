      "comments": [" Derek Anderson was 2-of-17 for 23 yards and a pick. The Browns had just nine first downs and lost the time of possession. Cleveland allowed Buffalo to convert six third downs. How in the world did they win this game? Well, it took a bunch of ineptness on the Bills' part. Buffalo finished the game with a whopping 13 penalties. The offensive line couldn't pass protect for Trent Edwards, who was sacked twice and had to force a bunch of short stuff. When Edwards had time to throw, he seemed scared to throw it into a howling 30-mph wind. Edwards also had a horrible interception, where he had Terrell Owens open downfield, but horribly underthrew him for an interception.    Edwards was 16-of-31 for 152 yards and that pick. As you can probably guess, his top target was Marshawn Lynch, who caught six balls for 56 yards on top of his 69 rushing yards (on 17 carries). Fred Jackson turned 15 touches into 47 total yards.    Congratulations to Owens, by the way, who had a season-high reception total. Owens grabbed four balls for 44 yards. Lee Evans hauled in just two passes for 11 yards.    As for the Browns, Jerome Harrison owners should direct their hate mail toward Eric Mangina, who decided to ride his old running back instead. Jamal Lewis carried the ball 31 times for 117 yards. He had a good game, but with the Browns building toward the future, you have to wonder why Harrison isn't getting the ball.    Mohamed Massaquoi led the Browns in both receptions (1) and receiving yards (16). Steve Heiden had the only other catch.    After the game, Buffalo's general manager would not commit to Dick Jauron as his head coach. It would not be a surprised if Jauron is fired very soon.   "],
