      "comments": [" The Texans were dominating this game. At halftime, they led 21-0 and were out-gaining the 49ers, 185-50. They had 11 first downs to San Francisco's three. When Shaun Hill was benched in favor of Alex Smith in the third quarter, everyone on the forum, including myself, thought it was over. We were all wrong, but can you blame us? Smith has been an epic failure his whole career, but he was amazing in the second half, leading the 49ers to three touchdown drives and coming several yards short on the final possession of a potential game-tying field goal. In just one half of play, Smith was 15-of-22 for 206 yards, three touchdowns and a desperation pick at the end of the game. It's hard to believe he can keep this up, and in the future, he'll need to avoid fumbling a lot (he has tiny hands), but if Smith can continue playing like this, the 49ers will be a Super Bowl contender.    All three of Smith's touchdowns went to Vernon Davis, who caught seven balls for 93 yards. However, aside from Smith, the big story for the 49ers was Michael Crabtree. The rookie holdout had five receptions for 56 yards, several of which were pretty impressive grabs. Crabtree also had an 25-yard snag wiped out by an illegal motion penalty.    Give Houston's run defense credit for putting the clamps on Frank Gore. Gore rushed for only 32 yards on 13 attempts.    As for the winning squad, Matt Schaub was once again as sharp as a whistle, going 20-of-30 for 264 yards and two touchdowns.    Schaub went to Owen Daniels the most, as the potential All-Pro tight end caught seven balls for 123 yards and a score. Andre Johnson had only two grabs, but managed 62 yards. Johnson left the game for a bit with a chest contusion. He's not expected to miss any time.    Steve Slaton rushed for 67 yards on 18 carries. He also caught four balls for 22 yards and scored twice. The headline here is that Slaton got a goal-line carry in the first half and was successful in diving into the end zone. If Gary Kubiak had just stuck with Slaton in those situations all year, the Texans could be 6-1 right now.   "],
