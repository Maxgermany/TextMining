      "comments": [" You may not be able to tell this based on the score, but this was a really sloppy game for the Packers. Despite the blowout win, Aaron Rodgers was sacked five times. Green Bay was also penalized 13 times. And you can't ignore the fact that the Packers were just 1-of-5 in the red zone in terms of scoring touchdowns.    Green Bay was in the red zone a lot, as the team seemed to live off of Detroit turnovers. Daunte Culpepper, who was 6-of-14 for 48 yards, tossed a pick that gave the Packers an easy touchdown (their only one in the red zone). Culpepper left in the third quarter because of a hamstring injury. Drew Stanton took his place and went 5-of-11 for 57 yards and two interceptions.    With Calvin Johnson out, neither Culpepper nor Stanton had many options. Dennis Northcutt led the team with five receptions for 40 yards. Brandon Pettigrew didn't catch a single pass.    Culpepper and Stanton were too inept to get Kevin Smith the ball out of the backfield. Smith finished with no receptions. He rushed for 61 yards on 15 carries.    Despite poor protection, Aaron Rodgers went 29-of-37 for 358 yards, two touchdowns and a pick against Detroit's sorry secondary.    Donald Driver led the team with seven catches for 107 yards. In doing so, Driver broke Sterling Sharpe's franchise record for receptions (595). Greg Jennings chipped in with six grabs for 64 yards.    The Lions stunk all around, but someone who deserves a lot of credit on the team is Julian Peterson, who had 10 tackles, 2.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. On Green Bay's side, rookie Clay Matthews managed two sacks.   "],
