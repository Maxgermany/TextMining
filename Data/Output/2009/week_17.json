      "comments": [" I picked the Saints to go to the Super Bowl back in July. Looks like I got that one wrong. Sean Payton foolishly benched his starters against the Panthers. Drew Brees didn't even play a single snap. After next week's bye, New Orleans will be really out of rhythm. Payton may say that this strategy worked for him back in 2006, but it didn't; the Saints barely beat a poor Eagles team with backup quarterback Jeff Garcia, and then went on to get <strike> blowed<\/strike> blown out against Rex stinkin' Grossman and the Bears.    No stats of note for New Orleans; the team mustered just 213 total net yards. Brunell was 15-of-29 for just 102 yards and an interception. Lynell Hamilton paced the Saints in rushing (48 yards, TD) and receiving (3-38).    Jonathan Stewart started with DeAngelo Williams out again. Stewart rumbled for 125 yards on 16 carries, including a 67-yard touchdown on the first drive of the game. Unfortunately, he reaggravated his old Achillies injury and had to leave the game.    Matt Moore was a mediocre 14-of-23 for 162 yards and a score, converting just 3-of-15 third downs. Keep in mind that Moore didn't have Steve Smith at his disposal. It was so bad that Muhsin Muhammad (7-85) led the team in receiving. Dwayne Jarrett chipped in with five receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown.   "],
