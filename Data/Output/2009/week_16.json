      "comments": [" With this victory, the Falcons are a win away from clinching consecutive winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. It's hard to believe that this has never happened, but it looks like Mike Smith is willing to do anything to make this happen - even if it means starting severely injured players. I kid, of course. Maybe. But Michael Turner didn't play, allowing Jason Snelling and Jerious Norwood to split carries. Snelling had 15 rushes for 68 yards, while Norwood mustered 52 yards on 13 attempts.    Matt Ryan did a solid job rebounding off a dreadful Week 15, going 18-of-35 for 250 yards and three touchdowns. Ryan hit Roddy White twice for scores. White managed eight catches for 139 yards. Marty Booker caught the other score - perhaps the final touchdown of his career.    Tony Gonzalez had just two receptions for 17 yards. He left the game with a calf injury in the second half.    Buffalo's offense couldn't do anything against Atlanta's pedestrian defense, compiling just 178 total net yards and converting only 2-of-10 third downs. Then again, the Bills were going with a practice-squad quarterback who had never attempted a single pass in the NFL, so no one should be surprised by this. Brian Set Up Us the Brohm was 17-of-29 for 146 yards and two interceptions. No wonder he was so thoughtlessly discarded by the Packers.    Terrell Owens didn't do much (4-39), but he's still worth noting because he became the sixth player NFL history to catch 1,000 passes. Lee Evans led the team with five receptions for 43 yards.    Atlanta's run defense, which hasn't allowed more than 103 rushing yards to an opponent since Nov. 15, did a great job shutting down the Bills' ground attack. Fred Jackson had 39 yards on 13 carries, including a fumble-six. Marshawn Lynch had three attempts for three yards.   "],
