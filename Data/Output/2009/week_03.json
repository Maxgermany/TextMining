      "comments": [" It's over! It's finally over! The Lions finally win! William Clay Darth Sidious Ford can raise ticket prices! The Creamsicle Buccaneers continue to be the only team in NFL history to lose more than 20 games in a row. Detroit's losing streak ends at 19. Coincidentally, it took 19 points to beat the Redskins.    It all starts at the quarterback position, and it seems like Matthew Stafford is getting more confident each week. Stafford went 21-of-36 for 241 yards and a score. He also had a nice deep throw to Bryant Johnson that went incomplete, but drew a pass interference flag.    Speaking of Bryant Johnson, he surprisingly led the Lions in receiving yardage with 73. He caught four balls, one of which was a touchdown. Calvin Johnson, meanwhile, garnered five receptions for 49 yards.    The catalyst for Detroit's offense was Kevin Smith, who burnt the Lions for 101 yards on 16 rushes. Smith's great running helped the Lions win the time-of-possession battle in the first half, 22-8 minutes. Unfortunately, Smith left the game with a shoulder injury. No word yet on its severity.    Of course, the Lions couldn't have won this game without a lot of ineptness from the Redskins. On Washington's first 16 offensive plays, Jim Zorn called 12 passes and four runs. You read that correctly. Zorn once again failed to give the ball to his best player. Clinton Portis ran the ball just 12 times for 42 yards against a pitiful Lions defense that hasn't been able to stop the rush. What is Zorn thinking? Is he facing Portis every week in his 2-man fantasy league? There is no reasonable explanation for this.    Zorn will also get criticized for going for it on 4th-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the first quarter. Portis couldn't get the touchdown, but I didn't really disagree with the call. I would have gone for it myself. Nevertheless, it gave the Lions the momentum they needed, as they went 99 yards for a touchdown.    Jason Campbell went 27-of-41 for 340 yards, two touchdowns and a pick, though it's worth noting that most of that came in junk time when the Lions were playing prevent defense, trying desperately to hold on.    The silver lining for Washington is that Santana Moss finally got going. Moss caught 10 balls for 178 yards and a score.    Daniel Snyder nearly had an aneurysm in the second quarter when his $100 million man, Albert Haynesworth, was carted off the field with a hip injury. Fortunately for Snyder's sanity, Haynesworth came back in the second half.   "],
