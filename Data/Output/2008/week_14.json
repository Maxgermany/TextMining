      "comments": [" After LaDainian Tomlinson scored the opening touchdown of the game, which established a 10-0 lead for the Chargers, he sat down on the bench, looked at his teammates and said, That was easy. That's exactly how I felt with picking the Chargers to cover the nine. The Raiders were so pathetic, this game was more comical than anything else.    Oakland has many problems, but the prominent ones are lack of discipline and the tendency to make stupid mistakes. That was extremely evident on many occasions in this contest. Let's discuss the team's three worst errors on Thursday night: 1. On what would have been a third-and-long deep in San Diego territory, Raiders defensive tackle Tommy Kelly committed a senseless personal foul, giving the Chargers a first down. San Diego went on to score a touchdown. It's a good thing the Raiders didn't spend too much money on Kelly! 2. On the subsequent drive, the Raiders were moving the football efficiently. However, once they ventured into San Diego territory, Kwame Harris, who signed a $16 million deal this offseason, false started. This put JaMarcus Russell into a long-yardage situation. He subsequently threw a pick on second-and-long. As of Nov. 20, Harris led the league with nine false starts. 3. On another promising drive, the Raiders had a first-and-10 on San Diego's 23. Unfortunately, Darren McFadden committed a personal foul. On the next play, Harris was whistled for a face mask. Oakland was stuck with a second-and-35 on San Diego's 48. Oh, and by the way, McFadden didn't even put his arms up for a pass on a fourth down because he didn't want to get hit. Good thing the Raiders don't have a lot invested in him either!    Oakland's offense was shut out in this game. The team's only touchdown came on a kickoff return by Justin Miller. The Raiders still have only one offensive first-half touchdown this season, and it doesn't look like they'll score another one. That's because JaMarcus Russell, who was 9-of-13, 68 yards, two picks and a fumble, left the game in the second quarter with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, but his status is still unclear. Andrew Walter picked up where Russell left off, and finished 8-of-17, 61 yards and an interception.    Once again, the only target of note for Oakland was Zach Miller, who had eight grabs for 64 yards.    Justin Fargas rushed for 50 yards on 12 carries. Darren McFadden had eight total yards of offense on one rush attempt and two receptions.    LaDainian Tomlinson didn't manage 100 rushing yards against the Raiders again, but he tallied 91 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.    San Diego moved the chains primarily through the air with long passes to Vincent Jackson (5 catches, 148 yards, TD) and screens to Darren Sproles (3 catches, 34 yards, 2 TDs). Philip Rivers finished 10-of-22, 214 yards and three scores.    Chargers linebacker Shaun Phillips, expected to step up his game in the wake of Shawne Merriman's injury, has disappointed this year. However, he abused Oakland's offensive line for five tackles, 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble. Inside linebacker Stephen Cooper, meanwhile, had seven tackles and two picks.   "],
