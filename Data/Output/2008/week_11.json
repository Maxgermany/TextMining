      "comments": [" I was expecting it in the first quarter. When it didn't happen, I thought, OK, if this gets tight in the second half, it'll come. It didn't. But when the game went into overtime, I would have bet the farm that it would come to fruition in the extra session. To my disdain, not a chance. What am I referring to? The perennial Brett Favre chokes in a big game moment. Last year at Dallas, Favre lobbed up passes for grabs. In the subsequent NFC Championship, he tossed a near pick-six. I was expecting something similar in a fight for first place. Kudos to Favre (26-of-33, 258 yards, 2 TDs) for playing smart football. That said, don't think he won't choke on a larger stage. Though it may not sound like it, I love Favre. He's one of my favorite players. I'd like to see him win another Super Bowl. But the fact remains that since he claimed his first Lombardi Trophy, he's come up small in big moments. And I doubt that has changed simply because he's playing in a different city.    So, because my premise was incorrect and Favre didn't make a single error, I lost yet another pick. However, I do feel a bit vindicated because something I've been saying all year finally came to fruition tonight: The Patriots couldn't stop the pass. At all. Their disgraceful secondary allowed Brett Favre to fire just seven incompletions and convert 9-of-16 third downs, including a painful third-and-15 in overtime. As a comparison, New England was just 4-of-14 on third downs.    And speaking of choking, I found it very odd that the Patriots were the ones who gagged instead of Favre. New England dominated most of the second half, but managed a mere 11 points in the final two quarters until the last few seconds of the game. The Patriots simply killed themselves once they crossed into Jets territory. On the first drive of the third quarter, Ben Watson lost the ball on an unforced fumble. On the next possession, center Dan Koppen snapped the ball before Matt Cassel was ready, resulting in a 20-yard loss. When the Patriots retained possession for the third time in the second half, Jabar Gaffney dropped an easy 20-yard catch on third down. And later on, Cassel overthrew a wide-open Randy Moss, who was streaking toward the end zone.    Despite that overthrow, Cassel had an incredible game. By going 30-of-51, 400 yards and three touchdowns, and also running for 62 yards, he became the first player since 1970 to match 400 passing yards and 60 rushing yards in a single game.    Cassel, perhaps unwisely, looked toward Ben Watson most often, connecting eight times for 88 yards and a score with the perennially overrated tight end. Meanwhile, Wes Welker (108 yards) and Jabar Gaffney (86 yards and a touchdown) each caught seven balls. Randy Moss had just three receptions for 26 yards, but caught an amazing, game-tying touchdown with one second remaining, where he somehow tapped both feet inbounds before falling out of the field of play.    Rookie Jerod Mayo had a great game for the Patriots. He recorded 20 tackles despite leaving the game temporarily with a slight injury. Mayo has all but sealed up Defensive Rookie of the Year honors.    However, Mayo's efforts weren't enough, as Thomas Jones (30 carries, 104 yards, one touchdown) became the first running back to eclipse the century barrier against New England since Ronnie Brown did so out of the Wildcat formation in Week 3.    Another rookie, Dustin Keller, led the Jets with eight receptions for 87 yards. Jerricho Cotchery had five grabs (one of which looked like the David Tyree helmet catch in the Super Bowl) for 87 yards and a score.    To wrap things up, I want to talk about the NFL overtime system. While it's much better than the ridiculous crap in college football, I think it sucks that a team can win on a simple field goal. I think they should play an unlimited amount of time, where the game ends when either squad scores at least five points. That can be two field goals. That can be a safety and a field goal. And that can obviously be a touchdown. This isn't sour grapes because the Jets probably would have reach the end zone anyway, but I firmly believe that the NFL should repair its overtime system.
