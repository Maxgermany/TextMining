      "comments": [" I can't remember the last time I missed even a portion of an NFL game. I cover the league for a living, so it's my job to watch all the NFL games. Not that I'm complaining or anything; running this site is a blast. However, I'll admit that I missed some of this contest. I went to bed really late on Wednesday night. I'm not sure what time it was, but the sun was up. I set my alarm for noon. However, the next thing I knew, it was 2:20 in the afternoon. Son of a b.... I quickly turned on my computer to check out the score. Safe to say I wasn't surprised - 35-10, Titans. Halftime. I guess I can make myself feel better and say that this wasn't an NFL game. As Phil Elliott said in the Live In-Games Thread: <i> I've always wondered what it would look like if an NFL team played a high school team. <\/i>    This was simply embarrassing for the city of Detroit. I'll say it again: Until the Lions post a winning record and prove that they can be competitive, they shouldn't be allowed to host a Thanksgiving game. Just look at their recent losses on Turkey Day: 47-10, 37-26, 27-10, 27-7 and 41-9. Just terrible.    The Lions couldn't do anything right. For those of you who were asleep during the game like me, it was over before it started. Shaun McDonald fumbled the ball away on the second play of the contest. Tennessee recovered it and scored a rushing touchdown two plays later. Following a drive that culminated in a 53-yard Jason Hanson field goal, Chris Johnson broke free and ran for a 58-yard score. Two possessions later, Daunte Culpepper flipped a careless pick-six toward Dave Ball. On Tennessee's next drive, LenDale walrused a touchdown away from Johnson. 28-3. Game over.    Johnson and White each tallied more than 100 rushing yards for the second time this year. They both scored two touchdowns. Johnson rushed for 125 yards, while White had 106. Most of White's production came when the game was out of hand.    Kerry Collins was just an economical 11-of-18 for 127 yards. Consequently, no Titan receiver caught more than two passes.    As for the Lions... well... at least Calvin Johnson had a decent game. Megatron caught five balls for 66 yards. He was targeted many more times, but Culpepper (13-of-26, 134 yards, TD, INT) just couldn't get him the ball. Johnson's longest gain (20 yards) came when Drew Henson was under center.    Kevin Smith had absolutely no running lanes to work with. He had just 22 yards on 12 carries.    Jeff Fisher challenged a 20-yard Johnson reception when his team was up 47-10 in the fourth quarter. The play stood, but Fisher was booed by the 20 people still left in the crowd. Hey Jeff, the Jerk Store called...    Ever since the Lions jumped out to a 17-0 lead against the Buccaneers, they've been outscored, 85-13. That's in a seven-quarter span!    With this loss, the Lions have clinched last place in the NFC North. No word yet on when the parade will take place.   "],
