      "comments": [" Bravo, Mike Tomlin. Unlike the Buccaneers, Colts and Jaguars last year, the Steelers won't be flat in the postseason. All the starters played the majority of the contest. Steelers fans had a collective heart attack when Ben Roethlisberger was carried off the field in a stretcher, but it turns out that he merely had a mild concussion.    Meanwhile, Pittsburgh's defensive starters wreaked havoc upon Cleveland's offense. The Browns actually haven't even scored an offensive touchdown in 24 quarters, which is an NFL record. The last time they got into the end zone, save for a pick-six against the Eagles, was the Monday night game against the Bills in November.    Bruce Gradkowski, starting for Ken Dorsey, who was out with a bad case of ineptness, was 5-of-16 for 18 yards and two picks. No Browns receiver caught more than a single pass. Braylon Edwards had just five receiving yards.    Believe it or not, Jamal Lewis had his best rushing performance of the season, gaining 94 yards on 23 attempts.    Willie Parker predictably out-classed Lewis, garnering 116 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries.    Roethlisberger was 9-of-14 for 110 yards and a pick before he was carried off the field. In relief, Byron Sandwich was 7-of-12 for 80 yards.    Hines Ward paced Pittsburgh with six receptions and 70 yards. Heath Miller had five grabs for 55 yards. Santonio Holmes caught three balls for 31 yards.   "],
