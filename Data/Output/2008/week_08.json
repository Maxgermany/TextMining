      "comments": [" I had a mini-argument this week on the forums with Wraith about Raiders coach Tom Cable. Wraith said he was the worst thing since sliced bread. I opined that Cable was doing a fine job. Whoops! Can we count all of Cable's gaffs on one hand? Let's give it a try: 1. JaMarcus registered zero - ZERO!!! - pass attempts on his first three drives. The Raiders called seven runs and two passes. The two passes were on second- and third-and-long, and both resulted in sacks. Now, I know Oakland's strength is pounding the rock, but three starters in Baltimore's secondary - Chris McAlister, Samari Rolle and Dawan Landry - were out. And besides, Baltimore is ranked first against the run. Giving Russell some throws on first-and-10 would have been much more lucrative. 2. Down 19 with a minute left in regulation, Oakland finally found the end zone, making the score 22-9. Going for two would have resulted in a 22-11 deficit, allowing Oakland to tie with a touchdown plus two and a field goal. Instead, Cable foolishly signaled for an extra point, forcing his squad to hunt for two improbable touchdowns against a great defense. 3. With seven minutes remaining and the score stuck at 22-10, Cable used a timeout on a fourth-and-21. Way to waste your second-half timeouts, Cable. Why would you call timeout? Who cares if you get a delay-of-game? It's a freaking punt, Cable! I'm losing it here! 4. It turns out that Cable used a timeout because he wanted to go for it... on a fourth-and-21. The Raiders were down two scores with seven minutes remaining. There was enough time to punt, force a three-and-out and get the ball back in good field position. Instead, Russell's fourth-and-21 fell incomplete to Ashley Lelie. The Ravens went three-and-out, but Oakland consequently was stuck in poor field position. 5. OK, I don't have any more, but I'd like to once again point out that Cable was 11-35 at Idaho. Maybe he would have been 12-34 if he knew how to manage timeouts, down-and-distance situations and conversion opportunities!    It turns out Baltimore was able to maintain its top-ranked rush defense all afternoon. Justin Fargas gained just 24 yards on 12 carries. Michael Bush, in relief of Darren McFadden, gained only eight yards on just five attempts.    Russell, meanwhile, finished with 228 yards, but completed just 15-of-33 attempts and threw an interception. No Raiders receiver caught more than three passes.    Another unspectacular but efficient performance from Joe Flacco, who was 12-of-24 for 140 yards and a touchdown. Flacco converted a third-and-five, third-and-12, third-and-eight, third-and-20 and another third-and-12. Flacco was also a recipient of a 43-yard pass from Troy Smith. Glad to see that the Raiders' defense showed up.    The only positive thing Oakland did on Sunday was contain Willis McGahee, who managed only 58 yards and a touchdown on 23 rushes. Unfortunately for the Silver and Black, Ray Rice compiled 101 yards on only 11 touches.   "],
