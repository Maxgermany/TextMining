(Direct snap to MIA #23, who handed to MIA #34, who handed to MIA #10, who threw the pass.) <\/i> NFL.com doesn't even know who the players are! They had to refer to them as numbers!    Yet another impressive performance by the Dolphins. I know Houston's defense is absolutely abysmal, but still - Miami barely could move the chains last year. Bill Parcells, Tony Sparano, and all of the Tuna's other minions deserve tons of credit.    Ronnie Brown didn't put up monstrous numbers (50 yards), but he carried the ball just 13 times and he scored a touchdown as well. Chad Pennington, meanwhile, was 19-of-25 for 284 yards, two touchdowns and a pick. Pennington's two scores were 80- and 58-yard throws to Patrick Cobbs, which undoubtedly had Ted Ginn, Greg Camarillo and Anthony Fasano fantasy owners cursing in disgust. Camarillo accumulated 49 yards on four catches, but neither Ginn nor Fasano did much of anything.    Poor Houston. They should have beaten the Colts and they could have beaten the Jaguars. They finally earned their first victory, but 3-2 would sound a lot better than 1-4 right now.    The Texans barely beat the Dolphins, who were 1-15 last year, but they deserve lots of credit. I didn't think they could recover from last week's depressing loss. Matt Schaub was incredible, going 22-of-42, 379 yards, one touchdown and two picks. Andre Johnson caught 10 of those passes for 178 yards and a score. Kevin Walter and Owen Daniels each had four grabs, for 98 and 70 yards, respectively.   "],
