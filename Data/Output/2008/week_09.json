      "comments": [" It's official: Eric Mangini has no idea what he's doing. The Jets stopped the Bills on third-and-11. Buffalo was penalized five yards. Though he had the option of declining the penalty and forcing a field goal, Mangini, in his infinite wisdom, pushed Buffalo back to make the kick tougher. Instead, Trent Edwards threw a 22-yard dart to Roscoe Parish. Fortunately for Mangini's job security and further scrutiny in this column, Edwards tossed a pick-six a couple of plays later.    I guess I shouldn't bash Pizza Delivery Boy that much; the Jets won at Orchard Park for only the second time since 2002.    Brett Favre did his usual great job keeping both teams in the game. Favre was 19-of-28 for 201 yards, leading the team to multiple scoring drives, but he also tossed a pick-six right into the hands of Jabari Greer. Favre went to Jerricho Cotchery the most; the wideout caught six balls for 62 yards. Laveranues Coles had three grabs for 40 yards.    Like Favre, there was good and some bad from Edwards. Edwards threw the aforementioned pick-six and another interception, but he was also 24-of-35 for 289 yards and a touchdown. Amazingly, Lee Evans barely did anything; Evans had four catches for 41 yards. Robert Royal led all of Edwards' targets with five receptions and 70 yards.    Marshawn Lynch had just nine carries for 16 yards. Don't panic, Lynch owners. Your workhorse running back is battling flu-like symptoms. Besides, Lynch also had three catches for 52 receiving yards.   "],
