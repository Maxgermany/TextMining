      "comments": [" If I were a fancy-shmancy sportswriter working for a dying newspaper, I'd start this write-up with something like, The power may have been out at Ralph Wilson Stadium, but that didn't stop Trent Edwards from lighting up the scoreboard. Man, that's good stuff. Edwards was 25-of-30 for 261 yards and a touchdown. He hit Lee Evans eight times for 89 yards and that score. Even more impressive is that Edwards performed so well amid mass confusion. We didn't know what the play clock was, or what the score was, or anything, Edwards said.    Viewers who wanted to see the game couldn't do so until there was seven minutes remaining in the first half because some balloons hit a power line. That's not a joke. Power went out again five minutes later, and was up and running again in the third quarter. The poor people who were looking forward to this game were treated to a Bengals-Steelers snooze-fest instead. Not cool. Whoever brought those balloons to the stadium should be banned for life.    Marshawn Lynch failed to reach the century mark, but managed 70 yards and a touchdown. He out-rushed LaDainian Tomlinson, who collected just 41 yards on 14 carries. Combined with a bum toe and Marcus Stroud clogging the middle, Tomlinson didn't have much of a chance.    With Tomlinson running in mud, Philip Rivers gave the Chargers a shot to win this game. He was 22-of-29 for 208 yards and two touchdowns. Unfortunately, he fumbled in Buffalo territory and then threw a pick in the end zone.    Rivers didn't have Chris Chambers at his disposal, so he had to go to Malcolm Floyd, Antonio Gates and Vincent Jackson four times each.   "],
