      "comments": [" The Chiefs are comical. The fact that they were outgained by 315 yards doesn't even tell the whole story. In the third quarter, the Chiefs kept the game alive, intercepting Jake Delhomme in the end zone, down 21-0. Damon Huard tossed a pick on the very next play.    It's tough to say whether Kansas City's defense was more pathetic than its offense. I'd call it a draw. Check out the Panthers' play-calling on their first touchdown drive: Run 1 yard, run 4 yards, run 4 yards, run 14 yards, run 5 yards, run 10 yards (touchdown). Nice job, Chiefs. On Carolina's third drive, 10 of the Panthers' 11 plays were rushes. The only pass was an incompletion. Oh, and did I mention that Carolina was missing its two starting offensive tackles!?    I almost forgot! The Panthers' second scoring drive featured a converted third-and-17, which was a 19-yard pass from Jake Delhomme to Mark Jones, whoever that is. The Chiefs can't even stop fake players!    Delhomme finished with 236 yards and two touchdowns. The thing is, he only had to throw the ball 22 times. DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart combined for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 39 carries. Steve Smith caught six balls for 96 yards.    Larry Johnson's comeback? So much for that. Johnson gained two yards on seven carries. Dwayne Bowe was the only Chief who put up solid numbers; he had five grabs for 57 yards.    One positive for Kansas City: Despite Williams and Stewart going off, Kansas City's rush defense improved! Entering the game, they allowed 5.6 yards per carry. Now it's down to 5.5!   "],
