      "comments": [" It's a shame Carson Palmer didn't play in this game. And not because Ryan Fitzpatrick was horrendous, and not because Cincinnati could have dodged an 0-4 start. If Derek Anderson would have defeated Palmer, that would have meant that an Oregon State alumnus would have knocked off a USC product as an underdog. The symmetry would have been awesome - though the Browns weren't a 25-point underdog that lost to crappy Stanford and was blowed out at Penn State.    Anyway, where did this Palmer injury come from? There was nothing during the week. He wasn't limited in practice. If it wasn't for Chris Mortensen, we wouldn't have found out Palmer was a scratch until kickoff.    Speaking of kickoff, I turned on CBS, expecting to see a good game. Unfortunately, the two announcers were previewing the Browns-Bengals. Seriously, whose brilliant idea was it to broadcast the Toilet Bowl, a battle between two 0-3 squads? Someone needs to be fired for this.    I was also shocked that Romeo Crennel didn't bench Anderson after he tossed a pick in the red zone on the opening drive of the third quarter. Crennel didn't even trust Anderson enough to throw the ball on the opening possession of the game, which culminated in a field goal. Seven runs, no passes. If the Browns weren't playing the sorry Bungles, they would be 0-4 right now.    Anderson finished 15-of-24, 138 yards, one touchdown and an interception. He went to Kellen Winslow Jr. five times for 54 yards. Braylon Edwards caught three balls for 22 yards and a touchdown. Edwards also had a senseless unnecessary roughness penalty after a Browns first down in the third quarter.    With all that offensive ineptness how did the Browns come away with a 20-12 victory? You can thank the Bengals for turning it over five times. Ryan Fitzpatrick gave Cincinnati no chance to win, as he threw three picks and fumbled once. Chris Perry also lost a fumble. With Fitzpatrick struggling, Cleveland focused on stopping Chris Perry, who totaled just 28 yards on 12 carries.   "],
