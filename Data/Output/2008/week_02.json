Thankfully, I won't be in danger of twisting my ankle or something anytime soon.    I found it odd that Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were the announcers of the Rams-Giants game. Didn't the FOX have a better matchup to broadcast? The Panthers and Bears are 1-0; that would have been better. Why televise a predicted blowout? Is Marc Bulger getting sacked a dozen times that amusing?    Speaking of Bulger, I have some breaking news to report. Bulger got hurt in the first quarter! Oddly enough, he was injured bumping into one of his own teammates. You gotta love the Rams.    Despite getting blowed... uhh... blewn... uhh... blowed out by the Giants, the Rams were more productive this week than they were against the Eagles. Steven Jackson ran for 53 yards on just 13 carries. And Torry Holt actually showed up, grabbing six balls for 76 yards and a score. Keep in mind, however, that St. Louis was playing at home, where they are much more effective. They can't do anything on the road.    Bulger was sacked six times, including twice by Justin Tuck. Tuck also had a pick-six.    Brandon Jacobs failed to get into the end zone again, but he managed 93 yards on only 15 rushes. Eli Manning stole all the scores. He had three to go along with his 20-of-29 for 260 yards. Plaxico Burress led all wideouts with five receptions and 81 yards.   "],
