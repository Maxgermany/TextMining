      "comments": [" When you handicap a game perfectly and watch the unbelievable happen, it can be tough. When it happens a few times a season, it's sickening. And when it happens as much as it has occurred to me this year, it's time to keep the car running in the garage. You're not supposed to lose picks when your 6-point dog has a 14-0 lead and a fourth-quarter advantage. Then again, I took a 9-point dog and watched them blow a cover despite leading 17-0...    Things began perfectly for the Jaguars. They drove down the field on their opening possession, forced Indianapolis to punt after six downs, and then engineered a dominant, 17-play, 93-yard drive spanning nine minutes and 30 seconds. The look on the Colts' faces was priceless. It was pretty much, Who are these guys? I thought they were supposed to suck! The Jaguars do suck... It's just that they hate the Colts with a passion, so they decided to try for the first time in weeks. Well, it showed. Indianapolis controlled the ball for 4:47 of the first 18:23, running only those six plays compared to Jacksonville's 25.    Well, it's a good thing the Colts have one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history under center. Peyton Manning was masterful, completing all 13 of his passes in the first half. In fact, he began the contest 17-of-17, finally misfiring because his receiver ran the wrong route. Manning finished 29-of-34 for 364 yards and three touchdowns.    David Garrard put up great numbers (28-of-41, 329 yards, 1 pass TD, 1 rush TD, 1 INT), but made way too many critical errors down the stretch. The obvious one is the pick-six he launched when the game was tied at 24, which was part of the horrifying events that transpired in this week's bad beat. The others include: taking two crucial sacks instead of throwing the ball away on the final drives; not being set when the official started the clock following a 10-second run-off after Maurice Jones-Drew injured his knee; and missing a wide-open Troy Williamson in the end zone on what would have been the tying score.    As for Jones-Drew, all indications are that he'll be OK. MJD rushed for 91 yards and caught seven balls for 71 more yards. He didn't reach the end zone to the chagrin of his fantasy owners.    Dennis Northcutt debacled the opposing secondary for the second game in a row. Northcutt caught eight balls for 101 yards and a score.    Meanwhile, solid stats all around for the Colts, save for Anthony Gonzalez (four catches, 38 yards). Reggie Wayne led the squad in yardage with 108 and a touchdown on seven catches. Dallas Clark paced the team in grabs with eight for 105 and a score.    Dominic Rhodes couldn't do much on the ground (14 carries, 27 yards), but he chipped in with six receptions for 62 receiving yards and an aerial score.   "],
