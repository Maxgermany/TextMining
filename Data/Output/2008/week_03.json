      "comments": [" They're growing up before our very eyes. This was an obvious trap game for the Bills, as they had every reason to have a letdown after beating two 2007 postseason participants. The Raiders had a 24-13 lead with five minutes remaining in regulation, but Trent Edwards was able to go 6-of-8 for 92 yards and a touchdown on his team's final two drives, leading the Bills to a 24-23 comeback victory.    As a whole, Edwards was 24-of-39 for 279 yards, one score and a pick. Lee Evans caught four balls for 65 yards, but he wasn't Edwards' primary target. Josh Reed registered six catches and 72 yards. Marshawn Lynch chipped in with 83 rushing yards and two touchdowns.    The offseason acquisition of the year has to be Marcus Stroud. For the third consecutive game, Buffalo hasn't allowed 100 rushing yards to their opponent. That's not just to a running back - that's the entire team I'm talking about.    Darren McFadden and Michael Bush each carried the ball 14 times. McFadden had 42 yards, while Bush had 55.    JaMarcus Russell threw just three passes in the second half. Way to be aggressive, Raiders. Russell finished 9-of-19 for 156 yards and a touchdown. If Al Davis remembers who Lane Kiffin actually is, there will probably be a coaching change this week.    The Bills, now in full control of the AFC East, are 3-0 for the first time since 1992 - one of the four years they lost the Super Bowl.   "],
