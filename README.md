# TextMining
A project from university (Modul Text Mining). The task is to crawl NFL game reports from the website walterfootball.com and maps player stats from the texts to a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats).
# Execution
To generate the data, if you didn't download it, you need Python (needed Libraries: os, re, json, requests, BeautifulSoup, ijson, and datetime) and R (needed Libraries: stringr, rjson, rlist, tidyverse, and tokenizer). First, execute the python scripts and then the R script "ExecutePipeline.R".
# Output
The output can be found in the folder "Data/Output". For visualization, you can look at https://maxgermany.github.io/TextMining or in the folder "Output".
